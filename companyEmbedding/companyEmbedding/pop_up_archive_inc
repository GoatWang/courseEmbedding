Optimizely gathers user insights through interviews —  and turns it into action

July 18, 2017June 8, 2017 Pop Up Archive
Use case




Speaking to users to better understand customer needs and to conduct usability testing are both key parts of successful product development. Optimizely proactively engages their audience in their design workflow, leveraging insights through customer interviews, and Pop Up Archive is a key tool in their effort.

Jeff Zych is Head of Design at Optimizely, a tool for personalizing digital experiences. In that role, he runs a team of product designers, researchers, and user interface engineers whose jobs are to constantly develop and improve the company’s products.
As part of this effort, Optimizely regularly does research interviews with customers where they might share a prototype or talk about how an existing product is being used. Each Optimizely designer has a couple of projects in flight at any given time — depending on the cycle of the project, they might be conducting interviews to better understand customer needs or do usability testing, both key parts of product development.
They conduct around 12 interviews a month, all of which are recorded, and needed a way to quickly review the contents of those conversations to find insights and synthesize key takeaways. In search of an automated solution, they turned to Pop Up Archive. The interviews, which are one-on-one and usually last 45 minutes to an hour, usually take place over the phone and often include a video screen sharing component.
After an interview is recorded, it’s usually uploaded to Pop Up Archive within a day or two. Once the transcript is complete, it’s exported and edited (although not to the point of absolute accuracy) in a word processor. Often the text will be used to create an affinity diagram, where the raw text (such as key points or sentences) from across a number of interviews are clustered into themes to understand the overarching themes. Sometimes transcripts get shared with project managers or engineers, but often the raw research gets turned into a presentation that transforms the findings into actionable insights.
Before using Pop Up Archive, Optimizely gathered customer insights in different ways: sometimes someone would lead an interview and someone else would take notes, sometimes the interviewer would both conduct the conversation and take notes, and sometimes an interview would be hand transcribed after the fact. All of these solutions were a bit chaotic, often less precise, and time-consuming. Using Pop Up means they don’t need to worry about note-taking and can just focus on the customer. Two features of the software that they particularly value are the automatic speaker detection and the timestamps. “Other transcription services don’t split the speakers, but that’s important for us because of the interview format,” said Jeff. In the case of the timestamps, they’ll sync those back to the video if they know someone said something interesting, but can’t remember exactly what.
Turnaround time is really important for Optimizely’s needs since they’re often iterating quickly. “Once we’ve used the interviews to guide product and design decisions, we don’t revisit them all that often.

What does “independence” really mean?

July 4, 2017June 5, 2017 Pop Up Archive
From the archives



A “lost boy” votes for independence — KALW Crosscurrents
In 2011, San Jose resident Bol Deng Bol, from southern Sudan, traveled 12 hours by car to cast his vote in the Sudan referendum in Arizona. Bol is one of the so-called “Sudan Lost Boys,” who fled the country and walked hundreds of miles through jungles to a refugee camp. Bol eventually became a program manager at Hope with Sudan, a San Jose non-profit, to help his country. Listen.
July 4th, 1970 — Pacifica Radio Archives
The cultural revolutions of the 1960s changed the discourse surrounding freedom and independence. Archival audio from a July 4, 1970 celebration in Washington, D.C. captures differing views on patriotism and the American legacy following the Civil Rights movement, anti-war efforts, the Stonewall Riots, second-wave feminism, and the rise of Black Power. Listen.
Can a free people survive? — Illinois Public Media
December 7, 1787 is a lesser known date than July 4, 1776, but it was a fateful month in our history as a nation. Delaware was the first state to ratify the charter of our liberties, the Constitution of the United States of America. 154 four years later, to a day, this nation was faced with the question of whether a free people living under the guarantees of that Constitution and protected by its Bill of Rights could survive. Listen.

Behind the scenes of “America’s attic”

June 20, 2017June 8, 2017 Pop Up Archive
Use case



When you hear the words “Smithsonian Institution,” you might think of a hallowed yet fusty single museum in Washington, D.C. But the Smithsonian is much broader and deeper than that — in addition to its 19 museums  visited by millions every year, it encompasses 9 research centers and the national zoo spread across multiple states and countries where active research is happening. Justin O’Neill, the producer of the Smithsonian’s podcast Sidedoor, is trying to bring the many rich aspects of the Smithsonian to life and to share them with the broader public, and Pop Up Archive is a critical tool in his workflow.

Experiences of World War II, 73 years later

June 6, 2017May 30, 2017 Pop Up Archive
From the archives



This June marks the 73rd anniversary of D-Day, “the largest seaborne invasion in history,” that initiated the liberation of Europe from the Nazis and supported an Allied victory along the Western Front. Today, pieces from the archives that examine World War II through the experiences of three different groups of citizens.
Veterans remember — Illinois Public Media
University of Illinois professor Bob Espeseth undertook a huge project to gather oral histories from World War II veterans before they were lost. In this piece, he interviews an 87-year-old veteran named Ed Gordon about his experience as a soldier in the war. (You can find all of Espeseth’s recordings in the Early American Museum in Mahomet, IL.) Listen.
Japanese in California — Pacifica Radio Archives
Not all World War II atrocities took place overseas — in the United States, President Franklin D. Roosevelt ordered Japanese American to be forcibly relocated and incarcerated in camps. All told, between 110,000 and 120,000 were affected, 62 percent of whom were U.S. citizens. This audio piece documents the experience with personal interviews of those who were interned. Listen.
The attack on Pearl Harbor through the eyes of students — KALW Crosscurrents
The attack on Pearl Harbor represented a major turning point for college students. Worried about final exams one day, many were enlisting and joining the army just a few days later. Sam Redman, cultural historian with UC Berkeley’s Regional Oral History Office spoke about the effect this had: “For these young men and woman, it really was a major turning point in their lives. Do they stay in school? Do they continue their studies?” Hear firsthand how they felt — and what they did. Listen.

Crunch time: crafting audio news features efficiently

May 23, 2017May 23, 2017 Pop Up Archive
Use case



“No one gets into reporting because they like transcribing. …Overall [Pop Up Archive] is very accurate. I’ve seen it improve a lot in the time I’ve been using it and it’s helping us hugely in our day to day management and production of stories.”
—Audrey Dilling, KALW Crosscurrents
Audrey Dilling has been a reporter and producer for “Crosscurrents,” a daily news magazine at KALW in San Francisco. She has primarily produced features about water, reporting stories that are six to eight minutes long. That may not sound like a lot — until you realize that each feature is composed of at least three interviews, plus ambient sound, and that the raw tape for each interview prior to editing can run from twenty to forty minutes long. To help her use time efficiently and streamline the production process, Audrey uses Pop Up Archive to transcribe and organize tape. Continue reading →

Alfreda Duster, daughter of Ida B. Wells — Studs Terkel Radio Archive
Ida B. Wells is a giant in American history. An African-American woman who was born a slave in Mississippi in 1862, she went on to become a journalist, editor, feminist and early leader in the civil rights movement. Her work has been honored in journalistic awards, a museum, a society for investigative reporting by journalists of color, and even a postage stamp. In 1971 her daughter, Alfreda Duster, spoke about the side of her only a daughter would know. Listen. Continue reading →

Celebrating TryPod one listener at a time

March 14, 2017March 28, 2017 Pop Up Archive
Audiosear.ch



TryPod is a recent effort hatched by industry executives to combat “podcast unawareness.” The goal of TryPod is to grow the overall podcast audience by encouraging people to share their favorite podcasts with those who don’t yet listen.
In 2016, 24 percent of Americans (67 million people) listened to a podcast in the past month, up three percent from 2015, according to last week’s Infinite Dial report from Edison Research.
Nancy Mills is a resident of Washington DC. She’s 67 and retired, and she’s a podcast power listener who is celebrating TryPod in a serious way. We spoke to Nancy about her listening habits and what she’s learned about how to be an effective podcast evangelist.
Let’s start at the beginning. How did you become a podcast listener? 
My daughter encouraged me to try it, but I don’t remember how I actually got started. Lots of hunting and clicking I think. Continue reading →

Pop-up Ideas – Cubes and Boxes offer many solutions
Have you got some great ideas but you cannot find the right marketing product for it? Our extremely varied range of pop-up products will no doubt offer a solution. Take for example the Pop-Up Cubes and Pop-Up Boxes. These pop-up products are extremely versatile because their design leaves room for almost any campaign imaginable. The Cube and Box both have six sides which is ample room to print your pop-up ideas with your marketing message. The pop-up cube is a perfect pop-up product to portray circular products, for example a football.
Unusual Shapes add to attraction of Pop up Products
When you are looking for some pop-up ideas that do not necessarily have to display your product but rather a message, you might hit the nail on the head with the Pop-Up Gems. These pop-up products attract attention through their unusual and unique shapes, making them ideal when you need to transmit relatively short messages. If you want your customer to fully take in your message, the Pop-Up Gems can do the hard work for you. The pop-up action, the shape, and the bright colors will certainly retain your customer’s attention long enough to convey its message.


Different direction in Pop up Ideas
Of course you can also choose to take a different direction with the Sideshooter. Although the Sideshooter is not 3D like most of our pop-up products, it is still classed as a pop-up product because of its two sleeves that shoot out on either side as soon as the Sideshooter is opened. This way, three separate sections are created, and this leaves room for all your pop-up ideas. You can depict your product in the middle, and describe what it does on both sleeves. You can also use a slogan on both sides and put the main information in the middle. This pop-up product is also available in a smaller version; the mini Sideshooter. Your campaign will look powerful and decisive with these powerful pop-up products.
Pop-up Products with surprising versatility – Balls and Houses
For pop-up products that need to represent your product, we have a range of specific shapes that will no doubt suit your pop-up ideas. For products that have to signify something spherical, the Pop-Up Ball is perfect. These brilliant and exclusive pop-up products can be used to represent soccer balls, globes or fruit. With the addition of handles you can easily create a lantern and because of its twelve sides, it lends itself perfectly to contain a promotional calendar. Besides the Pop-Up Balls, we also produce Pop-Up Houses. You can use these pop-up products to not only represent regular houses, but also greenhouses, industrial buildings and log cabins.


Power Packed Pop-up Ideas bring surprise and fun
Then there are the pop-up products that do not only jump themselves, they make your customers jump as well. The Springbox and the Two Pop Box have a compact print area and are applicable to many campaigns. If your campaign does not need an elaborate introduction but rather you would like to excite curiosity by just displaying your product and a web address, these pop-up products are excellent. However, if you want to accompany your products with more written information, the Jumpinjax will provide a solution. These power packed pop-up ideas are exceedingly applicable to depict things that jump: fleas, frogs, kangaroo and fireworks.
Functionality is the key to these Pop-up Products
We also provide a range of functional pop-up products that are designed to be sat on a desk. The functionality of these pop-up products adds to the longevity of your marketing campaign. After all, a marketing tool that will help your customer will be considered more valuable than one that is not useful. Our Power Pen Holder is a good example of such a functional pop-up product because it helps to keep your customer’s desk tidy. Also very popular is the money box. These pop-up products can be used to ‘fine’ colleagues for things like swearing or not making coffee. Because these pop-up products have the form of a regular pop-up box, they can easily depict whatever product you want to launch or message you want to convey.
