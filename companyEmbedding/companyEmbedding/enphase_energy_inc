Enphase Energy Enters Into License Agreement With Flextronics - Sell The News - Enphase Energy Inc. (NASDAQ:ENPH) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Enphase Energy Enters Into License Agreement With Flextronics - Sell The NewsJun.20.17 | About: Enphase Energy (ENPH) Henrik Alex Momentum, event-driven, short-term horizon, techSummaryCompany most likely transfers marketing and selling rights for some older and non-core product lines to its long standing manufacturing partner.The move will help the cash-strapped company to bring down operating expenses and working capital requirements.Today's analyst day presentation also alludes to these aspects.Given the character of the agreement, I do not expect Flextronics to pay a material license fee to Enphase.The substantial move in the stock price provides investors with a decent opportunity to dispose of existing positions or outright short the shares.Cash-strapped microinverter producer Enphase Energy (NASDAQ:ENPH) shares have been soaring in Tuesday's pre-market session and are currently up by roughly 20% as of the time of this writing thanks to news of the company having signed a license agreement with electronics manufacturing services giant Flextronics (NASDAQ:FLEX): 

  On June 13, 2017, Enphase Energy, Inc. ("Enphase") entered into a Master License Agreement ("Agreement") with Flextronics Industrial, Ltd. ("Flextronics"), under which Enphase licenses its intellectual property to Flextronics in order to allow Flextronics to market, manufacture, and sell certain Enphase products. Such rights may be used to assure continuity of supply to Enphase customers. The above description of the Agreement is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such agreement, a copy of which will be filed as an exhibit to Enphase's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ending June 30, 2017.  


 Picture: Enphase S820 and IQ6+ Microinverters Moreover, Deutsche Bank is out with an upgrade on the stock from "sell" to "hold" this morning as yesterday's analyst day obviously went quite well. That said, investors chasing the stock here are most likely getting the news wrong. While the company has not filed the complete agreement with the SEC yet, I do not expect this transaction to result in material cash inflows for Enphase. Readers should note that Flextronics has already been Enphase's microinverter manufacturing partner for eight years now, so this is not a new relationship. Judging by the statement that "such rights may be used to assure continuity of supply to Enphase customers" actually points to Enphase further streamlining its self-marketed product portfolio by transferring the marketing and selling rights of some older or non-core product lines to Flextronics, which has already manufactured these products for years for Enphase. The transaction will most likely help Enphase to bring down operating expenses and working capital requirements. In fact, the company alluded to all of these aspects in today's analyst day presentation. Given the assumed character of the agreement, I would actually be surprised to see a cash payment from Flextronics to Enphase here. There's more evidence for my take on the transaction as the company does not disclose any numbers and has not even issued a press release so far. In short, Enphase is suffering from fierce competition and has been severely pressured by liquidity issues as of late. Despite raising tens of millions in new capital during Q1 and ongoing efforts to bring down its expense structure, the company is still expected to burn meaningful amounts of cash going forward which might very well require just another capital raise in the second half of this year. There's plenty of up-to-date coverage on Enphase available on Seeking Alpha, investors looking for more color on the company should start with the articles from fellow contributors Morningsidepark and EnerTuition.
 While the stock price has already decreased more than 50% from 2017 peak levels, there might be more downside ahead, particularly if the company once again fails to meet financial targets going forward like it has already been the case several times in the recent past. Bottom line: Sell the news. Enphase is most likely disposing of some older and non-core product lines in a move to bring down operating expenses and working capital requirements as also stated in today's analyst day presentation. Accordingly, I do not expect Flextronics to pay a meaningful license fee. The violent pre-market move provides investors with a decent opportunity to finally dispose of the company's shares or even outright short the stock. While momentum traders will undoubtedly try to get behind the stock this morning, I fully expect their attempts to ultimately fail and the share price to come back meaningfully over the course of the session despite the Deutsche Bank upgrade most likely providing some additional tailwinds. Personally, I am looking forward to the momentum crowd trying to move the stock big time this morning and initiate a short position once price action and trading volume are starting to weaken. As always, don't bet the farm on short positions and adequately manage your risk.
Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a short position in ENPH over the next 72 hours.

Enphase Energy is a NASDAQ-listed energy technology company headquartered in Petaluma, California. Enphase designs and manufactures software-driven home energy solutions that span solar generation, home energy storage and web-based monitoring and control. Enphase has shipped about ten million solar microinverters, primarily into the residential and commercial markets in North America, Europe and Australia. Microinverters convert the direct current power from the solar panel (DC) directly into grid-compatible alternating current (AC) for use or export. Enphase was the first company to successfully commercialise the microinverter on a wide scale, and remains the market leader.[2]

History[edit]
A number of companies and institutes had promoted the solar micro-inverter concept through the 1990s. The basic idea is to reduce the power handling of a conventional inverter design so that it matches the output of a single panel. This so reduces the size of the inverter that it can be placed on the back of the panel, producing an "AC panel". Such a system can be connected directly to the grid, or to each other to produce larger arrays. This contrasts with the traditional solar inverter approach where many panels are connected together in series on the DC-side and then run en-masse to a single larger inverter. Several products based on the micro-inverter concept were introduced in the 1990s and especially the early 2000s, but none were widely successful due to a number of factors.
In the aftermath of the 2001 Telecoms crash, Martin Fornage of Cerent Corporation was looking for new projects. When he saw the low performance of the string inverter for the solar array on his ranch, he formed Enphase Energy with another Cerent engineer, Raghu Belur, in 2006. Backed by $100 million in private equity, in 2008 they released their first product, the M175, to moderate success. Their 2nd generation product, 2009's M190, was far more successful, with sales of about 400,000 units in 2009 and early 2010. Enphase quickly grew to 13% marketshare for residential systems by mid-2010, aiming for 20% by year-end.[3]
They shipped their 500,000th inverter in early 2011,[4] and their 1,000,000th in September of the same year.[5] The 3rd generation M215 was released in the summer of 2011,[6] and had sold over a million of all models in 2011, bringing their installed base to 1.55 million inverters and 34.4% market share.[7] A 4th generation, the M250, was released in 2013.
As of 2012[update], their inverters captured 53.5% market share for residential installations in the US, which represents 72% of the entire world micro-inverter market.[8] This makes them the sixth largest inverter manufacturer, of any kind, worldwide.[9] Enphase has experimented with the European market starting in France and offering sales in France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Italy.[10] However, they had considerably more success in the UK, and later, Australia. As of 2013[update], approximately 20% of their sales is outside North America.[11]
Enphase continues to see increasing pricing pressure due to rapidly falling prices in the inverter market. In spite of several effects that should cause stability, prices for inverters are predicted to fall 11% during 2013. Market leaders, especially, face continued market share erosion in the face of newer companies, most of them from the far east.[12]
Products[edit]




An Enphase M190 mounted and grounded.


All Enphase microinverters are basically the same internally, with differences in the maximum amount of power they can handle and the cabling system being the major differences between models.
Legacy Products[edit]
The M175 was their first product, released in 2008. It was designed to output 175 Watts of AC power, but is capable of up to 5% over that. The M175 was packaged in a relatively large cast aluminum box, similar to the boxes used on cable tv amplifiers seen on telephone poles. Wiring was passed through the case using compression fittings and the inverters connected to each other using a twist-lock connection. A limited number of M210 models, based on the same generation system, were also available for a limited time.
Due to a high level of failures the M175 was recalled and replaced by the M190 in 2009. The M190 offers a slightly higher power rating of 190 Watts (peaking to 199). The system was packaged in a much smaller case, this time filled with epoxy potting material to handle heat dissipation, and built-in cable connections replacing the earlier compression fittings. The system was otherwise similar, using the same connectors and cabling as the M175, and the two designs could be mixed in a string. Like its predecessor the M175 the M190 has also been plagued by a high failure rate.
Around the same time the company also released the D380, which was essentially two M190's in a single larger case. For small inverters like the M190, the case and its assembly represents a significant portion of the total cost of production, so by placing two in a single box that cost is spread out. The D380 also introduced a new inter-inverter cabling system based on a "drop cable" system. This placed a single connector on a short cable on the inverter, and used a separate cable with either one or three connectors on it. Arrays were constructed by linking together up to three D380s with a single drop cable, and then connecting them to other drop cables using larger twist-fit connectors.
Current Products[edit]
In 2011 the entire lineup was replaced with the 3rd generation M215, combining the features of the M190 and D380. Like the M190, the M215 was a single inverter, now in a much smaller box. Like the D380, the M215 used a trunk cabling system with short connector cables on the inverters. However, instead of one or three-drop cable, the M215's Engage system, used a long roll of cables with connectors spliced into it. The installer cuts the Engage cable to the required length, and then caps the open ends that result.
In 2013 the M250 was released, offering a new grounding system that eliminates the otherwise NEC - required external grounding conductor, increased reliability, and increased efficiency (96.5%), along with a rating bump to 250W. Whereas previous models were all named after the maximum power rating, the M250 actually refers to its peak power. Using the same convention the M190 would be called the M199. The M250 is otherwise identical to the earlier M215 and compatible with the same Engage cabling system.
All Enphase models use power line communications to pass monitoring data between the inverters and the Envoy communications gateway. The Envoy stores daily performance data for up to a year, and, when available, allows Enphase's Enlighten web service to download data approximately every 15 minutes. Customers and installers can review the data on the Enlighten web site.
In 2015 the company launched its fifth generation of products.

Enphase Energy is a NASDAQ-listed energy technology company headquartered in Petaluma, California. Enphase designs and manufactures software-driven home energy solutions that span solar generation, home energy storage and web-based monitoring and control. Enphase has shipped about ten million solar microinverters, primarily into the residential and commercial markets in North America, Europe and Australia. Microinverters convert the direct current power from the solar panel (DC) directly into grid-compatible alternating current (AC) for use or export. Enphase was the first company to successfully commercialise the microinverter on a wide scale, and remains the market leader.[2]

History[edit]
A number of companies and institutes had promoted the solar micro-inverter concept through the 1990s. The basic idea is to reduce the power handling of a conventional inverter design so that it matches the output of a single panel. This so reduces the size of the inverter that it can be placed on the back of the panel, producing an "AC panel". Such a system can be connected directly to the grid, or to each other to produce larger arrays. This contrasts with the traditional solar inverter approach where many panels are connected together in series on the DC-side and then run en-masse to a single larger inverter. Several products based on the micro-inverter concept were introduced in the 1990s and especially the early 2000s, but none were widely successful due to a number of factors.
In the aftermath of the 2001 Telecoms crash, Martin Fornage of Cerent Corporation was looking for new projects. When he saw the low performance of the string inverter for the solar array on his ranch, he formed Enphase Energy with another Cerent engineer, Raghu Belur, in 2006. Backed by $100 million in private equity, in 2008 they released their first product, the M175, to moderate success. Their 2nd generation product, 2009's M190, was far more successful, with sales of about 400,000 units in 2009 and early 2010. Enphase quickly grew to 13% marketshare for residential systems by mid-2010, aiming for 20% by year-end.[3]
They shipped their 500,000th inverter in early 2011,[4] and their 1,000,000th in September of the same year.[5] The 3rd generation M215 was released in the summer of 2011,[6] and had sold over a million of all models in 2011, bringing their installed base to 1.55 million inverters and 34.4% market share.[7] A 4th generation, the M250, was released in 2013.
As of 2012[update], their inverters captured 53.5% market share for residential installations in the US, which represents 72% of the entire world micro-inverter market.[8] This makes them the sixth largest inverter manufacturer, of any kind, worldwide.[9] Enphase has experimented with the European market starting in France and offering sales in France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Italy.[10] However, they had considerably more success in the UK, and later, Australia. As of 2013[update], approximately 20% of their sales is outside North America.[11]
Enphase continues to see increasing pricing pressure due to rapidly falling prices in the inverter market. In spite of several effects that should cause stability, prices for inverters are predicted to fall 11% during 2013. Market leaders, especially, face continued market share erosion in the face of newer companies, most of them from the far east.[12]
Products[edit]




An Enphase M190 mounted and grounded.


All Enphase microinverters are basically the same internally, with differences in the maximum amount of power they can handle and the cabling system being the major differences between models.
Legacy Products[edit]
The M175 was their first product, released in 2008. It was designed to output 175 Watts of AC power, but is capable of up to 5% over that. The M175 was packaged in a relatively large cast aluminum box, similar to the boxes used on cable tv amplifiers seen on telephone poles. Wiring was passed through the case using compression fittings and the inverters connected to each other using a twist-lock connection. A limited number of M210 models, based on the same generation system, were also available for a limited time.
Due to a high level of failures the M175 was recalled and replaced by the M190 in 2009. The M190 offers a slightly higher power rating of 190 Watts (peaking to 199). The system was packaged in a much smaller case, this time filled with epoxy potting material to handle heat dissipation, and built-in cable connections replacing the earlier compression fittings. The system was otherwise similar, using the same connectors and cabling as the M175, and the two designs could be mixed in a string. Like its predecessor the M175 the M190 has also been plagued by a high failure rate.
Around the same time the company also released the D380, which was essentially two M190's in a single larger case. For small inverters like the M190, the case and its assembly represents a significant portion of the total cost of production, so by placing two in a single box that cost is spread out. The D380 also introduced a new inter-inverter cabling system based on a "drop cable" system. This placed a single connector on a short cable on the inverter, and used a separate cable with either one or three connectors on it. Arrays were constructed by linking together up to three D380s with a single drop cable, and then connecting them to other drop cables using larger twist-fit connectors.
Current Products[edit]
In 2011 the entire lineup was replaced with the 3rd generation M215, combining the features of the M190 and D380. Like the M190, the M215 was a single inverter, now in a much smaller box. Like the D380, the M215 used a trunk cabling system with short connector cables on the inverters. However, instead of one or three-drop cable, the M215's Engage system, used a long roll of cables with connectors spliced into it. The installer cuts the Engage cable to the required length, and then caps the open ends that result.
In 2013 the M250 was released, offering a new grounding system that eliminates the otherwise NEC - required external grounding conductor, increased reliability, and increased efficiency (96.5%), along with a rating bump to 250W. Whereas previous models were all named after the maximum power rating, the M250 actually refers to its peak power. Using the same convention the M190 would be called the M199. The M250 is otherwise identical to the earlier M215 and compatible with the same Engage cabling system.
All Enphase models use power line communications to pass monitoring data between the inverters and the Envoy communications gateway. The Envoy stores daily performance data for up to a year, and, when available, allows Enphase's Enlighten web service to download data approximately every 15 minutes. Customers and installers can review the data on the Enlighten web site.
In 2015 the company launched its fifth generation of products. The S230 and S280 microinverters have the highest efficiency for module-level power electronics at 97%, offer advanced grid functionality like reactive power control, and comply with regulatory requirements like Electric Rule 21 in California and Rule 14H in Hawaii. The next-gen Envoy-S offers revenue-grade metering of solar production, consumption monitoring, and integrated Wi-Fi. The company also moved into home energy storage with its Storage System featuring an AC Battery, a modular, 1.2kWh lithium-iron phosphate offering aimed at residential users that is part of a Home Energy Solution. The Home Energy Solution will launch in Australia in mid-2016.

This placed a single connector on a short cable on the inverter, and used a separate cable with either one or three connectors on it. Arrays were constructed by linking together up to three D380s with a single drop cable, and then connecting them to other drop cables using larger twist-fit connectors.
Current Products[edit]
In 2011 the entire lineup was replaced with the 3rd generation M215, combining the features of the M190 and D380. Like the M190, the M215 was a single inverter, now in a much smaller box. Like the D380, the M215 used a trunk cabling system with short connector cables on the inverters. However, instead of one or three-drop cable, the M215's Engage system, used a long roll of cables with connectors spliced into it. The installer cuts the Engage cable to the required length, and then caps the open ends that result.
In 2013 the M250 was released, offering a new grounding system that eliminates the otherwise NEC - required external grounding conductor, increased reliability, and increased efficiency (96.5%), along with a rating bump to 250W. Whereas previous models were all named after the maximum power rating, the M250 actually refers to its peak power. Using the same convention the M190 would be called the M199. The M250 is otherwise identical to the earlier M215 and compatible with the same Engage cabling system.
All Enphase models use power line communications to pass monitoring data between the inverters and the Envoy communications gateway. The Envoy stores daily performance data for up to a year, and, when available, allows Enphase's Enlighten web service to download data approximately every 15 minutes. Customers and installers can review the data on the Enlighten web site.
In 2015 the company launched its fifth generation of products. The S230 and S280 microinverters have the highest efficiency for module-level power electronics at 97%, offer advanced grid functionality like reactive power control, and comply with regulatory requirements like Electric Rule 21 in California and Rule 14H in Hawaii. The next-gen Envoy-S offers revenue-grade metering of solar production, consumption monitoring, and integrated Wi-Fi. The company also moved into home energy storage with its Storage System featuring an AC Battery, a modular, 1.2kWh lithium-iron phosphate offering aimed at residential users that is part of a Home Energy Solution. The Home Energy Solution will launch in Australia in mid-2016.

Enphase Energy is a NASDAQ-listed energy technology company headquartered in Petaluma, California. Enphase designs and manufactures software-driven home energy solutions that span solar generation, home energy storage and web-based monitoring and control. Enphase has shipped about ten million solar microinverters, primarily into the residential and commercial markets in North America, Europe and Australia. Microinverters convert the direct current power from the solar panel (DC) directly into grid-compatible alternating current (AC) for use or export. Enphase was the first company to successfully commercialise the microinverter on a wide scale, and remains the market leader.[2]

History[edit]
A number of companies and institutes had promoted the solar micro-inverter concept through the 1990s. The basic idea is to reduce the power handling of a conventional inverter design so that it matches the output of a single panel. This so reduces the size of the inverter that it can be placed on the back of the panel, producing an "AC panel". Such a system can be connected directly to the grid, or to each other to produce larger arrays. This contrasts with the traditional solar inverter approach where many panels are connected together in series on the DC-side and then run en-masse to a single larger inverter. Several products based on the micro-inverter concept were introduced in the 1990s and especially the early 2000s, but none were widely successful due to a number of factors.
In the aftermath of the 2001 Telecoms crash, Martin Fornage of Cerent Corporation was looking for new projects. When he saw the low performance of the string inverter for the solar array on his ranch, he formed Enphase Energy with another Cerent engineer, Raghu Belur, in 2006. Backed by $100 million in private equity, in 2008 they released their first product, the M175, to moderate success. Their 2nd generation product, 2009's M190, was far more successful, with sales of about 400,000 units in 2009 and early 2010. Enphase quickly grew to 13% marketshare for residential systems by mid-2010, aiming for 20% by year-end.[3]
They shipped their 500,000th inverter in early 2011,[4] and their 1,000,000th in September of the same year.[5] The 3rd generation M215 was released in the summer of 2011,[6] and had sold over a million of all models in 2011, bringing their installed base to 1.55 million inverters and 34.4% market share.[7] A 4th generation, the M250, was released in 2013.
As of 2012[update], their inverters captured 53.5% market share for residential installations in the US, which represents 72% of the entire world micro-inverter market.[8] This makes them the sixth largest inverter manufacturer, of any kind, worldwide.[9] Enphase has experimented with the European market starting in France and offering sales in France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Italy.[10] However, they had considerably more success in the UK, and later, Australia. As of 2013[update], approximately 20% of their sales is outside North America.[11]
Enphase continues to see increasing pricing pressure due to rapidly falling prices in the inverter market. In spite of several effects that should cause stability, prices for inverters are predicted to fall 11% during 2013. Market leaders, especially, face continued market share erosion in the face of newer companies, most of them from the far east.[12]
Products[edit]




An Enphase M190 mounted and grounded.


All Enphase microinverters are basically the same internally, with differences in the maximum amount of power they can handle and the cabling system being the major differences between models.
Legacy Products[edit]
The M175 was their first product, released in 2008. It was designed to output 175 Watts of AC power, but is capable of up to 5% over that. The M175 was packaged in a relatively large cast aluminum box, similar to the boxes used on cable tv amplifiers seen on telephone poles. Wiring was passed through the case using compression fittings and the inverters connected to each other using a twist-lock connection. A limited number of M210 models, based on the same generation system, were also available for a limited time.
Due to a high level of failures the M175 was recalled and replaced by the M190 in 2009. The M190 offers a slightly higher power rating of 190 Watts (peaking to 199). The system was packaged in a much smaller case, this time filled with epoxy potting material to handle heat dissipation, and built-in cable connections replacing the earlier compression fittings. The system was otherwise similar, using the same connectors and cabling as the M175, and the two designs could be mixed in a string. Like its predecessor the M175 the M190 has also been plagued by a high failure rate.
Around the same time the company also released the D380, which was essentially two M190's in a single larger case. For small inverters like the M190, the case and its assembly represents a significant portion of the total cost of production, so by placing two in a single box that cost is spread out. The D380 also introduced a new inter-inverter cabling system based on a "drop cable" system. This placed a single connector on a short cable on the inverter, and used a separate cable with either one or three connectors on it. Arrays were constructed by linking together up to three D380s with a single drop cable, and then connecting them to other drop cables using larger twist-fit connectors.
Current Products[edit]
In 2011 the entire lineup was replaced with the 3rd generation M215, combining the features of the M190 and D380. Like the M190, the M215 was a single inverter, now in a much smaller box. Like the D380, the M215 used a trunk cabling system with short connector cables on the inverters. However, instead of one or three-drop cable, the M215's Engage system, used a long roll of cables with connectors spliced into it. The installer cuts the Engage cable to the required length, and then caps the open ends that result.
In 2013 the M250 was released, offering a new grounding system that eliminates the otherwise NEC - required external grounding conductor, increased reliability, and increased efficiency (96.5%), along with a rating bump to 250W. Whereas previous models were all named after the maximum power rating, the M250 actually refers to its peak power. Using the same convention the M190 would be called the M199. The M250 is otherwise identical to the earlier M215 and compatible with the same Engage cabling system.
All Enphase models use power line communications to pass monitoring data between the inverters and the Envoy communications gateway. The Envoy stores daily performance data for up to a year, and, when available, allows Enphase's Enlighten web service to download data approximately every 15 minutes. Customers and installers can review the data on the Enlighten web site.
In 2015 the company launched its fifth generation of products. The S230 and S280 microinverters have the highest efficiency for module-level power electronics at 97%, offer advanced grid functionality like reactive power control, and comply with regulatory requirements like Electric Rule 21 in California and Rule 14H in Hawaii.

The company also moved into home energy storage with its Storage System featuring an AC Battery, a modular, 1.2kWh lithium-iron phosphate offering aimed at residential users that is part of a Home Energy Solution. The Home Energy Solution will launch in Australia in mid-2016.

Enphase Energy: New Products, New Markets, Increased Marketshare, Lower Product Costs - Enphase Energy Inc. (NASDAQ:ENPH) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Enphase Energy: New Products, New Markets, Increased Marketshare, Lower Product CostsSep. 5.16 | About: Enphase Energy (ENPH) TJ Roberts Long/short equity, tech, small-cap, long onlySolarKings LLC ~ Sunshine State ~ FloridaSummaryEnphase's new technology could be a game changer like the Apple iPhone was.Enphase's 6th-generation microinverter promises a lower cost while still maintaining superiority to the older central string inverter - power optimizer solution.World leaders are pushing renewable energy — The market is huge!Enphase now has a new invention, a new home energy solution to sell.Enphase's Storage Solution gives the company a whole new revenue stream and complements their existing product portfolio.Well, Cupertino is not that far from Petaluma, so maybe there is some synergy there! It hasn't even been a month since my last article on Enphase Energy (NASDAQ:ENPH), and the simplicity and ease of installation of Enphase's microinverter-based solar PV systems is going viral. Like the first iPhones that hit the streets almost a decade ago, the residential solar PV system which offers almost 100% guaranteed up-time for the system's lifetime is selling globally - and now Enphase has a simplistic, new storage system to accompany it - a whole new market, and the best part is that what Enphase Energy has done for residential solar PV systems by empowering customers with the ability to easily manage and monitor their own solar systems, they are now doing for battery storage, and selling a complete package - the Enphase Home Energy Management System. Do new and existing solar PV customers need to think about storage with their solar photovoltaic solution? Yes, they should. Are Net Metering and FiTs contracts going to last forever? Most likely not, and in places like Australia, New Zealand, and Hawaii, to name a few, existing and new solar customers are turning to storage to address the policy changes so that they can store the energy their solar systems create instead of supplying the utility grid for free. There is an old saying: victory favors the prepared, and Enphase's long-range vision has prepared them for these changes in policy, and they are ready to take the advantage - Enphase Energy chose "Energy" over "Solar" in their company name because their long-range vision always has been to be a home energy system provider - the new Enphase Home Energy Management System is their masterpiece. The beauty of Enphase's AC Battery storage unit compared to most of the competitors is that their's doesn't push the "mortgage the farm" slogan upon you to buy their solution - instead, they work with your budget allowing you to buy some storage now, then more later on when your budget permits. Because of their storage product's modularity, they can give the customer the lowest cost-of-entry into this new market. Their new storage solution can be retrofitted into any existing solar PV solution out there, and that gives them a much bigger audience. Why should a customer have to make a 1-time, huge investment in a single vendor's storage technology when this safer purchasing option is available? The same way Enphase sells their microinverters is the way they are proceeding with their storage solution. Each of their AC Battery storage units includes its own microinverter - giving each AC Battery complete autonomy from the others - a complete, extremely elegant, lightweight, safe and certified,modular, scalable, all-in-one unit.
 Older battery storage solutions required complete cooperation between each battery device, and if any one battery had an issue, it compromised the whole battery farm, that is, all the interconnected batteries. With Enphase's AC Battery storage solution, there is 100% fault tolerance so that even if an AC Battery unit fails, the other AC Battery units will continue working independent of the failed device, giving the customer true reliability. This fault-tolerance is a powerful attribute, and this is Enphase. Not only do most of the competition's products not have Enphase's product modularity, they do not have their storage device designed with its own, internal state-of-the-art microinverter. Most storage solutions require multiple devices to install, multiple points of failure, multiple vendors to deal with - with Enphase, it's a single vendor, single product SKU - Enphase is simplicity. Remember when you had to buy the PC, buy the keyboard, buy the mouse, buy the monitor, et cetera? Now you have your single iPad, or MacBook Pro or single whatever. SolartEdge's StorEdge, the Tesla battery, the AC transformer device - they all come from different vendors; you need to purchase all of them in order to set up your home's storage solution; if any of them fail, then your whole storage solution is down, and for who knows for how long. The AC Battery is a single, modular, independent device which when configured with multiple AC Batteries gives the customer 100% fault tolerance with the lowest cost-of-entry. Using the computing analogy from above, which storage product do you think people will desire more? As we embrace the Internet of Things, it's easy to see why Enphase is growing market share, and globally, too. People want "cool" products, and people want it to be simple to install and maintain. There are over half a million Enphase customers out there, with more coming onboard daily. An Enphase problem is a problem, not a crisis. A SolarEdge (NASDAQ:SEDG), SMA (OTCPK:SMTGF), ABB (NYSE:ABB) or Fronius central string inverter failure is a crisis - why? Because when you realize your central string inverter is no longer working for your solar PV system, you really don't know how long your entire solar system will be down for, and you are at the mercy of the installer, the string inverter vendor, and your friendly utility company! As a solar customer and installer, I don't want a crisis - a single failed microinverter problem, sure, I will accept that; for example, if I were to experience a microinverter failure today, I could take care of it some time next week after Labor Day during normal business hours, knowing from the monitoring of my home's solar system using my browser, that the other 72 microinverters of my system were still running fine - that is the power of microinverters over a single central string inverter. Since installation of my solar system in 2013, I have yet to experience a problem, and I have 73 Enphase microinverters.
 Enphase is proving their new storage system is cutting-edge in the Australia - New Zealand market right now. An article in the Australian Financial Review on August 31, claims Enphase is more than doubling their initial sales projections with 70,000 battery systems projected for the year alone. A comparison of the AC Battery product to competing products gives excellent marks to Enphase's AC Battery. Enphase's success in the storage battleground regions of Australia and New Zealand, mean only that they will also do well in even bigger markets like Hawaii, Europe, and the USA. A new market means new revenue streams, new customers - new customers do not have to be existing Enphase customers; they could be a SolarEdge convert or some other central string inverter-based solar system. Enphase's co-founder, Raghu Belur, stated that dumb box solar systems with no Internet intelligence would eventually be replaced by decentralized, smart electronics like Enphase's. Much like the mainframe computers gave way to decentralized servers and PCs, so, too, will central string inverter-based residential solar PV systems be superseded by decentralized, microinverter-based residential solar PV solutions. It is only a matter of time, and the superior technology is gaining marketshare; more and more installers are realizing the ease of installation, simplicity and reliability of an Enphase microinverter-based solar PV solution. They're super quick to install, easy to manage, and they are 100% fault-tolerant offering the customer continuous up-time. Has the solar market been beat up lately? Yes, it has. The doom and gloom of SunEdison has appeared to give the solar industry a black eye, but Enphase Energy is in a different niche. The ITC expiration fears were a potential nail in the coffin for the solar industry, but thanks to our Congress, that fear evaporated overnight this past year. And this just wasn't some blind act by Congress, no, it was a realization by the politicians that solar is the fastest growing industry in the country, and that equates to future tax revenue. Solar is coming on strong because it is getting affordable - it is not just for the wealthy any longer. The GTM article on September 1, titled "Global Solar Demand Monitor: Q3 2016", states that this year is set to be another record breaker for solar globally, with the market set to grow by 43%. Remember when Apple Macintoshes cost $3,000 to $4,000, and only a select few could afford them? Now, everyone has some form of one. The same progression is happening with solar PV and storage today, and Enphase is in the catbird seat - they have their own solar home energy management system ready to go.
 If climate change is real, if Big Coal is being shuttered, if "peak oil" has been reached, if Europe and other countries are coming to the realization that they don't want to be oil importers - then we are on the verge of a mass renewable energy transformation minimizing the need for hydrocarbons (oil, gas, coal) as much as humanly possible. In a bestseller entitled, "The True Story of the Bilderberg Group", the author, Daniel Estulin, writes that at secretive annual meetings, heads of state, leaders of corporations, U.S. Presidents and other leaders are the real decision makers, and these leaders have decided that renewable energy is the way to go, and renewable energy can free us from a potential catastrophe when hydrocarbons run out, like oil, for they are not infinite resources. Whether or not you believe in that happening, whether or not you believe in climate change, things are abuzz with renewables - you could say Enphase Energy is at the right place and the right time, kind of like Apple Computer was with the iPhone. At these secretive, annual Bilderberg meetings, one of the prevailing subjects of discussion continues to be "energy". According to Jan Lundberg, an oil energy expert, the USA lost between 20% and 25% of its energy supply during Hurricane Katrina in 2005 - yet the Saudis did not increase production. Noting that, the question was raised: has "peak oil" been reached, and is the world on par for diminishing returns on oil? Were the Saudis pumping as much as they could without being able to increase production due to physical limitations? In 2003, then British Foreign Secretary, Jack Straw. stated "the depletion of gas reserves in the North Sea and the Irish Sea…it is expected that Britain will have to import 75 percent of its gas by 2015". Within 10-years, it is expected that Europe will have to import "more than 92% of its oil and 81% of its gas". In 2005, French Prime Minister and Bilderberg member, Dominique de Villepin, was quoted by Reuters saying "We have entered the post-oil era. I want to draw all the consequences of this and give real impulse to energy savings and to the use of renewable energies". Former CIA director, James Woolsey in an interview with the Washington Post in June, 2000, stated the energy crisis "should have a severe impact, global in scope, and be difficult to solve". In a January-February 1999 article titled "The New Petroleum" for the journal Foreign Affairs, he stated "the underlying goal of the U.N. force in Gulf War I, which included 500,000 American troops, was to ensure continued and unfettered access to petroleum". If world leaders at these secretive Bilderberg Group meetings constantly focus on the issue of energy, and they are calling for massive transition to renewables on a global scale, then clearly a gold nugget like Enphase Energy has some serious potential to play a part in the big picture, for Enphase's concept of true fault-tolerance, modularity, and reliability is the superior solution for solar systems on the residential rooftops - it is the best system for the customer.
 My monthly utility bill was outrageous before I started adding solar to my home in 2013. I found that 60% of the energy my utility purchased was from Big Coal. If climate change is real, then is Big Coal going to flourish, or will it slowly be retired? My utility company's CEO has posted letters in the company's monthly periodical warning customers what Big Coal's demise truly means in terms of supply and demand and billing. If he thinks coal is being retired, then surely renewable energy is something to embrace and pursue. As one of the most intelligent species on the planet, we must try to address global problems and save our planet, right? Overpopulation is a problem, right? In 1812, there were 1 billion people. In 1912, there were 1.5 billion people. Now, in 2016, there are 7.5 billion people on our planet Earth. OK, so humans are a problem, but feeding the livestock the humans consume is the real crux - there is just not enough Earth available to grow all the feed needed for those animals. Ever work on a farm with a lot of pigs or cattle? What's that one thing that is everywhere, that one smell? Methane is worse than carbon dioxide, ten times over, in terms of causing the "greenhouse effect", but changing people's eating habits, affecting even bigger industries than coal, is going to be an even greater monumental task to address. Is everyone ready to be a herbivore once again? So, solar energy is at least a more attainable goal by humans to try to lessen their carbon footprint on the Earth. With Elon Musk's rocket exploding on 9/1 on the launch pad in Cape Canaveral, destroying Facebook's satellite and their attempt at giving Africans wireless, we had better save this planet first before we consider Mars. I am a fan of Elon Musk, but it is clear that colonizing the red planet is still a ways off. And in reality, how many of us could pull a Matt Damon and be a Martian, it just does not look that desirable a life? This is the planet to save, this is the only planet we really have. So, solar is here to stay regardless of the political rhetoric you might hear from politicians who appear to not favor renewable energy - these politicians take orders or advice from the Bilderberg members, more or less. In reading Bilderberg and CFR member, Zbigniew Brezinski's 1997 book, "The Grand Chessboard", it shows the true blueprint for America's energy policy aka world energy policy, coming straight from the minds of the true leaders - the same leaders who are advisers to the POTUS and to other leaders around the world. Renewable energy is here to stay, and the transformation is just beginning.
 Enphase is preparing to debut their 6th-generation microinverter at Solar Power International 2016 in Las Vegas September 12 - 15. This is a big event for Enphase, for it follows the Analyst Day projections made last November of major cost reductions in their microinverter product. Now, juxtapose this with Enphase's global market growth and their new market revenue stream, and you have a serious revolution underway, just like their web site states. The numbers below represent about 3-weeks of data (8/8 through 8/31); these statistics show growth not only in the United States, but all over the world. The beauty of social media is that people are learning better ways to do things more quickly than ever before. In such a brave, new world, Enphase's product superiority is becoming well-known. Maybe in the pre-Internet days, monopolies could trounce a superior product to protect their inferior one, but with Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and so on, it is hard to keep a superior product down - information is flowing too freely these days in multiple directions and multiple channels, and that can be a good thing, especially for Enphase which can take advantage of the marketing muscle of the global media outlets. Microinverters are winning the MLPE (Module Level Power Electronics) war, and the venerable central string inverter, even with its band-aid-like power optimizers, must fade into history, as enlightened customers choose reliability and fault-tolerance for their home energy system. Customers will not want a home energy solution which can be completely disabled due to a single component failure. Enphase microinverters are the future of solar on the residential rooftops. Public Enphase Systems Coming Online from 8/8 through 8/31  Western USA - over 3,036 systems - almost 3% growth Mid-USA - almost 2% growth Eastern-USA - over 1,615 systems!! - solid 3% growth Southeastern USA - almost 3% growth Mexico & Central America - almost 8% growth South America - almost 2% growth United Kingdom - 1% growth Europe - almost 3% growth India - Sri Lanka regions - almost 10% growth Hawaii - 1% growth Northern Australia - almost 8% growth Southwestern Australia - almost 4% growth Eastern Australia - solid 3% growth New Zealand - almost 5% growth 
 And this is just a little more than 3 weeks of data, and it does not include all Enphase systems or products either. Enphase is on fire, and they are not burning up, their rocket ship is taking off. The upcoming November 1st conference call should be positive; if anything, it should show a trend towards profitability. The goal is still an iPhone-sized microinverter, and Enphase is on track to reach that goal. The upcoming conference call will demonstrate marketshare gains with new market revenue streams. The threat of the older, inferior solar technology gaining more marketshare due to cheap pricing will be shown to be subsiding. Yes, central string inverters were a great invention by SMA (OTCPK:SMTGF) in 1981, and the 2010 power optimizer gave the older technology some more life, but the fact remains that the microinverter with its 100% fault-tolerant topology is the superior technology. The lower price wins, regardless of superiority, just as long as it can do the job - the very existence and profitability of SolarEdge has proven that, but it is only a won battle not the war. When the superior system, the Enphase microinverter-based one, is at or near the same cost of the inferior one, the central string inverter with power optimizers, then customers will choose the better system. Enphase Energy's debut of their 6th-generation microinverter this month in Las Vegas is going to bring that reality closer to fruition. Furthermore, if you consider the 2 competing solutions, with the microinverter-based system, there is one less device to purchase and install as compared to the central string inverter - power optimizers system. Affordability and cost are of utmost importance to the customer, and cost must be measured against ROI to verify the purchase's reasonability. A presidential hopeful recently reiterated some real old solar news stating solar had a 19-year ROI. Well, factual proof is everything, and I am sure the hopeful's advisers will enlighten him sooner or later. if you are an installer, a string of 16 Talesun 260-Watt 16% efficient polycrystalline panels at $0.53/Watt with some $85 Enphase M215 micronverters is an incredible deal. Put 5 solar strings of these panels on a roof, and you have a 20,800-Watt system for under $20,000 material cost. Incredible, and 30% of it is deductible. Just one 16-panel string with Enphase microinverters is just under $4,000 cost giving you 4,120-Watts, at about 5 hours of daily solar insolation, for example, your ROI is under 5-years not including labor; 5 is a lot less than 19, right? I am sure people will challenge my numbers, but all I am trying to convey is that solar is getting cheap, affordable, and that means it is not for the wealthy any longer, and a huge market is opening up. If we are going to save the planet, then we are going to want as many rooves as possible to take part in this Green Energy revolution. While you are having a peaceful Labor Day, remember that the solar industry has had our nation's fastest growth, employing young American "laborers" - jobs and energy freedom can make the world great again, and our leaders have made the decision to move in that direction. As we approach the country's most important election, besides making America great again, let's try to make our planet great again by reducing our carbon footprint globally. As Thomas Edison once said, "I'd put my money on solar energy. I hope we don't have to wait till oil and coal run out before we tackle that."
 I am long on Enphase. I install solar for friends and neighbors. I have attended the Solar Energy Institute in Paonia, Colorado. I have assisted Grid Alternatives in Colorado installing Enphase microinverter-based solar systems. I have consulted with a local Florida solar company which prefers Enphase, and have seen first-hand what failed central inverters can cause in terms of both power loss, down time and customer frustration. Since 2013, I have designed and added onto my own home's solar system which now consists of 6 separate solar panel strings with 73 Enphase microinverters producing upwards of almost 100,000-Watt-hours on a sunny day in the Sunshine State. My utility bill is history, and I am fortunate enough to enjoy Net Metering with the utility company. I generate solar energy credits which are reconciled at the end of the utility's fiscal year. In terms of ROI alone, my Enphase-based solar system will be paid for in less than 6 years, and it is money well spent - money which is clearly earning more than 0.01% interest in a bank account!

And I think by the end of the year we will have yet again a far more cost-effective solution.''ENPH has already stated they believe every solar system sold within 5 years will include a battery...which is why they are not giving up on the ACB.I'm thinking the end game is to bring Rodgers two investments together eventually (ENPH and Enivox)....but in the meantime get those cost down around 50% and the wattage up 20% or more.That would be a good start.It won't help them this year....but with OPEX down to the 15M range it will set them up for a very profitable 2018.http://www.enovix.com/#homeMoreReplyReplies (3)53ddealwithitFor those that don't know....SEDG has flat annual revenue in the 75M dollar range and losses of 100M plus on the books before SCTY came along and dragged them into the big time....even though their products were exactly the same.

Enphase Energy, Inc. Key Developments

LG Electronics USA, Inc. Releases Two-Step Solar Panel with Enphase Energy, Inc
Jul 11 17
LG Electronics USA announced the NeON® 2 ACe in collaboration with Enphase Energy Inc. at Intersolar 2017. The alliance between LG Electronics USA and Enphase Energy, forged last year, is aimed at making solar solutions an easier investment. The LG NeON 2 ACe is the first result of the collaboration for residential installation, and it reduces installation time by half, compared with conventional modules, while offering cutting-edge technology. The result of two solar industry pacesetters, LG NeON 2 ACe brings together high-performance and a simplified user experience, combining the processes of logistics, installation and monitoring. Installation, always a concern for homeowners, becomes a quick, two-step roof installation process with this integrated AC Module - lifting the microinverter out of the flat shipping positon and connecting the cable without the need to install the two products separately. Once roof installation is complete and Enphase's internal software is set up, Enphase technology remote monitoring and management software can be controlled from any web connected device. On the surface, LG NeON 2 ACe utilizes brand new cello technology, which replaces the industry standard three busbars with 30 thin wires, enhancing output and reliability. This market-leading technology allows for more energy-efficiency and premium temperature performance characteristics. Aesthetically, these innovations are designed to improve curb-appeal for the homeowner, creating a sleek, black look. The energy created by this elegant solar panel can be safely converted to AC voltage, another product of this revolutionary partnership. A strategically positioned 15mm distance separates the DC module and the microinverter, mitigating any impact to performance and reliability by allowing sufficient air-flow for cooling. LG NeON 2 ACe also comes equip with LG Electronics' robust 12-year unit warranty and a 25-year warranty for the microinverter. LG Electronics is committed to exceeding customer's values and expectations beyond efficiency. The anodized aluminum frame of the panel can endure a front load up to 6,000Pa and a rear load up to 5,400Pa. This product is built to last.


Enphase Energy Receives Non-Compliance Notice From The Nasdaq
Jun 28 17
On June 23, 2017, Enphase Energy, Inc. was notified by the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) that for the previous 30 consecutive business days the bid price for the Company’s common stock had closed below the minimum $1.00 per share requirement for continued listing under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(a)(1).  That notification of noncompliance has no immediate effect on the listing or trading of the Company's common stock on the Nasdaq Global Market. Under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), if the minimum bid price of the Company’s common stock meets or exceeds $1.00 per share for a minimum of ten consecutive business days during the 180-day period following June 23, 2017, Nasdaq will provide the Company with written confirmation of compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement and this matter will be closed. If the Company does not achieve compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement by December 20, 2017, the Company may be eligible for an additional 180-calendar-day compliance period if it elects to transfer to the Nasdaq Capital Market. To qualify, the Company would be required to meet the continued listing requirement for market value of publicly held shares and all other initial listing standards for the Nasdaq Capital Market, with the exception of the Minimum Bid Price Requirement, and would need to provide written notice of its intention to cure the deficiency during the second compliance period. However, if it appears to Nasdaq that the Company will not be able to cure the deficiency, or if the Company is otherwise not eligible, Nasdaq would notify the Company that its securities would be subject to delisting. In the event of such notification, the Company may appeal Nasdaq’s determination to delist its securities, but there can be no assurance Nasdaq would grant the Company’s request for continued listing. The Company intends to monitor the closing bid price of its common stock and will consider available options to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement, including a reverse stock split.

Enphase Energy is a NASDAQ-listed energy technology company headquartered in Petaluma, California. Enphase designs and manufactures software-driven home energy solutions that span solar generation, home energy storage and web-based monitoring and control. Enphase has shipped about ten million solar microinverters, primarily into the residential and commercial markets in North America, Europe and Australia. Microinverters convert the direct current power from the solar panel (DC) directly into grid-compatible alternating current (AC) for use or export. Enphase was the first company to successfully commercialise the microinverter on a wide scale, and remains the market leader.[2]

History[edit]
A number of companies and institutes had promoted the solar micro-inverter concept through the 1990s. The basic idea is to reduce the power handling of a conventional inverter design so that it matches the output of a single panel. This so reduces the size of the inverter that it can be placed on the back of the panel, producing an "AC panel". Such a system can be connected directly to the grid, or to each other to produce larger arrays. This contrasts with the traditional solar inverter approach where many panels are connected together in series on the DC-side and then run en-masse to a single larger inverter. Several products based on the micro-inverter concept were introduced in the 1990s and especially the early 2000s, but none were widely successful due to a number of factors.
In the aftermath of the 2001 Telecoms crash, Martin Fornage of Cerent Corporation was looking for new projects. When he saw the low performance of the string inverter for the solar array on his ranch, he formed Enphase Energy with another Cerent engineer, Raghu Belur, in 2006. Backed by $100 million in private equity, in 2008 they released their first product, the M175, to moderate success. Their 2nd generation product, 2009's M190, was far more successful, with sales of about 400,000 units in 2009 and early 2010. Enphase quickly grew to 13% marketshare for residential systems by mid-2010, aiming for 20% by year-end.[3]
They shipped their 500,000th inverter in early 2011,[4] and their 1,000,000th in September of the same year.[5] The 3rd generation M215 was released in the summer of 2011,[6] and had sold over a million of all models in 2011, bringing their installed base to 1.55 million inverters and 34.4% market share.[7] A 4th generation, the M250, was released in 2013.
As of 2012[update], their inverters captured 53.5% market share for residential installations in the US, which represents 72% of the entire world micro-inverter market.[8] This makes them the sixth largest inverter manufacturer, of any kind, worldwide.[9] Enphase has experimented with the European market starting in France and offering sales in France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Italy.[10] However, they had considerably more success in the UK, and later, Australia. As of 2013[update], approximately 20% of their sales is outside North America.[11]
Enphase continues to see increasing pricing pressure due to rapidly falling prices in the inverter market. In spite of several effects that should cause stability, prices for inverters are predicted to fall 11% during 2013. Market leaders, especially, face continued market share erosion in the face of newer companies, most of them from the far east.[12]
Products[edit]




An Enphase M190 mounted and grounded.


All Enphase microinverters are basically the same internally, with differences in the maximum amount of power they can handle and the cabling system being the major differences between models.
Legacy Products[edit]
The M175 was their first product, released in 2008. It was designed to output 175 Watts of AC power, but is capable of up to 5% over that. The M175 was packaged in a relatively large cast aluminum box, similar to the boxes used on cable tv amplifiers seen on telephone poles. Wiring was passed through the case using compression fittings and the inverters connected to each other using a twist-lock connection. A limited number of M210 models, based on the same generation system, were also available for a limited time.
Due to a high level of failures the M175 was recalled and replaced by the M190 in 2009. The M190 offers a slightly higher power rating of 190 Watts (peaking to 199). The system was packaged in a much smaller case, this time filled with epoxy potting material to handle heat dissipation, and built-in cable connections replacing the earlier compression fittings. The system was otherwise similar, using the same connectors and cabling as the M175, and the two designs could be mixed in a string. Like its predecessor the M175 the M190 has also been plagued by a high failure rate.
Around the same time the company also released the D380, which was essentially two M190's in a single larger case. For small inverters like the M190, the case and its assembly represents a significant portion of the total cost of production, so by placing two in a single box that cost is spread out. The D380 also introduced a new inter-inverter cabling system based on a "drop cable" system. This placed a single connector on a short cable on the inverter, and used a separate cable with either one or three connectors on it. Arrays were constructed by linking together up to three D380s with a single drop cable, and then connecting them to other drop cables using larger twist-fit connectors.
Current Products[edit]
In 2011 the entire lineup was replaced with the 3rd generation M215, combining the features of the M190 and D380. Like the M190, the M215 was a single inverter, now in a much smaller box. Like the D380, the M215 used a trunk cabling system with short connector cables on the inverters. However, instead of one or three-drop cable, the M215's Engage system, used a long roll of cables with connectors spliced into it. The installer cuts the Engage cable to the required length, and then caps the open ends that result.
In 2013 the M250 was released, offering a new grounding system that eliminates the otherwise NEC - required external grounding conductor, increased reliability, and increased efficiency (96.5%), along with a rating bump to 250W. Whereas previous models were all named after the maximum power rating, the M250 actually refers to its peak power. Using the same convention the M190 would be called the M199. The M250 is otherwise identical to the earlier M215 and compatible with the same Engage cabling system.
All Enphase models use power line communications to pass monitoring data between the inverters and the Envoy communications gateway. The Envoy stores daily performance data for up to a year, and, when available, allows Enphase's Enlighten web service to download data approximately every 15 minutes. Customers and installers can review the data on the Enlighten web site.
In 2015 the company launched its fifth generation of products. The S230 and S280 microinverters have the highest efficiency for module-level power electronics at 97%, offer advanced grid functionality like reactive power control, and comply with regulatory requirements like Electric Rule 21 in California and Rule 14H in Hawaii. The next-gen Envoy-S offers revenue-grade metering of solar production, consumption monitoring, and integrated Wi-Fi. The company also moved into home energy storage with its Storage System featuring an AC Battery, a modular, 1.2kWh lithium-iron phosphate offering aimed at residential users that is part of a Home Energy Solution. The Home Energy Solution will launch in Australia in mid-2016.

Enphase Energy is a NASDAQ-listed energy technology company headquartered in Petaluma, California. Enphase designs and manufactures software-driven home energy solutions that span solar generation, home energy storage and web-based monitoring and control. Enphase has shipped about ten million solar microinverters, primarily into the residential and commercial markets in North America, Europe and Australia. Microinverters convert the direct current power from the solar panel (DC) directly into grid-compatible alternating current (AC) for use or export. Enphase was the first company to successfully commercialise the microinverter on a wide scale, and remains the market leader.[2]

History[edit]
A number of companies and institutes had promoted the solar micro-inverter concept through the 1990s. The basic idea is to reduce the power handling of a conventional inverter design so that it matches the output of a single panel. This so reduces the size of the inverter that it can be placed on the back of the panel, producing an "AC panel". Such a system can be connected directly to the grid, or to each other to produce larger arrays. This contrasts with the traditional solar inverter approach where many panels are connected together in series on the DC-side and then run en-masse to a single larger inverter. Several products based on the micro-inverter concept were introduced in the 1990s and especially the early 2000s, but none were widely successful due to a number of factors.
In the aftermath of the 2001 Telecoms crash, Martin Fornage of Cerent Corporation was looking for new projects. When he saw the low performance of the string inverter for the solar array on his ranch, he formed Enphase Energy with another Cerent engineer, Raghu Belur, in 2006. Backed by $100 million in private equity, in 2008 they released their first product, the M175, to moderate success. Their 2nd generation product, 2009's M190, was far more successful, with sales of about 400,000 units in 2009 and early 2010. Enphase quickly grew to 13% marketshare for residential systems by mid-2010, aiming for 20% by year-end.[3]
They shipped their 500,000th inverter in early 2011,[4] and their 1,000,000th in September of the same year.[5] The 3rd generation M215 was released in the summer of 2011,[6] and had sold over a million of all models in 2011, bringing their installed base to 1.55 million inverters and 34.4% market share.[7] A 4th generation, the M250, was released in 2013.
As of 2012[update], their inverters captured 53.5% market share for residential installations in the US, which represents 72% of the entire world micro-inverter market.[8] This makes them the sixth largest inverter manufacturer, of any kind, worldwide.[9] Enphase has experimented with the European market starting in France and offering sales in France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Italy.[10] However, they had considerably more success in the UK, and later, Australia. As of 2013[update], approximately 20% of their sales is outside North America.[11]
Enphase continues to see increasing pricing pressure due to rapidly falling prices in the inverter market. In spite of several effects that should cause stability, prices for inverters are predicted to fall 11% during 2013. Market leaders, especially, face continued market share erosion in the face of newer companies, most of them from the far east.[12]
Products[edit]




An Enphase M190 mounted and grounded.


All Enphase microinverters are basically the same internally, with differences in the maximum amount of power they can handle and the cabling system being the major differences between models.
Legacy Products[edit]
The M175 was their first product, released in 2008. It was designed to output 175 Watts of AC power, but is capable of up to 5% over that. The M175 was packaged in a relatively large cast aluminum box, similar to the boxes used on cable tv amplifiers seen on telephone poles. Wiring was passed through the case using compression fittings and the inverters connected to each other using a twist-lock connection. A limited number of M210 models, based on the same generation system, were also available for a limited time.
Due to a high level of failures the M175 was recalled and replaced by the M190 in 2009. The M190 offers a slightly higher power rating of 190 Watts (peaking to 199). The system was packaged in a much smaller case, this time filled with epoxy potting material to handle heat dissipation, and built-in cable connections replacing the earlier compression fittings. The system was otherwise similar, using the same connectors and cabling as the M175, and the two designs could be mixed in a string. Like its predecessor the M175 the M190 has also been plagued by a high failure rate.
Around the same time the company also released the D380, which was essentially two M190's in a single larger case. For small inverters like the M190, the case and its assembly represents a significant portion of the total cost of production, so by placing two in a single box that cost is spread out. The D380 also introduced a new inter-inverter cabling system based on a "drop cable" system. This placed a single connector on a short cable on the inverter, and used a separate cable with either one or three connectors on it. Arrays were constructed by linking together up to three D380s with a single drop cable, and then connecting them to other drop cables using larger twist-fit connectors.
Current Products[edit]
In 2011 the entire lineup was replaced with the 3rd generation M215, combining the features of the M190 and D380. Like the M190, the M215 was a single inverter, now in a much smaller box. Like the D380, the M215 used a trunk cabling system with short connector cables on the inverters. However, instead of one or three-drop cable, the M215's Engage system, used a long roll of cables with connectors spliced into it. The installer cuts the Engage cable to the required length, and then caps the open ends that result.
In 2013 the M250 was released, offering a new grounding system that eliminates the otherwise NEC - required external grounding conductor, increased reliability, and increased efficiency (96.5%), along with a rating bump to 250W. Whereas previous models were all named after the maximum power rating, the M250 actually refers to its peak power. Using the same convention the M190 would be called the M199. The M250 is otherwise identical to the earlier M215 and compatible with the same Engage cabling system.
All Enphase models use power line communications to pass monitoring data between the inverters and the Envoy communications gateway. The Envoy stores daily performance data for up to a year, and, when available, allows Enphase's Enlighten web service to download data approximately every 15 minutes. Customers and installers can review the data on the Enlighten web site.
In 2015 the company launched its fifth generation of products. The S230 and S280 microinverters have the highest efficiency for module-level power electronics at 97%, offer advanced grid functionality like reactive power control, and comply with regulatory requirements like Electric Rule 21 in California and Rule 14H in Hawaii. The next-gen Envoy-S offers revenue-grade metering of solar production, consumption monitoring, and integrated Wi-Fi. The company also moved into home energy storage with its Storage System featuring an AC Battery, a modular, 1.2kWh lithium-iron phosphate offering aimed at residential users that is part of a Home Energy Solution. The Home Energy Solution will launch in Australia in mid-2016.

					Welcome to Enphase home solar solutions											Here's why Enphase belongs on your roof.














More power from your panels                
Enphase Microinverters get more power from the same solar panels. This means greater savings for you, and greater environmental impact. Each microinverter connects to a single solar panel so, unlike other types of inverters,  if there is a dirty, shaded or problem panel, the rest of the system keeps running smoothly.













See your solar savings                
You can learn how much power your system is producing at any time from your phone or computer. Watch it work and know you’re saving money, as well as the planet.













Knowledge is power                
Real-time data lets you know if there’s a problem with your system, and how it performs day to day and with weather changes. 













Solar your home will love                
Every part of the Enphase system is designed to have minimal impact on your home. Wiring and equipment stay out of sight, and our low voltage design boosts safety. 













Reliability, inside and out                
Enphase products are designed to deliver more power, but also with less need for maintenance and repairs. Our state-of-the-art testing facility is tough on our equipment,  so we know it will stand up to the test of time.

					Enphase Microinverters											What's underneath the panels makes all the difference.














Enphase Microinverters





Overview




Quality




Comparing Inverters




Microinverter Family




Accessories


















Powerful technology at the heart of the Enphase system.

Solar panels may be on top, but it's the inverter that does all the real work. Choosing an inverter technology is the most critical decision you'll make when going solar. Enphase Microinverters offer the most advanced inverter technology on the market, which means higher production, greater reliability, and unmatched intelligence.








How the Microinverter System works



















	Microinverters





	The solar panels on your roof absorb sunshine in the form of direct current (DC) power. Tucked beneath each panel, a microinverter converts that DC power to alternating current (AC), the form of electricity your home can use.



            Learn more 











	Envoy





	The Envoy is the brains of the system, gathering data from your microinverters and delivering it to Enlighten software. It communicates in the other direction, too, letting your installer pinpoint any issue remotely and delivering updates to your microinverters.


            Learn more 











	MyEnlighten





	MyEnlighten is your window into your home energy. It turns Envoy's data into an easy-to-use interface that lets you track your system's production and see your home energy usage.


            Learn more 









The smarter choice in solar technology.









Higher production, best savings

Enphase microinverters are proven to produce more energy than other technologies.
Microinverters operate independently, so each panel performs to its fullest. One shaded or dirty panel won't affect the rest of the system.
Burst technology lets microinverters produce more at dawn, dusk, and in low-light conditions, for a longer solar day.









More reliable

Because they function independently, microinverters are inherently more reliable:
there's no single point of failure in a microinverter system. Plus, we're obsessive about quality, and our products reflect that.
If one panel goes down, the others won't go down with it.
Enphase microinverters undergo the most rigorous product testing in the industry.
We stand by our products with the industry's highest warranties.









Safer

Microinverters are safer than other inverter technologies.
An all-AC system means no high-voltage DC power on your roof. 
Enphase Microinverters are commonly chosen for schools, since they meet even the strictest government safety requirements.









More cost-effective

In addition to the greater energy savings from higher production, Enphase microinverters are just a better long-term investment.
Enphase microinverters come with a 25-year warranty; string inverters need to be replaced at least once in the lifetime of the system.
Streamlined components make for quicker and less costly installations.
High-quality materials and remote problem-solving save money on repairs. 














A system that fits your needs, now and later.

The Enphase System is flexible, so you can design a system to fit today's budget and energy needs, and expand it later as your needs evolve. Want to add more panels, or a solar battery? With microinverters, it's no problem.



















Higher production, no matter what nature brings.

Maybe your roof isn’t shaded, so you think microinverters aren't for you. Well, think again.
First, every system experiences some shading at some point during the day -- and Enphase tolerates shading better than others. Second, shading is only a part of the story. Think dirt, leaves, scratches, snow….
Third, even if you keep your panels spotlessly clean, wear and tear won’t happen uniformly, and temperature differences occur naturally. No matter what, you’ll deal with panels operating at different levels of efficiency (an occurrence known as module mismatch). And if you’ve got microinverters, you’ll maximize your production in spite of it.







Installation is easy -- just plug and play.











	1. Bolt





	Simple, single-bolt mount to rail or racking.












	2. Plug in to Engage Cable





	Microinverter plugs directly into Engage Cable.












	3. Connect to panel





	Connect the DC leads directly to the microinverter.

"Enphase m215 powering my Sun Edison Panels installed by Infinity Energy In C.A."

They're awesome, I've been installed for 6 months and no problems. Plus online monitoring is So Cool!!! Online access to watch daily production and you get a monthly email that shows your production with carbon offset. Great product and Very Satisfied!!!

"Using this company to monitor my panels"

No issues so far... 1 month on-line.
Gui could be better and updating "System" was difficult.
Not bad and functional.
Did contact them about a minor issue... They responded.
