Take a Sneak Peek Inside the Guide
DATA GROWTH: IT CAN’T BE STOPPED
If there’s one universal truth that pervades all organizations, no matter the size, sector, or specialty, it very well may be this: Data growth is a force to be reckoned with.
As ESG research notes, both primary and secondary/tertiary storage are growing by roughly 35% every year.1 And when you consider that for every 1TB of primary storage, organizations can create between 4TB and 6TB of secondary copies for backup purposes, runaway data growth can quickly push storage into unsustainable territory.

History[edit]




An Iron Mountain Truck


Background[edit]
The company was started by Herman Knaust, who had made his fortune growing and marketing mushrooms.[3] He purchased a depleted iron ore mine and 100 acres (0.40 km2) of land in Livingston, New York for $9,000 in 1936, needing more space to grow his product.[3] By 1950, the mushroom market had shifted, and Knaust was looking for alternative uses for his mine, which he had named "Iron Mountain."
Founding and early years (1951–1970)[edit]
Knaust saw a business opportunity, amidst widespread Cold War fears, in protecting corporate information from nuclear attack and other disasters.
The company was originally known as "Iron Mountain Atomic Storage Corporation;" it opened its first underground "vaults" in 1951 and its first sales office in the Empire State Building, about 125 miles (201 km) south.[4] Iron Mountain's first customer was East River Savings Bank, who brought microfilm copies of deposit records and duplicate signature cards in armored cars for storage in the mountain facility. In 1978, the company opened its first above-ground records-storage facility.
Middle years (1970–2000)[edit]
This first iteration of Iron Mountain was bankrupt by the early 1970s and was wholly acquired by Vincent J. Ryan through his holdings in Schooner Capital Corporation, Boston, Massachusetts. At the time, it consisted of the original facility in Livingston, New York and IMAR (Iron Mountain at Rosendale), a former limestone mine and mushroom cave outside of Kingston, New York. In 1980, it expanded to Rhode Island through the purchase of a former Industrial National Bank (a precursor to FleetBoston) cold site and data tape repository in Glocester, Rhode Island. It had many Fortune 500 clients at the time, and its revenue was in the $6 million range in the early 1980s.
Its breakthrough came in the mid-1980s when it convinced Manufacturer's Hanover Bank to move all its paper records out of Manhattan to an above-ground facility, a former strip mall in Port Ewen, New York. This was the first time that bar codes were used by a records management company to allow real time access to shipped boxes and the documents inside.
During the 1980s, the company expanded beyond New York, opening facilities in New Jersey and throughout New England. In 1988, Iron Mountain extended its reach into 12 more U.S. markets by acquiring Bell & Howell Records Management, Inc.[5]
The firm went public on January 31, 1996. In 1997, Iron Mountain became a leading software escrow company with the acquisition of Data Securities International (DSI).
Expansion and consolidation (2000–present)[edit]




Iron Mountain Vehicle


Since 1980, Iron Mountain grew through acquisitions. Revenue over this period increased from $3 million in 1981 to $2.7 billion at the end of 2007.
In February 2000, Iron Mountain Incorporated announced the completion of its acquisition of Pierce Leahy Corp. (NYSE:PLH) in a stock-for-stock merger valued at approximately $1.1 billion.[6]
In 2004, Iron Mountain formed a digital assets division called "Iron Mountain Digital", following the acquisition of Connected Corporation, a maker of online PC backup software.[7][8][9] A year later, Iron Mountain Digital bought LiveVault, a provider of online backup software for server data.[10] In 2007 Iron Mountain acquired Stratify Inc.,[11] one of the larger e-discovery service providers at the production end of the Electronic Discovery Reference Model (EDRM).[12] The acquired businesses of LiveVault and Stratify Inc. were consolidated into Iron Mountain Digital.
Richard Reese became the company's CEO in 1981, and he concurrently assumed the position of chairman in 1995. He remained in the former position until June 2008, when he was replaced by Bob Brennan, but he remained in the chairman's seat.[13][14] However, the company announced Brennan's departure in April 2011, and Reese resumed his former title.[15]
In February 2010, Iron Mountain acquired a California-based eDiscovery and content archiving software provider, Mimosa Systems. The acquisition too was absorbed into Iron Mountain Digital.[16]
On May 16, 2011, Iron Mountain decided to divest Iron Mountain Digital, which was acquired by the British enterprise search and knowledge management firm Autonomy corporation for $380 million.[17] Shortly thereafter, in August 2011, Hewlett-Packard acquired the Cambridge based Autonomy, and amalgamated the operations of Autonomy (which included Iron Mountain Digital) into HP's enterprise software division.[18]
On May 8, 2012, Iron Mountain expanded its high-security storage facility business through the acquisition of three records storage firms—File House Offsite Record Storage in Fredericksburg, Virginia, and Document Systems Inc. in Columbia, South Carolina and First National Safe Deposit in Philadelphia.[19]
On November 5, 2013, Iron Mountain announced it would be shutting down its Saint John, New Brunswick contact center in 2014. Many of the jobs were transitioned to Convergys.[20]
As of January 1, 2014, Iron Mountain successfully converted to a real estate investment trust after approval of private letter ruling requests by the IRS to classify steel racking structures as qualified real estate assets.[21]
At the end of April 2015, Iron Mountain announced it would acquire Australian data protection services provider Recall Holdings for around $2.2 billion in cash and stock.[22] At the end of March 2016 the Australian Competition & Consumer Commission released a statement saying it would not block the acquisition of Recall pursuant to Iron Mountain's agreement to divest most of its Australian business.[23] At the same time, the Canadian Competition Bureau announced it entered an agreement with Iron Mountain to allow the acquisition as long as Iron Mountain divested records management assets in the markets in which it found the acquisition would limit effective remaining competitors: Toronto, Montreal, Ottawa, Calgary, Edmonton and Vancouver.[24] The US Department of Justice also agreed to allow the acquisition provided Iron Mountain divested records management assets in the 15 markets where Iron Mountain and Recall were two of the top three competitors – these markets include Detroit; Kansas City, Missouri; Charlotte, North Carolina; Durham, North Carolina; Raleigh, North Carolina; Buffalo, New York; Tulsa, Oklahoma; Pittsburgh; Greenville/Spartanburg, South Carolina; Nashville, Tennessee; San Antonio, Texas; Richmond, Virginia; San Diego; Atlanta; and Seattle.[25] Finally, the UK's Competition and Markets Authority approved the acquisition pending an investigation into the acquisition's effect on competition in the UK. In June 2016, the Competition and Markets Authority determined the acquisition would create a "substantial lessening of competition" in Aberdeen and Dundee. In response to this report, Iron Mountain and the Competition and Markets Authority reached an agreement whereby Iron Mountain would sell Recall's existing operations in Aberdeen and Dundee (known as C21 Data Services).[26] On May 2, 2016 Iron Mountain announced the completion of the merger for $2 billion (US), mostly in stock.[27]
In 2016 Fortune magazine listed Iron Mountain at number 729 on its list of the largest 1000 public companies in the United States.[28]
Facilities[edit]
The storage location in Dighton, Massachusetts was once a missile storage battery during the cold war.[citation needed] The best known Iron Mountain storage facility is a high-security storage facility in a former limestone mine at Boyers, Pennsylvania, near the city of Butler in the United States (41°05′35″N 79°54′40″W﻿ / ﻿41.093°N 79.911°W﻿ / 41.093; -79.911). It began storing records in 1954 and was purchased by Iron Mountain in 1998. It is here that Bill Gates stores his Corbis photographic collection in a refrigerated cave 220 feet (67 m) underground.[29] Nearby, the U.S. Office of Personnel Management leases another underground cavern to store, and process government employee retirement papers.[30]
Iron Mountain has additional underground storage facilities in the United States and the rest of the world. It stores the wills of Princess Diana, Charles Dickens, and Charles Darwin.[31] It also stores the original recordings of Frank Sinatra and master recordings from Sony Music Entertainment.[32] Most of the company's over 1,000 storage locations are in above-ground leased warehouse space located near customers.
Recognition[edit]
Security Magazine named Iron Mountain in “Security 500” of 2008, an annual ranking of the United States' 500 most secure companies. Iron Mountain was its industry’s sole representative in the category of business services. Published in the magazine’s November issue, the Security 500[33] ranks companies using several metrics such as the percentage of a company’s revenue spent on security. The survey tracks 16 vertical markets to serve as a benchmarking tool for companies.
Fortune magazine has had Iron Mountain on its list of the “World’s Most Admired Companies” every year from 2006 to 2011.[34][35][36][37][38][39] In its category, "diversified outsourcing services", it has every year come in second behind Aramark. The only exception was 2006, when it also ranked below Convergys.[40][41][42][43][44][45] The industry rankings reflect feedback from executives, directors, and analysts who rated Iron Mountain and industry peers on nine attributes of reputation, from investment value to quality of management.[citation needed]
In April 2009, Iron Mountain's Digital Record Center for Images was recognized as a "Product of the Year" by the Massachusetts Network Communications Council in the "Cloud Computing, Virtualization and Data Warehousing/Storage category".[46]
Data losses[edit]
The company has received media attention for losing or misplacing customer files and data, particularly tapes containing private information such as home addresses and Social Security numbers. In 1997 a mysterious fire destroyed a warehouse just off the New Jersey Turnpike (USA) at Exit 8, full of corporate documents. This was two days after a smaller blaze damaged another warehouse several hundred feet away.[47] Both buildings are owned by Iron Mountain Inc.
In May 2005, Time Warner disclosed that a container of 40 unencrypted backup tapes containing the personal information of 600,000 current and former employees had disappeared while being transported in an Iron Mountain van that made 18 other stops in Manhattan that day. After the loss, Time Warner began encrypting its tapes, and Iron Mountain advised its other clients to do the same.[48][49] A year later, tapes containing personal information for about 17,000 Long Island Rail Road employees were lost while in transit to the railroad's office, along with tapes belonging to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs being shipped in the same vehicle.[50]
In July 2006, a fire completely destroyed a leased six-story company warehouse in London.[51] The paper records of 600 customers,[52] including client files stored by several prominent London law firms, were lost.[53] Also destroyed were the medical records of up to 240,000 patients of Chelsea and Westminster Hospital.[52] The London Fire Brigade later concluded that the fire was caused by arson.[54] One day earlier, a smaller fire believed to have been caused by contractors making roof repairs damaged a company warehouse in Ottawa, Canada.[55]
In August 2007, the company began retrofitting its unmarked vans and trucks with a new security and alarm system using chain of custody technology to reduce the exposure of customer data to possible loss. Among other security features, the system uses radio frequency authentication and real-time tracking capabilities to help prevent "mysterious disappearances" of tapes, or their actual removal from the vehicle, during transit.[56]
A large fire struck Iron Mountain’s document storage warehouse and headquarters in Aprilia, Italy late on Friday November 4, 2011. According to news reports, the entire building was enveloped in flames causing substantial damage to the building and, presumably, to the documents and digital content stored there. Approximately 40 employees worked in the facility but nobody was injured.[57]
On February 5, 2014, an intentional fire[58] completely burned down the company's Buenos Aires warehouse. At least nine firefighters died in the incident while seven others were severely injured.[59]

History[edit]




An Iron Mountain Truck


Background[edit]
The company was started by Herman Knaust, who had made his fortune growing and marketing mushrooms.[3] He purchased a depleted iron ore mine and 100 acres (0.40 km2) of land in Livingston, New York for $9,000 in 1936, needing more space to grow his product.[3] By 1950, the mushroom market had shifted, and Knaust was looking for alternative uses for his mine, which he had named "Iron Mountain."
Founding and early years (1951–1970)[edit]
Knaust saw a business opportunity, amidst widespread Cold War fears, in protecting corporate information from nuclear attack and other disasters.
The company was originally known as "Iron Mountain Atomic Storage Corporation;" it opened its first underground "vaults" in 1951 and its first sales office in the Empire State Building, about 125 miles (201 km) south.[4] Iron Mountain's first customer was East River Savings Bank, who brought microfilm copies of deposit records and duplicate signature cards in armored cars for storage in the mountain facility. In 1978, the company opened its first above-ground records-storage facility.
Middle years (1970–2000)[edit]
This first iteration of Iron Mountain was bankrupt by the early 1970s and was wholly acquired by Vincent J. Ryan through his holdings in Schooner Capital Corporation, Boston, Massachusetts. At the time, it consisted of the original facility in Livingston, New York and IMAR (Iron Mountain at Rosendale), a former limestone mine and mushroom cave outside of Kingston, New York. In 1980, it expanded to Rhode Island through the purchase of a former Industrial National Bank (a precursor to FleetBoston) cold site and data tape repository in Glocester, Rhode Island. It had many Fortune 500 clients at the time, and its revenue was in the $6 million range in the early 1980s.
Its breakthrough came in the mid-1980s when it convinced Manufacturer's Hanover Bank to move all its paper records out of Manhattan to an above-ground facility, a former strip mall in Port Ewen, New York. This was the first time that bar codes were used by a records management company to allow real time access to shipped boxes and the documents inside.
During the 1980s, the company expanded beyond New York, opening facilities in New Jersey and throughout New England. In 1988, Iron Mountain extended its reach into 12 more U.S. markets by acquiring Bell & Howell Records Management, Inc.[5]
The firm went public on January 31, 1996. In 1997, Iron Mountain became a leading software escrow company with the acquisition of Data Securities International (DSI).
Expansion and consolidation (2000–present)[edit]




Iron Mountain Vehicle


Since 1980, Iron Mountain grew through acquisitions. Revenue over this period increased from $3 million in 1981 to $2.7 billion at the end of 2007.
In February 2000, Iron Mountain Incorporated announced the completion of its acquisition of Pierce Leahy Corp. (NYSE:PLH) in a stock-for-stock merger valued at approximately $1.1 billion.[6]
In 2004, Iron Mountain formed a digital assets division called "Iron Mountain Digital", following the acquisition of Connected Corporation, a maker of online PC backup software.[7][8][9] A year later, Iron Mountain Digital bought LiveVault, a provider of online backup software for server data.[10] In 2007 Iron Mountain acquired Stratify Inc.,[11] one of the larger e-discovery service providers at the production end of the Electronic Discovery Reference Model (EDRM).[12] The acquired businesses of LiveVault and Stratify Inc. were consolidated into Iron Mountain Digital.
Richard Reese became the company's CEO in 1981, and he concurrently assumed the position of chairman in 1995. He remained in the former position until June 2008, when he was replaced by Bob Brennan, but he remained in the chairman's seat.[13][14] However, the company announced Brennan's departure in April 2011, and Reese resumed his former title.[15]
In February 2010, Iron Mountain acquired a California-based eDiscovery and content archiving software provider, Mimosa Systems. The acquisition too was absorbed into Iron Mountain Digital.[16]
On May 16, 2011, Iron Mountain decided to divest Iron Mountain Digital, which was acquired by the British enterprise search and knowledge management firm Autonomy corporation for $380 million.[17] Shortly thereafter, in August 2011, Hewlett-Packard acquired the Cambridge based Autonomy, and amalgamated the operations of Autonomy (which included Iron Mountain Digital) into HP's enterprise software division.[18]
On May 8, 2012, Iron Mountain expanded its high-security storage facility business through the acquisition of three records storage firms—File House Offsite Record Storage in Fredericksburg, Virginia, and Document Systems Inc. in Columbia, South Carolina and First National Safe Deposit in Philadelphia.[19]
On November 5, 2013, Iron Mountain announced it would be shutting down its Saint John, New Brunswick contact center in 2014. Many of the jobs were transitioned to Convergys.[20]
As of January 1, 2014, Iron Mountain successfully converted to a real estate investment trust after approval of private letter ruling requests by the IRS to classify steel racking structures as qualified real estate assets.[21]
At the end of April 2015, Iron Mountain announced it would acquire Australian data protection services provider Recall Holdings for around $2.2 billion in cash and stock.[22] At the end of March 2016 the Australian Competition & Consumer Commission released a statement saying it would not block the acquisition of Recall pursuant to Iron Mountain's agreement to divest most of its Australian business.[23] At the same time, the Canadian Competition Bureau announced it entered an agreement with Iron Mountain to allow the acquisition as long as Iron Mountain divested records management assets in the markets in which it found the acquisition would limit effective remaining competitors: Toronto, Montreal, Ottawa, Calgary, Edmonton and Vancouver.[24] The US Department of Justice also agreed to allow the acquisition provided Iron Mountain divested records management assets in the 15 markets where Iron Mountain and Recall were two of the top three competitors – these markets include Detroit; Kansas City, Missouri; Charlotte, North Carolina; Durham, North Carolina; Raleigh, North Carolina; Buffalo, New York; Tulsa, Oklahoma; Pittsburgh; Greenville/Spartanburg, South Carolina; Nashville, Tennessee; San Antonio, Texas; Richmond, Virginia; San Diego; Atlanta; and Seattle.[25] Finally, the UK's Competition and Markets Authority approved the acquisition pending an investigation into the acquisition's effect on competition in the UK. In June 2016, the Competition and Markets Authority determined the acquisition would create a "substantial lessening of competition" in Aberdeen and Dundee. In response to this report, Iron Mountain and the Competition and Markets Authority reached an agreement whereby Iron Mountain would sell Recall's existing operations in Aberdeen and Dundee (known as C21 Data Services).[26] On May 2, 2016 Iron Mountain announced the completion of the merger for $2 billion (US), mostly in stock.[27]
In 2016 Fortune magazine listed Iron Mountain at number 729 on its list of the largest 1000 public companies in the United States.[28]
Facilities[edit]
The storage location in Dighton, Massachusetts was once a missile storage battery during the cold war.[citation needed] The best known Iron Mountain storage facility is a high-security storage facility in a former limestone mine at Boyers, Pennsylvania, near the city of Butler in the United States (41°05′35″N 79°54′40″W﻿ / ﻿41.093°N 79.911°W﻿ / 41.093; -79.911). It began storing records in 1954 and was purchased by Iron Mountain in 1998. It is here that Bill Gates stores his Corbis photographic collection in a refrigerated cave 220 feet (67 m) underground.[29] Nearby, the U.S. Office of Personnel Management leases another underground cavern to store, and process government employee retirement papers.[30]
Iron Mountain has additional underground storage facilities in the United States and the rest of the world. It stores the wills of Princess Diana, Charles Dickens, and Charles Darwin.[31] It also stores the original recordings of Frank Sinatra and master recordings from Sony Music Entertainment.[32] Most of the company's over 1,000 storage locations are in above-ground leased warehouse space located near customers.
Recognition[edit]
Security Magazine named Iron Mountain in “Security 500” of 2008, an annual ranking of the United States' 500 most secure companies. Iron Mountain was its industry’s sole representative in the category of business services. Published in the magazine’s November issue, the Security 500[33] ranks companies using several metrics such as the percentage of a company’s revenue spent on security. The survey tracks 16 vertical markets to serve as a benchmarking tool for companies.
Fortune magazine has had Iron Mountain on its list of the “World’s Most Admired Companies” every year from 2006 to 2011.[34][35][36][37][38][39] In its category, "diversified outsourcing services", it has every year come in second behind Aramark. The only exception was 2006, when it also ranked below Convergys.[40][41][42][43][44][45] The industry rankings reflect feedback from executives, directors, and analysts who rated Iron Mountain and industry peers on nine attributes of reputation, from investment value to quality of management.[citation needed]
In April 2009, Iron Mountain's Digital Record Center for Images was recognized as a "Product of the Year" by the Massachusetts Network Communications Council in the "Cloud Computing, Virtualization and Data Warehousing/Storage category".[46]
Data losses[edit]
The company has received media attention for losing or misplacing customer files and data, particularly tapes containing private information such as home addresses and Social Security numbers. In 1997 a mysterious fire destroyed a warehouse just off the New Jersey Turnpike (USA) at Exit 8, full of corporate documents. This was two days after a smaller blaze damaged another warehouse several hundred feet away.[47] Both buildings are owned by Iron Mountain Inc.
In May 2005, Time Warner disclosed that a container of 40 unencrypted backup tapes containing the personal information of 600,000 current and former employees had disappeared while being transported in an Iron Mountain van that made 18 other stops in Manhattan that day. After the loss, Time Warner began encrypting its tapes, and Iron Mountain advised its other clients to do the same.[48][49] A year later, tapes containing personal information for about 17,000 Long Island Rail Road employees were lost while in transit to the railroad's office, along with tapes belonging to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs being shipped in the same vehicle.[50]
In July 2006, a fire completely destroyed a leased six-story company warehouse in London.[51] The paper records of 600 customers,[52] including client files stored by several prominent London law firms, were lost.[53] Also destroyed were the medical records of up to 240,000 patients of Chelsea and Westminster Hospital.[52] The London Fire Brigade later concluded that the fire was caused by arson.[54] One day earlier, a smaller fire believed to have been caused by contractors making roof repairs damaged a company warehouse in Ottawa, Canada.[55]
In August 2007, the company began retrofitting its unmarked vans and trucks with a new security and alarm system using chain of custody technology to reduce the exposure of customer data to possible loss. Among other security features, the system uses radio frequency authentication and real-time tracking capabilities to help prevent "mysterious disappearances" of tapes, or their actual removal from the vehicle, during transit.[56]
A large fire struck Iron Mountain’s document storage warehouse and headquarters in Aprilia, Italy late on Friday November 4, 2011. According to news reports, the entire building was enveloped in flames causing substantial damage to the building and, presumably, to the documents and digital content stored there. Approximately 40 employees worked in the facility but nobody was injured.[57]
On February 5, 2014, an intentional fire[58] completely burned down the company's Buenos Aires warehouse. At least nine firefighters died in the incident while seven others were severely injured.[59]

At the end of April 2015, Iron Mountain announced it would acquire Australian data protection services provider Recall Holdings for around $2.2 billion in cash and stock.[22] At the end of March 2016 the Australian Competition & Consumer Commission released a statement saying it would not block the acquisition of Recall pursuant to Iron Mountain's agreement to divest most of its Australian business.[23] At the same time, the Canadian Competition Bureau announced it entered an agreement with Iron Mountain to allow the acquisition as long as Iron Mountain divested records management assets in the markets in which it found the acquisition would limit effective remaining competitors: Toronto, Montreal, Ottawa, Calgary, Edmonton and Vancouver.[24] The US Department of Justice also agreed to allow the acquisition provided Iron Mountain divested records management assets in the 15 markets where Iron Mountain and Recall were two of the top three competitors – these markets include Detroit; Kansas City, Missouri; Charlotte, North Carolina; Durham, North Carolina; Raleigh, North Carolina; Buffalo, New York; Tulsa, Oklahoma; Pittsburgh; Greenville/Spartanburg, South Carolina; Nashville, Tennessee; San Antonio, Texas; Richmond, Virginia; San Diego; Atlanta; and Seattle.[25] Finally, the UK's Competition and Markets Authority approved the acquisition pending an investigation into the acquisition's effect on competition in the UK. In June 2016, the Competition and Markets Authority determined the acquisition would create a "substantial lessening of competition" in Aberdeen and Dundee. In response to this report, Iron Mountain and the Competition and Markets Authority reached an agreement whereby Iron Mountain would sell Recall's existing operations in Aberdeen and Dundee (known as C21 Data Services).[26] On May 2, 2016 Iron Mountain announced the completion of the merger for $2 billion (US), mostly in stock.[27]
In 2016 Fortune magazine listed Iron Mountain at number 729 on its list of the largest 1000 public companies in the United States.[28]
Facilities[edit]
The storage location in Dighton, Massachusetts was once a missile storage battery during the cold war.[citation needed] The best known Iron Mountain storage facility is a high-security storage facility in a former limestone mine at Boyers, Pennsylvania, near the city of Butler in the United States (41°05′35″N 79°54′40″W﻿ / ﻿41.093°N 79.911°W﻿ / 41.093; -79.911). It began storing records in 1954 and was purchased by Iron Mountain in 1998. It is here that Bill Gates stores his Corbis photographic collection in a refrigerated cave 220 feet (67 m) underground.[29] Nearby, the U.S. Office of Personnel Management leases another underground cavern to store, and process government employee retirement papers.[30]
Iron Mountain has additional underground storage facilities in the United States and the rest of the world. It stores the wills of Princess Diana, Charles Dickens, and Charles Darwin.[31] It also stores the original recordings of Frank Sinatra and master recordings from Sony Music Entertainment.[32] Most of the company's over 1,000 storage locations are in above-ground leased warehouse space located near customers.
Recognition[edit]
Security Magazine named Iron Mountain in “Security 500” of 2008, an annual ranking of the United States' 500 most secure companies. Iron Mountain was its industry’s sole representative in the category of business services. Published in the magazine’s November issue, the Security 500[33] ranks companies using several metrics such as the percentage of a company’s revenue spent on security. The survey tracks 16 vertical markets to serve as a benchmarking tool for companies.
Fortune magazine has had Iron Mountain on its list of the “World’s Most Admired Companies” every year from 2006 to 2011.[34][35][36][37][38][39] In its category, "diversified outsourcing services", it has every year come in second behind Aramark. The only exception was 2006, when it also ranked below Convergys.[40][41][42][43][44][45] The industry rankings reflect feedback from executives, directors, and analysts who rated Iron Mountain and industry peers on nine attributes of reputation, from investment value to quality of management.[citation needed]
In April 2009, Iron Mountain's Digital Record Center for Images was recognized as a "Product of the Year" by the Massachusetts Network Communications Council in the "Cloud Computing, Virtualization and Data Warehousing/Storage category".[46]
Data losses[edit]
The company has received media attention for losing or misplacing customer files and data, particularly tapes containing private information such as home addresses and Social Security numbers. In 1997 a mysterious fire destroyed a warehouse just off the New Jersey Turnpike (USA) at Exit 8, full of corporate documents. This was two days after a smaller blaze damaged another warehouse several hundred feet away.[47] Both buildings are owned by Iron Mountain Inc.
In May 2005, Time Warner disclosed that a container of 40 unencrypted backup tapes containing the personal information of 600,000 current and former employees had disappeared while being transported in an Iron Mountain van that made 18 other stops in Manhattan that day. After the loss, Time Warner began encrypting its tapes, and Iron Mountain advised its other clients to do the same.[48][49] A year later, tapes containing personal information for about 17,000 Long Island Rail Road employees were lost while in transit to the railroad's office, along with tapes belonging to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs being shipped in the same vehicle.[50]
In July 2006, a fire completely destroyed a leased six-story company warehouse in London.[51] The paper records of 600 customers,[52] including client files stored by several prominent London law firms, were lost.[53] Also destroyed were the medical records of up to 240,000 patients of Chelsea and Westminster Hospital.[52] The London Fire Brigade later concluded that the fire was caused by arson.[54] One day earlier, a smaller fire believed to have been caused by contractors making roof repairs damaged a company warehouse in Ottawa, Canada.[55]
In August 2007, the company began retrofitting its unmarked vans and trucks with a new security and alarm system using chain of custody technology to reduce the exposure of customer data to possible loss. Among other security features, the system uses radio frequency authentication and real-time tracking capabilities to help prevent "mysterious disappearances" of tapes, or their actual removal from the vehicle, during transit.[56]
A large fire struck Iron Mountain’s document storage warehouse and headquarters in Aprilia, Italy late on Friday November 4, 2011. According to news reports, the entire building was enveloped in flames causing substantial damage to the building and, presumably, to the documents and digital content stored there. Approximately 40 employees worked in the facility but nobody was injured.[57]
On February 5, 2014, an intentional fire[58] completely burned down the company's Buenos Aires warehouse. At least nine firefighters died in the incident while seven others were severely injured.[59]

History[edit]




An Iron Mountain Truck


Background[edit]
The company was started by Herman Knaust, who had made his fortune growing and marketing mushrooms.[3] He purchased a depleted iron ore mine and 100 acres (0.40 km2) of land in Livingston, New York for $9,000 in 1936, needing more space to grow his product.[3] By 1950, the mushroom market had shifted, and Knaust was looking for alternative uses for his mine, which he had named "Iron Mountain."
Founding and early years (1951–1970)[edit]
Knaust saw a business opportunity, amidst widespread Cold War fears, in protecting corporate information from nuclear attack and other disasters.
The company was originally known as "Iron Mountain Atomic Storage Corporation;" it opened its first underground "vaults" in 1951 and its first sales office in the Empire State Building, about 125 miles (201 km) south.[4] Iron Mountain's first customer was East River Savings Bank, who brought microfilm copies of deposit records and duplicate signature cards in armored cars for storage in the mountain facility. In 1978, the company opened its first above-ground records-storage facility.
Middle years (1970–2000)[edit]
This first iteration of Iron Mountain was bankrupt by the early 1970s and was wholly acquired by Vincent J. Ryan through his holdings in Schooner Capital Corporation, Boston, Massachusetts. At the time, it consisted of the original facility in Livingston, New York and IMAR (Iron Mountain at Rosendale), a former limestone mine and mushroom cave outside of Kingston, New York. In 1980, it expanded to Rhode Island through the purchase of a former Industrial National Bank (a precursor to FleetBoston) cold site and data tape repository in Glocester, Rhode Island. It had many Fortune 500 clients at the time, and its revenue was in the $6 million range in the early 1980s.
Its breakthrough came in the mid-1980s when it convinced Manufacturer's Hanover Bank to move all its paper records out of Manhattan to an above-ground facility, a former strip mall in Port Ewen, New York. This was the first time that bar codes were used by a records management company to allow real time access to shipped boxes and the documents inside.
During the 1980s, the company expanded beyond New York, opening facilities in New Jersey and throughout New England. In 1988, Iron Mountain extended its reach into 12 more U.S. markets by acquiring Bell & Howell Records Management, Inc.[5]
The firm went public on January 31, 1996. In 1997, Iron Mountain became a leading software escrow company with the acquisition of Data Securities International (DSI).
Expansion and consolidation (2000–present)[edit]




Iron Mountain Vehicle


Since 1980, Iron Mountain grew through acquisitions. Revenue over this period increased from $3 million in 1981 to $2.7 billion at the end of 2007.
In February 2000, Iron Mountain Incorporated announced the completion of its acquisition of Pierce Leahy Corp. (NYSE:PLH) in a stock-for-stock merger valued at approximately $1.1 billion.[6]
In 2004, Iron Mountain formed a digital assets division called "Iron Mountain Digital", following the acquisition of Connected Corporation, a maker of online PC backup software.[7][8][9] A year later, Iron Mountain Digital bought LiveVault, a provider of online backup software for server data.[10] In 2007 Iron Mountain acquired Stratify Inc.,[11] one of the larger e-discovery service providers at the production end of the Electronic Discovery Reference Model (EDRM).[12] The acquired businesses of LiveVault and Stratify Inc. were consolidated into Iron Mountain Digital.
Richard Reese became the company's CEO in 1981, and he concurrently assumed the position of chairman in 1995. He remained in the former position until June 2008, when he was replaced by Bob Brennan, but he remained in the chairman's seat.[13][14] However, the company announced Brennan's departure in April 2011, and Reese resumed his former title.[15]
In February 2010, Iron Mountain acquired a California-based eDiscovery and content archiving software provider, Mimosa Systems. The acquisition too was absorbed into Iron Mountain Digital.[16]
On May 16, 2011, Iron Mountain decided to divest Iron Mountain Digital, which was acquired by the British enterprise search and knowledge management firm Autonomy corporation for $380 million.[17] Shortly thereafter, in August 2011, Hewlett-Packard acquired the Cambridge based Autonomy, and amalgamated the operations of Autonomy (which included Iron Mountain Digital) into HP's enterprise software division.[18]
On May 8, 2012, Iron Mountain expanded its high-security storage facility business through the acquisition of three records storage firms—File House Offsite Record Storage in Fredericksburg, Virginia, and Document Systems Inc. in Columbia, South Carolina and First National Safe Deposit in Philadelphia.[19]
On November 5, 2013, Iron Mountain announced it would be shutting down its Saint John, New Brunswick contact center in 2014. Many of the jobs were transitioned to Convergys.[20]
As of January 1, 2014, Iron Mountain successfully converted to a real estate investment trust after approval of private letter ruling requests by the IRS to classify steel racking structures as qualified real estate assets.[21]
At the end of April 2015, Iron Mountain announced it would acquire Australian data protection services provider Recall Holdings for around $2.2 billion in cash and stock.[22] At the end of March 2016 the Australian Competition & Consumer Commission released a statement saying it would not block the acquisition of Recall pursuant to Iron Mountain's agreement to divest most of its Australian business.[23] At the same time, the Canadian Competition Bureau announced it entered an agreement with Iron Mountain to allow the acquisition as long as Iron Mountain divested records management assets in the markets in which it found the acquisition would limit effective remaining competitors: Toronto, Montreal, Ottawa, Calgary, Edmonton and Vancouver.[24] The US Department of Justice also agreed to allow the acquisition provided Iron Mountain divested records management assets in the 15 markets where Iron Mountain and Recall were two of the top three competitors – these markets include Detroit; Kansas City, Missouri; Charlotte, North Carolina; Durham, North Carolina; Raleigh, North Carolina; Buffalo, New York; Tulsa, Oklahoma; Pittsburgh; Greenville/Spartanburg, South Carolina; Nashville, Tennessee; San Antonio, Texas; Richmond, Virginia; San Diego; Atlanta; and Seattle.[25] Finally, the UK's Competition and Markets Authority approved the acquisition pending an investigation into the acquisition's effect on competition in the UK. In June 2016, the Competition and Markets Authority determined the acquisition would create a "substantial lessening of competition" in Aberdeen and Dundee. In response to this report, Iron Mountain and the Competition and Markets Authority reached an agreement whereby Iron Mountain would sell Recall's existing operations in Aberdeen and Dundee (known as C21 Data Services).[26] On May 2, 2016 Iron Mountain announced the completion of the merger for $2 billion (US), mostly in stock.[27]
In 2016 Fortune magazine listed Iron Mountain at number 729 on its list of the largest 1000 public companies in the United States.[28]

It is here that Bill Gates stores his Corbis photographic collection in a refrigerated cave 220 feet (67 m) underground.[29] Nearby, the U.S. Office of Personnel Management leases another underground cavern to store, and process government employee retirement papers.[30]
Iron Mountain has additional underground storage facilities in the United States and the rest of the world. It stores the wills of Princess Diana, Charles Dickens, and Charles Darwin.[31] It also stores the original recordings of Frank Sinatra and master recordings from Sony Music Entertainment.[32] Most of the company's over 1,000 storage locations are in above-ground leased warehouse space located near customers.

History[edit]




An Iron Mountain Truck


Background[edit]
The company was started by Herman Knaust, who had made his fortune growing and marketing mushrooms.[3] He purchased a depleted iron ore mine and 100 acres (0.40 km2) of land in Livingston, New York for $9,000 in 1936, needing more space to grow his product.[3] By 1950, the mushroom market had shifted, and Knaust was looking for alternative uses for his mine, which he had named "Iron Mountain."
Founding and early years (1951–1970)[edit]
Knaust saw a business opportunity, amidst widespread Cold War fears, in protecting corporate information from nuclear attack and other disasters.
The company was originally known as "Iron Mountain Atomic Storage Corporation;" it opened its first underground "vaults" in 1951 and its first sales office in the Empire State Building, about 125 miles (201 km) south.[4] Iron Mountain's first customer was East River Savings Bank, who brought microfilm copies of deposit records and duplicate signature cards in armored cars for storage in the mountain facility. In 1978, the company opened its first above-ground records-storage facility.
Middle years (1970–2000)[edit]
This first iteration of Iron Mountain was bankrupt by the early 1970s and was wholly acquired by Vincent J. Ryan through his holdings in Schooner Capital Corporation, Boston, Massachusetts. At the time, it consisted of the original facility in Livingston, New York and IMAR (Iron Mountain at Rosendale), a former limestone mine and mushroom cave outside of Kingston, New York. In 1980, it expanded to Rhode Island through the purchase of a former Industrial National Bank (a precursor to FleetBoston) cold site and data tape repository in Glocester, Rhode Island. It had many Fortune 500 clients at the time, and its revenue was in the $6 million range in the early 1980s.
Its breakthrough came in the mid-1980s when it convinced Manufacturer's Hanover Bank to move all its paper records out of Manhattan to an above-ground facility, a former strip mall in Port Ewen, New York. This was the first time that bar codes were used by a records management company to allow real time access to shipped boxes and the documents inside.
During the 1980s, the company expanded beyond New York, opening facilities in New Jersey and throughout New England. In 1988, Iron Mountain extended its reach into 12 more U.S. markets by acquiring Bell & Howell Records Management, Inc.[5]
The firm went public on January 31, 1996. In 1997, Iron Mountain became a leading software escrow company with the acquisition of Data Securities International (DSI).
Expansion and consolidation (2000–present)[edit]




Iron Mountain Vehicle


Since 1980, Iron Mountain grew through acquisitions. Revenue over this period increased from $3 million in 1981 to $2.7 billion at the end of 2007.
In February 2000, Iron Mountain Incorporated announced the completion of its acquisition of Pierce Leahy Corp. (NYSE:PLH) in a stock-for-stock merger valued at approximately $1.1 billion.[6]
In 2004, Iron Mountain formed a digital assets division called "Iron Mountain Digital", following the acquisition of Connected Corporation, a maker of online PC backup software.[7][8][9] A year later, Iron Mountain Digital bought LiveVault, a provider of online backup software for server data.[10] In 2007 Iron Mountain acquired Stratify Inc.,[11] one of the larger e-discovery service providers at the production end of the Electronic Discovery Reference Model (EDRM).[12] The acquired businesses of LiveVault and Stratify Inc. were consolidated into Iron Mountain Digital.
Richard Reese became the company's CEO in 1981, and he concurrently assumed the position of chairman in 1995. He remained in the former position until June 2008, when he was replaced by Bob Brennan, but he remained in the chairman's seat.[13][14] However, the company announced Brennan's departure in April 2011, and Reese resumed his former title.[15]
In February 2010, Iron Mountain acquired a California-based eDiscovery and content archiving software provider, Mimosa Systems. The acquisition too was absorbed into Iron Mountain Digital.[16]
On May 16, 2011, Iron Mountain decided to divest Iron Mountain Digital, which was acquired by the British enterprise search and knowledge management firm Autonomy corporation for $380 million.[17] Shortly thereafter, in August 2011, Hewlett-Packard acquired the Cambridge based Autonomy, and amalgamated the operations of Autonomy (which included Iron Mountain Digital) into HP's enterprise software division.[18]
On May 8, 2012, Iron Mountain expanded its high-security storage facility business through the acquisition of three records storage firms—File House Offsite Record Storage in Fredericksburg, Virginia, and Document Systems Inc. in Columbia, South Carolina and First National Safe Deposit in Philadelphia.[19]
On November 5, 2013, Iron Mountain announced it would be shutting down its Saint John, New Brunswick contact center in 2014. Many of the jobs were transitioned to Convergys.[20]
As of January 1, 2014, Iron Mountain successfully converted to a real estate investment trust after approval of private letter ruling requests by the IRS to classify steel racking structures as qualified real estate assets.[21]
At the end of April 2015, Iron Mountain announced it would acquire Australian data protection services provider Recall Holdings for around $2.2 billion in cash and stock.[22] At the end of March 2016 the Australian Competition & Consumer Commission released a statement saying it would not block the acquisition of Recall pursuant to Iron Mountain's agreement to divest most of its Australian business.[23] At the same time, the Canadian Competition Bureau announced it entered an agreement with Iron Mountain to allow the acquisition as long as Iron Mountain divested records management assets in the markets in which it found the acquisition would limit effective remaining competitors: Toronto, Montreal, Ottawa, Calgary, Edmonton and Vancouver.[24] The US Department of Justice also agreed to allow the acquisition provided Iron Mountain divested records management assets in the 15 markets where Iron Mountain and Recall were two of the top three competitors – these markets include Detroit; Kansas City, Missouri; Charlotte, North Carolina; Durham, North Carolina; Raleigh, North Carolina; Buffalo, New York; Tulsa, Oklahoma; Pittsburgh; Greenville/Spartanburg, South Carolina; Nashville, Tennessee; San Antonio, Texas; Richmond, Virginia; San Diego; Atlanta; and Seattle.[25] Finally, the UK's Competition and Markets Authority approved the acquisition pending an investigation into the acquisition's effect on competition in the UK. In June 2016, the Competition and Markets Authority determined the acquisition would create a "substantial lessening of competition" in Aberdeen and Dundee. In response to this report, Iron Mountain and the Competition and Markets Authority reached an agreement whereby Iron Mountain would sell Recall's existing operations in Aberdeen and Dundee (known as C21 Data Services).[26] On May 2, 2016 Iron Mountain announced the completion of the merger for $2 billion (US), mostly in stock.[27]
In 2016 Fortune magazine listed Iron Mountain at number 729 on its list of the largest 1000 public companies in the United States.[28]
Facilities[edit]
The storage location in Dighton, Massachusetts was once a missile storage battery during the cold war.[citation needed] The best known Iron Mountain storage facility is a high-security storage facility in a former limestone mine at Boyers, Pennsylvania, near the city of Butler in the United States (41°05′35″N 79°54′40″W﻿ / ﻿41.093°N 79.911°W﻿ / 41.093; -79.911). It began storing records in 1954 and was purchased by Iron Mountain in 1998. It is here that Bill Gates stores his Corbis photographic collection in a refrigerated cave 220 feet (67 m) underground.[29] Nearby, the U.S. Office of Personnel Management leases another underground cavern to store, and process government employee retirement papers.[30]
Iron Mountain has additional underground storage facilities in the United States and the rest of the world. It stores the wills of Princess Diana, Charles Dickens, and Charles Darwin.[31] It also stores the original recordings of Frank Sinatra and master recordings from Sony Music Entertainment.[32] Most of the company's over 1,000 storage locations are in above-ground leased warehouse space located near customers.
Recognition[edit]
Security Magazine named Iron Mountain in “Security 500” of 2008, an annual ranking of the United States' 500 most secure companies. Iron Mountain was its industry’s sole representative in the category of business services. Published in the magazine’s November issue, the Security 500[33] ranks companies using several metrics such as the percentage of a company’s revenue spent on security. The survey tracks 16 vertical markets to serve as a benchmarking tool for companies.
Fortune magazine has had Iron Mountain on its list of the “World’s Most Admired Companies” every year from 2006 to 2011.[34][35][36][37][38][39] In its category, "diversified outsourcing services", it has every year come in second behind Aramark. The only exception was 2006, when it also ranked below Convergys.[40][41][42][43][44][45] The industry rankings reflect feedback from executives, directors, and analysts who rated Iron Mountain and industry peers on nine attributes of reputation, from investment value to quality of management.[citation needed]
In April 2009, Iron Mountain's Digital Record Center for Images was recognized as a "Product of the Year" by the Massachusetts Network Communications Council in the "Cloud Computing, Virtualization and Data Warehousing/Storage category".[46]
Data losses[edit]
The company has received media attention for losing or misplacing customer files and data, particularly tapes containing private information such as home addresses and Social Security numbers. In 1997 a mysterious fire destroyed a warehouse just off the New Jersey Turnpike (USA) at Exit 8, full of corporate documents. This was two days after a smaller blaze damaged another warehouse several hundred feet away.[47] Both buildings are owned by Iron Mountain Inc.
In May 2005, Time Warner disclosed that a container of 40 unencrypted backup tapes containing the personal information of 600,000 current and former employees had disappeared while being transported in an Iron Mountain van that made 18 other stops in Manhattan that day. After the loss, Time Warner began encrypting its tapes, and Iron Mountain advised its other clients to do the same.[48][49] A year later, tapes containing personal information for about 17,000 Long Island Rail Road employees were lost while in transit to the railroad's office, along with tapes belonging to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs being shipped in the same vehicle.[50]
In July 2006, a fire completely destroyed a leased six-story company warehouse in London.[51] The paper records of 600 customers,[52] including client files stored by several prominent London law firms, were lost.[53] Also destroyed were the medical records of up to 240,000 patients of Chelsea and Westminster Hospital.[52] The London Fire Brigade later concluded that the fire was caused by arson.[54] One day earlier, a smaller fire believed to have been caused by contractors making roof repairs damaged a company warehouse in Ottawa, Canada.[55]
In August 2007, the company began retrofitting its unmarked vans and trucks with a new security and alarm system using chain of custody technology to reduce the exposure of customer data to possible loss. Among other security features, the system uses radio frequency authentication and real-time tracking capabilities to help prevent "mysterious disappearances" of tapes, or their actual removal from the vehicle, during transit.[56]
A large fire struck Iron Mountain’s document storage warehouse and headquarters in Aprilia, Italy late on Friday November 4, 2011. According to news reports, the entire building was enveloped in flames causing substantial damage to the building and, presumably, to the documents and digital content stored there. Approximately 40 employees worked in the facility but nobody was injured.[57]
On February 5, 2014, an intentional fire[58] completely burned down the company's Buenos Aires warehouse. At least nine firefighters died in the incident while seven others were severely injured.[59]

Apr 20, 2015   Product Marketing Interview Anonymous Interview Candidate in Boston, MANo OfferNeutral ExperienceAverage InterviewApplicationI applied through college or university. The process took a week. I interviewed at Iron Mountain Inc (Boston, MA) in March 2015.InterviewI applied online through my university website. Then, next, I got an email immediately the next day that I applied asking if I was available for an in person interview. I drove to the office in Boston. The in person interview was only 30 minutes long. They were right on time getting me in and it only actually lasted 30 minutes. The interviewer asked me to explain myself, there weren't many actual "typical" questions. They got back to me the next day with my results.Interview Questions No specific questions, asked me to explain myself.

May 18, 2009 How will you position the current legacy product considering that the next generation product is beginning to be offered.1 AnswerThe answer they were looking for was that the legacy product should be offerred tothe price sensitive customers, while migrating other customers to the more expensive, advanced newer product.Product Marketing Manager at Juniper Networks was asked... Nov 8, 2011 Can you tell me how you would manage a new product launch? 1 AnswerI would put together a launch plan with input from the necessary teams: Product Management, Engineering, Testing, Support. A part of the plan would include schedule, key stakeholders and responsible team members, and key deliverables and milestones with dates. I would arrange weekly meetings leading up to the launch date and manage the progress on each of the milestones and deliverables by coordinating with each of the team members.Product Marketing Manager at Aruba Networks was asked... Sep 12, 2013 Tell me the thought process and planning as well as the execution in the launching a product x or creating a positioning for a product/feature Y. 1 AnswerStart with the target customer, the use case, and the differentiation of this product.Product Marketing Manager at Hewlett-Packard was asked... Apr 27, 2011 "if Germans were the tallest people in the world how would you prove it"50 AnswersI first asked how would we define germans. People who were born in germany. People who lived in Germany. From East or West. The food they ate (had to do likely w/ $) and stuff like that.Man...poorly constructed question! We only have to prove 'it' if Germans ARE the tallest people in the world. Therefore, if we are forced to prove it, it must be the case that Germans are actually the tallest people! We could also randomly sample heights from people considered German and compare it to a random sampling of heights from people in non-German groups we are interested in. Assuming we have resources to get large enough samples and can account for a variety of biases, some ANOVA and other stats stuff can get us the answer.Ask yourself, who you are supposed to prove it to? The question was for a Product Marketing Manager interview; could it perhaps be that what they want is to see how you take something you *know* to be true (you have to believe that the products you are trying to sell are great products to be a really great salesperson), and convince everyone else of that fact?Show More ResponsesThere's a lot of poorly defined stuff in here: Define Germans. (Include Polish or French post WWII rapes?) Define 'prove'. (Leave no doubt, or is a statistical rejection of the null hypothesis acceptable, and if so, by what percentage?) Define 'tallest'. (Include children under the age of 2?)I would check out the Guinness Book of World Records and find out the nationality of the tallest person in the world.I'd probably say to the interviewer 'As long as no one can disprove that Germans are the tallest people, then you really don't have to prove anything.'"Germans were the tallest people in the world" is a statement that is considered to be a statement that is made on basis of some Statical analysis data point then that's the proof. In given statement, Conclusion is made prior to the proof.It would be an appropriate question if there was no 'if' in a question,Take height measurements of a statistically significant sample of Germans as well as all other groups to be considered. If the average height of the German sample is the highest, you've proven what was to be proven.I can think of two different ways to get a quick insight into this: 1. Survey McDonalds. Get them to count the heights of the first 50 people in the door on a given day, then compare that information. I haven't done the confidence math on this. 2. Call the Levi Strauss company and ask them what distribution of pants they sell around the world. Bluejeans are sold just about everywhere, so except for the possibility that leg length isn't an exact indicator of overall height (I, for example, have short legs for my height) they should be able to tell you how tall people are in any given country based on the pants they sell there.You can prove that there is a statistically significant difference between 2 classes using a 2-tailed students T test. It just requires the average and standard deviation of each class. Instead of just giving up and saying we can't define who is German. Pick a definition of what a "German" is , take their average height and standard deviation, and compare it to the average and standard deviation of the rest of the world using the 2-tailed students T test (or other similar statistical tests). Collecting height data may not be realistic for 1 person but if the interviewer asked you the question with no other stipulations, then you can fill in the rest. Pretend you have unlimited resources. Just assume the data you need is known or can be looked up. I think the interviewer wants to hear you think through a problem that displays you're creativity and resourcefulness. Just saying it's not possible won't get you the job."I'm sorry - I feel uncomfortable with Holocaust jokes..."Other than measuring the height directly, another possible solution is to use the "side effects" of taller people, e.g. higher ceilings, larger shoes or clothing, or maybe it's all in the DNA? Anyway, just call up an international retailer and ask if they make things bigger for Germans.Show More ResponsesI would answer with the following procedure: 1- Get the height of the shortest "German" 2- Get the height of the tallest "non-German" if the shortest german is taller than the tallest non-german, then this argument is true. otherwise, it's false.DMV records (or likewise entities) are available all over the world.@Research Engineer wrote "Pick a definition of what a "German"" Well, if we are going to pick our own definition, mine would be: 1) Everyone who is over 6'6" is German; 2) Everyone under 6'6" is not German. QED.I would look to the medical community, CDC or AMA, possibly the UN.The proposed answers seem rather convoluted. You would have to prove it by statistics. The statistics indicate that the Dutch are the tallest people with an average height of 6 feet for men. Most of western (and eastern) Europe have surpassed the United States in height due to the US fast food compulsion and inequitable health care.If we already know that Germans are the tallest people in the world, then we don't have to prove it.This is a problem solving question - straight up, pure and simple. You take the question as a hypothesis and explain how you would go about proving the veracity of the statement. If stats exist on the internet that's probably the fastest way to answer the question. If there was time an money you could pay for secondary research (if it exists) or primary research. The interviewer only wants to see how logical you are - not to actually solve the problem or question the thesis statement.I have to agree: Driver Licenses are a good source for height information. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15464003Gather as large of a sample of German and non-German heights. Employ a t-test/z-test to accept or reject the hypothesis at a given confidence interval.Pull out my phone and access www.guinnessworldrecords.com This one was easy. HP needs to come up with more challenging questions if they are to prosper in 2012. HP's HR interviewer is now answering similar questions since being fired for lack of defining what he meant by a German. tsk tskShow More ResponsesTheir cars would be the biggest if they were indeed the tallest.Sorry, assumptions cannot be proved, BUT let me try to convince you. This will strike some conversation, just enough time for you to think on how to convince. I am sure, all this Questions do not have a perfect answer. They want to check your thought process, patience.The average length of mattress in Germany is higher than the other countries, then Germans are the tallest.Before I do that, how will the answer best help us solve our business challenges?Germany has the largest number of stores that sell shoes in larger sizes(11 inch and above). And foot size is directly proportional to the height of person......hence germans are proved to be the tallest.If Germans "were" the tallest people in the world, I would have to prove it by determining what group "is" the tallest people in the world.No need - the Dutch are the tallest, apparently.If you work with the definition that the country with the tallest median person are the tallest nation, you can get to a solution algorithmically (assumptions: no multiple citizenships allowed, median on an even number of persons is the one at positon n/2+0.5 for simplicity. We have lots of time to do this, so we don't care about getting to a result quick) (1) get everybody in a room. (2) ask people to stand together by nations and form a line each (3) repeat for each line until nobody swaps (3-1) ask each person to swap with their right neighbour if that neighbour is shorter (4) for each line (should be sorted by height now) (4-1) ask the smallest and the largest person of each nation to leave (4-2) repeat until only one or two people are left. (5) for each of the pairs left send the shorter one home (6) repeat until only one person is left (6-1) ask the remaining persons to form random pairs. Don't worry if one person is left standing alone. (6-2) send all the shorter persons in each pair home. (6-3) If the remainin person is German - you have proved it.I would respond by saying that this is a profiling question and would prefer not to answer.DMV records don't include heights in many countries of the world (including Germany). Which kind of puts the kibosh on this approach.... http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_driving_licenceShow More ResponsesI think average height for adults is available from census or other survays per country. Now if you consider a person living in Germany German (citizenship/residence vs nationality), the highest number of your list should be Germany, there's the proofIn the hypothetical world of the question, it is a fact that the Germans are the tallest. A fact is a statement that can be proven. So the fact was already proven at some point (in the make believe world). Answer is a question: How did the person who proved it before do it?In Science, there is no absolute "truth." A hypothesis is not "proven" per se. You can support your hypothesis with positive data but you can never really prove it scientifically. Conclusion: your theory that "Germans are the tallest people" can either be supported or negated but not proven.Use arrest, warrant or inmate records. They do have height information because that is an identifying characteristic, just like Scars, Marks or Tattoos.Just check the most selled pant size.By taking the average height into consideration of every country ..it would be proved that germans were tallest in the world....Analogy: If A=B, how would you prove it? Answer: I don't need to. Because you already said that A=B.Measure the height of the shortest doorway in a railway station or a common everyday place and compare to other nations.Germany is known for the automobile manufacturing giants like BMW etc. Just measure the the distance from the seat beneath to the rooftop above. If it is greater than any other car manufactured, then certainly an average German's height would account as the tallest.since in the qn. they have used "if", i wud answer that, "how can i prove you right or wrong, if you itself not sure about the fact"Show More ResponsesTape measureDMV reportI would show the average height of Germans compared to the average height of the rest of the worldLook upI would Google it.First you have to define your population, then you have to establish a plan for your research. What method are you going to use to gather data, and also define your sampling plan- the bigger the sample group the more reliable. In market research there are several methods to analyze your data establishing your sampling procedure. We can use deductive or inductive research.Classic puzzle question with aim to understand a persons thinking process and structure. The interviewer's original question drill-down approach or any of the statistical approaches are the only correct ways to answer such a problem solving question. The others -- like pant sizes, shoe sizes -- are interesting leading questions to lead to the solution. You never simply answer such a case question without drilling down on the use cases first. Apparently the other responders either failed math / proofs, are not anywhere near the product spectrum, or are random trolls jumping on a "hot" question. Sadly they downvoted the best answer and the only one that probably would have passed the interview.Product Marketing Manager at VMware was asked... Sep 26, 2010 Who are our competitors?4 Answersthey have a lot.Most notably, Parallels comes to mind, but I think there may be one or two smaller players.Microsoft, Citrix, Oracle/SunShow More ResponsesDitto experience interviewing with them for a similar position...they did not bother even responding to mails/phone calls requesting for updates...learnt from an acquaintance over there that they had quietly moved on with another candidate...helps a lot if you have strong internal backing....lack of professionalism is obviously loud and clear...i would probably attribute it to arrogance for having quickly moved up the ranks as a successful silicon valley company...Principal Product Marketing Manager at Atlassian was asked... Jul 5, 2013 If John Locke from lost was running for president of the island what would be his campaign slogan.3 AnswersI said I would never attack the oposite position but lay landmines of them. "John Locke, the reliable and visionary choice for the future.""Don't ever tell us what we can't do. Ever."Learn how to walk again before we can run!Product Marketing Manager at Microsoft was asked... Dec 21, 2009 There are 3 cars travelling in a road from point a to pont b, you have to pick one car, which one do you choose?4 AnswersThis question will help the interviewer understand your decision-making ability, decision making process, and ultimately your decisiveness & confidence.It depends... If the road between points a and b is accident prone, I'd want to be in a Volvo. If the road is pretty straightforward and I need to get to my destination in a hurry...the fastest sports car. If it is a scenic road and I am on a vacation...a convertible.I choosed safety car and everything insideShow More ResponsesIt depends on the goal. Am I trying to get some place as quickly as possible? Am I content to get there in one piece no matter how much time? Am I more interested in the journey? This question is about thought process.Director Product Marketing at Seagate Technology was asked... Jun 21, 2012 What should our strategy be for XYZ1 AnswerI find that companies use this question and others like it to be tell-tale signs that a company is using the interview process to get ideas or competitive information without ever hiring for the role. Ialways have to determine how to answer this as a true interview question without crossing the line into gift giving or a breach of confidentiality.Product Marketing Manager at Hewlett-Packard was asked... Jul 25, 2014 Give me a search optimization plan for telecommunications service.1 AnswerI was confused by the question because the service didn't seem to fit with HP's product/service line. I asked several clarifying questions about target audience, current marketing vehicles used, competitive landscape, available budget. Before I could get to a proposed plan, the hiring manager told me that he was satisfied with my thought process.Product Marketing at Citrix was asked...

It consists of a miniature transmitter housed in a small ultra light, aerodynamic, totally balanced module called the HideRider which is easily attached to the arrow. Upon Impact the HideRider transmitter  is released from the arrow and the unit starts to transmit. The hunter, using the compact receiver can find and recover the downed game.

Take a Sneak Peek Inside the Guide
DATA GROWTH: IT CAN’T BE STOPPED
If there’s one universal truth that pervades all organizations, no matter the size, sector, or specialty, it very well may be this: Data growth is a force to be reckoned with.
As ESG research notes, both primary and secondary/tertiary storage are growing by roughly 35% every year.1 And when you consider that for every 1TB of primary storage, organizations can create between 4TB and 6TB of secondary copies for backup purposes, runaway data growth can quickly push storage into unsustainable territory.
