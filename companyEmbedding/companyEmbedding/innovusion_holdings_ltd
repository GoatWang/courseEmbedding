Innovision Financial Server provides the 
                                   foundation for retail, wealth management, institutional and back office applications based on 
                                   industry-standard XML protocols, such as Open Financial Exchange (OFX) and Interactive Financial
                                   Exchange (IFX).
                                 



Innovision Health Server standardizes access to 
                                   disparate clinical and administrative systems through HL7-XML

NEPAL Developer is a powerful tool used for protocol

                                   the scope of existing protocols, NEPAL Developer is the solution.
                                 










                                   NEPAL is a platform that provides a framework for building and executing protocol-based systems.
                                 






                                   Using NEPAL, high-level protocol development and deployment becomes a process of assembling 
                                   reusable components to efficiently and securely deliver information to a variety of 
                                   endpoints.
