Issues Special Letter to ShareholdersAccesswireJanuary 11, 2017ReblogShareTweetShareDENVER, CO / ACCESSWIRE / January 11, 2017 / Grow Solutions Holdings, Inc. (GRSO) (the "Company" or "Grow Solutions"), a company involved in the development and distribution of high demand products for cultivation, processing and consumption of legal cannabis, today issued the following special letter to shareholders from its President, Jeffrey Beverly, to the shareholders of Grow Solutions Holdings, Inc.:2016 was a very exciting year for Grow Solutions and the cannabis industry, overall. After successfully introducing our model in 2015, we saw our business plan validated as our 2015 revenues of $2.7 million increased to $6.4 million for 2016, representing 137% year over year growth, and exceeding our 2016 projections.As we move forward in 2017, we expect to increase revenues approximately 200% to approximately $20 million through organic growth, the launching of our new businesses, and growth from acquisitions planned for the year.We believe the Company is well positioned to continue growing in each of our verticals - supporting and benefiting from the growth of the legal cannabis industry across the United States, and globally, while remaining a company that does not "touch the leaf."The Year at Grow Solutions Holdings, Inc., a summary:ONE LOVE GARDEN SUPPLY, LLC. ("One Love") One Love, our wholly owned subsidiary, currently operates three organic and hydroponic garden supply stores in Colorado. One Love also sells products online through Amazon and eBay. One Love's revenues more than doubled from the previous year, and we expect it to grow at that rate in 2017. As we previously announced, One Love has agreed to acquire two additional stores in Oregon and Florida. These two stores did over $2 million in combined revenues in 2016 and, consistent with the growth of our previous retail acquisitions, we expect them to double in 2017.We look forward to closing these acquisitions in the next 30 days. We also have plans to acquire multiple stores in strategic locations nationally (Nevada, California, the Mid-West, the East Coast, Texas), positioning One Love as a national brand for consumer and commercial legal cannabis growers. One Love also plans to relaunch its website in the first quarter of 2017 with a fully integrated online store. We plan for this site to allow customers to place orders, receive discounts, and track orders for delivery.In addition to the consumer facing site, we plan for the One Love platform to support motivated sales reps to sell growing supplies across the US and Canada. Ryan Clement, Executive Vice President of Grow Solutions, believes there is "unlimited growth opportunities for our One Love stores in 2017."FUTURE TECH ("FT") In the third quarter of 2016, we launched our retail products division under the Future Tech brand. Future Tech designs proprietary products for sale to accessory distributors, smoke shops, dispensaries, head shops, and others in the industry. We believe the divisions Roztek Equinox Rosin Press and other proprietary products will continue to be well received in the market. We expect sales in 2017 to exceed the $3 Million-dollar mark.For Roztek and a list of featured products, please visit: http://www.roztekofficial.com"Future Tech is continuing to develop proprietary products that service the cannabis customer," Joshua Wexler, Vice President of Grow Solutions, commented, adding, "Future Tech's ability to quickly develop and manufacturer quality products for the legal cannabis consumer gives the company a competitive advantage."Future Tech has plans to acquire a distributor in the space and has begun the due diligence process.FIVE SEASONS GREENHOUSE ("Five Seasons")This past November we launched the Greenhouse brand in Las Vegas. Five Seasons provides custom greenhouses to cannabis growers. We believe greenhouses are one of the fastest growth components of the nascent cannabis industry and are excited to be in the greenhouse space as more states approve or expand cannabis growth and sale for medicinal and adult use.Five Seasons positioned itself to capitalize on this growth opportunity while limiting capital risk exposure. Five Seasons focuses on leveraging their expertise to develop deal flow and expects to close its first two projects this quarter. Grow Solutions expects Five Seasons to exceed $7 million in revenue in 2017.Read MoreJOBGROW ("JG")In 2016, Grow also successfully partnered with recruiter.com to establish jobgrow.com. Recruiter.com is the world's largest online recruiter, with over 3 million user members. Recruiter.com believes the cannabis industry is one of the fastest area of employment growth and believes that Jobgrow is perfectly situated to capitalize on that growth.Jobgrow is the first employment site for the legal cannabis industry to partner with a mainstream employment website. The subsidiary will enable employers, employees, and recruiters to fill needed positions in the cannabis industry online.In addition to the recruiter functionality on the Jobgrow site, Jobgrow is developing groundbreaking functions that will expand traffic and users to the Jobgrow site. Grow Solutions expects jobgrow.com to launch at the end of the first quarter.GROW TECH ("GT") Grow Solutions is fortunate to have brought together an experienced team with knowledge in all areas of the legal cannabis industry. The Grow Solutions team has been working with manufacturing partners in Spain and China to develop our own line of lights, nutrients, and other products used by growers in the legal cannabis industry, and we expect to launch these lines in the third and fourth quarter of 2017. Our strategy is to develop and brand our own proprietary products for sale through distributors, and of course, our own One Love stores.GROW CONSULTING ("GC") Finally, the Grow Solutions team will also be leveraging their experience to develop a consultancy team to assist others in taking advantage of the enormous opportunities of cannabis legalization. With eight more states legalizing or expanding cannabis in this past election, the Company's expertise is in demand, and Grow Solutions is providing services to clients including, among others, support with: licensing, growing, dispensary management, and compliance.Grow Solutions has been contacted by groups seeking licensing in Arkansas, Pennsylvania, and California in the past 30 days and believes this division is well positioned to generate revenue in 2017, as the market expands across the country.Our View on the Legal Cannabis Industry Those of you who have had an opportunity to read my recent editorials on MarketWatch and CNBC know that I am excited about the opportunities in this business. For those of you that have not, I invite you to take the time to see how we at Grow Solutions think about this emerging sector:MarketWatch: http://www.marketwatch.com/story/how-to-make-money-from-marijuana-without-ever-touching-a-plant-2016-11-22CNBC: http://www.cnbc.com/2016/12/19/why-pot-industry-will-keep-growing-under-trump-commentary.htmlThe legal cannabis industry continues to grow at an amazing rate. In November of 2016, eight states voted to approve or expand their medical or adult use laws. California, Maine, Nevada, and Massachusetts approved adult use of cannabis, while Florida, Arkansas, North Dakota, and Montana approved or expanded medicinal use of cannabis.As Troy Dayton, CEO of Arcview, recently stated: "You will not find another multi-billion-dollar market growing at 25 percent anywhere in the world that is not already filled with multi-national companies and institutional investors. That's part of what makes the cannabis industry such a unique opportunity for investors and entrepreneurs."We could not agree more. Grow Solutions has gone from model to revenue producing, and we look forward to being in an industry that allows us to exceed our projections.In 2017, we plan to continue our campaign of aggressive expansion nationwide. And as we begin 2017, I want to take a moment to thank the Grow Solutions team for their great work this past year, and to thank each of you for your continued support.Thank you,Jeffrey Beverly President, Grow Solutions Holdings, Inc. http://www.growsolutionsinc.comGrow Solutions Facebook Page: https://www.facebook.com/GrowSolGRSO Grow Solutions Twitter Feed: https://twitter.com/GrowSolGRSO Grow Solutions Stock Twits page: https://stocktwits.com/growinc Jeff Beverlys Public Facebook Page: https://www.facebook.com/jeffwbeverly Jeff Beverlys Public Twitter Feed: https://twitter.com/CannaExecAbout Grow Solutions Holdings, Inc.Grow Solutions Holdings, Inc. is a holding company that is publicly traded on the OTCQB market, under the symbol "GRSO".

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.
