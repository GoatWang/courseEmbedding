History[edit]
StreetShares Inc. launched in 2014 by Mark L. Rockefeller, Mickey Konson, and Ben Shiflet.[1] StreetShares investors include global microfinance company, ACCION International,[2] Washington D.C. area community bankers, military veteran investors, Harvard Business School angel investors, and Capital One alumni.[3][4]
In March 2015, StreetShares announced commitments from private investment firms Direct Lending Investments and Community Investment Management, as well as Eagle Bank Corp for more than $200 million in funding to back loans made on StreetShares.[5]
In April 2015, StreetShares was named Best Investment in the 2015 global Harvard Business School New Venture Competition, an alumni competition sponsored by Harvard Business School’s Rock Center for Entrepreneurship and Social Enterprise Initiative. The award was chosen by a global panel of Harvard judges.[6][7]
Business model[edit]
StreetShares offers 3- to 36-month term business loans up to $100,000. Applicants must be U.S. citizens or permanent residents, in business for at least one year, earning revenue, incorporated or LLC, and have a business guarantor. StreetShares charges a pre-disclosed one-time origination fee based on term length, risk and loan amount.[8] StreetShares investments are available to qualified investor members with an established StreetShares account.[9][10][11][12][13]
Reception[edit]
StreetAuthority stated that the StreetShares auction model drives down costs and may preview the biggest competitive threat to popular alternative lender OnDeck.[14] According to Entrepreneur Magazine contributor and Small Business Development Center Director, Kedma Ough, StreetShares is considered a top resource for small businesses owned by military veterans.[15] StreetShares has been described by the Washington Business Journal as “Shark Tank meets eBay” for small business loans.[16] According to NerdWallet contributor Jackie Zimmermann StreetShares is "Fast and Veteran Friendly".[17]

WASHINGTON, March 23, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- The StreetShares Foundation announced today three winners of its monthly Veteran Small Business Awards. Winners will receive awards of $5,000, $3,000 and $2,000, supported by JPMorgan Chase & Co. 
March Winners








1st Place: Tom Cox, Army Veteran, Co-Founder of Candl (Atlanta, Ga.)
2nd Place: Brian Wood, Army Veteran, CEO of Good Shepherd Defense and Training (Morton, Ill.)
3rd Place: Charles Miller, Army Veteran, Founder/Designer of Charles Miller Brand Denim (Washington, DC)
Tom Cox, CEO and Co-founder of Candl, has more than 20 years of experience in communications technology. Candl's mission is to make connectivity accessible to people around the world. Tom and Co-Founder Jason Talley came up with the idea after meeting a Syrian refugee who said, "Staying connected is more important than food and shelter."
Candl connects world travelers and refugees with cellular data or WiFi through a hardware device and software products. Tom and Jason plan to donate 50 percent of the veteran award funds to a nonprofit supporting refugees.
Brian Wood, CEO of Good Shepherd Defense and Training, started his small business after receiving low-quality civilian firearms training. As a recent combat veteran, he wanted to provide a more personalized training course for Illinois residents getting their concealed carry license. As a Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Business, Brian provides not only firearms training but also self-defense courses. "We're creating shepherds who could be mothers or fathers protecting their families," Brian said. 
Charles Miller, Founder and Designer of Charles Miller Brand Denim (CMBD), created high quality apparel for the traveling professional, who could be government contractors, business owners, photographers, etc. As a member of the National Guard and an Equal Opportunity leader, Charles believes in creating a community of collaboration and mentorship among creatives. CMBD is veteran-owned and made in the USA. Denim is sourced in North Carolina and manufactured in Los Angeles.

StreetShares Secures $200M For Veteran-Owned Small Businesses

		  Leading Investment Funds and Community Bank Partner with Growing Marketplace Lender

WASHINGTON, March 11, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- StreetShares, the peer-to-peer (P2P) lending marketplace for small business loans, today announced commitments from Direct Lending Investments, Community Investment Management (CIM) and Eagle Bank Corp for more than $200 million in funding to back loans on the StreetShares marketplace, with a focus on funding veteran-owned small businesses. 
Direct Lending Investments, a business loan investment fund, and CIM, an impact investment asset management firm, will fund $200 million in small business loans over a four year period. Eagle Bank Corp, a community bank in Maryland, Virginia and Washington, D.C., opened a warehouse line for StreetShares.  
"Marketplace lending is exploding," Direct Lending Investments President Brendan Ross (@brendan_ross) said. "Our mission is to put money to work fueling healthy small businesses. We are excited about this business partnership with StreetShares and the unique business owners they serve."
"StreetShares provides responsible and transparent financing to underserved small businesses to drive economic growth and job creation," CIM Managing Partner Jacob Haar said. "We believe their innovative approach to lending and focus on veteran-owned small businesses creates significant long-term value for borrowers, local communities and investors, and we are pleased to partner with them."
Direct Lending Investments, CIM and Eagle Bank Corp join StreetShares' current investor members, comprised of qualified individual investors and investment funds that bid to back portions of small business loan requests on StreetShares. The StreetShares marketplace combines the lowest bids into a single loan for the small business, a technique designed to decrease the borrower's cost to the lowest possible rate. 
The majority of StreetShares loan recipients are small businesses owned by U.S. military veterans. StreetShares has formed the nation's largest coalition of veteran-focused small business, entrepreneurship and service organizations. StreetShares' exclusive partners serve a collective membership of more than two million U.S. military veterans. 
Mark L. Rockefeller (@markrockefeller), an Iraq war veteran and former finance lawyer at Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy LLP, and Mickey Konson, former head of small business credit for Capital One and previously with McKinsey & Co., launched StreetShares in 2014. StreetShares recently welcomed to its Board of Advisors consumer protection pioneer Raj Date, former head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, along with SoFi founding team member, Pete Hartigan, and former Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army, General George Casey. 
StreetShares is an affinity-based, peer to peer (P2P) small business lending marketplace that connects small business owners with qualified retail and institutional investors. Investors compete in an online auction to fund portions of the requested loan, and StreetShares blends the lowest bids into a single loan. StreetShares membership is open to all small business owners. StreetShares is located outside of Washington, D.C.

Online lender StreetShares helps fill a void for businesses that are starting to find their financial footing.
Though StreetShares uses a combination of traditional and alternative underwriting practices, the lender focuses primarily on cash flow as an indicator of your business’s ability to repay the loan. If you have $25,000 in revenue and are growing, with a year or more in business and a personal credit score of 600 or more, you may qualify for financing through StreetShares.
The company offers 3- to 36-month term loans from $2,000 to $100,000 and a line of credit from $5,000 to $100,000. With annual percentage rates for both products at 9% to 40%, StreetShares offers competitive rates, often helping small-business owners acquire funds to meet working capital needs, purchase inventory or open a franchise.
StreetShares also recently launched a contract financing product to specifically target small businesses with government contracts. Once a contract is secured, StreetShares will advance you 80% to 90% of the invoice, up to $500,000 per contract. After being reimbursed by a government agency or commercial corporation if you’re a subcontractor, StreetShares will then pass along the remaining balance to you, minus fees. APRs range from 12% to 25%. There are no minimum revenue or credit score requirements to qualify, but you can’t have any liens on your business.
StreetShares takes a different spin on the peer-to-peer lending model, which connects borrowers with investors. The company uses its “affinity-based lending” strategy to match borrowers with investors who share similar characteristics, such as U.S. military veterans and female entrepreneurs.

Reasons to use StreetShares
Community-based lending: Connecting the borrower to investors who have similar passions or interests is a selling point for StreetShares, because the borrower feels a responsibility to those who put up the funds. “You, in essence, tap into positive peer pressure,” co-founder and CEO Mark Rockefeller says, “and the borrowers are less inclined to be late on a payment or default on that loan.” It takes some of the risk out of lending, he continues, and less risk results in lower APRs for borrowers.
Entrepreneurs who are military veterans, in particular, have benefited from the company’s affinity-group approach. Rockefeller, a veteran himself, says he recalls seeing payday lenders lining the streets around military bases, preying on young service members. When starting his company, Rockefeller aimed to help veterans finance their small businesses and avoid similar lending traps, partnering with organizations including the American Legion and the National Veteran-Owned Business Association.

But StreetShares has expanded beyond veterans: It has successfully matched businesses based on other characteristics, including gender and location.
Access to capital for new businesses: Finding loans for businesses with low revenue can be tricky, but StreetShares offers loans to companies that have been in business for just one year and pull in $25,000 in annual revenue. But if you’re among the few who hit the six-month mark and already have $100,000 in revenue, you’re also eligible to apply for a term loan. (Learn more details about the application process.)
No prepayment fee: Borrowers can pay back their loans early, with no prepayment penalties. If your company is young, there’s a good chance you’ll alter your financing plan as your business changes, says Peter Somerville, director of investor relations. “We’ve talked to business owners who are being choked to death by prepayment fees,” he says. Regardless of the length of your loan, StreetShares offers the flexibility of paying it back immediately.
Where StreetShares falls short
Funding limitations: Though StreetShares offers term loans and lines of credit up to $100,000, the maximum amount you can qualify for is 20% of your annual revenue. If you make $200,000 a year, that limits you to a maximum loan of $40,000. You may need to look elsewhere to get financing for big projects, such as a major expansion.
Limited reach: In response to market demand, StreetShares applies for permission to lend on a state-by-state basis. At the moment, it does not provide loans to businesses in North Dakota, South Dakota, Vermont, Rhode Island, Wyoming, Oregon, Montana, Nevada, or Alaska. If you operate a sole proprietorship, you can’t use StreetShares if you live in Delaware, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, Washington, D.C., or Wisconsin (as of January 2017).
There are also a few industry limitations. StreetShares does not lend to construction contractors and those who will use the loan to flip homes or other real estate (although real estate management is OK). Neither does it lend to law firms or tax preparation or accounting firms — unless the business belongs to a certified public accountant.
Weekly payments: You’ll pay back your loan with automatic weekly deductions from your bank account. Although some borrowers may find that convenient, others looking for semimonthly or monthly payments may struggle with the lack of flexibility. If you have uneven cash flow, you may also find this repayment option inconvenient.

You're ready to get your new business off the ground and may already have discovered that finding financing can be a challenge. We've rounded up some strategies to help you get your company launched.



Options for startups 




Because you have strong personal credit, you could qualify for a line of credit through BlueVine or OnDeck that would help you meet daily expenses and maintain inventory. If you've been in business at least a year and have at least $100,000 in annual revenue, consider OnDeck, whose maximum APR is lower than BlueVine’s. If your annual revenue starts at $60,000, BlueVine is a better bet. BlueVine also offers invoice factoring, a type of financing that advances you cash based on your unpaid customer invoices.

Microloans and personal loans are good options to finance your inventory and daily expenses if you’re an established business but make less than $25,000 in revenue. Microloans through nonprofits and the SBA usually have low APR and manageable payment terms, but you'd have to deal with stringent requirements. Personal loans are easier to access, but the APR can be higher than with microloans.

Because you deal with a lot of unpaid customer invoices, consider BlueVine and Fundbox financing to help meet everyday expenses. They each provide a cash advance against outstanding invoices. BlueVine has a higher cash-advance cap of $2 million, compared with Fundbox’s $100,000. BlueVine is a good bet if you have at least $120,000 in annual revenue and your customers have strong credit. If you’re a young business with limited revenue, consider Fundbox, which does not require a minimum revenue or personal credit score. You must, however, have at least six months of activity in an online accounting software such as QuickBooks to qualify for Fundbox.

OnDeck and Kabbage are good options when you need cash for everyday expenses and inventory but your personal credit score still needs some work. If you have at least $100,000 in annual revenue and a personal credit score of 500 or more, you may qualify for OnDeck’s term loan. For businesses with lower revenue, consider Kabbage, which also does not require a minimum personal credit score. You’ll get high APRs with both lenders. You should turn to these options mainly for short-term needs or emergencies and only if you're sure you have the cash flow to cover the financing costs.

Because you're just starting out and your personal credit score is below 600, your best bet is microloans through nonprofit lenders or the U.S. Small Business Administration. The downside is these are "micro" amounts of money, usually no more than $50,000. However, many microlenders help businesses grow and establish better credit. SBA microloans generally have an APR of 8% to 8.5% and manageable repayment terms. Successfully repaying microloans will boost your credit score and make you eligible for bigger financing.

When you have strong personal credit and a young business with a lot of unpaid customer invoices, BlueVine and Fundbox are good financing options. Both offer invoice factoring at similar costs. Where they differ: minimum revenue and minimum credit score. With BlueVine, you need at least $120,000 in revenue and a minimum 530 personal credit score.

As a young entrepreneur with strong personal credit, you may find it easier to qualify for a personal loan or a business credit card. Personal loans and business credit cards are also decent options for startups because approval is based on personal credit score rather than business history. The amount you can finance is typically smaller than with a term loan, however, and you need good credit to qualify. Keep in mind that failure to repay can ruin your personal credit.

Because you have strong credit but your revenue doesn’t quite meet the requirements of most online lenders, consider Fundbox or a business credit card. Business credit cards are a solid option for ongoing working capital and provide quick access to cash, spending rewards and sign-up bonuses. If your business has unpaid customer invoices, you can take a cash advance against those invoices through Fundbox, although you’ll likely pay a higher APR than you would with a business credit card.

Since you have strong personal credit but are still building revenue, you can turn to microloans or personal loans for financing. Microloans are designed especially to help underserved entrepreneurs launch and grow their businesses, but the loans are small and can carry APRs in the low teens. With strong credit, personal loans are another option, but funding typically tops out at $35,000.
