 SharesPost 100 Fund












































SharesPost 100 FundCapture the Upside Potential of Late-stage Venture-backed Companies
The historically attractive return profile of many late-stage venture-backed companies has typically only been available to institutional and high net worth investors. With many high-growth companies staying private longer than ever, a significant portion of their value appreciation typically occurs before their entry into the public markets.
Available for a minimum investment of $2,500 without investor accreditation requirements, the SharesPost 100 Fund, a closed-end interval fund, offers individuals, family offices and institutions an effective means to access the venture-backed asset class. 



Key Benefits





Access
Gain access from an alternative growth investment typically reserved for institutions and endowments.







Diversification
Gain exposure to late-stage venture-backed private companies across multiple industry sectors.**







Liquidity
Enjoy more efficient redemption than direct investments or traditional venture capital funds through the SharesPost 100 Fund’s quarterly redemption program.

Important DisclosureInvestors should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses carefully before investing. For a prospectus with this and other information about the Fund, please download here. Read the prospectus carefully before investing.Investment in the SharesPost 100 Fund involves substantial risk. The Fund is not be suitable for investors who cannot bear the risk of loss of all or part of their investment. The Fund is appropriate only for investors who can tolerate a high degree of risk and do not require a liquid investment. The Fund has no history of public trading and investors should not expect to sell shares other than through the Fund's repurchase policy regardless of how the Fund performs. The Fund does not intend to list its shares on any exchange and does not expect a secondary market to develop.All investing involves risk including the possible loss of principal. Shares in the Fund are highly illiquid, and you may not be able to sell your shares when, or in the amount that, you desire. The Fund intends to primarily invest in securities of private, late-stage, venture-backed growth companies. There are significant potential risks relating to investing in such securities. Because most of the securities in which the Fund invests are not publicly traded, the Fund’s investments will be valued by the Investment Adviser pursuant to fair valuation procedures and methodologies adopted by the Board of Trustees. While the Fund and the Investment Adviser will use good faith efforts to determine the fair value of the Fund’s securities, value will be based on the parameters set forth by the Prospectus. As a consequence, the value of the securities, and therefore the Fund’s NAV, may vary. Due to transfer restrictions and the illiquid nature of the Fund’s investments, you may not be able to sell your investments when you wish to do so. There are significant potential risks associated with investing in venture capital and private equity-backed companies with complex capital structures. The Fund focuses its investments in a limited number of securities, which could subject it to greater risk than that of a larger, more varied portfolio. There is a greater focus in technology securities that could adversely affect the Fund’s performance. If the Fund does not have at least 500 Members for an entire taxable year, you could receive an adverse tax treatment. The Fund’s quarterly repurchase policy may require the Fund to liquidate portfolio holdings earlier than the Investment Adviser would otherwise do so, and may also result in an increase in the Fund’s expense ratio. This is not a complete enumeration of the Fund’s risks. Please read the Fund prospectus for other risk factors related to the Fund, its investment strategy and your investment in the Fund, and other additional details.Certain potential conflicts of interest involving the Fund’s Investment Adviser and its affiliates could impact the Fund’s investment returns and limit the flexibility of the implementation of its investment policies. New investment opportunities that meet the Fund’s investment objectives might not be offered, or otherwise made available to the Fund, due to affiliations between entities related to the Fund. Prospective investors should review the conflicts of interest described in the section entitled “Conflicts of Interest” in the Prospectus prior to making an investment in the Fund.The SharesPost 100 Fund is distributed by FORESIDE FUND SERVICES, LLC**The Fund is subject to a Fundamental Concentration Policy pursuant to which no more than 25% of the value of its assets may be invested in companies in a particular industry or group of industries. Further, holdings in companies that represent more than 5% of value of Fund’s total assets may not exceed more than 50% of the value of Fund’s assets. The SharesPost 100 Fund is a "non-diversified" investment company, and as such, the Fund may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of a single issuer than investment companies that are "diversified."

SharesPost 100 Fund Marks One Year of Growth, Expansion | Business Wire
























































SharesPost 100 Fund Marks One Year of Growth, Expansion




SharesPost 100 List Updated to Reflect Changes in the Market






April 06, 2015 11:34 AM Eastern Daylight Time



MENLO PARK, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--SharesPost, Inc., a leading provider of late-stage private security 
      investment products, celebrates one year of operations for its flagship 
      SharesPost 100 Fund, which invests in late-stage, private, 
      venture-backed companies.
    


      SharesPost launched the Fund to provide retail investors the opportunity 
      to gain investment exposure to private companies that have demonstrated 
      solid growth trajectories and are expected to have a liquidity event 
      within two to four years, typically either an IPO or acquisition. The 
      Fund, a closed end interval fund, is the first of its type, with a 
      minimum investment of only $2,500 and no investor accreditation 
      requirements.
    

      The SharesPost 100 Fund has a one year total return of 26.94%, period 
      ending March 31, 2015. The annualized total return based on the 
      inception date of March 25, 2014 is 27.64%. The Fund is currently 
      invested in 20 companies and has been adding new ones at the approximate 
      pace of one every 10 days.
    

Performance data quoted is based on a purchase at NAV, represents 
      past performance and is no guarantee of future results. NAV performance 
      does not take into consideration the applicable maximum sales charge of 
      5.75% on the fund.. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate 
      so that an investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less 
      than original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the 
      performance data quoted. Some of the Fund’s fees were waived or expenses 
      reimbursed; otherwise, returns would have been lower. The Fund’s total 
      annual expenses are 3.47%. The Adviser has contractually agreed to waive 
      fees and/or reimburse expenses such that the total expenses of the Fund 
      do not exceed 2.50% through May 1, 2016.


      “In crossing the country over the past year, I’ve heard from investors, 
      advisors and other financial professionals who see the value of this 
      asset class in the overall economy, and as part of a retail investor 
      portfolio. Typically, private growth companies have only been available 
      to large institutional investors and the very wealthy. The SharesPost 
      100 Fund democratizes investment access to late-stage, private 
      companies. Two to four years prior to a listing, is a time when many 
      companies often experience significant growth and share price 
      appreciation”, Weber said. “We’ve had a very strong first year and we 
      are looking forward to raising more assets, and adding more holdings to 
      the portfolio in the year to come.”
    

New companies to the SharesPost 100 List


      SharesPost Investment Management, LLC (which manages the SharesPost 100 
      Fund and is a wholly owned subsidiary of SharesPost, Inc.), also 
      announced quarterly changes to the SharesPost 100 List. Three new 
      companies have been added to the SharesPost 100 List this quarter: 
      Houzz, OpenX and Turn. The SharesPost 100 Fund is currently invested in 
      Turn, but not invested in Houzz or OpenX. Visit http://www.sharespost100fund.com 
      for a complete list of the Fund’s holdings. The SharesPost 100 Fund is 
      required to invest a minimum of 80% of its assets in companies on the 
      SharesPost 100 List.
    

      “The community of venture-backed private companies continues to be very 
      strong,” Weber said. “There is a robust group of companies both in and 
      out of Silicon Valley that have solid business models, are growing 
      revenue rapidly and are approaching a liquidity event. We’ve picked what 
      we believe are the best of these companies to add to the SharesPost 100 
      List.” Visit sharespost.com 
      for a complete listing of all the SharesPost 100 List companies.
    

About SharesPost, Inc.


      Since 2009, SharesPost has been the leader and innovator in private 
      securities investments. Based in Silicon Valley, SharesPost has created 
      one of the largest and most active network of shareholders, investors, 
      issuers and entrepreneurs through offering an array of private company 
      products and services. With more than $2 billion in closed transactions, 
      SharesPost provides its clients with unparalleled access to information 
      and liquidity. In 2013, SharesPost announced a joint venture with NASDAQ 
      OMX Group to create the Nasdaq Private Market, the next generation 
      online platform to manage private securities transactions.
    

About the SharesPost 100 Fund


      The SharesPost 100 Fund was launched in March 2014 to provide investors 
      with access to a portfolio of late-stage, private growth companies, an 
      asset class that has traditionally been only available to institutional 
      investors and the very wealthy. Through the company’s growing network of 
      advisors, retail investors can now invest in a ’40 Act registered fund, 
      which target to invest exclusively in late-stage private growth 
      companies. The Fund is distributed by Foreside Fund Services, LLC.
    

Investors should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges 
      and expenses carefully before investing. For a prospectus with this and 
      other information about the Fund, please visit http://www.sharespost.com 
      or call 1-800-834-8707. Please read the prospectus carefully 
      before investing.


      All investing involves risk including the possible loss of principal. 
      Shares in the Fund are highly illiquid, and you may not be able to sell 
      your shares when, or in the amount that, you desire. The Fund intends to 
      primarily invest in securities of private, late-stage, venture-backed 
      growth companies. There are significant potential risks relating to 
      investing in such securities.
    

      Because most of the securities in which the Fund invests are not 
      publicly traded, the Fund’s investments will be valued by the Investment 
      Adviser pursuant to fair valuation procedures and methodologies adopted 
      by the Board of Trustees. While the Fund and the Investment Adviser will 
      use good faith efforts to determine the fair value of the Fund’s 
      securities, value will be based on the parameters set forth by the 
      Prospectus. As a consequence, the value of the securities, and therefore 
      the Fund’s NAV, may vary.
    

      The Fund focuses its investments in a limited number of securities, 
      which could subject it to greater risk than that of a larger, more 
      varied portfolio. There is a greater focus in technology securities that 
      could adversely affect the Fund’s performance. If the Fund does not have 
      at least 500 Members for an entire taxable year, you could receive an 
      adverse tax treatment.
    

      The Fund has a limited redemption policy, which allows investors to 
      redeem their shares each quarter, but total redemptions are limited to 
      5% of the Fund’s market value based on the Net Asset Value (NAV).
    

      Certain potential conflicts of interest involving the Fund’s Investment 
      Adviser and its affiliates could impact the Fund’s investment returns 
      and limit the flexibility of the implementation of its investment 
      policies. Prospective investors should review the conflicts of interest 
      described in the section entitled “Conflicts of Interest” in the 
      Prospectus prior to making an investment in the Fund.

How Venezuela chaos could spark oil rally OPEC has failed to achieve 
              
              Political and economic turmoil in Venezuela could fuel a rise in oil prices—something the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, despite it’s efforts to cut back production, hasn’t been able to do.

Important DisclosureInvestors should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses carefully before investing. For a prospectus with this and other information about the Fund, please download here. Read the prospectus carefully before investing.Investment in the SharesPost 100 Fund involves substantial risk. The Fund is not be suitable for investors who cannot bear the risk of loss of all or part of their investment. The Fund is appropriate only for investors who can tolerate a high degree of risk and do not require a liquid investment. The Fund has no history of public trading and investors should not expect to sell shares other than through the Fund's repurchase policy regardless of how the Fund performs. The Fund does not intend to list its shares on any exchange and does not expect a secondary market to develop.All investing involves risk including the possible loss of principal. Shares in the Fund are highly illiquid, and you may not be able to sell your shares when, or in the amount that, you desire. The Fund intends to primarily invest in securities of private, late-stage, venture-backed growth companies. There are significant potential risks relating to investing in such securities. Because most of the securities in which the Fund invests are not publicly traded, the Fund’s investments will be valued by the Investment Adviser pursuant to fair valuation procedures and methodologies adopted by the Board of Trustees. While the Fund and the Investment Adviser will use good faith efforts to determine the fair value of the Fund’s securities, value will be based on the parameters set forth by the Prospectus. As a consequence, the value of the securities, and therefore the Fund’s NAV, may vary. Due to transfer restrictions and the illiquid nature of the Fund’s investments, you may not be able to sell your investments when you wish to do so. There are significant potential risks associated with investing in venture capital and private equity-backed companies with complex capital structures. The Fund focuses its investments in a limited number of securities, which could subject it to greater risk than that of a larger, more varied portfolio. There is a greater focus in technology securities that could adversely affect the Fund’s performance. If the Fund does not have at least 500 Members for an entire taxable year, you could receive an adverse tax treatment. The Fund’s quarterly repurchase policy may require the Fund to liquidate portfolio holdings earlier than the Investment Adviser would otherwise do so, and may also result in an increase in the Fund’s expense ratio. This is not a complete enumeration of the Fund’s risks. Please read the Fund prospectus for other risk factors related to the Fund, its investment strategy and your investment in the Fund, and other additional details.Certain potential conflicts of interest involving the Fund’s Investment Adviser and its affiliates could impact the Fund’s investment returns and limit the flexibility of the implementation of its investment policies. New investment opportunities that meet the Fund’s investment objectives might not be offered, or otherwise made available to the Fund, due to affiliations between entities related to the Fund. Prospective investors should review the conflicts of interest described in the section entitled “Conflicts of Interest” in the Prospectus prior to making an investment in the Fund.The SharesPost 100 Fund is distributed by FORESIDE FUND SERVICES, LLC**The Fund is subject to a Fundamental Concentration Policy pursuant to which no more than 25% of the value of its assets may be invested in companies in a particular industry or group of industries. Further, holdings in companies that represent more than 5% of value of Fund’s total assets may not exceed more than 50% of the value of Fund’s assets. The SharesPost 100 Fund is a "non-diversified" investment company, and as such, the Fund may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of a single issuer than investment companies that are "diversified."

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
