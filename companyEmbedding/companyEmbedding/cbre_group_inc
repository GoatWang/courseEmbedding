• The company has been piloting a BYOD program to support iOS and Andriod devices in several of its domestic and global offices and plans on fully supporting the new Blackberry BB10 operating system in March 2013.
• In addition, the company also plans on having a Microsoft Azure cloud platform in production by March 2013.
• The company completed its Oracle Exadata and PeopleSoft deployments in 2012, but plans on rolling out PeopleSoft to its Europe Middle East Asia (EMEA) region in 2013, although the platform has already been deployed in the Middle East region.

History[edit]
Following the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, Tucker, Lynch & Coldwell was established on August 27, 1906, and renamed Coldwell, Banker & Company in 1940. In 1989, in a leveraged buyout, CB Commercial was spun off as a privately held company, CB Commercial Real Estate Group Inc., from Coldwell Banker which, after financial difficulties, was later acquired by Realogy.[5] Following CB Commercial’s 1998 acquisition of Richard Ellis International Limited, which traced its roots to London in 1773, the company changed its name to CB Richard Ellis.[citation needed]
In June 2004, CBRE began trading on the New York Stock Exchange. In 2005, CBRE was first recognized as a Fortune 1000 company, and in 2006 it was added to the S&P 500.[6] In late 2006, CBRE merged with Trammell Crow Company in a transaction valued at $2.2 billion.[7]
In February 2011, CBRE won in auction the right to buy ING's real estate investment management business in Europe and Asia (Asia acquisition completed in October 2011)[1] as well as ING's United States–based Clarion Real Estate Securities division, making CBRE the "world's biggest real estate investment manager".[8] The agreement also included ING's listed securities business.[8]
The company changed its name to CBRE Group, Inc. on October 3, 2011.[1] This change was made to bring the formal name of the company into alignment with the well recognized "CBRE" brand.[1]
In January 2017, CBRE Group acquired Floored, a New York-based commercial real estate software company.[9] On January 31, 2017, CBRE Global Investment Partners disclosed that it would invest $450 million in a portfolio of retail property on the West Coast.[10]
Business model[edit]
In real estate, as of 2011, CBRE's approach has been to invest in "properties that need upgrading before they are sold".[8] The company's acquisition of ING Asian real estate assets was consistent with this in that, though ING's approach to real estate has in general been to "invest in properties with a steady cash flow as well as listed real estate securities", the Asian property business included a significant stake in "properties that need upgrading".[8]
Operations[edit]
Real estate investment operations reside in CBRE Investors, a wholly owned subsidiary of CBRE Group.[8] As of 2011, the CBRE Investors unit had US$37,600,000,000 of assets under management.[8]

In January 2017, CBRE Group acquired Floored, a New York-based commercial real estate software company.[9] On January 31, 2017, CBRE Global Investment Partners disclosed that it would invest $450 million in a portfolio of retail property on the West Coast.[10]
Business model[edit]
In real estate, as of 2011, CBRE's approach has been to invest in "properties that need upgrading before they are sold".[8] The company's acquisition of ING Asian real estate assets was consistent with this in that, though ING's approach to real estate has in general been to "invest in properties with a steady cash flow as well as listed real estate securities", the Asian property business included a significant stake in "properties that need upgrading".[8]
Operations[edit]
Real estate investment operations reside in CBRE Investors, a wholly owned subsidiary of CBRE Group.[8] As of 2011, the CBRE Investors unit had US$37,600,000,000 of assets under management.[8]

History[edit]
Following the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, Tucker, Lynch & Coldwell was established on August 27, 1906, and renamed Coldwell, Banker & Company in 1940. In 1989, in a leveraged buyout, CB Commercial was spun off as a privately held company, CB Commercial Real Estate Group Inc., from Coldwell Banker which, after financial difficulties, was later acquired by Realogy.[5] Following CB Commercial’s 1998 acquisition of Richard Ellis International Limited, which traced its roots to London in 1773, the company changed its name to CB Richard Ellis.[citation needed]
In June 2004, CBRE began trading on the New York Stock Exchange. In 2005, CBRE was first recognized as a Fortune 1000 company, and in 2006 it was added to the S&P 500.[6] In late 2006, CBRE merged with Trammell Crow Company in a transaction valued at $2.2 billion.[7]
In February 2011, CBRE won in auction the right to buy ING's real estate investment management business in Europe and Asia (Asia acquisition completed in October 2011)[1] as well as ING's United States–based Clarion Real Estate Securities division, making CBRE the "world's biggest real estate investment manager".[8] The agreement also included ING's listed securities business.[8]
The company changed its name to CBRE Group, Inc. on October 3, 2011.[1] This change was made to bring the formal name of the company into alignment with the well recognized "CBRE" brand.[1]
In January 2017, CBRE Group acquired Floored, a New York-based commercial real estate software company.[9] On January 31, 2017, CBRE Global Investment Partners disclosed that it would invest $450 million in a portfolio of retail property on the West Coast.[10]
Business model[edit]
In real estate, as of 2011, CBRE's approach has been to invest in "properties that need upgrading before they are sold".[8] The company's acquisition of ING Asian real estate assets was consistent with this in that, though ING's approach to real estate has in general been to "invest in properties with a steady cash flow as well as listed real estate securities", the Asian property business included a significant stake in "properties that need upgrading".[8]

CBRE Group Becomes #130 Most Shorted S&P 500 Component, Replacing Illumina
The most recent short interest data has been released for the 04/28/2017 settlement date, and we here at Dividend Channel like to sift through this fresh data and order the underlying components of the S&P 500 by "days to cover." There are a number of ways to look at short data, for example the total number of shares short; but one metric that we find particularly useful is the "days to cover" metric because it considers both the total shares short and the average daily volume of shares typically traded. The number of shares short is then compared to the average daily volume, in order to calculate the total number of trading days it would take to close out all of the open short positions if every share traded represented a short position being closed.
