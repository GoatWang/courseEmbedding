Capital One® Secured Mastercard®


                                            I never had played in credit before, and someone suggested this card to me to build credit for the first time. I've been really satisfied for the most part. They report quickly and accurately, remind me when my bill is due, and the customer service has been kind and thorough....show more

The Business Gold Rewards Card from American Express OPEN


                                            Approached at airport to sign up for this card. Already had a few. Signed up anyway as some pressure applied. Did a status check to see where I sat with the promotion 80% at the spending goal and was told there was no promotion. So I closed all AMEX cards but this one and plan...show more

                                            WalletHub is by far my favorite credit monitoring tool and has made it really easy for me to gain an understanding of my score. Signing up was a very simple process and there were no extra strings attached.

Bed Bath & Beyond® Credit Card


                                            The Bed Bath & Beyond Mastercard was purchased from US Bank in October 2016. My advice: If you have been with US Bank and made the transition to Comenity - check your credit report. Comenity reports twice and never reports the old account closed, so it looks like you have 2...show more

                                            It is my opinion that you would do better to find a different company. In the long run they will charge you plenty and the support is virtually non-existent. They don't even have a working answering system. They are disorganized  and a nightmare to work with.

KingSize Credit Card


                                            It's not the worst, but it's certainly deceptive. I can't trust a company that lies to me for two bucks.

Veridian Credit Union


                                            i love banking with veridian, but the new updated online banking is garbage.10x harder to navigate than before staring from the log in page. Making simple transfers or even looking at accounts is harder and more confusing. bring back the old version.

Grange Insurance


                                            Grange Insurance added a 58% surcharge to our auto policy after a icy bridge weather related accident.  The increase totaled of $1042.00.  No "accident forgiveness" with this company.  Take your business elswhere!

Virginia Credit Union


                                            I was pre qualified for a mortgage loan. They waited until the week before closing and decided that I did not qualify.  This was after i put $500.00 down and paid for the inspection and gave notice to where I was renting .

Lowe's Store Card


                                            You will never get a credit line increase. I have good credit and zero late payments and get turned down every time. I don't have this problem with any of my other credit accounts. Had my account over a year in good standing. Paid it down to zero twice. What a joke!
