Offshore Expertise That Runs Wide & Deep
Decades of over-water flying in extremely demanding conditions have honed unmatched knowledge, skill—and leadership—in offshore transportation for companies that discover and produce oil and natural gas. Each year, our people carry more than one million passengers to and from the ships and platforms that make up their offshore workplaces.
Today, deepwater and ultra-deepwater reserves represent the vast majority of the world's new oil and gas discoveries, overwhelmingly in places where we have well-established capabilities: off the coasts of Australia, Brazil, Norway, the United Kingdom and several nations in Africa.
As our customers continue to go further to explore and produce oil and gas, CHC's world-class, advanced fleet, innovative technology and global reach make us uniquely able to understand and safely meet their needs.

Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

History[edit]




A Eurocopter Super Puma in Sealand Helicopters livery






A Sikorsky S-61 in Okanagan Helicopters livery


Commercial helicopter flying began in British Columbia in the summer of 1947. Three ex-RCAF officers, pilots Carl Agar and Barney Bent, and engineer Alf Stringer, were operating a fixed-wing charter company, Okanagan Air Services Ltd., from Penticton. In July 1947 they raised enough money to purchase a Bell 47-B3 and pay for their flying and maintenance training.
Okanagan Air Services moved to Vancouver in 1949, renamed Okanagan Helicopters Ltd. By 1954, it had become the largest commercial helicopter operator in the world.[citation needed]
In 1987, Newfoundland businessman Craig Dobbin headed a group of investors organized under the name Canadian Holding Company and using the acronym CHC. CHC purchased Okanagan Helicopters, Viking Helicopters, and Toronto Helicopters and merged them with Dobbin's own company, Sealand Helicopters, to form a company named Canadian Helicopters. The parent company was renamed CHC Helicopter Corporation. CHC acquired British International Helicopters in 1994; Helicopter Services Group of Norway in 1999 (including Bond Helicopters), Helikopter Service AS, Lloyd Helicopters of Australia and Court Helicopters of South Africa. In 2004, CHC purchased Schreiner Aviation Group who provided offshore helicopter services in the Dutch sector of the North Sea and to the Nigerian offshore industry.
In 2000, CHC entered into an agreement with Fonds de Solidarité FTQ (FSTQ) and the management of its two Canadian divisions, Canadian Helicopters Eastern and Canadian Helicopters Western, for the sale of an interest in CHC's Canadian assets in a management buyout to form Canadian Helicopters. As a result, senior management and FSTQ acquired 10% and 45% equity interests in Canadian Helicopters, respectively, while CHC retained a 45% equity interest.
CHC restructuring in 2004 saw the creation of a new corporate headquarters in Richmond, British Columbia and the creation of three main operating segments:

CHC Global Operations, based in Richmond, B.C.,
CHC European Operations, based in Aberdeen, Scotland, and
Heli-One, CHC's leasing and repair and overhaul support group, now based in Delta, B.C.

In February 2008 all of CHC's shares were purchased by First Reserve, a US private equity company, for CAD$3.7 billion ($3.5 billion). At the time, the word "Corporation" was dropped from the company's name, which is now simply CHC Helicopter. On January 16, 2014 CHC announced an Initial Public Offering of 31,000,000 shares. First Reserve now holds 56.7% of CHC's shares.
On 15th Jan 2016, CHC offered 31,000,000 shares at US$5.17.
On 5 May 2016, CHC Helicopters filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy.[3] CHC shares dropped from US$176.10 (17th Nov 14) to US 0.45cents 17 June 2016. A Texas court allowed CHC in July 2016 to shed 65 helicopters from its financial obligations, most of the Super Pumas.[4] CHC reorganized in March 2017.[5]
Divisions[edit]
CHC manages its global operations through the following divisions:

EEA Helicopter Operations B.V. ("EEA"), a Dutch company majority owned by EHO Holdings S.a.r.l. and minority owned by CHC Helicopter S.a.r.l., provides helicopter services in the North Sea.

History[edit]




A Eurocopter Super Puma in Sealand Helicopters livery






A Sikorsky S-61 in Okanagan Helicopters livery


Commercial helicopter flying began in British Columbia in the summer of 1947. Three ex-RCAF officers, pilots Carl Agar and Barney Bent, and engineer Alf Stringer, were operating a fixed-wing charter company, Okanagan Air Services Ltd., from Penticton. In July 1947 they raised enough money to purchase a Bell 47-B3 and pay for their flying and maintenance training.
Okanagan Air Services moved to Vancouver in 1949, renamed Okanagan Helicopters Ltd. By 1954, it had become the largest commercial helicopter operator in the world.[citation needed]
In 1987, Newfoundland businessman Craig Dobbin headed a group of investors organized under the name Canadian Holding Company and using the acronym CHC. CHC purchased Okanagan Helicopters, Viking Helicopters, and Toronto Helicopters and merged them with Dobbin's own company, Sealand Helicopters, to form a company named Canadian Helicopters. The parent company was renamed CHC Helicopter Corporation. CHC acquired British International Helicopters in 1994; Helicopter Services Group of Norway in 1999 (including Bond Helicopters), Helikopter Service AS, Lloyd Helicopters of Australia and Court Helicopters of South Africa. In 2004, CHC purchased Schreiner Aviation Group who provided offshore helicopter services in the Dutch sector of the North Sea and to the Nigerian offshore industry.
In 2000, CHC entered into an agreement with Fonds de Solidarité FTQ (FSTQ) and the management of its two Canadian divisions, Canadian Helicopters Eastern and Canadian Helicopters Western, for the sale of an interest in CHC's Canadian assets in a management buyout to form Canadian Helicopters. As a result, senior management and FSTQ acquired 10% and 45% equity interests in Canadian Helicopters, respectively, while CHC retained a 45% equity interest.
CHC restructuring in 2004 saw the creation of a new corporate headquarters in Richmond, British Columbia and the creation of three main operating segments:

CHC Global Operations, based in Richmond, B.C.,
CHC European Operations, based in Aberdeen, Scotland, and
Heli-One, CHC's leasing and repair and overhaul support group, now based in Delta, B.C.

In February 2008 all of CHC's shares were purchased by First Reserve, a US private equity company, for CAD$3.7 billion ($3.5 billion). At the time, the word "Corporation" was dropped from the company's name, which is now simply CHC Helicopter. On January 16, 2014 CHC announced an Initial Public Offering of 31,000,000 shares. First Reserve now holds 56.7% of CHC's shares.
On 15th Jan 2016, CHC offered 31,000,000 shares at US$5.17.
On 5 May 2016, CHC Helicopters filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy.[3] CHC shares dropped from US$176.10 (17th Nov 14) to US 0.45cents 17 June 2016. A Texas court allowed CHC in July 2016 to shed 65 helicopters from its financial obligations, most of the Super Pumas.[4] CHC reorganized in March 2017.[5]
Divisions[edit]
CHC manages its global operations through the following divisions:

EEA Helicopter Operations B.V. ("EEA"), a Dutch company majority owned by EHO Holdings S.a.r.l. and minority owned by CHC Helicopter S.a.r.l., provides helicopter services in the North Sea. EEA operates under the CHC brand name and uses CHC logo under licence. It provides services from 17 bases in the UK, Ireland, Denmark, Norway and the Netherlands.[6]
Brazilian Helicopter Services (BHS) (Brazil)
CHC Helicopters Global Operations/Corporate Office (Richmond, British Columbia)
CHC Helicopters (Australia)
CHC Helicopters (Africa)
CHC Composites (Gander, Newfoundland)

CHC EMS and SAR services[edit]
Ireland[edit]




CHC S-61 operated for the Irish Coast Guard


CHC Helicopter serves as the sole provider of Search and Rescue helicopter services to the Irish Coast Guard, where it had operated a fleet of six Sikorsky S-61N helicopters based in Dublin, Shannon, Waterford, and Sligo. This fleet has now been replaced by 5 Sikorsky S-92 Helibus. The S-61N exited service in December 2013 with a flight from Dublin Airport to Weston Aerodrome, West Dublin. The flight was operated by EI-SAR, the oldest S-61N in commercial operation at the time.[7]
United Kingdom[edit]
CHC currently provides SAR helicopters to two of the four Maritime and Coastguard Agency bases in the UK; Portland, Lee-on-Solent, and until recently also operated from Sumburgh and Stornoway. CHC, as part of the Soteria SAR consortium was selected as the "Preferred Bidder" for a 25-year contract to provide a civilian Search and Rescue service throughout the United Kingdom.[8] However, days before the contract was due to be signed in February 2011, the British Government halted the process after CHC disclosed that it had unauthorised access to commercially sensitive information.[9]
Australia[edit]
CHC is the largest provider of emergency medical helicopter services in Australia.[citation needed]
Military[edit]

Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) - CHC has been providing dedicated rescue support to the RAAF since 1989, where it operates Sikorsky S76.

History[edit]




A Eurocopter Super Puma in Sealand Helicopters livery






A Sikorsky S-61 in Okanagan Helicopters livery


Commercial helicopter flying began in British Columbia in the summer of 1947. Three ex-RCAF officers, pilots Carl Agar and Barney Bent, and engineer Alf Stringer, were operating a fixed-wing charter company, Okanagan Air Services Ltd., from Penticton. In July 1947 they raised enough money to purchase a Bell 47-B3 and pay for their flying and maintenance training.
Okanagan Air Services moved to Vancouver in 1949, renamed Okanagan Helicopters Ltd. By 1954, it had become the largest commercial helicopter operator in the world.[citation needed]
In 1987, Newfoundland businessman Craig Dobbin headed a group of investors organized under the name Canadian Holding Company and using the acronym CHC. CHC purchased Okanagan Helicopters, Viking Helicopters, and Toronto Helicopters and merged them with Dobbin's own company, Sealand Helicopters, to form a company named Canadian Helicopters. The parent company was renamed CHC Helicopter Corporation. CHC acquired British International Helicopters in 1994; Helicopter Services Group of Norway in 1999 (including Bond Helicopters), Helikopter Service AS, Lloyd Helicopters of Australia and Court Helicopters of South Africa. In 2004, CHC purchased Schreiner Aviation Group who provided offshore helicopter services in the Dutch sector of the North Sea and to the Nigerian offshore industry.
In 2000, CHC entered into an agreement with Fonds de Solidarité FTQ (FSTQ) and the management of its two Canadian divisions, Canadian Helicopters Eastern and Canadian Helicopters Western, for the sale of an interest in CHC's Canadian assets in a management buyout to form Canadian Helicopters. As a result, senior management and FSTQ acquired 10% and 45% equity interests in Canadian Helicopters, respectively, while CHC retained a 45% equity interest.
CHC restructuring in 2004 saw the creation of a new corporate headquarters in Richmond, British Columbia and the creation of three main operating segments:

CHC Global Operations, based in Richmond, B.C.,
CHC European Operations, based in Aberdeen, Scotland, and
Heli-One, CHC's leasing and repair and overhaul support group, now based in Delta, B.C.

In February 2008 all of CHC's shares were purchased by First Reserve, a US private equity company, for CAD$3.7 billion ($3.5 billion). At the time, the word "Corporation" was dropped from the company's name, which is now simply CHC Helicopter. On January 16, 2014 CHC announced an Initial Public Offering of 31,000,000 shares. First Reserve now holds 56.7% of CHC's shares.
On 15th Jan 2016, CHC offered 31,000,000 shares at US$5.17.
On 5 May 2016, CHC Helicopters filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy.[3] CHC shares dropped from US$176.10 (17th Nov 14) to US 0.45cents 17 June 2016. A Texas court allowed CHC in July 2016 to shed 65 helicopters from its financial obligations, most of the Super Pumas.[4] CHC reorganized in March 2017.[5]
Divisions[edit]
CHC manages its global operations through the following divisions:

EEA Helicopter Operations B.V. ("EEA"), a Dutch company majority owned by EHO Holdings S.a.r.l. and minority owned by CHC Helicopter S.a.r.l., provides helicopter services in the North Sea. EEA operates under the CHC brand name and uses CHC logo under licence. It provides services from 17 bases in the UK, Ireland, Denmark, Norway and the Netherlands.[6]
Brazilian Helicopter Services (BHS) (Brazil)
CHC Helicopters Global Operations/Corporate Office (Richmond, British Columbia)
CHC Helicopters (Australia)
CHC Helicopters (Africa)
CHC Composites (Gander, Newfoundland)

CHC EMS and SAR services[edit]
Ireland[edit]




CHC S-61 operated for the Irish Coast Guard


CHC Helicopter serves as the sole provider of Search and Rescue helicopter services to the Irish Coast Guard, where it had operated a fleet of six Sikorsky S-61N helicopters based in Dublin, Shannon, Waterford, and Sligo. This fleet has now been replaced by 5 Sikorsky S-92 Helibus. The S-61N exited service in December 2013 with a flight from Dublin Airport to Weston Aerodrome, West Dublin. The flight was operated by EI-SAR, the oldest S-61N in commercial operation at the time.[7]
United Kingdom[edit]
CHC currently provides SAR helicopters to two of the four Maritime and Coastguard Agency bases in the UK; Portland, Lee-on-Solent, and until recently also operated from Sumburgh and Stornoway. CHC, as part of the Soteria SAR consortium was selected as the "Preferred Bidder" for a 25-year contract to provide a civilian Search and Rescue service throughout the United Kingdom.[8] However, days before the contract was due to be signed in February 2011, the British Government halted the process after CHC disclosed that it had unauthorised access to commercially sensitive information.[9]
Australia[edit]
CHC is the largest provider of emergency medical helicopter services in Australia.[citation needed]

History[edit]




A Eurocopter Super Puma in Sealand Helicopters livery






A Sikorsky S-61 in Okanagan Helicopters livery


Commercial helicopter flying began in British Columbia in the summer of 1947. Three ex-RCAF officers, pilots Carl Agar and Barney Bent, and engineer Alf Stringer, were operating a fixed-wing charter company, Okanagan Air Services Ltd., from Penticton. In July 1947 they raised enough money to purchase a Bell 47-B3 and pay for their flying and maintenance training.
Okanagan Air Services moved to Vancouver in 1949, renamed Okanagan Helicopters Ltd. By 1954, it had become the largest commercial helicopter operator in the world.[citation needed]
In 1987, Newfoundland businessman Craig Dobbin headed a group of investors organized under the name Canadian Holding Company and using the acronym CHC. CHC purchased Okanagan Helicopters, Viking Helicopters, and Toronto Helicopters and merged them with Dobbin's own company, Sealand Helicopters, to form a company named Canadian Helicopters. The parent company was renamed CHC Helicopter Corporation. CHC acquired British International Helicopters in 1994; Helicopter Services Group of Norway in 1999 (including Bond Helicopters), Helikopter Service AS, Lloyd Helicopters of Australia and Court Helicopters of South Africa. In 2004, CHC purchased Schreiner Aviation Group who provided offshore helicopter services in the Dutch sector of the North Sea and to the Nigerian offshore industry.
In 2000, CHC entered into an agreement with Fonds de Solidarité FTQ (FSTQ) and the management of its two Canadian divisions, Canadian Helicopters Eastern and Canadian Helicopters Western, for the sale of an interest in CHC's Canadian assets in a management buyout to form Canadian Helicopters. As a result, senior management and FSTQ acquired 10% and 45% equity interests in Canadian Helicopters, respectively, while CHC retained a 45% equity interest.
CHC restructuring in 2004 saw the creation of a new corporate headquarters in Richmond, British Columbia and the creation of three main operating segments:

CHC Global Operations, based in Richmond, B.C.,
CHC European Operations, based in Aberdeen, Scotland, and
Heli-One, CHC's leasing and repair and overhaul support group, now based in Delta, B.C.

In February 2008 all of CHC's shares were purchased by First Reserve, a US private equity company, for CAD$3.7 billion ($3.5 billion). At the time, the word "Corporation" was dropped from the company's name, which is now simply CHC Helicopter. On January 16, 2014 CHC announced an Initial Public Offering of 31,000,000 shares. First Reserve now holds 56.7% of CHC's shares.
On 15th Jan 2016, CHC offered 31,000,000 shares at US$5.17.
On 5 May 2016, CHC Helicopters filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy.[3] CHC shares dropped from US$176.10 (17th Nov 14) to US 0.45cents 17 June 2016. A Texas court allowed CHC in July 2016 to shed 65 helicopters from its financial obligations, most of the Super Pumas.[4] CHC reorganized in March 2017.[5]
Divisions[edit]
CHC manages its global operations through the following divisions:

EEA Helicopter Operations B.V. ("EEA"), a Dutch company majority owned by EHO Holdings S.a.r.l. and minority owned by CHC Helicopter S.a.r.l., provides helicopter services in the North Sea. EEA operates under the CHC brand name and uses CHC logo under licence. It provides services from 17 bases in the UK, Ireland, Denmark, Norway and the Netherlands.[6]

CHC Helicopter Announces Management ChangesHomeMailFlickrTumblrNewsSportsFinanceCelebrityAnswersGroupsMobileMoreYahooSearchSearchSkip to NavigationSkip to Main ContentSkip to Related Content0CHC Helicopter Announces Management ChangesMarketwireFebruary 15, 2011ReblogShareTweetShareVANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA--(Marketwire - 02/15/11) - CHC Helicopter has announced a number of Executive management changes, including two appointments and two retirements.After 29 years with CHC Helicopter, Christine Baird, CHC's president of Global Operations, has announced her retirement from the organization.In 1997, when Baird became president of what was then Canadian Helicopters International, the company had annual revenues of $35 million. By the time Baird was finished leading the company through the mergers of Court, Lloyds, and Schreiner, Global Operations boasted revenues of $560 million annually. This amazing feat made Baird one of the most well known and respected leaders in the international helicopter industry."Christine Baird has been a powerful visionary and leader who used her keen instinct to not just take over the world of helicopters but reshape it in her vision," said William J. Amelio, President and CEO, CHC Helicopter. "Although I have known her only a short time, integrity, charm, and a fierce tenacity are hallmarks of Christine's style. Our recent win of Woodside is a testament to Christine's leadership. This is the biggest contract win in Australian history. After a legendary career with CHC Helicopter, I am grateful for the legacy of success Christine leaves behind. On behalf of the senior leadership team, her many friends and colleagues at CHC and elsewhere throughout the industry, I wish her all the best in her retirement."In other changes, Tilmann Gabriel will transition from his post as President of European Operations and take over leadership of CHC's Search and Rescue division."Tilmann Gabriel has done an outstanding job with European Operations and his enthusiasm for growing the SAR segment of our business makes him the obvious candidate to assume responsibility for tackling the difficult task of growing this business," explained Mr. Amelio.In addition to Mr. Gabriel's transition, Scott Pinfield has been appointed interim leader of the new Flying Operations division. Mr. Pinfield has a sterling reputation with CHC Helicopter, having contributed to the European Operations team as Chief Operating Officer and latterly as Managing Director, European Operations. Mr. Pinfield will be responsible for integrating CHC's European Operations and Global Operations divisions into a single Flying Operations division. Benefits of this integration include the ability to deliver common standards on a global basis, an improved consistency of product, enhanced safety levels and increased levels of customer service.CHC also announced that Michael O'Neill will assume the position of Chief Legal Counsel, eventually replacing Martin Lockyer, who has announced his retirement from CHC. Mr. O'Neill joins CHC after serving as Senior Vice President and General Counsel for the Lenovo Group, where he was responsible for all legal affairs, contracts, government affairs, and security for the company."I'd like to thank Martin for his dedication and passion for CHC and I am grateful that he has agreed to stay on to assist with Michael's transition into the role," said Mr. Amelio. During his tenure with CHC, Mr. Lockyer has been involved in every M&A transaction, refinancing and high profile operational issue CHC has completed. Examples include the acquisition of CHC by First Reserve in 2008, restructuring of CHC's Nigerian operations, recent successful bond offering, and providing legal oversight to the many commercial contracts to which CHC is a party.CHC Helicopter is the world's largest helicopter services company, specializing in the transport of personnel to offshore oil platforms. The CHC Helicopter group of companies is also a world-leader in the provision of civilian Search-and-Rescue operations with major contracts in the UK, Ireland and Australia and a world leader in helicopter maintenance through its Delta, British Columbia-based division, Heli-One. -- For full biographies of CHC Helicopter's Senior Leadership team please visit www.chc.caReblogShareTweetSharePopular in the CommunityTrump to Sessions: ‘You’re kind of fired!

CHC’s decision to expand the use of AIMS across operations in different locations underlines AIMS unparalleled ability to support, manage and develop a business model that effectively caters for the needs of each individual country.
 
George G. Bethanis, Head of Corporate Communications
 
“It is extremely rewarding to see that our product is helping the world’s largest commercial helicopter operator evolve and we will continue to be by their (CHC Helicopter’s) side to help consolidate, and build on this success”.

			Helicopter Rides 
            
There's just no better view of...well...anything than the breathtaking vistas that open up before you in a helicopter! Unlike the stuffy cabin of a commercial plane, where you peep thru the tiny window, your view obstructed by a mammoth wing - in a helicopter you're right out there. Levitating, floating in space! You'd swear you could just reach out and touch the skyscrapers, mountains, clouds, ocean, canyon...whatever you're flying over. You're not just seeing the sights, you're floating inside them! There is nothing like it. A helicopter tour truly is the only way to fly.

We absolutely loved this experience. One of the best days in our lives. Everyone was kind and willing to help. I want to mention Kim. She was our waitress at dinner. She went above and beyond in her service. Thank you so much for everything

			Helicopter Rides 
            
There's just no better view of...well...anything than the breathtaking vistas that open up before you in a helicopter! Unlike the stuffy cabin of a commercial plane, where you peep thru the tiny window, your view obstructed by a mammoth wing - in a helicopter you're right out there. Levitating, floating in space! You'd swear you could just reach out and touch the skyscrapers, mountains, clouds, ocean, canyon...whatever you're flying over. You're not just seeing the sights, you're floating inside them! There is nothing like it. A helicopter tour truly is the only way to fly.

History[edit]




A Eurocopter Super Puma in Sealand Helicopters livery






A Sikorsky S-61 in Okanagan Helicopters livery


Commercial helicopter flying began in British Columbia in the summer of 1947. Three ex-RCAF officers, pilots Carl Agar and Barney Bent, and engineer Alf Stringer, were operating a fixed-wing charter company, Okanagan Air Services Ltd., from Penticton. In July 1947 they raised enough money to purchase a Bell 47-B3 and pay for their flying and maintenance training.
Okanagan Air Services moved to Vancouver in 1949, renamed Okanagan Helicopters Ltd. By 1954, it had become the largest commercial helicopter operator in the world.[citation needed]
In 1987, Newfoundland businessman Craig Dobbin headed a group of investors organized under the name Canadian Holding Company and using the acronym CHC. CHC purchased Okanagan Helicopters, Viking Helicopters, and Toronto Helicopters and merged them with Dobbin's own company, Sealand Helicopters, to form a company named Canadian Helicopters. The parent company was renamed CHC Helicopter Corporation. CHC acquired British International Helicopters in 1994; Helicopter Services Group of Norway in 1999 (including Bond Helicopters), Helikopter Service AS, Lloyd Helicopters of Australia and Court Helicopters of South Africa. In 2004, CHC purchased Schreiner Aviation Group who provided offshore helicopter services in the Dutch sector of the North Sea and to the Nigerian offshore industry.
In 2000, CHC entered into an agreement with Fonds de Solidarité FTQ (FSTQ) and the management of its two Canadian divisions, Canadian Helicopters Eastern and Canadian Helicopters Western, for the sale of an interest in CHC's Canadian assets in a management buyout to form Canadian Helicopters. As a result, senior management and FSTQ acquired 10% and 45% equity interests in Canadian Helicopters, respectively, while CHC retained a 45% equity interest.
CHC restructuring in 2004 saw the creation of a new corporate headquarters in Richmond, British Columbia and the creation of three main operating segments:

CHC Global Operations, based in Richmond, B.C.,
CHC European Operations, based in Aberdeen, Scotland, and
Heli-One, CHC's leasing and repair and overhaul support group, now based in Delta, B.C.

In February 2008 all of CHC's shares were purchased by First Reserve, a US private equity company, for CAD$3.7 billion ($3.5 billion). At the time, the word "Corporation" was dropped from the company's name, which is now simply CHC Helicopter. On January 16, 2014 CHC announced an Initial Public Offering of 31,000,000 shares. First Reserve now holds 56.7% of CHC's shares.
On 15th Jan 2016, CHC offered 31,000,000 shares at US$5.17.
On 5 May 2016, CHC Helicopters filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy.[3] CHC shares dropped from US$176.10 (17th Nov 14) to US 0.45cents 17 June 2016. A Texas court allowed CHC in July 2016 to shed 65 helicopters from its financial obligations, most of the Super Pumas.[4] CHC reorganized in March 2017.[5]
Divisions[edit]
CHC manages its global operations through the following divisions:

EEA Helicopter Operations B.V. ("EEA"), a Dutch company majority owned by EHO Holdings S.a.r.l. and minority owned by CHC Helicopter S.a.r.l., provides helicopter services in the North Sea. EEA operates under the CHC brand name and uses CHC logo under licence. It provides services from 17 bases in the UK, Ireland, Denmark, Norway and the Netherlands.[6]
Brazilian Helicopter Services (BHS) (Brazil)
CHC Helicopters Global Operations/Corporate Office (Richmond, British Columbia)
CHC Helicopters (Australia)
CHC Helicopters (Africa)
CHC Composites (Gander, Newfoundland)

CHC EMS and SAR services[edit]
Ireland[edit]




CHC S-61 operated for the Irish Coast Guard


CHC Helicopter serves as the sole provider of Search and Rescue helicopter services to the Irish Coast Guard, where it had operated a fleet of six Sikorsky S-61N helicopters based in Dublin, Shannon, Waterford, and Sligo. This fleet has now been replaced by 5 Sikorsky S-92 Helibus. The S-61N exited service in December 2013 with a flight from Dublin Airport to Weston Aerodrome, West Dublin. The flight was operated by EI-SAR, the oldest S-61N in commercial operation at the time.[7]
United Kingdom[edit]
CHC currently provides SAR helicopters to two of the four Maritime and Coastguard Agency bases in the UK; Portland, Lee-on-Solent, and until recently also operated from Sumburgh and Stornoway. CHC, as part of the Soteria SAR consortium was selected as the "Preferred Bidder" for a 25-year contract to provide a civilian Search and Rescue service throughout the United Kingdom.[8] However, days before the contract was due to be signed in February 2011, the British Government halted the process after CHC disclosed that it had unauthorised access to commercially sensitive information.[9]
Australia[edit]
CHC is the largest provider of emergency medical helicopter services in Australia.[citation needed]

History[edit]




A Eurocopter Super Puma in Sealand Helicopters livery






A Sikorsky S-61 in Okanagan Helicopters livery


Commercial helicopter flying began in British Columbia in the summer of 1947. Three ex-RCAF officers, pilots Carl Agar and Barney Bent, and engineer Alf Stringer, were operating a fixed-wing charter company, Okanagan Air Services Ltd., from Penticton. In July 1947 they raised enough money to purchase a Bell 47-B3 and pay for their flying and maintenance training.
Okanagan Air Services moved to Vancouver in 1949, renamed Okanagan Helicopters Ltd. By 1954, it had become the largest commercial helicopter operator in the world.[citation needed]
In 1987, Newfoundland businessman Craig Dobbin headed a group of investors organized under the name Canadian Holding Company and using the acronym CHC. CHC purchased Okanagan Helicopters, Viking Helicopters, and Toronto Helicopters and merged them with Dobbin's own company, Sealand Helicopters, to form a company named Canadian Helicopters. The parent company was renamed CHC Helicopter Corporation. CHC acquired British International Helicopters in 1994; Helicopter Services Group of Norway in 1999 (including Bond Helicopters), Helikopter Service AS, Lloyd Helicopters of Australia and Court Helicopters of South Africa. In 2004, CHC purchased Schreiner Aviation Group who provided offshore helicopter services in the Dutch sector of the North Sea and to the Nigerian offshore industry.
In 2000, CHC entered into an agreement with Fonds de Solidarité FTQ (FSTQ) and the management of its two Canadian divisions, Canadian Helicopters Eastern and Canadian Helicopters Western, for the sale of an interest in CHC's Canadian assets in a management buyout to form Canadian Helicopters. As a result, senior management and FSTQ acquired 10% and 45% equity interests in Canadian Helicopters, respectively, while CHC retained a 45% equity interest.
CHC restructuring in 2004 saw the creation of a new corporate headquarters in Richmond, British Columbia and the creation of three main operating segments:

CHC Global Operations, based in Richmond, B.C.,
CHC European Operations, based in Aberdeen, Scotland, and
Heli-One, CHC's leasing and repair and overhaul support group, now based in Delta, B.C.

In February 2008 all of CHC's shares were purchased by First Reserve, a US private equity company, for CAD$3.7 billion ($3.5 billion). At the time, the word "Corporation" was dropped from the company's name, which is now simply CHC Helicopter. On January 16, 2014 CHC announced an Initial Public Offering of 31,000,000 shares. First Reserve now holds 56.7% of CHC's shares.
On 15th Jan 2016, CHC offered 31,000,000 shares at US$5.17.
On 5 May 2016, CHC Helicopters filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy.[3] CHC shares dropped from US$176.10 (17th Nov 14) to US 0.45cents 17 June 2016. A Texas court allowed CHC in July 2016 to shed 65 helicopters from its financial obligations, most of the Super Pumas.[4] CHC reorganized in March 2017.[5]
Divisions[edit]
CHC manages its global operations through the following divisions:

EEA Helicopter Operations B.V. ("EEA"), a Dutch company majority owned by EHO Holdings S.a.r.l. and minority owned by CHC Helicopter S.a.r.l., provides helicopter services in the North Sea. EEA operates under the CHC brand name and uses CHC logo under licence. It provides services from 17 bases in the UK, Ireland, Denmark, Norway and the Netherlands.[6]
Brazilian Helicopter Services (BHS) (Brazil)
CHC Helicopters Global Operations/Corporate Office (Richmond, British Columbia)
CHC Helicopters (Australia)
CHC Helicopters (Africa)
CHC Composites (Gander, Newfoundland)

CHC EMS and SAR services[edit]
Ireland[edit]




CHC S-61 operated for the Irish Coast Guard


CHC Helicopter serves as the sole provider of Search and Rescue helicopter services to the Irish Coast Guard, where it had operated a fleet of six Sikorsky S-61N helicopters based in Dublin, Shannon, Waterford, and Sligo. This fleet has now been replaced by 5 Sikorsky S-92 Helibus. The S-61N exited service in December 2013 with a flight from Dublin Airport to Weston Aerodrome, West Dublin. The flight was operated by EI-SAR, the oldest S-61N in commercial operation at the time.[7]
United Kingdom[edit]
CHC currently provides SAR helicopters to two of the four Maritime and Coastguard Agency bases in the UK; Portland, Lee-on-Solent, and until recently also operated from Sumburgh and Stornoway. CHC, as part of the Soteria SAR consortium was selected as the "Preferred Bidder" for a 25-year contract to provide a civilian Search and Rescue service throughout the United Kingdom.[8] However, days before the contract was due to be signed in February 2011, the British Government halted the process after CHC disclosed that it had unauthorised access to commercially sensitive information.[9]
Australia[edit]
CHC is the largest provider of emergency medical helicopter services in Australia.[citation needed]
Military[edit]

Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) - CHC has been providing dedicated rescue support to the RAAF since 1989, where it operates Sikorsky S76.

On 5 May 2016, CHC Helicopters filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy.[3] CHC shares dropped from US$176.10 (17th Nov 14) to US 0.45cents 17 June 2016. A Texas court allowed CHC in July 2016 to shed 65 helicopters from its financial obligations, most of the Super Pumas.[4] CHC reorganized in March 2017.[5]
Divisions[edit]
CHC manages its global operations through the following divisions:

EEA Helicopter Operations B.V. ("EEA"), a Dutch company majority owned by EHO Holdings S.a.r.l. and minority owned by CHC Helicopter S.a.r.l., provides helicopter services in the North Sea.

CHC EMS and SAR services[edit]
Ireland[edit]




CHC S-61 operated for the Irish Coast Guard


CHC Helicopter serves as the sole provider of Search and Rescue helicopter services to the Irish Coast Guard, where it had operated a fleet of six Sikorsky S-61N helicopters based in Dublin, Shannon, Waterford, and Sligo. This fleet has now been replaced by 5 Sikorsky S-92 Helibus. The S-61N exited service in December 2013 with a flight from Dublin Airport to Weston Aerodrome, West Dublin. The flight was operated by EI-SAR, the oldest S-61N in commercial operation at the time.[7]
United Kingdom[edit]
CHC currently provides SAR helicopters to two of the four Maritime and Coastguard Agency bases in the UK; Portland, Lee-on-Solent, and until recently also operated from Sumburgh and Stornoway. CHC, as part of the Soteria SAR consortium was selected as the "Preferred Bidder" for a 25-year contract to provide a civilian Search and Rescue service throughout the United Kingdom.[8] However, days before the contract was due to be signed in February 2011, the British Government halted the process after CHC disclosed that it had unauthorised access to commercially sensitive information.[9]
Australia[edit]
CHC is the largest provider of emergency medical helicopter services in Australia.[citation needed]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
