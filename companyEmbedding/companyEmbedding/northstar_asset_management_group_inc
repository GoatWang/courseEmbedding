Guiding our clients to their financial objectives

http://www.northstarinvestments.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/commercial.mp4
During the Past 35 Years, We Have Developed a Research Process and a Commitment to Service that is Helping Our Clients Achieve Their Financial Goals.
We established North Star Asset Management, Inc. (NSAM) in 1996 to provide superior investment performance by focusing on internal, proprietary research and investing in high quality, consistent growth companies. We developed a vision of the way we wished to work and how we would help our clients achieve their financial goals. The result is a cohesive, agile firm that invests opportunistically and assertively.  Our success is a product of our experience, continuity, and commitment.
Prior to the establishment of North Star Asset Management, Inc., the five founding principals of the firm had worked as a team of Trust Investment Officers at Associated Bank in Neenah, Wisconsin. With an average of 20 years of investment analysis and portfolio management experience, our group has produced an enviable record of investment performance and client service. 
North Star Asset Management was founded to ensure the continuity of our team of professionals and to improve upon an already solid track record of results and service. The creation of an investment advisory firm with a limited number of clients for each portfolio manager has allowed for an enhanced level of proprietary investment research, expanded flexibility to pursue new investment opportunities, and a greater level of client communications. We remain firmly committed to our philosophy of long-term investment in a diversified portfolio of fundamentally sound, consistent growth companies.
North Star Asset Management is incorporated in Wisconsin and registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission. NSAM advises clients in 34 states and several foreign countries.

Our Approach
Our Equity Investment Approach:
Investing for the Long-Term in a Diversified Portfolio of Fundamentally Sound Consistent Growth Companies at a Reasonable Price. 
We focus on identifying consistent growth companies offering above-average return potential regardless of their size or geographic location.  Those companies typically possess the following characteristics:
 
Sustainable competitive advantage.  A sustainable competitive advantage is what differentiates a company from its competitors.  This includes such things as providing a superior product or service, having the leading market share, being the low-cost producer, possessing a superior distribution system, utilizing better technology, having superior research and development technology, or offering the best customer service.  Trademarks, trade names, and patents also provide compelling competitive advantages.
 
Superior management that acts in the shareholders’ interest.   Management should have a defined business objective and strategy.  It must use the company’s assets wisely and invest to generate superior levels of profit and growth.  They must be innovative and able to anticipate and act on change.  In addition, management must apply high standards of corporate governance and truly think of shareholders as owners of the business. A high level of management ownership in the company better aligns management with shareholders and is viewed positively. 
 
Long-term track record of revenue and EPS growth.  The company should have reported consistent revenue and EPS growth over the past 5-10 years or more.  To continue such a record, demand for its products or services must be growing, as cost containment and margin improvement will not last forever.  The consistency of reported EPS also demonstrates recurring and predictable demand for the company’s products or services.  A company that exhibits this consistency will most likely have below average vulnerability to a downturn in the economy. 
 
Leader in a growing industry.  The company’s end-markets should be growing faster than the overall economy.  The company should be a leader and innovator, not necessarily the largest.  The rate of internal growth (as opposed to growth from acquisitions) is important because it will provide a sustainable annual return and increase the value of the company over the long-term.  
 
Strong balance sheet.  A company with a strong balance sheet (low net debt-to-capital) should have the capacity to finance its growth. A company’s operating income should provide a very secure level of interest coverage under varied economic conditions.  A solid balance sheet will help reduce volatility in reported earnings during an economic recession, as well as reduce the risk of charges from write-downs.
 
Generation of free cash flow – The best businesses tend to be relatively less capital intensive and generate significant free cash flow.  Free cash flow can benefit shareholders in many ways, such as share repurchases, debt reduction, or strategic acquisitions. 
 
Attractive Valuation.  After finding a company that meets most, if not all, of the above criteria, it is critical to investment success to have the discipline to wait for the appropriate purchase price.  Key valuation determinants include a company’s probable long-term earnings per share growth rate, consistency and stability of estimated growth, profitability, financial condition, projected cash flow, and quality of management.  Our valuation methodology incorporates the use of a dividend discount model as well as relative price-to-earnings ratio (PE) and price-to-earnings relative to expected growth ratio (PEG) analysis.
 
Our Fixed Income Approach:
A Focus on High Quality Securities and Duration Management. 
Our bond investment approach emphasizes the generation of long-term, consistent returns within the parameters of individual client objectives.   Our staff has experience in a variety of fixed income disciplines, from emphasizing income and principal stability for conservative clients, to applying active duration management techniques for dedicated institutional portfolios.   Our strength lies in our ability to customize a fixed income portfolio to meet the specific needs of each client.  However, several aspects of our philosophy will apply to all fixed income portfolios under our management: 

Focus on investment grade securities.  

 

Avoid excessive interest rate risk.

 

Maintain adequate liquidity to ensure maximum flexibility.

Permissible investments include U.S. Treasury securities, government agency issues, corporate securities, preferred stocks, municipal bonds, mortgage and asset-backed issues, certificates of deposit, fixed income mutual funds, exchange traded funds (ETFs) and high quality money market funds.

Our Philosophy
Our Investment Philosophy:
How Your Portfolio Will Be Managed.
 
North Star Asset Management tailors each portfolio to meet the specific needs and objectives of our clients primarily through a combination of high quality, consistent growth companies and investment grade fixed income securities.  Though each portfolio is unique, the majority of the investments are consistent with a model portfolio developed by our team of investment professionals.  We customize the risk of each portfolio primarily by adjusting the level of stocks and bonds rather than changing the mix of individual securities, although each portfolio manager has the flexibility to invest in securities that are appropriate for each clients risk tolerance.  By limiting the ratio of clients per portfolio manager, we ensure that our portfolio managers have the time necessary for properly assessing client objectives and developing and implementing a portfolio strategy to meet those needs.  
 
We utilize a team approach with eleven investment professionals working together to provide personalized portfolio management services by researching and investing in consistent growth companies and appropriate fixed income securities. Each portfolio is guided by a veteran manager with the resources and experience of the entire team in support. All portfolios are reviewed regularly by the entire investment team.
 
Our team of investment professionals evaluates investment opportunities through proprietary, fundamental analysis, involving company visits, input from Wall Street, and the utilization of a dividend discount valuation model.  Our equity portfolios are invested in a select number of stocks representing 15-20 industries.  Holdings of individual securities are generally limited to no more than 7% of an equity portfolio.  This provides sufficient diversification while permitting us to leverage our internal research.  By diversifying between large, medium, and small stocks along with growth, value and international stocks, NSAM provides broad diversification for its clients.  This flexibility allows us to invest in the most attractive companies regardless of their size or geographic location.
 
North Star Asset Management believes in long-term investing.  We have relatively low portfolio turnover, thereby avoiding excessive trading costs.  Our equity portfolio turnover is approximately 20% annually, resulting in an average holding period of approximately 5 years.  This turnover is significantly below industry averages.  In addition to minimizing trading expenses, the low turnover reduces potential tax liabilities.
 
While the firm utilizes a low portfolio turnover approach, it also recognizes the need to be flexible and take action when the fundamentals warrant the sale of an investment.  Other key elements of our sell discipline include disposing of investments when they materially exceed fair value, when holdings can be modified to enhance returns, or when prudence dictates portfolio diversification.
 
Although our dividend discount valuation model and fundamental research provide valuable input and our investment philosophy adds discipline, there are no substitutes for knowledge and experience when making investment decisions.  To that end, our investment professionals continuously review current holdings, security recommendations, and portfolio strategy for each account.

First Week of NSAM June 2016 Options Trading
Investors in NorthStar Asset Management Group Inc saw new options become available this week, for the June 2016 expiration.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The three scores are based on the trading styles of Growth, Value, and Momentum.


Growth Score
A


Value Score
A


Momentum Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B.

About Us









WELCOMENorthStar began in 1990 as a public equity and fixed income manager. As our analysis of solutions broadened, shareholder activism, community investing, community engagement, and charitable giving became essential ingredients of our active portfolio management process. Our approach has been guided by our deeply-held belief that the financial system is broken, that people are suffering, and that we need to help our clients use their resources to effect change.





OUR APPROACH


NorthStar’s mission is to provide the most integrative approach to portfolio management available today. Wealth management begins with an analysis of the social, ecological, and political problems of our time and with deep conversations with our clients. These steps result in the construction of portfolios that integrate financial goals while upholding a commitment to social change.





Synthesizing our broad market outlook and the individual needs of the client, we combine direct investments in global equities, investment grade bonds, community loan funds, alternative “outside” investments and cash to create a vibrant and well-balanced portfolio.








WHAT WE DOHow We Do ItOutside InvestingPerformanceClient ServicesHow We Do ItWe carefully choose public equities from each of the major industry groups. Identifying particular strengths relative to their impact on the global community, we simultaneously acknowledge the issues, problems, and challenges unique to each company. Our goal is to find the best, financially sound and socially conscious businesses with full awareness of the limitations of any public company. We then intervene at a corporate level to improve their behavior with regard to such issues as human rights, the environment, employee relations, and corporate citizenship.Outside InvestingSome of our clients are eager to make significant investments miles away from Wall Street. Local investing, social capital investing, mission investing and direct support of projects that reflect social and environmental vision are offered through NorthStar’s Outside Investments division.PerformanceOur equity performance is measured against traditional benchmarks and is available upon request. Our overall performance is also measured against traditional financial benchmarks for balanced accounts, even though some of our investments are outside the scope of these benchmarks. We are happy to discuss our performance and metrics with any potential clients.Client ServicesNorthStar is profoundly client-centered. We form important relationships with clients around every facet of their financial lives. We introduce younger clients with inherited wealth to the opportunities and challenges of responsible investing and help them navigate family relationships and money. We help clients in the LGBT community navigate legal obstacles related to property and inheritance.

                            Financial literacy isn’t typically taught in school, yet it’s a complicated topic every adult needs to master.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our unaudited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Item 1. "Financial Statements" of this report. References to "NSAM," the "Company," "we," "us" or "our" refer to NorthStar Asset Management Group Inc. and its subsidiaries unless the context specifically requires otherwise. Introduction We are a global asset management firm focused on strategically managing real estate and other investment platforms in the United States and internationally. We commenced operations on July 1, 2014 upon the spin-off by NorthStar Realty Finance Corp., or NorthStar Realty, of its asset management business into a separate publicly-traded company, NorthStar Asset Management Group Inc. 

                            
                            
                                  
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
                                  
                                    NSAM

                            
                                  
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
                                         a Delaware corporation, or the NSAM Spin-off. The NSAM Spin-off was in the form of a tax-free distribution to NorthStar Realty's common stockholders where each NorthStar Realty common stockholder received shares of our common stock on a one-for-one basis. At the same time, NorthStar Realty became externally managed by our affiliate through a management contract with an initial term of 20 years. NorthStar Realty continues to operate its commercial real estate, or CRE, debt origination business. On October 31, 2015, NorthStar Realty completed the spin-off of its European real estate business, or the NRE Spin-off, into a separate publicly-traded real estate investment trust, or REIT, NorthStar Realty Europe Corp., or NorthStar Europe. We manage NorthStar Europe pursuant to a long-term management agreement, on substantially similar terms as our management agreement with NorthStar Realty. NorthStar Realty and NorthStar Europe are herein collectively referred to as our NorthStar Listed Companies. We have a substantial business raising and managing capital in the retail marketplace accessing a variety of pools of capital and through various vehicles that include REITs, closed-end funds and others that we may form in the future. We earn various fees from managing this capital and we refer to this platform as our Retail Business. Certain of our affiliates also manage NorthStar Realty's previously sponsored non-traded companies which raise capital through the retail market, as well as any new non-traded company and any future sponsored company that raises capital from retail investors, referred to as our Retail Companies and together with the NorthStar Listed Companies, referred to as our Managed Companies. We are organized to provide asset management and other services to our Managed Companies, or any other companies we may sponsor in the future, both in the United States and internationally. Our Managed Companies have historically invested in the CRE industry. We seek to expand the scope of our asset management business beyond real estate into new asset classes and geographies by organically creating and managing additional investment vehicles or through acquisitions, strategic partnerships and joint ventures. On January 29, 2016, we acquired an approximate 84% interest in Townsend Holdings LLC, or Townsend, or the Townsend Acquisition Date, a leading global provider of investment management and advisory services focused on real assets. Founded in 1983, Townsend is the manager or advisor to $184 billion of real assets as of September 30, 2016. Townsend's management team owns the remainder of the business and continues to direct day-to-day operations, subject to the oversight and direction of its board of directors which is controlled by NSAM. We acquired the interest in Townsend for approximately $383 million, net of post-closing adjustments. In connection with the acquisition, we obtained a $500 million term loan, which was used to fund the transaction, repay in full the amount outstanding under our revolving credit agreement and for general corporate purposes, including repurchases of our common stock.

Our Latest Thinking











Identifying the main drivers of long-term change is key to investment success in the 21st century. We believe we are at the beginning of a secular growth phase for the U.S. economy driven largely by the rebalancing of global growth from the developed to the developing world. We focus on the long-term drivers, the macro forces and investment themes at play across industries that are taking us into the next growth cycle.

Wealth Structuring
Preservation and Transfer
Your wealth plan is designed to provide you and your family with thoughtful and innovative solutions customized to the financial and personal complexities of your life.  We bring you knowledge, experience and expertise across the broad range of wealth structuring disciplines.






Wealth Planning
Integrating your personal and financial affairs
By thinking holistically about all aspects of your wealth, we develop customized strategies to help pursue your unique goals. Wealth structuring can help you address issues including:

The cash flow required to help meet your lifestyle
The investments needed to help meet long-range objectives 
The most effective way to pursue estate planning goals 
The tax implications of the many aspects of managing and transferring your wealth

Trusts and Estates
Shaping your legacy and transferring your wealth
For more than two centuries, U.S. Trust has been helping many of America's wealthiest families build estate plans and implement wealth transfer strategies. Your team can work with you to build a sound estate plan that may help you:

Control the transfer of wealth to those you care about
Fulfill important philanthropic commitments
Reduce estate taxes
Maintain your privacy
Protect assets from creditors and other third parties

We can help you and your attorney establish trusts to provide financial security for your spouse or partner, pass assets to future generations and charities and reduce estate taxes, as well as provide for financial and investment management during your lifetime. We bring our extensive knowledge and experience to bear in helping clients manage their trusts whether we are serving as agent for trustee or corporate trustee.
Philanthropy
Making your charitable giving more fulfilling and effective
We offer you personal support and an array of tools to help you and your family assess your charitable goals, values and interests. Your philanthropic specialist can then help you understand a range of important considerations, including how to:

Implement your plan
Identify the best-qualified grant recipients
Monitor the impact of your efforts

We can help you design and implement a philanthropic strategy that helps you fulfill your values-based commitments in a way that is consistent with your lifestyle.
Learn more about Philanthropy at U.S. Trust
Custody Services
Benefiting from the experience of dedicated custody specialists
U.S. Trust is the custodian of choice for many sophisticated investors with extensive and complex holdings. Whether you manage your own portfolio or work with multiple brokers and investment managers, we can structure a personalized custody program that simplifies portfolio and trade monitoring and helps meet your specific safekeeping, service and information needs.

Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax or estate planning strategy.
Bank of America, N.A. and the U.S. Trust Company of Delaware (collectively the "Bank") do not serve in a fiduciary capacity with respect to all products or services. Fiduciary standards or fiduciary duties do not apply, for example, when the Bank is offering or providing credit solutions, banking, custody or brokerage products/services or referrals to other affiliates of the Bank.

A radical shift in the forces shaping emerging market (EM) growth will require investors to take a different investment approach from what may have worked in the past.
