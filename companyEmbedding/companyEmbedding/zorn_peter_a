As a member of Thompson's backing group, Zorn played acoustic guitar, mandolin, saxophone, flute, and tin whistle and acted as a backing vocalist.[1][2] He was also a bass guitarist.
Zorn performed on Thompson's albums Hand of Kindness (1983), Sweet Talker (1991), and Dream Attic (2010). He was also one of two credited bass guitarists on the 1982 Richard & Linda Thompson album Shoot Out the Lights.

Although he frequently toured with Thompson, Zorn had also played with many other singers and groups including Arizona Smoke Revue, formed by older brother Bill Zorn, Show of Hands, the Phil Beer Band, Elaine Paige, Thomas Anders, Gerry Rafferty, Barbara Dickson, Chris Rainbow, and his band WAZ, which features Steve Tilston.
He appeared in the UK top 10 in 1979 as part of Driver 67 with his brother-in-law Paul Phillips on the single "Car 67". He and Phillips met when Zorn came to London with Fishbaugh, Fishbaugh, and Zorn, a three-piece folk rock band signed to CBS Records in London. Because of his talent on so many instruments and his vocal range, Zorn became a staple of many sessions produced by Phillips in the early and mid-seventies. After the hit with Car 67, they made an album called Hey Mister Record Man, under the name Tax Loss. Bill and Conrad Zorn also played.
In 2009 Zorn joined Steeleye Span on the spring section of the band's 40th anniversary tour, replacing Rick Kemp, who was absent for health reasons. He also replaced Kemp on the American and Australian legs of the tour. Kemp returned for the winter leg of the tour, but Zorn stayed with the band as a guitarist and multi-instrumentalist due to various strains on the band.
He played on the albums Now We Are Six Again and Wintersmith and appeared on all Steeleye tours until spring 2015, when he left the band.
Death[edit]
Zorn died on April 19, 2016, following a battle with cancer.[3] His death was announced by Zorn's family, and by Thompson, on their respective Facebook pages.[2]

tgadesign - Peter Zorn







 




 
  
  









 Peter Zorn senior 
        designer

      An Associate with TGA since 1993, Peter earned his BFA in Industrial Design 
      from the Cleveland Institute of Art in 1965, and his Master of Fine Arts 
      from the University of Miami in 1977.

      A former professor and coordinator of graphic design and illustration at 
      the University of Miami, Peter is also an award-winning screenwriter and 
      textbook author. He recently completed the book George Merricks Coral 
      Gables: Where Your Castles in Spain Are Made Real! for noted area historian 
      Arva Moore Parks and developer Ralph Sanchez. 

      His combined industrial design background has been instrumental to the success 
      of the signage and wayfinding programs he has designed. He feels that the 
      two disciplines come together beautifully when creating two dimensional 
      typography and realizing the final product in three dimensions.

Item Description: ReInk Books, 2017. SoftCover. Book Condition: New. Reprinted from 1743 edition. NO changes have been made to the original text. This is NOT a retyped or an ocr'd reprint. Illustrations, Index, if any, are included in black and white. Each page is checked manually before printing. As this reprint is from very old book, there could be some missing or flawed pages, but we always try to make the book as complete as possible. Fold-outs, if any, are not part of the book. If the original book was published in multiple volumes then this reprint is of only one volume, not the whole set. This paperback book is SEWN, where the book block is actually sewn (smythe sewn/section sewn) with thread before binding which results in a more durable type of paperback binding. It can also be open wide. The pages will not fall out and will be around for a lot longer than normal paperbacks. This print on demand book is printed on high quality acid-free paper.

Item Description: ReInk Books, 2017. SoftCover. Book Condition: New. Reprinted from 1731 edition. NO changes have been made to the original text. This is NOT a retyped or an ocr'd reprint. Illustrations, Index, if any, are included in black and white. Each page is checked manually before printing. As this reprint is from very old book, there could be some missing or flawed pages, but we always try to make the book as complete as possible. Fold-outs, if any, are not part of the book. If the original book was published in multiple volumes then this reprint is of only one volume, not the whole set. This paperback book is SEWN, where the book block is actually sewn (smythe sewn/section sewn) with thread before binding which results in a more durable type of paperback binding. It can also be open wide. The pages will not fall out and will be around for a lot longer than normal paperbacks. This print on demand book is printed on high quality acid-free paper.

It can also be open wide. The pages will not fall out and will be around for a lot longer than normal paperbacks. This print on demand book is printed on high quality acid-free paper.

ZORN, PETER ALTON It is with a heavy heart that we announce the death of Peter A. Zorn, age 76, on Jan. 1, 2017 of a massive heart attack. Death was brutally sudden but mercifully swift. One minute, he was trying to decide whether or not to go to a New Year's Day party, and the next minute, he was gone. Peter was one tough cowboy. He died with his boots on. He beat cancer. At the time of his death, Peter had been cancer-free for two years. Peter was born on May 8, 1940 in Sandusky, Ohio. He received his BFA from Cleveland Institute of Art, and MFA from the University of Miami, where he was invited to join the faculty. Peter had three careers, and numerous productive avocations. In 1965, Peter was hired as an industrial designer by the Pittsburgh firm of Muller-Munk Associates, whose clients included Westinghouse, Waring and US Steel. In 2015, the Carnegie Museum of Art presented a retrospective of pioneering Muller-Munk designs, with the original designers, including Peter, honored by the museum at the opening ceremonies. On display was Peter's groundbreaking environmental graphic design for Pittsburgh's Three Rivers Stadium, including a photograph of a much younger Peter. Peter later joined the industrial design firm of Stewart-Macdonald Co, in Athens, Ohio, producing graphic and product design for US Dept. of Commerce, US Dept. of Agriculture, Grumman Aviation, and American Packaging Corp., among others. After attaining his master's degree from the University of Miami, Peter stayed on to become a professor of art and graphic design. He retired from the university in 1993 as a tenured full professor. Peter then joined the Coral Gables design firm of Tom Graboski Associates as senior graphic designer. Peter was still employed by TGA full-time at the time of his death, producing environmental graphic design for botanical gardens, theme parks, and more than twenty Royal Caribbean cruise ships. While at University of Miami, Peter joined forces with Dr. Stephen Bowles, a professor in the film department, to write a series of award winning screenplays. Their screenplay "Florida City" (released as "Small Time Conspiracy") was produced by Nancy Hector and Paul Lazarus ("Westworld") and starred Jeannetta Arnette ("Boys Don't Cry"), Zen Gesner, and William Morgan Sheppard. With Nat Chediak, Steve Bowles and Peter Zorn founded the Miami International Film Festival. Peter was selected as official poster artist for the first festival (1984), and also the tenth, one of the few artists to ever have his work selected twice. Peter's iconic image for the first Miami Film Festival poster a director's chair in the sand is displayed in movie theaters and private collections across the country. Other exhibitions of his art and design include: Lowe Art Museum, Coral Gables; Hortt Memorial Exhibition, Palm Beach; Viktor Schreckengost Legacy Exhibition, Attleboro Arts Museum, Attleboro, Mass.; and the PMMA Retrospective Exhibit at Carnegie Museum of Art in Pittsburgh. Peter again teamed with Dr. Bowles and Professor Ron Mangravite to write "The Screenwriter's Manual: A Complete Reference of Format & Style" (Pearson), the standard textbook used in screenwriting courses nationwide. Peter leaves behind his loving wife and best friend, Kathleen Smith Zorn, daughter Jennifer, grandchildren RJ & Damien, loyal dog Lucchese, hundreds of grateful students, fans of his books and screenplays, and his beloved 1946 MG-TC. A Memorial Service and Celebration of Life will be held on Friday, March 10, at 3:00 PM at the Coral Gables Congregational Church, 3010 De Soto Boulevard, with reception in the Fellowship Hall to follow. In lieu of flowers, please call someone you love, take them out, tell them how much they mean to you, and drink a toast to Peter.
