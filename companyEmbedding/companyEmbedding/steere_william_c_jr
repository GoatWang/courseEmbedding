President(1990 – 1991)
Chief Executive Officer (1991 – 2001)
Chairman of the Board (1992 – 2001)


During the ten years Bill Steere served as chief executive officer, he focused Pfizer's business on its research-based, global pharmaceutical business and centered the Company's management on a set of core values including community, customer focus, innovation, integrity, leadership, performance, respect for people and teamwork.
Steere Joined Pfizer directly from Stanford University in 1959, beginning as a sales representative. He held a variety of United States and international sales, marketing, and general management positions and became president of Pfizer Pharmaceuticals in 1986. The board of directors elected him chief executive officer in 1991 and chairman in 1992.
During the 1990s, Pfizer emerged as the industry's "partner of choice," marketing not only its own innovation but those of other health care companies as well.
Pfizer breakthroughs during the 1990s included market-leaders Norvasc® (amlodipine besylate), Zithromax® (azithromycin), Zoloft® (sertraline hydrochloride), and Viagra® (sildenafil citrate). With partners, Pfizer launched Aricept® (donepezil hydrochloride tablets), Celebrex® (celecoxib), and Lipitor® (atorvastatin calcium).
In late 1999, Steere announced Pfizer's intention to merge with Warner-Lambert, which, like Pfizer, was a fast-growing, global, health care company whose roots extended back to the mid-1800s. In June 2000, Pfizer and Warner-Lambert began operating as a single company with more than 85,000 colleagues worldwide.
Bill Steere retired as chairman and CEO in 2001.

Pfizer past CEO Steere, a key company builder,   retires from its board













William C. Steere Jr, during his tenure as Pfizer CEO





Published March 25. 2011 2:03AM 




By Lee Howard Day Staff Writer








William C. Steere Jr., longtime board member for Pfizer Inc. and chief executive of the firm during its heyday in the 1990s, will be leaving his position as one of the company's directors in a move that some see as reaffirmation of a major shakeup playing out at the pharmaceutical giant.The 74-year-old Steere's retirement from the board, announced unceremoniously in a footnote to a proxy filed by Pfizer earlier this week, will take effect next month after the company's annual meeting. Another director, Robert N. Burt, former chairman and chief executive of chemicals manufacturer FMC Corp. and machinery manufacturer FMC Technologies Inc., will be retiring at the same time.But it was Steere's retirement that caught the eye of many industry watchers, including Ed Silverman, who writes the influential Pharmalot blog and broke the story. Steere served as Pfizer chief executive from 1991 to 2000, and as chairman from 1992 to 2001, during a time when Pfizer brought to market such leading medications as Viagra, Zoloft and Zithromax."His departure signals the end of an era, given the domineering role he sometimes played, notably a push for outsized acquisitions," Silverman said.Steere, initially an opponent of major acquisitions, eventually became an adherent of the strategy, turning Pfizer into a virtual company-eating machine, including megamergers with Warner-Lambert, Pharmacia and Wyeth Pharmaceuticals. Pfizer has major research facilities in Groton and New London.The Warner-Lambert deal brought Pfizer the world's leading medication, cholesterol drug Lipitor, but subsequent acquisitions weren't as successful. The Wyeth merger, according to Silverman, led to a rift between Steere and former chief executive Jeffrey B. Kindler, who had preferred a diversification strategy, and may have resulted in Kindler's ouster at the end of last year.Pfizer's current chief executive, Ian Read, said to be a Steere loyalist, nevertheless has begun reconsidering some of the chairman emeritus' strategies. In the past month, Read has signaled his intention to seriously look into selling off parts of the company, including animal health and consumer product divisions that largely are the legacy of the Wyeth acquisition."At least symbolically, Steere's departure could mean that Ian Read ... has a free hand," according to Matthew Herper in his blog The Medicine Show.On the other hand, according to Silverman, Pfizer's new chairman of the board, 70-year-old George Lorch, is considered a Steere protege and they regularly play golf together."Steere will continue to cast a shadow over the Pfizer board," Silverman said.l.howard@theday.com

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/24/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.
