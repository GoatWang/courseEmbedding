Forestry & Natural Resources
Since my undergraduate days at California State University, Sacramento, where I majored in Environmental Resources, I have had a great interest in Forestry. After working for the Forest Service and then volunteering for them, I realized that forest products could be good investments.
I built upon my skill set by further education in forestry at Yale University and Oxford, where I wrote a dissertation on forestry investments.
In the past, Stevens First Principles has had forest investments, but limited those investments to publicly traded REITS and partnerships.
We plan to expand our forestry investment universe by investing directly into forest and other natural resource investments through outside managed properties and partnerships.
The SFP Forestry and Land Fund is now open to investors.

SFP Forestry and Land Fund
March 2016 New Zealand Forest Plantation Tour
SFP Foresty and Land Fund plans on touring several New Zealand Pinus Radiata plantations throughout both islands of New Zealand. This tour is open only to SFP Forestry and Land Fund partners. We will fly from Los Angeles on Air New Zealand and spend approximately one week touring plantations and learning about New Zealand forestry investments from some of the foremost experts in plantation growing. Participation is limited to 10 people, and they are responsible for payment of accommodations, airfare, and some meals. We will make all the travel arrangements. This trip may be tax deductible, but please check with your accountant. For further information, contact Steven Yamshon.
Stay tuned for further plantation tours in the Southern United States, Northeast United States, United Kingdom, and Brazil.
