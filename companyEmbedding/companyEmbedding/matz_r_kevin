As well as being an accomplished developer, Kevin also has a thorough understanding and strong aptitude for product management.  Kevin provided many valuable recommendations for new and improved processes to ensure efficiency and quality control, and to guarantee the development of a superior software product. He provided well-written and comprehensive documents to describe and qualify the need for these processes.

Kevin is very articulate and communicates well with technical and non-technical staff.  He has an exceptional ability to describe complex concepts so that they are easily understood. He is detail oriented, a methodical worker and very creative.  I was extremely impressed with Kevin’s ability to design and create product prototypes that were innovative, intuitive, and visually appealing.  
 
Kevin would be a very strong asset to any team with his dedication, knowledge, skills and his creativity.   I enjoyed working with Kevin and would welcome the opportunity to work with him again.See moreSee lessSign up to see who recommended KevinView Kevin’s full profile to...See who you know in commonGet introducedContact Kevin directlyView Kevin’s Full ProfileNot the Kevin you’re looking for?
