Nf Energy Exploits Multiple China Industry Trends (Part I) - NF Energy Saving Corp. (NASDAQ:NFEC) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Nf Energy Exploits Multiple China Industry Trends (Part I)Aug.18.09 | About: NF Energy (NFEC) The GeoTeam Long/short equity, growth at reasonable price, value, arbitrageGeoInvesting, LLCOn July 28, 2009, the GeoTeam coded Nf Energy Saving Corp America (NFES.OB) as a GeoSpecial at $1.10. The Nf Energy Saving Corp America story is easy to understand supported by industry fundamentals that should drive growth into the foreseeable future. We are particularly impressed with the information provided in the company's 10K filings which thoroughly address the various product/service lines as they relate to ever-changing industry dynamics. It ultimately remains to be seen if Nf Energy will rise to the challenge posed by China's increased emphasis on clean/efficient energy solutions. We urge interested parties to peruse the company's filings and website to gain a taste of the opportunities present for Nf Energy Saving Corp America.Understanding Nf Energy Saving Corp: NF Energy Saving Corp of America is a China-based provider of integrated energy conservation solutions. Nf Energy's products address some fundamental deficiencies present in China's aging industrial infrastructure. Seventy percent of the Company's sales revenues come from it's major customers involved with large-scale electricity generation and commodity supply, industry's that need efficient processes when producing and distributing their products and services. The country's energy saving goals can be solved by a Nf Energy's capabilities to address energy conservation and emissions through the modernization of industrial boilers and furnaces, steam thermal systems, motor drive systems, lighting lamps, wind power equipment components, heat recovery systems and flow control systems. Each component of the Company's focus plays an integral part in contributing to a large picture of optimizing the output of various systems and supporting the idea of sustainable energy as China enters an industrial boom. In breaking down Nf Energy as a company, it can be categorized into four major business directions, all of which provide the company market opportunity.

Energy Saving Reconstruction Projects
Production and sales of energy-saving valves, intelligent valves and flow control equipment
Comprehensive energy conservation and emission reduction services for municipalities
Equipment Manufacturing for Wind Power Plants

  I Energy Saving Reconstruction Project 
Refurbishing of industrial energy producing systems
Installation of new modern energy efficient systems
Other initiatives to renew and recover various forms of energy

Industrial Boilers The source of heat for a boiler is combustion of any of several fuels, such as wood, coal, oil, or natural gas. In the case of China, 95% of the total burners in the country are coal-fired. Boilers have many applications. They can be used in stationary applications to provide heat, hot water, or steam for domestic use, or in generators and they can be used in mobile applications to provide steam for locomotion in applications such as trains, ships, and boats. Using a boiler is a way to transfer stored energy from the fuel source to the water in the boiler, and then finally to the point of end use. (Source:Wikipedia:boiler) Furnaces, explained later, are sometimes a component of boilers that supply the heat needed to maintain a constantly flowing process.Problem - Boiler Inefficiency

Due to the mechanism of operation, 60% of boilers in China are below current efficiency standards.
The use of old and inefficient boiler equipment and associated components leads to small capacities and incompatible coal use.
The reliance of higher grade/expensive coal to operate boilers.
Loss of potential energy due to inefficient systems.

Nf Energy Solutions to Boiler Inefficiency

Retrofit old boilers with modern equipment and improve the efficiency of the boiler operating mechanism.

Constructing new efficient boilers for its customers, further limiting energy loss.


Opportunity within the Boiler Market

In light of boilers not meeting efficiency standards, the opportunity for Nf Energy is immense as companies race to meet code.
Companies that contract with Nf Energy Saving Corp to improve boiler operating systems will be able to refurbish old boilers or construct new boilers that will meet new standards. Added benefits to these companies will be increased margins through the use of cheaper coal, less energy loss and the ability to capture lost heat/energy that occurs in the combustion process.

  Industrial FurnacesChina's industrial furnaces are mainly used in high energy consumption industries, accounting for 10% of China's total energy use. An industrial furnace or direct-fired heater, is a piece of equipment used to provide heat for processes such as those used in the iron and steel, metallurgy, building materials, machinery manufacturing and chemical industries. Furnace designs vary with the intended function, heating duty, type of fuel and method of introducing combustion air. However, most process furnaces have common features. (Source:Wikipedia:furnace)Problem - Archaic Furnace Design

Equipped with backward technology
Outdated equipment
Experiencing serious waste of energy.

Nf Energy Solution to Archaic Furnace Design
Use existing technology to reconstruct furnace structure, its heat source system, combustion system and control system.
Opportunity within the Furnace Market
Half of the enterprises that utilize furnaces experience problems.  Steam Thermal SystemsThe main goal of steam thermal systems is to transfer heat resulting in the energy needed to drive a process. The flow of heat from point to point in a thermal system is usually related to the temperatures at various locations within the system. When the energy is extracted from the steam, the steam condenses into a low-temperature reservoir, where it can be reused as feed water to make more steam.Problem - Inefficient Steam Thermal Systems
Inefficient systems lead to energy leakage
Nf Energy Solution to Steam Thermal System Inefficiency

Reconstruct thermal systems
Eliminate leakage losses
Recovery condensed water to be used as energy.

Opportunity with Steam Thermal Systems
Companies can benefit from efficient steam trap designs and other components that help to make the systems more self sufficient. Their bottom lines will be positively affected as a result of the containment of reusable resources.  Motor Drive SystemsA motor drive system is comprised of an electric motor and other parts of a mechanical system for operating a machine or machines.Problem - Excessive Power Consumption

China's motor drive system power consumption accounts for 2/3 of total electricity consumption of the country.
Nf Energy Solution
Reconstruct an efficient motor drive system with modern equipment. Opportunity with Motor Drive Systems Companies will view the NFES solution as a way to consume less energy when powering machinery.  Green Lighting ProjectFunded by the China State Economic and Trade Commission (OTC:SETC) and the Global Environment Facility, the China Green Lights Project began its expanded implementation in September 2001. The primary objective of the project is to, by 2010, reduce lighting energy use in China by ~10%.  This involves the optimization of power distribution and how it is used by the overall system. Problem - Overload on Lighting One of the fastest growing sectors of electricity growth is in lighting energy consumption.


Annual growth in electrical consumption by lighting was 15% for much of the 1990s. 


Lighting currently accounts for approximately 12% of lighting energy use in China.

Nf Energy SolutionGiven the predominant reliance on coal as a generation fuel, serious health and environmental problems can be reduced if the use of coal is curtailed by way of smart processes and higher quality products.
The Company accommodates the project through the manufacture of energy efficient green light products, renewing the lighting power supply, rational distribution of lamps, improving the quality of power supply and on-demand control. Green Lighting Project OpportunityThe project will set minimum efficiency standards for lighting products and designs.

Those who supply the most efficient products will rise to the top.
Companies can outsource product manufacturing to NFES.
As the government continues to implement its green light project demand for related products should increase.
Because the project is in its infancy, NFES can garner a favorable reputation as one of the original contributors if the project's goals are met.
NFES is the only commercial distributor of energy efficient lighting lamps in Liaoning Province where the provincial government is targeting 2.5 million bulb installations for 2009.

  Recovery of Residual HeatProblem - Lost EnergyIn the various industries that Nf Energy serves, residual heat is created during energy creation and can be considered a source of lost energy. Nf Energy Solution The company has developed reliable methods to recover and utilize residual heat from a variety of different sources.Residual Heat Opportunity
There is the potential for Nf Energy to generate contracts with companies that see the Company's recovery methods as a competitive advantage.

Contract is with El Concorde Construction Co. Ltd. to supply valve products to KUT sewerage treatment plant in Iraq



NF Energy Saving Corp. of America (NFES), a manufacturer of energy saving equipment and a provider of integrated energy conservation solutions, announced a new contract with El Concorde Construction Co. Ltd. to supply valve products to El Concorde's wastewater project, KUT Sewerage Treatment Plant in Iraq. The new contract will generate sales revenue of $362,274 for the company.
El Concorde's wastewater project started in June 2006 is for the Iraqi Ministry of Municipalities & Public Works. The total investment for this project is $19 million. NFES will supply flow control valves, penstocks and accessories to KUT Sewerage Treatment Plant. 
"El Concorde is a large multinational engineering and construction company. We are very pleased to cooperate with El Concorde in the KUT sewerage treatment plant project and to supply them with high-quality valve products," said Gang Li, the chairman and CEO of the company. "This is not the first time for us to supply our flow control valve products to foreign clients, but it is the first time for us to supply our products to a foreign wastewater treatment plant. The water industry will be an important industry for us to develop for our future growth."

Our story




Gu-ru / ‘goroō /
Noun:
1. A mentor, a teacher, one who helps you move forward.
2. A source of inspiration and good energy.


GURU
A Story of Organic Growth
Ever since the early days, GURU has always been driven by this idea of crafting the best natural energy drink out there. Founded in Montreal during the summer of 1999 by four college friends, the company marketed the world's first all-natural energy drink.
More than 15 years later, this vision is not only fulfilled but is also thriving and expanding worldwide. GURU has become the #1 Organic Energy Drink in Canada and the US in the Health Channel thanks to a strong network of distribution partnerships and a passionate sales team. 
With research & development at the forefront of our expansion, GURU now tackles a new market and adventure with the recent introduction of our Energy Waters. This new line of product arrives just in time to satisfy a growing demand for organic sugar and calorie-free energy beverages.
In short, GURU has and will always believe that energy should not come at the expense of health. That is what has brought our company a steady and organic growth.
Our Philosophy
Through its corporate philosophy and its beverages, GURU gives good energy for people to make great things, reminding that, with the right dose of will, inspiration and energy, achieving great results is within everyone's reach. 
People today define themselves less by what they have and more by what they do and contribute to the world. Resourcefulness, imagination, inventiveness is today’s new currency. Whether using technology, natural ingredients or just plain common sense, people who Make it Good are the ones who seek to make everything better. We call them Makers.
They are pioneers that never settle. Makers, not followers. Crafters not manufacturers. Some may call them obsessed, exceptional or extraordinary people. But these are men and women who are true innovators, thought leaders and doers in their respective communities. They make the impossible possible.

Luc Martin-Privat
Our Brew Master
Meet Luc our Brew Master. He is the brains behind GURU.  In fact, while he could have become your friendly neighborhood pharmacist, Luc had other dreams…
From the functional herbs he started playing with in his dad’s lab to his PhD in Pharmacology, Luc has mastered the art of blending botanicals, an art he is now applying to our beloved GURU.
Always on the lookout for smart organics from around the world, Luc is looking into the GURU recipe “Organically” to make it perfect everytime! And when he is not looking at new ways to craft our GURU, Luc is dreaming about new products!

New Look!
We're giving our products a new look but as always, it’s what’s on the inside that counts. That’s why the formulas are still the same.








5 German blades. Flex hinge. Lubricating strip. Precision trimmer.
Everything you need for a close, comfortable shave: sharp, durable blades, a flex hinge, a lubricating strip, and a precision trimmer for your sideburns and hard-to-reach places like under your nose.








Increased Control
The Truman handle is designed with a rubberized matte exterior, texturized grip pattern, and weighted core for maximum grip and control. It may be the best-looking thing in your bathroom (other than you.) 








Smooth Shave
Our Foaming Shave Gel lathers into a rich foam, while our Shave Cream has a smooth texture. Both help your razor glide effortlessly over your skin for a close, comfortable shave.
