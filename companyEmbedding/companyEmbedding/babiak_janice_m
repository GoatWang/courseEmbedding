Stock Performance is the difference between a director's stock index and the S&P 500.
A director's stock index is an unweighted index of company stock performances while they sat on the board.
CEO pay includes salary, bonuses, stock sales, and other payments.
Average CEO Pay is calculated using the last year a director sat on the board of each company.
Stock returns do not include dividends.
All directors refers to people who sat on the board of at least one Fortune 100 company between 2008 and 2012.


          The Pay Pals project relies on financial research conducted by the Center for Economic Policy and Research.
