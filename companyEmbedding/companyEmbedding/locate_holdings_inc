        Kadmon Announces Supplemental Interim Phase 2 Data of KD025 in Chronic Graft-Versus-Host Disease
      
      
        NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Kadmon Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: KDMN) ('Kadmon' or the 'Company') today announced supplemental clinical data from the first cohort (KD025 200 mg QD) of an ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial (KD025-208) of the Company's lead Rho-associated coiled-coil kinase 2 ('ROCK2') inhibitor, KD025, for chronic graft-versus-host disease ('cGVHD'). The Company first announced clinical data from the study on July 11, 2017.
      
      
Top Company Interviews


        The data points, which were pending at the time of the prior data release, are as follows:
      
      

          An additional responder sustained a response through 24 weeks of KD025 treatment. Of responders remaining on KD025 through 24 weeks, 8 of 9 (89%) sustained responses, up from 7 of 8 patients (88%) previously reported.
        

          An additional patient achieved stable disease at week 24. This finding brings the number of patients with stable disease at week 24 to three patients, up from two patients previously reported, and increases the overall clinical benefit (response and stable disease) to 88% (15/17) of patients, up from 82% (14/17) of patients.
        

      
        The full data from the first cohort have been updated to reflect these points as follows:
      
      
        KD025-208 is an ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating the safety, tolerability and activity of KD025 in adults with steroid-dependent or steroid-refractory cGVHD and active disease. The dose-finding study includes 48 patients divided into three cohorts at different dose levels (KD025 200 mg QD, 200 mg BID and 400 mg QD), enrolled sequentially following a safety assessment of each cohort.
      
      
        In a preliminary analysis of data from the first cohort, KD025 200 mg QD (n=17), KD025 demonstrated clinically meaningful responses in cGVHD patients, with an Overall Response Rate ('ORR') of 71% (12/17), which includes complete and partial responders. Of responders remaining on KD025 through week 24, 8 of 9 (89%) sustained responses. In addition to the 12 responders, three patients have stable disease and remain on KD025 through week 24. Overall clinical benefit (response and stable disease) occurred in 88% (15/17) of patients. Sixty-seven percent (67%; 8/12) of responders saw an improvement in symptoms as measured by the Lee cGVHD Symptom Scale score. To date, no drug-related serious adverse events (SAEs) have been recorded, and no drug-related elevations in liver function tests have been observed. Importantly, 67% (8/12) of responders had reduction of steroid doses and 67% (4/6) of patients had reduction of tacrolimus doses.
