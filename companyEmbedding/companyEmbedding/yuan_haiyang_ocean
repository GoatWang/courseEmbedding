Geography[edit]
Haiyang, on the coastline of the western Pacific Ocean, is a county-tier city under the 3-tier administrative system of China. Haiyang has an estimated population of 690,000 and spans over 1,886 square kilometers along the biggest Chinese peninsula, facing South Korea and Japan across the Yellow Sea.
Leisure resorts[edit]
The city, known for its newly discovered primitive beauty[citation needed], is a prime destination for beach sports[citation needed] with its 230 kilometer coastline, and climatically and typographically is quite similar to Scotland. In the past decade, this city has quickly become one of top summer resorts and vacation paradises in China, and in northeast Asia at large.[citation needed]
Historical affiliation[edit]
Haiyang was first settled with Laiyi people, one of peripheral Chinese ethnic minorities, some 2,300 years ago, and was annexed into China proper over centuries of dynasty rule and wars. Haiyang was consecutively under administration of Qi Kingdom in Warring Period, Jiaodong Province in Qin Dynasty, Laizhou Prefecture in Tang, Song and Yuan Dynasties and Dengzhou Prefecture in Ming Dynasty.
Dasongwei Fortress[edit]
In 1389, Dasongwei Fortress, one of the nine coastal Fortresses of the time to guard against Japanese invasion and pirate attacks, was set up to govern both administratively and militarily the today's area of Haiyang, which land was ever called Dansylvania in the 19th century. In 1734, Dasongwei Fortress is officially renamed as Haiyang, which name lasts to date covering the south coast of Shandong Peninsula with an area of more than 3,000 kilometers. In 1947, the newly founded communist government cut off the eastern land of Haiyang to create another county of Rushan, since then Haiyang's 1,886 kilometer area forms a shape of flying phoenix towards west Pacific Ocean.
European settlement[edit]
From the late 19th century until World War I, Haiyang was a strategic town on the route between the two European settlements of Tsingtao and Weihaiwei, respectively taken by Germany in 1898 and Britain in 1898 on lease basis, and commercial and trade activities were active until 1947 when communist troops took over.
Haiyang Port[edit]
Haiyang Port is one of the pivotal ports along south coastline of Shandong Peninsula with sea route connecting Korea, Japan and south Chinese ports. In May 1860, French navy tried to land for taking the fortress and failed. In August 1947, the government troops retreated from the port for Tsingtao after defeat by the communists. In April 1963, the Taiwan-based Chinese nationalist troops tried to land for taking back the city and all were defeated and captured by the paramilitaries. Haiyang Port is today one of the trade ports for the peninsula province with active export-oriented manufactures, and administratively under Qingdao Customs and Port authorities.
Asian Beach Games[edit]
Haiyang with host the 2012 Asian Beach Games, the first ever to be held in China, which was announced by the Olympic Council of Asia in Doha on December 2, 2006.
Vacation facilities[edit]
Haiyang is nicknamed West Pacific Paradise partially due to its literal meaning of the city name, which means Ocean and Sun. With Laoshan mountain range in the northwest and Kunyu maintain range in the northeast, Haiyang boasts the nationwide best facilities of beach sporting and leisure resorts, including but not limited to Tiger Beach Golf Courses, Yachting Clubs, sailing events, Sand Carving Parks, Beach Volleyball Club, Beach Basketball Club, Music Festival, Japanese Village, seaview gardens and terrains, Phoenix Wetland Reserve, National Forest Park and Coast Film Park. Rocky Islands some 80 kilometers off the shore are another vacation resort of the city.

A 10-K is a comprehensive summary report of a company's performance that must be submitted annually to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Typically, the 10-K contains much more detail than the annual report. It includes information such as company history, organizational structure, equity, holdings, earnings per share, subsidiaries, etc. 

The 10-K must be filed within 60 days (it used to be 90 days) after the end of the fiscal year.

Form 10-Q
The SEC form 10-Q is a comprehensive report of a company's performance that must be submitted quarterly by all public companies to the Securities and Exchange Commission. In the 10-Q, firms are required to disclose relevant information regarding their financial position. The form must be submitted on time, and the information should be available to all interested parties. 

The 10-Q is due 35 days (it used to be 45 days) after each of the first three fiscal quarters. There is no filing after the fourth quarter because that is when the 10-K is filed.
Form 10-Q/A
Amended Form 10-Q
Form 3
A document that must be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) by an insider affiliated with a public company's operation or by any investor owning 10% or more of the company's outstanding shares

This document must be filed with the SEC no later than 10 days after an insider becomes affiliated with a company, and it must be filed for each company in which a person is an insider, regardless of whether or not the insider has an equity position in the company at that time.
Form 3/A
Amended Form 3
Form 4
A Form 4 is a document that must be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) whenever there is a material change in the holdings of company insiders. Insiders required to submit a Form 4 include directors and officers of the company as well as any shareholders owning 10% or more of the company's outstanding stock.

This two-page document covers any buy-and-sell orders on the open market as well as the exercise of company stock options. A Form 4 is mandatory within two business days starting from the end of the day the material transaction occurred. This filing is related to Form 3 and the Form 5, which also cover changes to the company insider holdings.
Form 4/A
Amended Form 4
Form 5

Form 5/A
Amended Form 5
Form 8-K
An 8-K is a report of unscheduled material events or corporate changes at a company that could be of importance to the shareholders or the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

Examples of events reported on an 8-K include acquisition, bankruptcy, resignation of directors, or a change in the fiscal year. Also known as Form 8k.
Form D
A filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) required for companies that are selling securities in reliance on a Regulation D exemption or Section 4(6) exemption provisions. 

Form D is a brief notice of a company's executive officers and stock promoters, in lieu of the regular reports required when no exemption under Regulation D exists. 

Form D must be filed no later than 15 days after the first sale of securities.

Form D is also known as the Notice of Sale of Securities and is a requirement under Regulation D, Section 4(6) and/or the Uniform Limited Offering Exemption of the Securities Exchange Act of 1933. 

This act, often referred to as the "truth in securities" law, requires that these registration forms, providing essential facts, are filed to disclose important information upon registration of a company's securities. This helps the SEC achieve the objectives of this act - requiring investors to receive significant information regarding securities offered and prohibiting fraud in the sale of the offered securities.
Form D/A
Amended Form D
Form DEF 14A
A filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that must be filed by or on behalf of a registrant when a shareholder vote is required. SEC Form DEF 14A is most commonly used in conjunction with an annual meeting proxy. The form should provide security holders with sufficient information to allow them to make an informed vote at an upcoming security holders' meeting or to authorize a proxy to vote on their behalf. It includes information about the date, time and place of the meeting of security holders; revocability of proxy; dissenter's right of appraisal; persons making the solicitation; direct or indirect interest of certain persons in matters to be acted upon; modification or exchange of securities; financial statements; voting procedures; and other details. 

All other filed by non-management definitive proxy statements - typically an annual meeting proxy.

Form DEF 14A, which is also known as "definitive proxy statement", is required under Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. This form is filed with the SEC when a definitive proxy statement is given to shareholders and helps the SEC ensure that shareholders' rights are upheld.
Form S-1
The SEC form S-1 is the initial registration form for new securities required by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for public companies. Any security that meets the criteria must have an S-1 filing before shares can be listed on a national exchange. 

Form S-1 requires companies to provide information on the planned use of capital proceeds, detail the current business model and competition, as well provide a a brief prospectus of the planned security itself, offering price methodology, and any dilution that will occur to other listed securities. The SEC also requires the disclosure of any material business dealings between the company and its directors and outside counsel. 

Form S-1 is also known as the "Registration Statement Under the Securities Exchange Act of 1933". 

Investors can view S-1 filings online to perform due diligence on new offerings prior to their issue. The form is sometimes amended as material information changes or general market conditions cause a delay in the offering. 

The Securities Exchange Act of 1933, often referred to as the "truth in securities" law, requires that these registration forms are filed to disclose important information upon registration of a company's securities. This helps the SEC achieve the objectives of this act, which is requiring investors to receive significant information regarding securities offered, and to prohibit fraud in the sale of the offered securities. 

A less rigid registration form is the S-3, which is for companies that don't have the same ongoing reporting requirements.

Geography[edit]
Haiyang, on the coastline of the western Pacific Ocean, is a county-tier city under the 3-tier administrative system of China. Haiyang has an estimated population of 690,000 and spans over 1,886 square kilometers along the biggest Chinese peninsula, facing South Korea and Japan across the Yellow Sea.
Leisure resorts[edit]
The city, known for its newly discovered primitive beauty[citation needed], is a prime destination for beach sports[citation needed] with its 230 kilometer coastline, and climatically and typographically is quite similar to Scotland. In the past decade, this city has quickly become one of top summer resorts and vacation paradises in China, and in northeast Asia at large.[citation needed]
Historical affiliation[edit]
Haiyang was first settled with Laiyi people, one of peripheral Chinese ethnic minorities, some 2,300 years ago, and was annexed into China proper over centuries of dynasty rule and wars. Haiyang was consecutively under administration of Qi Kingdom in Warring Period, Jiaodong Province in Qin Dynasty, Laizhou Prefecture in Tang, Song and Yuan Dynasties and Dengzhou Prefecture in Ming Dynasty.
Dasongwei Fortress[edit]
In 1389, Dasongwei Fortress, one of the nine coastal Fortresses of the time to guard against Japanese invasion and pirate attacks, was set up to govern both administratively and militarily the today's area of Haiyang, which land was ever called Dansylvania in the 19th century. In 1734, Dasongwei Fortress is officially renamed as Haiyang, which name lasts to date covering the south coast of Shandong Peninsula with an area of more than 3,000 kilometers. In 1947, the newly founded communist government cut off the eastern land of Haiyang to create another county of Rushan, since then Haiyang's 1,886 kilometer area forms a shape of flying phoenix towards west Pacific Ocean.
European settlement[edit]
From the late 19th century until World War I, Haiyang was a strategic town on the route between the two European settlements of Tsingtao and Weihaiwei, respectively taken by Germany in 1898 and Britain in 1898 on lease basis, and commercial and trade activities were active until 1947 when communist troops took over.
Haiyang Port[edit]
Haiyang Port is one of the pivotal ports along south coastline of Shandong Peninsula with sea route connecting Korea, Japan and south Chinese ports. In May 1860, French navy tried to land for taking the fortress and failed. In August 1947, the government troops retreated from the port for Tsingtao after defeat by the communists. In April 1963, the Taiwan-based Chinese nationalist troops tried to land for taking back the city and all were defeated and captured by the paramilitaries. Haiyang Port is today one of the trade ports for the peninsula province with active export-oriented manufactures, and administratively under Qingdao Customs and Port authorities.
Asian Beach Games[edit]
Haiyang with host the 2012 Asian Beach Games, the first ever to be held in China, which was announced by the Olympic Council of Asia in Doha on December 2, 2006.
Vacation facilities[edit]
Haiyang is nicknamed West Pacific Paradise partially due to its literal meaning of the city name, which means Ocean and Sun. With Laoshan mountain range in the northwest and Kunyu maintain range in the northeast, Haiyang boasts the nationwide best facilities of beach sporting and leisure resorts, including but not limited to Tiger Beach Golf Courses, Yachting Clubs, sailing events, Sand Carving Parks, Beach Volleyball Club, Beach Basketball Club, Music Festival, Japanese Village, seaview gardens and terrains, Phoenix Wetland Reserve, National Forest Park and Coast Film Park. Rocky Islands some 80 kilometers off the shore are another vacation resort of the city.
