Why is this contact information displayed? [Close]
The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

          Simone Biles is no match for wisdom teeth anesthesia

      


        Celebrity

          Do ... do the Fox & Friends hosts know how insurance works? 



        WTF

    5 hours ago
  


        A man of his word, @JeffLieber showed up to the office in a Palin-inspired ensemble following John McCain's vote against the Republican's ACA skinny repeal bill.

			Tangible Science Introduces New Contact Lens Coating

Tangible™ Science, LLC, recently introduced its new Tangible™ Hydra-PEG contact lens coating designed to help reduce discomfort.
Reportedly launched at the Global Specialty Lens Symposium held this past weekend in Las Vegas, Tangible Hydra-PEG is a high-water polymer coating permanently bonded to the surface of a contact lens. The new coating has reportedly been shown to improve wettability, increase surface water retention and lubricity, and minimize deposits on the lens.
Through its partnership with Contamac™ the Tangible Hydra-PEG will be offered on its Optimum gas permeable (GP) lenses, and through its partnership with SynergEyes®, the coating will be offered on its Duette® hybrid lens materials.
