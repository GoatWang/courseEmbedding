Objective
The investment objective of the fund is to provide an attractive level of total return, primarily through long term capital appreciation and secondarily through income and gains.
    


Highlights

A unique, highly disciplined mathematical investment strategy designed to seek to achieve long-term returns in excess of the S&P 500 Index (“Alpha”) with equal or less risk than the benchmark
Seeks to provide attractive quarterly distributions

Provides an alternative to index-oriented equity products or passively managed index strategies
Combines investment expertise of two premier managers
INTECH risk-managed mathematical investment process

Nuveen fund management and option strategy execution 






Investment Strategy

  The fund invests in a portfolio of actively managed common stocks selected from among the 500 stocks comprising the S&P 500 Index, using a proprietary mathematical process designed and implemented by INTECH, a sub-adviser of the fund.  The fund also sells custom baskets of call options covering up to 50% of the fund’s equity portfolio in seeking to enhance risk-adjusted performance relative to an all equity portfolio.

Original Investment & Cumulative Distributions is the original investment value added to the cash flow received from distributions. The total returns are not adjusted to reflect the effects of taxation and assume reinvestment of dividends and capital gains.
		

			Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

RISKSInvestment, Market, and Price Risk: Closed-end fund shares are subject to investment risk, including the possible loss of the entire principal amount that you invest.  Common shares frequently trade at a discount to their NAV.  At any point in time, your common shares may be worth less than you paid, even after considering the reinvestment of fund distributions.Common Stock Risk: Common stock returns often have experienced significant volatility.Call Option Risk: The value of call options sold (written) by the fund will fluctuate. The fund may not participate in any appreciation of its equity portfolio as fully as it would if the fund did not sell call options. In addition, the fund will continue to bear the risk of declines in the value of its equity portfolio.Index Call Option Risk: Because index options are settled in cash, sellers of index call options, such as the fund, cannot provide in advance for its potential settlement obligations by acquiring and holding the underlying securitiesTax Risk: The tax treatment of fund distributions may be affected by future changes in tax laws and regulations or their interpretation by the Internal Revenue Service or state tax authorities.
NOTES


					** The premium/discount is calculated as (most recent price/most recent NAV) -1.






†† Managed Distribution Policy

				Historical distribution sources have included net investment income, realized gains and return of capital. If a distribution includes anything other than net investment income, the fund provides a notice of the best estimate of its distribution sources at that time which may be viewed at nuveen.com/CEFdistributions. These estimates may not match the final tax characterization (for the full year’s distributions) contained in shareholders’ 1099-DIV forms after the end of the year. You should not draw any conclusions about a fund’s past or future investment performance from its current distribution rate.
			

				Distribution rates represent the latest declared regular distribution, annualized, relative to the most recent market price and NAV. Special distributions, including special capital gains distributions, are not included in the calculation.
