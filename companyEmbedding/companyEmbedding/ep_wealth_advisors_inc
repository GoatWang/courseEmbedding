What is Tax Planning? Tax Planning Services | EP Wealth Advisors





























































































Services Menu







Tax Strategies: Fuel efficiency for your finances
A key component of financial planning is gaining tax efficiency. EP Wealth Advisors works with you and your tax preparer so you retain as much of your earned income as possible.
We do this in three steps:

Adjusted gross income (AGI)
AGI is what you are taxed on, and there are ways to lower it—like accounting for qualified retirement plans and/or the interest paid on certain debt such as student loans.


Maximize deductions
Once your AGI is established, you can still reduce your tax burden by taking deductions for mortgage interest, charitable gifts, state taxes and more.


Tax credits
You may also qualify for tax credits you weren’t aware of which may reduce your tax burden. Some of the more common tax credits are the earned income credit, tax credits for college expenses, and the adoption of a child.

Tax and legal information is general in nature. It is provided for informational purposes only, and should not be construed as legal or tax advice. EP Wealth Advisors is not engaged in the practice of law or accounting.

Firm will make a Minority Equity Investment in EP Wealth Advisors to Enhance Client Experience and  Support Growth Strategies
TORRANCE, CA (July 10, 2017) — EP Wealth Advisors, a leading independent registered investment advisor based in Torrance, California, today announced a strategic partnership with Wealth Partners Capital Group, LLC (“WPCG”) of West Palm Beach, Florida that will support client demand and growth goals. WPCG will make a minority, non-controlling equity investment in EP Wealth Advisors.  EP Wealth Advisors will continue to run day-to-day operations.
Founded by boyhood friends Derek Holman and Brian Parker, EP Wealth Advisors currently operates eight regional offices throughout California , Colorado and  Washington.  From their early days, Holman and Parker saw an opportunity to provide objective financial advice in the best interest of clients. Since then, EP Wealth Advisors has become one of the most dynamic independent wealth management firms in the country.  Together with EP Wealth Advisors’ President Patrick Goshtigian, the team has grown the firm to nearly $3 billion in assets under management.  EP Wealth Advisors intends to draw on WPCG’s expertise and resources when acquiring other client-centric advisory firms, expanding services, hiring of additional advisory personnel, and investing in technology.
“While many in our industry are adopting more robo-based investment services, we’re doubling down on personal touch,” said Patrick Goshtigian, president of EP Wealth Advisors.  “Money and investments are highly personal issues, and our advisors and staff are driven to make an impact on our clients’ lives and look after all aspects of their financial health. That requires tremendous support.  We help advisors by handling back office support, investment management, financial planning, and other non-advisory aspects of running an independent, fiduciary firm.”
“EP Wealth Advisors has built an outstanding organization with the rare ability to scale and still deliver customized solutions,” said Rich Gill, Senior Partner of WPCG.  “What Derek, Brian, Patrick and the EP team have put together is the model for what a wealth management firm needs to look like going forward: fee-only, with dedicated operational, investment, financial planning, and compliance staff, and a complete focus on providing clients the best advice.”
EP Wealth Advisors was advised on this transaction by Park Sutton Advisors, LLC and by Advice Dynamics Partners, LLC.

Asset Retention Rate
The asset retention rate depicted is calculated for the 2014 fiscal year commencing January 1, 2014 and concluding December 31, 2014. This rate was calculated by comparing the assets at the beginning of the fiscal year versus the assets under management at the end of the 2014 fiscal year end. We then divided EP Wealth Advisors’ assets under management as of the end of the fiscal year (December 31, 2014) by assets being transferred out during the 2014 fiscal year that we determined to be a result of closed or terminated accounts. This asset retention rate is believed to be accurate as of December 31, 2014 and cannot and does not accurately forecast the asset retention rate of any year outside of the year indicated. This rate should not be construed as an endorsement of the advisor by any client nor is it representative of any one client’s evaluation. A high asset retention rate is not an indication or guarantee of investment success and does not ensure that a client or prospective client will experience a higher level of performance or results. No current or prospective client should assume that future asset retention rates will remain at the level depicted. All investments and investment strategies have the potential for profit or loss. Working with an investment advisor or financial planer does not guarantee investment success. The risk of investment loss can never be eliminated. EPWA has used its best efforts to verify the data used to develop the asset retention rate. However, EPWA cannot guarantee that the asset retention rate is unequivocally accurate. This rate should not be used to determine whether to hire EPWA or as an indicator of EPWA’s proficiency.
Third-party rankings
Third-party rankings are no guarantee of future investment success. Working with a highly-ranked adviser does not ensure that you will experience a higher level of performance.
The third-party ranking displayed should not be construed as an endorsement of the advisor by any client nor is it representative of any one client’s evaluation or opinion of the advisor.

Wealth Management Services - Fee Only Financial Advisors | EP Wealth Advisors









































































































Is someone listening to you? Are you comfortable with the process?
It is only by listening and understanding that we can build you a personalized and comprehensive ﬁnancial plan. In collaborating with you, we create a framework that allows us to make thoughtful and prudent decisions. It’s the one way to truly manage the many components of your ﬁnancial future—not just to meet your ﬁnancial goals and objectives, but also to fulﬁll your aspirations.






Our Process: Your Path to Peace of Mind
EP Wealth’s Peace of Mind Planning Model is our cornerstone wealth management process intended to help you build a more solid financial future
Discover
We spend the time with you to develop a comprehensive understanding of your current needs, future goals, and personal or family ambitions—the crucial context needed to plan, invest and forge an effective partnership.
Prioritize
You’ll receive a tailored financial plan that organizes your financials and defines your goals. This financial foundation allows us to make thoughtful decisions together that are in your long-term best interest.
Implement
We work with you to put your plan into action. This includes creating an investment portfolio strategically structured by our in-house investment team, balanced by your goals and your risk tolerance. It reaches beyond securities to encompass your real estate, small business, insurance, college funding, wealth transfer and more to create a resilient, personalized and integrated portfolio.
Monitor
Our goal is to limit the surprises, and our responsibility is to continually keep you informed through transparent reporting and proactive recommendations aligned to your goals and objectives. When you have questions, we will be there to help you.




Our Services
In all of our wealth management services we analyze your unique circumstances and make sure we are working towards your identified goals. As fee-only advisors, we strive to make the process simple and transparent.

At EP Wealth we don’t just talk about these challenges. Our cause and calling is to partner with you to understand your challenges, to make positive change happen and see results, no matter your gender. CONTACT US FOR MORE…

This tool allows you and your advisor to review your overall financial plan, asset allocation and individual investments anytime so when you need to make a financial decision, you have the information to make a prudent decision. CONTACT US FOR MORE…

The better informed you are, the more prudent your decisions will be. Through every step, we help you better understand your financial situation with one on one reviews, investment newsletters and our twice annual Market Outlook events. LEARN MORE…




Our Fundamental Principles
Simplicity
Our goal is to simplify your financial life. Achieving your financial objectives can involve numerous components. Bringing them all together through a team that understands the big picture can significantly simplify your life. We’ve built our Peace of Mind (POM) Planning Model to serve as a comprehensive approach to managing all of your financial needs. This includes the way different life stages can change your goals and needs. So when new issues arise in your life, we’re well prepared to address them.
Transparency
Seeing is believing. That’s why EP Wealth’s POM Planning Model is so valuable: you’ll see the steps in the process beforehand so you know what to expect. And you’ll receive quarterly reports and participate in an annual review so you have a clear understanding of your progress and will address any changes in objectives. Our own approach to business is transparent as well. We’re fee-only advisors—with no products to sell. Because your success is our success, you can be confident that our recommendations are always in your best interest.
Purpose
It’s the why of wealth that ultimately matters. We’re here to help you focus on the “whys” that matter most to you, and arrange your financial resources to achieve them. Whatever your priorities—from financial security to philanthropic causes—we’ll align our capabilities with your goals. The result is performance with a purpose: empowering you to live a more meaningful life.

Investment Management: Your pathway to performance and peace of mind
Portfolio performance is as much about minimizing risk as it is about recognizing upside.
That’s why EP Wealth Advisors’ in-house investment team first understands your risk tolerance and your goals to set your personal asset allocation policy.
Only within that context does EP Wealth Advisors attempt to identify favorable global market conditions and economic sectors poised for growth. Once we’ve narrowed down these favorable conditions, we do extensive proprietary and secondary research to find stocks, Mutual Funds, ETFs, and bonds with track records that give us confidence to project continued growth in the future. This is more than just financial products, our team researches the management, process, returns and fee structures.
In order to further diversify your portfolio and provide you with greater stability, we may invest in alternative investments.
