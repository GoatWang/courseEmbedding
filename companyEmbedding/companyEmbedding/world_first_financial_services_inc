World Financial Group (WFG) is a multi-level marketing company based in Johns Creek, Georgia, a suburb of Atlanta, which sells investment, insurance, and various other financial products through a network of distributors in the United States, Canada, and Puerto Rico.[1][2] It is wholly owned by Transamerica, a subsidiary of Aegon.[3]
World Financial Group associates are compensated by selling financial services products and receiving commission overrides from people that agents sponsor into the company.[4] Associates use "six fundamentals of personal finance" to build financial plans. These fundamentals are cash management, debt management, emergency fund creation, insurance protection (includes life insurance, critical illness insurance, disability insurance etc...), asset accumulation and estate preservation.[5]

History[edit]
World Marketing Alliance (WMA) was founded by Hubert Humphrey after he left Primerica in 1991. The original name was Alexander, Inc. but shortly thereafter was renamed World Marketing Alliance. The original idea was that the baby boomers needed a solution for wealth creation and tax protection, and that the "buy term and invest the difference" philosophy of Primerica (formerly A.L. Williams) could be better addressed with variable universal life insurance.
While in A.L., Humphrey created and introduced the Business Format System (BFS), a business sales and recruiting methodology. Williams continued to develop the methodology in WMA.[6] MD TV, the company's private satellite television network, was also introduced during this period. The company expanded its operations to Canada, Taiwan, Mexico, Puerto Rico, Guam and the Philippines.[6] The company held its first convention in Las Vegas in 1992. It was attended by about 2,000 associates.[6]
On March 23, 1998, WMA Executive World Headquarters opened in Duluth, Georgia. The 100,000-square-foot (9,300 m2) building housed 500+ employees.[6]
In November 1998, WMA was fined $100,000 "for not properly supervising its sales agents" after their clients lost nearly $2 million in unregistered investments.[7][8] In 2000, WMA was fined $125,000 "for failing to report nearly 900 customer complaints".[9]
In June 2001, select assets of WMA were purchased by AEGON and renamed World Financial Group, Inc.[10] Humphrey retained WMA Mortgage Services, Inc. and the original logo, which was used in his subsequent companies World Leadership Group and Hegemon Group International. As part of the conditions of sale, Humphrey was placed on a noncompete agreement and could not compete in the insurance industry until 2013. Following the sale of WMA to Aegon, Alexander Wynaendts, chief executive of AEGON, was quoted as saying, "When we took the company over, we put in place very strict regulatory and compliance procedures".[11]
World Financial Group has over 3,500 offices in the United States.[12] The World Financial Group Canadian division, World Financial Group Insurance Agency of Canada Inc., moved to Toronto, Ontario in February 2012.[13] In 2008, World Financial Group had over 80 Canadian offices and over 1,500 agents.[14]
On July 1, 2013, The MFDA announces that effective immediately, the WFG Securities of Canada Inc. securities dealer is now, Transamerica Securities Inc.[15]
Provider companies[edit]
WFG works with hundreds of product provider companies, including mutual funds and unit investment trusts, and various insurance and financial services-related companies.[16][17]
Regulatory issues[edit]
WFG's stated mission goal is to "serve the financial needs of individuals and families typically overlooked by the financial services industry".[18] It is yet unclear how successfully the company has managed to distance itself from its more controversial U.S.-based predecessor WMA, associated with fraud, misrepresentation and false statements, and the subject of class action lawsuits, and National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) disciplinary action.[19][20] In preparation for Aegon's acquisition in 2001, "World Marketing Alliance 'ramped up' compliance before the acquisition".[21] As reported in the same Bloomberg article, Aegon's Chief Executive Officer Alexander Wynaendts said on Bloomberg TV that "When we took the company over, we put in place very strict regulatory and compliance procedures, Of course, when you have such large numbers of people out there in the field, it is quite an effort. We feel comfortable that we now have the regulatory issues under control."[21]

In March 2011, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) reported that World Group Securities (WGS) had incurred ten regulatory penalties since 2004.[22]
A 2004 NASD disciplinary action report summarized disciplinary actions against WGS. According to the report, WGS "submitted a Letter of Acceptance, Waiver, and Consent in which the firm was censured and fined $15,000. Without admitting or denying the allegations, the firm consented to the described sanctions and to the entry of findings that the firm permitted representatives to act in registered capacities while their registrations were inactive due to their failure to satisfy the Regulatory Element of NASD's Continuing Education Requirements. NASD also found that the firm failed to establish and maintain a supervisory system reasonably designed to assure compliance with the Regulatory Element of the Continuing Education Requirement by its registered representatives."[23]
In December 2006, WGS and one of its brokers were fined $150,000 by Missouri's commissioner of securities for selling unsuitable products to elderly people.[11][2][24][25] Other cases of private arbitration "where variable annuities were allegedly sold to people too old to realize any benefit before they died" were also reported. Utah's Division of Securities has cited at least four WGS brokers since 2006.[21][26]
In April 2007, WGS was fined $50,000 for failing to supervise its representatives in the State of Utah, who were misrepresenting their credentials and services rendered during free lunch seminars targeting seniors.[2][1][27][28][29]
In April 2010, WGS was fined in excess of $850,000 as the result of the unauthorized sale of private securities by some of its agents in the State of Arizona.[30][31]
In November 2010, the SEC ordered WGS to pay, among other things, a civil monetary penalty in the amount of $200,000 for the fraudulent selling of unsuitable securities in the State of California, which were funded using home equity, derived from the refinance of the customers' homes into subprime mortgages.[32][33][34][35]
WFG Securities (Canada) was under investigation by the Manitoba Securities Commission in 2008, after some investors say they ended up in financial situations they did not understand regarding leveraged accounts. The securities commission noted that that World Financial Group "did not have adequate controls and mechanisms in place to fully supervise the leveraged accounts." WFG Securities paid a $250,000 settlement to rectify the situation. Dennis Villarin of Winnipeg, MB, a former agent who opened and trained others to open the above accounts, was stripped of his licensing and charged by the MFDA. They noted that Dennis Villarin and his trainees "made it appear to WFG's supervisory and compliance staff as though the clients satisfied WFG's requirements regarding the use of leveraging, as set out in its policies and procedures."[36][37]
In 2013, WFG Securities (Canada) was restructured and rebranded by Transamerica Corporation and is now known as Transamerica Securities of Canada Inc.

World Financial Group (WFG) is a multi-level marketing company based in Johns Creek, Georgia, a suburb of Atlanta, which sells investment, insurance, and various other financial products through a network of distributors in the United States, Canada, and Puerto Rico.[1][2] It is wholly owned by Transamerica, a subsidiary of Aegon.[3]
World Financial Group associates are compensated by selling financial services products and receiving commission overrides from people that agents sponsor into the company.[4] Associates use "six fundamentals of personal finance" to build financial plans. These fundamentals are cash management, debt management, emergency fund creation, insurance protection (includes life insurance, critical illness insurance, disability insurance etc...), asset accumulation and estate preservation.[5]

History[edit]
World Marketing Alliance (WMA) was founded by Hubert Humphrey after he left Primerica in 1991. The original name was Alexander, Inc. but shortly thereafter was renamed World Marketing Alliance. The original idea was that the baby boomers needed a solution for wealth creation and tax protection, and that the "buy term and invest the difference" philosophy of Primerica (formerly A.L. Williams) could be better addressed with variable universal life insurance.
While in A.L., Humphrey created and introduced the Business Format System (BFS), a business sales and recruiting methodology. Williams continued to develop the methodology in WMA.[6] MD TV, the company's private satellite television network, was also introduced during this period. The company expanded its operations to Canada, Taiwan, Mexico, Puerto Rico, Guam and the Philippines.[6] The company held its first convention in Las Vegas in 1992. It was attended by about 2,000 associates.[6]
On March 23, 1998, WMA Executive World Headquarters opened in Duluth, Georgia. The 100,000-square-foot (9,300 m2) building housed 500+ employees.[6]
In November 1998, WMA was fined $100,000 "for not properly supervising its sales agents" after their clients lost nearly $2 million in unregistered investments.[7][8] In 2000, WMA was fined $125,000 "for failing to report nearly 900 customer complaints".[9]
In June 2001, select assets of WMA were purchased by AEGON and renamed World Financial Group, Inc.[10] Humphrey retained WMA Mortgage Services, Inc. and the original logo, which was used in his subsequent companies World Leadership Group and Hegemon Group International. As part of the conditions of sale, Humphrey was placed on a noncompete agreement and could not compete in the insurance industry until 2013. Following the sale of WMA to Aegon, Alexander Wynaendts, chief executive of AEGON, was quoted as saying, "When we took the company over, we put in place very strict regulatory and compliance procedures".[11]
World Financial Group has over 3,500 offices in the United States.[12] The World Financial Group Canadian division, World Financial Group Insurance Agency of Canada Inc., moved to Toronto, Ontario in February 2012.[13] In 2008, World Financial Group had over 80 Canadian offices and over 1,500 agents.[14]
On July 1, 2013, The MFDA announces that effective immediately, the WFG Securities of Canada Inc. securities dealer is now, Transamerica Securities Inc.[15]
Provider companies[edit]
WFG works with hundreds of product provider companies, including mutual funds and unit investment trusts, and various insurance and financial services-related companies.[16][17]
Regulatory issues[edit]
WFG's stated mission goal is to "serve the financial needs of individuals and families typically overlooked by the financial services industry".[18] It is yet unclear how successfully the company has managed to distance itself from its more controversial U.S.-based predecessor WMA, associated with fraud, misrepresentation and false statements, and the subject of class action lawsuits, and National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) disciplinary action.[19][20] In preparation for Aegon's acquisition in 2001, "World Marketing Alliance 'ramped up' compliance before the acquisition".[21] As reported in the same Bloomberg article, Aegon's Chief Executive Officer Alexander Wynaendts said on Bloomberg TV that "When we took the company over, we put in place very strict regulatory and compliance procedures, Of course, when you have such large numbers of people out there in the field, it is quite an effort. We feel comfortable that we now have the regulatory issues under control."[21]

In March 2011, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) reported that World Group Securities (WGS) had incurred ten regulatory penalties since 2004.[22]
A 2004 NASD disciplinary action report summarized disciplinary actions against WGS. According to the report, WGS "submitted a Letter of Acceptance, Waiver, and Consent in which the firm was censured and fined $15,000. Without admitting or denying the allegations, the firm consented to the described sanctions and to the entry of findings that the firm permitted representatives to act in registered capacities while their registrations were inactive due to their failure to satisfy the Regulatory Element of NASD's Continuing Education Requirements. NASD also found that the firm failed to establish and maintain a supervisory system reasonably designed to assure compliance with the Regulatory Element of the Continuing Education Requirement by its registered representatives."[23]
In December 2006, WGS and one of its brokers were fined $150,000 by Missouri's commissioner of securities for selling unsuitable products to elderly people.[11][2][24][25] Other cases of private arbitration "where variable annuities were allegedly sold to people too old to realize any benefit before they died" were also reported. Utah's Division of Securities has cited at least four WGS brokers since 2006.[21][26]
In April 2007, WGS was fined $50,000 for failing to supervise its representatives in the State of Utah, who were misrepresenting their credentials and services rendered during free lunch seminars targeting seniors.[2][1][27][28][29]
In April 2010, WGS was fined in excess of $850,000 as the result of the unauthorized sale of private securities by some of its agents in the State of Arizona.[30][31]
In November 2010, the SEC ordered WGS to pay, among other things, a civil monetary penalty in the amount of $200,000 for the fraudulent selling of unsuitable securities in the State of California, which were funded using home equity, derived from the refinance of the customers' homes into subprime mortgages.[32][33][34][35]
WFG Securities (Canada) was under investigation by the Manitoba Securities Commission in 2008, after some investors say they ended up in financial situations they did not understand regarding leveraged accounts. The securities commission noted that that World Financial Group "did not have adequate controls and mechanisms in place to fully supervise the leveraged accounts." WFG Securities paid a $250,000 settlement to rectify the situation. Dennis Villarin of Winnipeg, MB, a former agent who opened and trained others to open the above accounts, was stripped of his licensing and charged by the MFDA. They noted that Dennis Villarin and his trainees "made it appear to WFG's supervisory and compliance staff as though the clients satisfied WFG's requirements regarding the use of leveraging, as set out in its policies and procedures."[36][37]
In 2013, WFG Securities (Canada) was restructured and rebranded by Transamerica Corporation and is now known as Transamerica Securities of Canada Inc.

Untitled Document
 
Face your future with optimism
No matter what financial challenges you face – whether it’s debt, limited savings and investments, or lack of life insurance — they can be resolved successfully. By providing you with a better understanding of your financial situation and access to products and solutions that are appropriate for your specific goals, your WFG associate can help you achieve your dreams.



Common Challenges
WFG believes that having a solid understanding of the challenges families and individuals throughout North America face is an important first step to overcoming them.




Credit Card Debt & Poor Savings
Cost of College
Retirement Savings
Social Security
Rising Cost of Living
Unexpected Loss





Credit Card Debt & Poor Savings
If you have high credit card balances, little to no savings and no understanding of how much savings is enough, you are not alone.
In a recent survey by BankRate.com, nearly 30 percent of Americans say they have more credit card debt than emergency savings; and some 17 percent report having neither emergency savings nor credit card debt.1
TransUnion’s quarterly analysis of Canadian credit trends found that the average consumer’s total debt (excluding mortgage) in Q4 2013 increased to $27,368.2
Too much credit card debt and limited savings can be major threats your family’s current and future prosperity. Since consumer debt can have a negative impact on your future, you have to find ways to avoid it or eliminate it, so that you can build an emergency fund and start saving for your future.
1. Constantine von Hoffman, “Close to half of Americans have more credit card debt than savings,” MoneyWatch, Feb.18, 2014, http://www.cbsnews.com/news/51-percent-have-enough-cash-to-pay-off-credit-card-debt-study/.
2. TransUnion, “Delinquency Rates Drop as Consumer Debt Surprisingly Remains Nearly the Same During Fourth Quarter,” Press release, Feb. 26, 2014, http://newsroom-en.transunion.ca/article/?id=1812220.






Cost of College
If you’re a parent, you’re probably aware that the cost of a college degree has been increasing steadily, year after year, throughout North America.
In the United States, the cost (tuition, fees, books, room and board, and other expenses) for an in-state public college for the 2013–14 academic year averaged $22,826; while the cost of private college averaged $44,750..1
Similarly, in Canada, the cost of a university degree is increasing, with tuition and other compulsory fees expected to triple from 1990 to 2017.2
Trends like these are likely to persist. So you have to start planning for your children’s education now, even as you continue to meet your day-to-day expenses and save for retirement.

Retirement Savings
Many people face an uncertain retirement. According to a recent study, many U.S. workers say they have virtually no savings or investments. Excluding the value of their home and defined benefit plans, 60 percent of the workers surveyed say their household savings and investments is less than $25,000.1
In Canada, although more people are making contributions to their RRSPs, three-quarters (77%) of those with RRSPs indicate they won’t be making the maximum allowable contribution in 2014.2
It may be because they do not know how much money they need to save to cover their expenses once they stop working; or they may not earn enough income to start saving.
Today, people face a different retirement reality. The traditional model that saw your parents or grandparents through their golden years – a company pension, a government-sponsored savings plan like Social Security or the Canadian Pension Plan, and their own personal savings – is in upheaval. There are fewer companies offering pensions and government programs are uncertain. Now, people who want a secure retirement have to rely more heavily on their own personal savings.

2. RBC, “RRSPs rebound: more Canadians holding RRSPs, making contributions, says RBC Poll,” Press release, Feb. 5, 2014, http://www.rbc.com/newsroom/news/2014/20140205-wave2-rrsp.html.





Social Security
In the United States, Social Security may not be a reliable source of income in the near future. According to recent projections,1 the program’s key trust fund will be depleted by 2035. That’s why you have to plan for the possibility that you may receive partial Social Security benefits when you retire – or none at all.
1. The 2013 Annual Report of the Board of Trustees of The Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance and Federal Disability Insurance Trust Funds, p. 3, http://www.socialsecurity.gov/OACT/TR/2013/tr2013.pdf





Rising Cost of Living
Did you know the amount of money you earn today will have less value tomorrow, and even less 20 years from now? Have you considered the rising cost of
living in your financial strategy? To show how this can affect you, take a look at the following example:
If you and your spouse are each 45 years old, earn $100,000 per year and plan to retire in 20 years, and if inflation averages 4.5% during the next two decades, you will need more than $241,000 a year to equal your current $100,000 annual income.





Unexpected Loss
What if you were to pass away unexpectedly? Without proper planning – whether through life insurance and/or emergency savings – your family could face serious financial issues due to funeral costs, credit card bills, and more. Proper insurance coverage can help you guard against the impact of such losses.

Life Insurance 1
Since different people have different financial needs, licensed WFG Associates offer a variety of life insurance policies to help meet your financial goals. Some policies feature premiums that remain constant for the life of the policy. Cash value policies allow you to access the policy value once it is sufficient through policy loans or withdrawals.
In the United States a variable universal life insurance2 policy combines permanent life insurance with investment options. The policy owner may direct net premiums to a variety of investment options to match his/her investment objectives. These account options have the potential to build cash value over time. However, the return and principal value of the investment options will fluctuate and when redeemed, they may be worth more or less than their original cost.
Policy loans and withdrawals reduce the cash value and death benefit and loans are subject to interest charges. If a policy is surrendered or lapses while a loan is outstanding, adverse tax consequences may result. Consult with your tax advisor regarding the effect of policy loans and withdrawals for your particular situation.
Be sure that you’re aware of and understand the several different fees and charges associated with different types of life Insurance policies.
Speak to your licensed WFG associate, who can help you determine which type of life insurance you need and the optimal coverage level.

Long-Term Care 1

It pays to be ready in the event that you or someone you love will need help performing basic tasks of daily living. When setting your financial strategy and goals, talk to your WFG licensed associate to see if long-term care insurance is an option for you.

Cash Flow
When you create your financial strategy, it’s important to know how much money you have access to and how, if possible, you can increase that amount. This money is your cash flow and can help you accomplish many things, including reducing or eliminating debt and increasing your savings.
Here are some strategies you can use to increase your cash flow:

Create a budget for your monthly expenses and needs – and stick to it
Spend less than you earn
Raise deductibles on your auto, homeowners and other insurance policies, which can help to lower premium
Look for ways to earn higher interest on money that is currently in low-interest savings accounts
Start a second career or a part-time business to earn additional income

Your WFG associate can help you evaluate your current cash flow and assist you in finding ways to increase it.





Proper Protection
A big part of building a sound financial strategy is life insurance. Life insurance helps protect your loved ones in the event of your death. It not only helps replace lost income, but it can also help preserve your family’s assets.
A basic rule of thumb is to have enough life insurance to provide approximately 10 times your annual family income. For example, if your current household income is $50,000, you may want to consider having $500,000 in life insurance protection.
A WFG associate can evaluate of your financial situation to help you determine how much life insurance you need.
*In the United States, products and services offered through WFG’s affiliated companies, which include World Financial Group Insurance Agency, Inc. and Transamerica Financial Advisors, Inc. Associates must be properly licensed and appointed to sell insurance- and securities-related products.

Non-securities products and services are not offered through WFGS.





Debt Management
One of the biggest obstacles to a sound financial future is consumer debt. It’s important to have a strategy that can help reduce and eliminate debt.
Here are some approaches you can take:

Pay more than the minimum, as much as possible within your budget, on the credit card/ loan with the highest interest rate. Once you pay off that credit card/loan, begin paying off the next highest interest rate credit card/loan.
Consider transferring credit card/loan balances to a card with a low interest rate that is offering a promotional, no fee transfer option. Don’t hesitate to call the issuers of all your credit cards to ask for a lower rate.
Quit charging. Put your credit cards away so you don’t consider charging on them while you’re paying down your debt or after it’s paid off.

There are many other things you can do to reduce debt. Work with your WFG associate to find strategies that you can work for you.





Emergency Fund
No matter how much you plan in life, the unexpected happens. To prepare for life’s little “disasters,” set up an emergency fund to help pay for any resulting expenses. A basic rule of thumb for determining how much you should set aside is three- to six-months of your total expenses.
Don’t think you need an emergency fund? Consider these potential expenses and scenarios:

Major car repairs
Major home repairs
Major appliance repairs or replacement
Loss of a job
Serious illness or hospitalization
Extended elder care or long-term care

Having an extra source of funds gives your family peace of mind during a stressful time.





Build Wealth
When developing your financial strategy, it’s important to ensure you put a long-term asset accumulation program in place that strives to outpace inflation and reduce taxation. When determining the best program for you, ask yourself the following questions:

How long do I expect live?
How much it will cost to live comfortably during those years?

There are key financial concepts that can help you as address these questions. For example, the Rule of 72 is an estimation of the time it takes for money to double.* Additionally, understanding the cost of waiting gives you an idea of the financial advantage of starting to save today.
Your WFG associate can explain these and other financial concepts to you, and help you develop a strategy based on your needs.
* The Rule of 72 is a mathematical concept that approximates the number of years it will take to double the principal at a constant rate of return compounded over time. All figures are for illustrative purposes only, and do not reflect the risks, expenses or charges associated with an actual investment. The rate of return of investments fluctuates over time and, as a result, the actual time it will take an investment to double in value cannot be predicted with any certainty. Results are rounded for illustrative purposes. Actual results in each case are slightly higher or lower.





Preserve Wealth
An essential part of your financial strategy is ensuring that the wealth you accumulated over the years is not impacted by taxes or other unintended consequences. A well-designed strategy can:

Eliminate probate costs
Help manage estate taxes
Ensure your legacy reaches your intended heirs, including any life insurance coverage, pensions and annuities
Provide an opportunity to set up medical and financial powers of attorney so that, should you become incapacitated, someone can take care of your finances, make medical decisions for you and more

Please consult with your attorney and/or tax advisor for guidance regarding your specific circumstances.*
* Tax and/or legal advice are not offered by World Financial Group Inc., World Financial Group Canada Inc, their affiliated companies or their independent associates. Please consult with your personal tax and/or legal professional for further guidance.

                            The Clearing House and FIS Laud Federal Reserve’s Faster Payments Task Force’s Final Report

The Clearing House and FIS Laud Federal Reserve’s Faster Payments Task Force’s Final Report


​Washington, DC – Today, The Clearing House (TCH) and FIS welcomed the Federal Reserve’s Faster Payments Task Force’s final report which presents a roadmap for achieving competitive, safe, ubiquitous, and faster payments.  The Task Force was created by the Federal Reserve and is comprised of more than 300 stakeholders with an interest in U.S. payments.  The Task Force was called on to collectively identify criteria for end-to-end solutions that would produce effective 21st century payments systems and task force members were invited to put forward proposals that meet the Task Force’s recommendations.    
TCH and FIS were active participants in the Task Force’s initiative and submitted a joint proposal for evaluation of TCH’s Real-Time Payments (RTP) system, which is targeted to launch  later this year.  TCH enlisted the help of FIS to help achieve ubiquity by offering enhanced RTP services to more than 3,000 financial institutions.  
“The Federal Reserve Faster Payments Task Force’s final report marks a significant milestone in the path toward faster payments in the U.S.,” said Russ Waterhouse, Executive Vice President, Product Development and Strategy at The Clearing House.  “The Task Force ran an inclusive and collaborative process that resulted in recommendations that will drive better private sector solutions that benefit businesses and consumers across the country. Its work was instrumental in helping us design and build our real-time payments system, which we expect to start supporting transactions later this year.”
“FIS has been implementing real-time payment schemes around the globe since 2009 and we draw important lessons from these projects every day,” said Anthony Jabbour COO, Banking and Payments, FIS. “Speed, ubiquity and ease of use lead to high adoption rates and relevant payment solutions that banks can offer to their retail, small business and corporate clients. FIS understands the specialized risks inherent in a real time payments scheme, and that’s why we focus on minimizing risk to support systems, and ensure appropriate fraud prevention measures are taken into account. All this is vital to gain large-scale user uptake and thus turn a real-time payments vision into real-time business value for all.” 
The Task Force defined 36 effectiveness criteria grouped into the six categories: Ubiquity, Efficiency, Safety and Security, Speed (Fast), Legal, and Governance.  These criteria were critical in helping TCH as it worked to design and build its RTP system.  TCH and FIS were pleased that their proposal was found to have met each of the criteria necessary for a modern 21st century payment system established by the Task Force.   TCH’s RTP system also aligns with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s “Consumer Protection Principles” for faster payment systems. 
About The Clearing HouseThe Clearing House is a banking association and payments company that is owned by the largest commercial banks and dates back to 1853.  The Clearing House Payments Company L.L.C. owns and operates core payments system infrastructure in the United States and is currently working to modernize that infrastructure by building a new, ubiquitous, real-time payment system.  The Payments Company is the only private-sector ACH and wire operator in the United States, clearing and settling nearly $2 trillion in U.S. dollar payments each day, representing half of all commercial ACH and wire volume.  Its affiliate, The Clearing House Association L.L.C., is a nonpartisan organization that engages in research, analysis, advocacy and litigation focused on financial regulation that supports a safe, sound and competitive banking system.

World Financial Group - Bad products from misinformed, well-meaning people.




                                    I joined WFG thinking that I was truly joining a non-captive financial services agency. Soon, I realized that all of the hoopla about licensing, securities, and product training was secondary to recruit and recruit. Also, the "best training" comes from buying the...

Current Vacancies










Who we are
World First was born back in 2004 by two innovators in a South London basement armed with ten years of banking experience, an entrepreneurial spirit and a desire to provide customers a real alternative to the big banks. Since then, we’ve grown exponentially and with a global team around 600 strong, have become a market-leading, multi-award winning, bank-beating, rapidly-growing, fun-loving international payments company.
People are at the heart of everything we do. Our business is built on relationships with our clients, suppliers, and partners. And we’re inspired to make our customers’ lives just a little bit better each day by helping them to move their money around the world, brilliantly. But what’s the real secret behind our continued success? Hands down, we’re powered by the dynamic and passionate World First family.
People First
At World First, we particularly value the following behaviours, which means that we look for examples of these when we hire, promote and reward World Firsters.








Always approachable and prepared to make time for others. Transparent and fair with our customers and each other.
Open 




Appreciate and value the work of those around you – united we stand! Treat every customer as if they’re your own.
Selfless 




Seek to understand our strategy, market, customers and each other. Always on the look out to make good things great.
Curious 




Dare to do and be bold - not afraid of taking smart risks that you can justify. Challenge assumptions and be confident to make suggestions.
Courageous




Seek to share information and make complex things simple. Know when to make a contribution and when to seek help.
Collaborative 




Take ownership for the work you do and the results you deliver. Inspire others with your thirst for excellence.
Accountable 







Life at World First
From day one you’ll find yourself a part of our friendly, innovative and internationally collaborative team. We are driven and inspired and our workplace reflects that.

Our People First culture means our staff is empowered to take chances and build real connections. And, we offer opportunities to grow – whether that means joining one of our international offices (think: London, Hong Kong, Singapore, Amsterdam, Austin or Sydney) or broadening your skillset through training from our dedicated learning and development team.

A company who offers everything that Primerica offers and more, for example whole life, n other products that are not the best for your clients is not good.

NOTE: I'll happily retract this statement if this turns out to be a bump in the road. But claims of thousands of extra income every week is a joke. Please don't fall for this.

GeneralFAQ
PaymentsFAQ
Online platform for businessFAQ
Online sellersFAQ






Do you charge fees for payments or wire transfers? 

That's an easy answer: We don't charge fees when you make a personal transfer with us for over $10,000. For personal transfers under $10,000 we charge $10.
For our business clients though, there are fees but we agree to a fee structure that reflects how much business we do together.
And there are no fees if you’re an online seller transferring funds back to domestic accounts.
Sometimes the banks in the middle and at the end will take a charge, so it seems that not all the money has been sent but we try our best to make sure all your money gets to where it needs to by covering correspondent and receiving charges where we can.





How do I open an account with you? How long will it take? 

If you want to open an account for personal use you can do it over the phone or online. Over the phone shouldn't take longer than 10 minutes. It's super-fast to open an account online too - we can usually get you up and running within an hour (we'll need to verify your identity).
Business clients and online sellers can open an account online and our team will get you sorted out as fast as they can.




How much can I transact with World First? 

You can transact any amount over $1000 (or equivalent in other currencies).




Can I buy vacation money or cash from you? 

At World First we can help make international payments from one bank account to another. We can't help you out with your vacation money or cash.




Is my money safe with you? Are you regulated? 

Ensuring the safety and security of your money is central to our business.
We are incorporated in the USA (Delaware State Division of Corporations) and are registered as a Money Services Business in the United States with FinCEN and are registered as a non-depository financial institution with the Nationwide Multistate Licensing System. We are required to hold sufficient capital to protect our business and further safeguard our customers. We maintain high levels of capital and have a 3A2 credit rating from Dun and Bradstreet. If you'd like a bank reference for us please give us a call, we'd be happy to oblige. You can find out more about where the companies under the World First Group are registered and regulated here.
You'll find full information on our security page, where you can also download our audited financial statements.




How do you save me money compared to a bank? 

We always try to quote you a better rate than your bank and if you're quoted a better rate, we'll match it – we've even got a promise (find out more here). Savings are usually from 0.25% up to 4% of the amount being transferred. We only charge a $10 fee when you are transferring less than $10,000 for personal transfers and we try to cover third party fees where we can (i.e. the fees from the banks who handle the transfer along the way).




So how do you make money then? 

The rate you usually see on online currency converters is the Interbank Rate. This is the rate that banks and large financial institutions use to trade with each other. It is not the same as the rate they offer you. They quote you a different rate and that's where they make their money. This is known as the spread, or the margin. We make our money by taking a smaller margin and passing that saving on to you.




Can I fix an exchange rate for a future date? 

Yes, you can lock in a rate now for a date up to 3 years in the future. This is often called a forward contract. You might need to pay an initial deposit and then the balance will be due at the end of the contract. If the rates move against you may need to top up the deposit. Your account manager will explain and discuss this with you before you book your forward. This can be ideal if you want to know exactly how much you'll get when you come to make your transfer.




What if I am unhappy with the service I receive from World First? 

If you're unhappy with any aspect of your transaction with us, please contact your relationship manager. Your complaint will always be investigated and you'll receive a formal response.

How long does a transfer take?


This depends on a couple of things, including the currency you're sending or buying, the bank used and the size of the transaction.
If it's sterling, US dollars or euros then we'll usually make a same-day payment when we receive your cleared funds. The payment will arrive fully cleared with your bank the same day though they may not credit your account until the next business day.
With other currencies, we send your payment out on the date agreed but you'll need to allow one to four days for your funds to reach the recipient. The length of time depends on the currency. For example for Swedish kroner, it will be 1 day; for East Caribbean Dollars it could be 4 days. Transfers to Australia and New Zealand will usually clear within 24 hours.
If you're sending USD to another country (not the US) then you should allow up to 4 days for it to clear.
If you need funds to arrive by a particular date please call us for advice and accurate information for the country you are sending funds to.
In rare circumstances delays may occur. World First will do everything reasonably possible to ensure that funds arrive on time but is not liable for delays caused by intermediary or receiving banks.




Will you accept funds from a different source or account?


Yes we can receive funds from an account in a different name to yours, but due to Anti Money Laundering regulations we will need to verify the source. Please contact us for more details.




How do you pay me or my nominated beneficiary?


We are a member of SWIFT network (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication) - the main system used throughout the financial world to make payments securely  with speed, certainty and confidence. Once we've received your cleared funds we pay the account(s) on the agreed date. We'll send you confirmation in a PDF to let you know everything has gone through.
Please note that the funds will arrive in the beneficiary's account from World First, rather than your name.  There will be a reference which starts with WFPAY followed by a sequence of numbers.




What payment / beneficiary details do I need to be able to send funds?



Europe - IBAN and SWIFT
Canada - account number, SWIFT and Transit code
Australia - account number,  SWIFT or BSB code
New Zealand -  account number, 6 digit bank code and SWIFT
USA - account number, ABA routing number or SWIFT
UK - account number and sort code or SWIFT and IBAN
India - account number, SWIFT and IFSC number, reason for transfer
China - account number, SWIFT
Mexico - account number, (Clabe no). and SWIFT

Please call us for information on other countries.




Where do I send my money to?


Once you've booked your trade, you'll receive an email confirmation which includes our client bank account details.  It'll also tell you when you need to send the money to us by.




When do I have to send my money to you?


When you book your trade, you will be given a 'funds in' date based on the method you chose for sending funds to us. You need to make sure that your funds are with us and cleared by that date.




How do I send my money to World First?


For your first personal transfer with us, we ask you send us your money by wire transfer.  For subsequent transfers we are able to receive funds via ACH Direct Debit. For personal transfers, there’s an initial transaction limit of $25,000, and $50,000 for transfers thereafter. For business transfers you can send us your money by wire transfer or ACH direct debit. Please speak to your account manager who will help get this set up for you.




How does the method I choose for sending fund to World First affect my trade?


We can only send payments once your funds are with us and have cleared.




What is the cut-off time for sending money to World First?


You can send funds to World First at any time as long as they are cleared by the date of the outgoing payment on your trade confirmation. If your funds aren't yet with us, your payment won't leave.




When will my payment go out to my beneficiary?


We'll make the payment to your beneficiary on the date we agree when you book your trade. Your beneficiary might not be able to access the money right away as their bank might take some time to clear the funds for them.
Please note that the funds will arrive in the beneficiary's account from World First, rather than your name.  There will be a reference which starts with WFPAY followed by a sequence of numbers.




How will my payment appear in my beneficiary's account?


As we are making the payment on your behalf, the funds will arrive in your beneficiary's account from World First and not in your name.  There will also be a reference which starts with WFPAY and followed by a sequence of numbers.  Make sure to let your recipient know just in case they're expecting to see the money arrive in your name.




Can I make a same-day payment?


Yes, you can book a same-day transfer for a large number of currencies and the earlier you book your trade, the better. To make a same-day outgoing payment in EUR, USD or GBP, you will need to have your cleared funds with us by the times below (given in EST time)

EUR payments: 10:00
GBP payments: 10:50
USD payments: 11:00

If we receive your funds after these times we will still try our best to make the payment on the same day.





What happens if my funds don't arrive?


This doesn't often happen, but if your funds don't arrive within the expected timescale, then let us know as soon as possible so that we can set up an investigation with our bank. We will continue to liaise with our bank until the issue has been resolved and the beneficiary has received the funds, and we promise to keep you informed every step of the way.
Don't forget: the payment will show as coming from World First, and not your name - so keep an eye out for World First on your statement.  The payment will have a reference that starts with WFPAY followed by a sequence of numbers.

This will allow you to add multiple payments and book a larger trade to cover all of them.




I have several trades and wish to make one payment from them - how can I do this?

I need my payment to go out sooner than the online system will let me - how can I change this? 

First of all, try choosing a different way of sending funds to World First. If you send funds to us by wire transfer rather than direct debit, you should be given an earlier payment date. Remember that there are some currencies that we can't buy for the same day or the day after. If you are still unsure, please get in touch with your account manager.

                                We reserve the right to close accounts where they are inactive or the transaction turnover is very low over a three month period.

There is a mandatory currency conversion, please make sure that the account is denominated in a different currency to the one you hold in your World First account. If you are unsure on any of your bank details please check them with your bank.




How long do payments take to credit my account? 

USD payments credit the same day as they are paid out. EUR, GBP and other currency payments take 1-4 days to credit from the day they are paid out. If you're sending USD to China this can take up to 4 days to credit.
                                In rare circumstances delays may occur. World First will do everything reasonably possible to ensure that funds arrive on time but is not liable for delays caused by intermediary or receiving banks.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
