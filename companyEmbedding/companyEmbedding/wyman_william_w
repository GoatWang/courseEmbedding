In 2001, Mr. Wyman served as the Chief Executive Officer of Predictive Systems, Inc., a systems consulting and installation company. In 1984, Mr. Wyman co-founded Oliver Wyman and Company, a management consulting firm serving large financial institutions. He served as Managing Partner until 1995, when he became a counselor to chief executives of several companies, and a director for a number of companies in the technology and financial sectors. Mr. Wyman serves as a director of Castle Harlan, a private equity firm; Sprout Group, a private equity firm; and Allston Holding LLC, a private proprietary trading firm. From 2005 to 2009, he served as a director and member of the Audit Committee of Datascope Corp., a public company that manufactures medical devices. In 2014, Mr. Wyman joined ProMIS Neurosciences, Inc. (formerly Amorfix Life Sciences) as Chairman of the Board.
