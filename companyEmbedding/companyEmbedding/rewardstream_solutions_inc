Who trades options the most? Millennial investors
              
              Millennials are frequently criticized by market experts for the way they invest—or, more accurately, the way they’re not investing—but recent research indicates that at least some young market participants are going about things in a more sophisticated way than they’re typically given credit for.

Dollar turns lower for the week following GDP report
              
              The U.S. dollar fell on Friday, erasing its gains for the week after a read on economic growth came in below expectations, though analysts said the beleaguered currency was potentially nearing a bottom.

Dollar rises from 13-month low
              
              The U.S. dollar rises on Thursday, gaining against major rivals in what analysts suggest a mild consolidation following precipitous declines over recent weeks.

It's a good match: a "refer a friend" rewards tracker with an online promotional products provider


 

Online shoppers receive rewards for referring a friend








	Automated referral marketing solutions specialist Rewardstream Solutions Inc (CVE:REW) is to provide its ‘refer-a-friend’ program for promotional products provider iPromo.

	iPromo is an online provider of high-quality promotional products for more than 45,000 customers around the world, including most Fortune 500 companies, Rewardstream noted.

	Rewardstream’s platform will enable iPromo’s customers to refer their friends and business colleagues using email, social media applications and word-of-mouth.

	The RewardStream platform will handle all of the online interactions, data analysis, fraud detection and reward management, making it a simple, integrated offering for iPromo.

	"iPromo offers their customers exceptional products and services through their online e-commerce platform, and now they'll be able to leverage their strong customer relationships to acquire new business through referrals,” said Rob Goehring, chief executive officer of RewardStream.

	Leo Friedman, Goehring’s counterpart at iPromo said iPromo places a high value on the loyalty of its customers.

	"We know how important referrals are to our business, and we love being able to make our promotional products and services available to new customers," Friedman said.

	Rewardstream's platform makes it easy for a person using an online store to invite their friends to also use the store, in return for which they – and the friends who respond to the referrals – receive a reward. All activity is tracked in Rewardstream's high-volume and scalable referral platform.

	RewardStream said it offers the largest number of referral options with support for email, Facebook, Twitter, Gmail, text message, WhatsApp, face-to-face and many other social channels.
