Company Details
More About Mark HellersteinChildren/Families“Adventure in Ventriloquism”Kids 6-12 and their families will love an “Adventure in Ventriloquism” as they take a time machine into the past and travel to Dr. Frankenstein’s castle where Mark and friends recreate the famous experiment. Not only do kids participate in the program, but Mark provides special sound effects and surprises.  Great laughs are added with Pansy, the baby chimpanzee, and Willy Worm, the bookworm.  Laughs keep coming as a member of the audience is invited on stage to become a “live” puppet.“Adventure in Reading”Willy Worm takes kids on an “Adventure in Reading” where they not only explore how reading opens up a world of learning, but also why reading is important. They also learn about “classics” and how to use their imagination. A highlight is when Willy tells them a hilarious “fractured” version of a story he has just read. Kids are amazed when a drawing of a classic book comes to life before their eyes.“Colorado History and Classic Books”History and learning is great fun for grades 4-9.  “Torrance N. Tabor,” a mining prospector from the early days of Colorado, together with “Buckaroo Buddy”, a wagon trail master, take kids on a historical journey that is fun, funny and educational. They will also learn about classic books and enjoy the re-creation of the Frankenstein operation. “Puppet and Ventriloquism Workshops”Workshops provide a wonderful opportunity for kids to explore the art of puppetry and ventriloquism.  In many ways puppetry incorporates most of the performing arts:  theatre, acting, music, staging and scripting.  Workshops are tailored to the client’s needs—from a 1 hour tutorial to six 1 ½ hour sessions which includes lessons of voice, puppet manipulation / synchronization,  puppet making, storytelling and scripting, staging and ventriloquism.  Lots of learning tools including video clips, live demonstrations, hands-on playing with puppets, actual student performances, puppet making, power point and much, much more.A favorite at Elementary Schools and Scouts:Parr, Lincoln Academy, St. Mary’s Academy, Teller, Wyco, Steck, Eldorado, Larkspur, Lumberg, North Mor, Palmer, Hay, Federal Heights, Fletcher Miller, Clayton, Twain, Coronado Hills, Cottonwood, Greenwood, Dartmouth, Monaco, F.M. Day, Cory, Alice Terry, South, Fulton, High Plains, Graland McElwain, Polton, Stedman, Bradley, Ashley, Bromwell, Goddard, Pitt-Waller and many more!

Corporate Entertainer & Ventriloquist For Adult Shows & Event in Denver CO | Puppets & Things on Strings







































































303-378-5392


   








 	  Event Entertainer and Adult VentriloquistProfessor Penwell literally comes to life right before your eyes as Mark Hellerstein draws a picture of the Professor… and suddenly he begins talking. Moments later he magically appears “in person”. But the fun really begins through his lovable adult comedy. He is gentle and clean, but strictly adult. His humor can be personalized to make your special occasion really memorable. The Professor not only sings simultaneously with Mark, but he performs his version of the famous Houdini “Great Escape”. You will not believe your eyes.
 

Mark provides a “Tribute to Sammy King”. Sammy and Francisco performed over 25,000 times on stages throughout the world, including the Aladdin Hotel (Las Vegas), Crazy Horse (Paris), Harrah’s (Reno), Palm Springs Follies, not to mention the Ed Sullivan Show. This amazing act is described as “the best 12 minutes in the business.” Sammy asked Mark to carry on this timeless classic act. Enjoy this hilarious adult program.
The audience becomes part of the show as Mark invites seven members of the audience to audition as his new “dummy”. Not only do the volunteers have the time of their life, but the audience will be rolling in the aisles.
 

For a little edgier adult comedy, meet Julius P. Morgan. Mr. Morgan was one of the most successful businessmen in the country and is now living under the 20th St. Bridge as a homeless person. Mr. Morgan rose from rags to riches by searching for renewable energy…he found a bottle of Viagra. But his fortunes unravel as he meets the many loves of his life, including Candy DooTell and Clara Clapper, the cage wrestler known as the Cage Killer. Audiences fall in love with this very endearing character.

Marc Hellerstein

 Professor 
 Research Description Who studies metabolic regulation these days - the flow of metabolites through competing pathways in complex biological networks, the anabolic and catabolic processes that determine tissue composition, adaptations to environmental stresses and how their failure leads to disease? Not most Biochemistry or Molecular Biology departments. It is our belief that the study of physiologic chemistry (metabolic regulation) using modern tracer techniques and metabolic control concepts can be seized by nutrition researchers interested in making fundamental contributions to biochemistry and medicine (and in being funded).Toward this end, our laboratory has focused on measuring a variety of intracellular metabolic processes not previously accessible to study in vivo. Our goal has always been to answer questions concerning the regulation of disease-modifying pathways by diet, genes, drugs and other factors, and to apply these techniques in humans. Because methods for studying the behavior of fully assembled, living systems have lagged remarkably – in comparison to techniques for characterizing chemical structure of isolated components of these systems, for example- much effort in our laboratory is spent on methods development. Accordingly, we have developed new in vivo stable isotope-mass spectrometric methods for measuring endogenous synthesis or transport rates of biomolecules such as fatty acids, cholesterol, proteins and carbohydrates and proliferation rates of cells. These techniques include mass isotopomer distribution analysis (MIDA), a universal technique for measuring polymerization biosynthesis; heavy water labeling for quantifying DNA replication and cell proliferation rates; dilution techniques for measuring reverse cholesterol transport fluxes; and methods for measuring the dynamics of brain molecules (among many others).A number of basic questions in metabolic physiology have been addressed in this manner. Do humans convert excess carbohydrate calories to fat (surprisingly, no)? Do gene expression profiles accurately represent the flow of lipogenic and adipogenic pathways in adipose tissue of obese mice (no, pathway fluxes need to be measured)? Can the powerful effects of chronic caloric restriction on the promotional phase of carcinogenesis be replicated by alternate-day fasting regimens (yes, and even better, these regimens can be modified to permit some energy intake on the “fast” day, without loss of effects)? Can metabolic pathways in neurons in the brain be modulated and monitored for therapeutic benefit (very much so- the axonal microtubule assembly/disassembly cycle, for example, with effects on axonal transport of cargo; or new brain cell proliferation in the adult hippocampus). And so on.Accordingly, our group is involved in a number of projects. These include studies of obesity/diabetes (the dynamics of adipose tissue components, including lipids, adipocytes, and macrophages) and dyslipidemias (reverse cholesterol transport and HDL functionality; sources of triglycerides secreted from the liver as VLDL); the effects of commonly used agents with important metabolic effects (cigarette smoking, alcohol); protein metabolism and body composition in wasting disorders (role of cytokines, rational development of new therapies including growth hormone, anabolic agents and anti-cytokines); specific nutrients (fructose, high carbohydrate diets, ethanol); and others.Additional Information is available at the Hellerstein Lab page.
