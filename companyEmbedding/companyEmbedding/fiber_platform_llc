The Engineering of Easy: UniCam® Connectors
UniCam® Connectors






For years, the installation of cable networks' field connectors was a fairly time-consuming process. To ensure the seamless flow of data-forming light, each hair-thin strand of glass fiber had to be glued into a connector. Technicians had to tote along portable ovens to heat-cure the special epoxy.
After waiting for the connector to finish curing, the technician would clean and polish the components by hand to ensure the pristine surface required for optical transmission.
On average, it took six to eight minutes to terminate a single connector. Results varied widely, based on the skill and experience of the technician. As recently as the mid-1990s, that’s just how it was.
But as carriers everywhere began to embrace the fast transmission capabilities of optical fiber networks, Corning engineers knew they had to find a better way.

Redefining Home Connectivity
Redefining Home Connectivity



Answering the Customer’s Call
It may not seem like it now, but it wasn’t that long ago that fiber to the home (FTTH) was in its infancy. There were no mass deployments, no customized products, and no recommended or common installation procedures. While Corning had been preparing for FTTH deployments for many years, we hadn’t yet had the opportunity to work with a customer and realize the vision of taking optical fiber all the way to the end customer. That changed when the first major carrier announced its plans to deploy FTTH technology.
With this announcement, we got to work, hand-in-hand with our customer. Our goal was to merge our expertise in fiber optics with the customer’s need for a reliable, future-ready product that could be deployed rapidly to allow for large-scale FTTH deployments. The result: The FlexNAP™ system, which uses standard optical fiber cables with network access points pre-installed at customer-specified locations along the length of the cable. With this product, we were able to bring the life-enhancing benefits of optical fiber to the customer, with deployments several times faster than traditional field installations.
Together with our customer, we developed a product that revolutionized FTTH delivery and is still an essential element in many FTTH deployments today.

	Chobani LLC announced a major portfolio expansion along with new marketing initiatives to continue its category leadership and deliver on its mission to provide better food for more people. Products targeted at new and existing consumers and eating occasions include Chobani Kids™ & Chobani Tots™ Greek Yogurt Pouches, Chobani® Greek Yogurt Oats – Ancient Grain Blend and new Chobani Flip Creations™. 









	To launch its new platform designed specifically for kids and tots, Chobani Kids™ and Chobani Tots™ Greek Yogurt Pouches will prominently feature iconic Disney and Marvel characters such as Winnie the Pooh and Spider-Man on packaging. Chobani Kids™ offers 8g of protein and 25% less sugar than the leading kids' yogurt in kid-approved flavors, empowering kids to choose naturally delicious snacks.

	Chobani Tots™ Greek Yogurt Pouches, the only refrigerated Greek Yogurt product especially for tots, have creamy and gentle whole milk Greek Yogurt blended with real fruits and vegetables, 12mg of Omega-3 DHA, and live and active cultures, giving a nutritious and delicious Greek Yogurt option for babies and toddlers. Additional characters including Doc McStuffins will launch in summer 2015. The new line of Disney-branded yogurts shows Disney Consumer Products' continued commitment to more nutritious food options for kids and families, and delivers on the promise of Disney's Magic of Healthy Living initiative, which helps parents make nutritious eating and physical activity more appealing and more fun.

	Building on its success in the past year, Chobani is also introducing Chobani® Greek Yogurt Oats – Ancient Grain Blend, an extension of the brand's recent take on oatmeal that offers a hearty, delicious, breakfast using only natural ingredients in each cup with 10g of whole grains, 10g of protein and 3g of fiber. The Company will also roll out new products for its successful Chobani Flip Creations™, which has fast become the market leader in the mix-in category as a perfect afternoon snack and a healthier alternative to many candy bars. The Company is focusing on popular ingredients flavors such as hazelnut for its Chocolate Haze Craze™ and on savory flavor combinations, such as Salted Caramel Crunch, and will introduce new flavors throughout the year.

	"Flavor innovation is a big part of the specialness of our brand. We were the first Greek Yogurt company to launch flavors like pomegranate, passion fruit, watermelon and grapefruit, so it's natural for us to be first with flavors like Green Tea that excite the shelf, the category and, importantly, our consumers," said Peter McGuinness, Chief Marketing and Brand Officer, Chobani.

	McGuinness added: "People are hungry for better food options throughout the day and we'll continue to fuel our growth with products that fill gaps in the market and meet consumer needs. Our newest platform for kids and tots is one our most important, offering delicious, healthy food that has been designed especially for young ones. At the same time, platforms like Chobani Flip, Chobani Oats and Chobani Indulgent are bringing new people and excitement into the category. We see significant room for growth and, as the leader, we feel it's our right, role and responsibility to curate the category with the best possible options out there. Our marketing in the coming year will focus especially on driving trial and raising awareness, including national campaigns, event marketing and sampling programs that introduce even more people to our products and the category."

	As part of its strategy to expand its audience in 2015, Chobani will be announcing partnerships throughout the year that raise brand awareness and introduce more people to Chobani Greek Yogurt. In late January, the brand will introduce Sundance Film Festival goers to its Chobani Creation™ bar with a full cafe experience from yogurt dusted popcorn to sweet and savory freshly made yogurt creations made by Chobani's Executive Chef, Chef Tim Reardon, along with sampling opportunities throughout the premiere national event to build off the success the brand saw with experiential activations throughout 2014 such as its custom brand integration at the Food & Wine Classic in Aspen. Additionally, the Company announced that it is continuing its partnerships with the United States Olympic Committee and IMG College, naturally fueling athletes, students and fans while increasing brand awareness and yogurt consumption. To drive trial beyond its events, Chobani will be expanding its fleet of sampling vehicles, dubbed "ChoMobiles," with an aim to reach up to 40 states and sample up to 1 million products throughout the year.

	As one of the most active brands in social media, Chobani's marketing initiatives in the coming year will continue to explore new channels to communicate with consumers, building on its recent Tumblr and Snapchat launches, which the company used to reveal its latest Limited Batch flavors to brand fans.

	Newest Additions to the Fast-Growing Chobani Family

	Five new platform innovations are appearing on store shelves in January.

• Chobani® Greek Yogurt Oats – Ancient Grain Blend
	Two new flavors join the convenient, protein-packed Chobani Greek Yogurt Oats family, Chobani's take on oatmeal made with delicious Greek Yogurt. The new Ancient Grain Blend is packed with steel-cut oats, quinoa, chia, buckwheat, and amaranth, creamy Greek Yogurt and real, ripe fruit blended into two delicious new flavors: Mixed Berry 5-Grain and Apricot 5-Grain. With 10g of protein, 10g of whole grains and as much fiber as a packet of instant oatmeal, there's a hearty breakfast in each and every cup.

• Chobani Kids™ & Chobani Tots™ Greek Yogurt Pouches
	Chobani Kids™ & Chobani Tots™ Greek Yogurt Pouches is the Chobani® Greek Yogurt you love, made for the one you love. Made with natural ingredients and live and active cultures, including real fruits and vegetables, there are no preservatives, added colors, high fructose corn syrup, modified corn starch or other artificial ingredients used in other kids' yogurts. Not to mention Chobani Kids™ has twice the protein and 25% less sugar than the leading kids' yogurt – and kids love the taste. Find Chobani Kids in Strawberry, Banana, Chocolate Dust, Watermelon and Grape – all offering 25% less sugar than the leading kid's yogurt – and Chobani Tots in Banana & Pumpkin and Mango & Spinach.

• Chobani® Limited Batch Grape and Green Tea
	On the heels of the popular Limited Batch Pumpkin Spice and Apple Spice this fall, the newest Limited Batch Chobani® Greek Yogurt flavors are now on shelves while supplies last. Refreshing Green Tea Chobani® Greek Yogurt is an unexpected flavor combination that exemplifies the craft and experimentation that has long set Chobani apart, while delicious Chobani® Grape proves grape isn't a flavor just for kids.

• Chobani Flip Creations™ Salted Caramel Crunch and Chocolate Haze Craze
	Chobani Flip Creations™—which feature tasty low-fat Greek Yogurt (1.5% milkfat) paired with exciting, culinary-inspired, all-natural mix-ins—welcomes a few new additions to the family: Salted Caramel Crunch and Chocolate Haze Craze. Whether it's an afternoon snack, or a swap-in for a candy bar, Chobani Flip Creations™ are an excellent source of protein packaged in an elevated yogurt experience.

• Chobani Indulgent™ Greek Yogurt flavors: Dulce de Leche Caramel & Dark Chocolate and Double Chocolate Chunk
	New flavors are now available for Chobani Indulgent Greek Yogurt, the brand's first dessert product launched last year, including Dulce de Leche Caramel & Dark Chocolate and Double Chocolate Chunk. Made with 100% natural ingredients, the richest dark chocolate and creamiest yogurt, the new Chobani Indulgent™ is so decadent and silky, people will remember to save room for dessert.

• Chobani Simply 100™ Greek Yogurt flavors: zesty Tropical Citrus and tropical Raspberry Lemon
	The first and only 100-calorie authentic strained Greek Yogurt made with only natural ingredients and no artificial sweeteners, Chobani Simply 100™ is releasing two new refreshing blended flavors: zesty Tropical Citrus and tropical Raspberry Lemon. Like the full Chobani Simply 100 portfolio, the new flavors are an excellent source of protein and fiber – 100 calories worth counting.

Welcome to Fiber Foods Inc!

Established in the 1960s, Norfolk Noodle Factory has become well known for its unique Yock Noodle, also known as Yock-a-Mein. This popular product is famous up and down the East Coast, and homeward-bound Atlantic Fleet sailors have spread it across the nation. Now known as Fiber Foods, the company remains rooted in Norfolk, Virginia, and continues to turn out the same fine product for your enjoyment. The main difference is streamlined production techniques.
