Increases Middlefield’s asset base approximately 28% to $970 millionExpected 
      to be accretive to earnings in year oneEarn back of 
      tangible book value dilution in less than four years








July 28, 2016 07:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time



MIDDLEFIELD,Ohio & BEACHWOOD, Ohio--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Middlefield Banc Corp. (“Middlefield”, the “Bank”, or the “Company”) 
      (NASDAQ: MBCN), the bank holding company for The Middlefield Banking 
      Company, and Liberty Bank, N.A. (“Liberty”) today announced Middlefield 
      has entered into an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization (the 
      “Agreement”) with Liberty.
    


      Under the terms of the Agreement, Liberty shareholders will have the 
      option to receive either 1.1934 shares of MBCN stock or $37.96 in cash 
      in addition to receiving a special dividend immediately prior to closing 
      of approximately $3.13 a share. Based on the 20 day average stock price 
      of MBCN as of July 26, 2016, the indicated transaction value would be 
      approximately $40.8 million (cash consideration of approximately $20.0 
      million plus an indicated stock consideration of $16.6 million plus a 
      $3.0 million special dividend plus $1.1 million paid to option holders). 
      On a per share basis, the indicated value to Liberty shareholders is 
      $41.09 for those receiving cash and $3.13 plus 1.1934 shares of MBCN for 
      those receiving stock (together, $41.68 based on the 20 day average). In 
      aggregate (subject to proration), 45% of Liberty’s shares of common 
      stock will be converted into Middlefield’s common stock.
    

      “We are excited to announce this merger with Liberty, as both banks 
      share common community banking values, compelling financial models, and 
      outstanding management teams,” stated Thomas G. Caldwell, President and 
      CEO of Middlefield. “Liberty’s strong management team and three highly 
      productive Northeast Ohio branches will enhance Middlefield’s growth 
      opportunities. We are pleased to welcome Liberty’s customers to The 
      Middlefield Banking Company family, while extending our reach to 
      Cuyahoga and Summit Counties. As a community oriented bank, we believe 
      customers in these markets will benefit from Middlefield’s customer 
      focus and leading financial products. We look forward to a prosperous 
      partnership with Liberty and creating value for our shareholders.”
    

      William Valerian, Chairman, President and CEO of Liberty stated, 
      “Middlefield understands the value we place on our customers. Their 
      leadership team and banking infrastructure create the perfect merger 
      partner for Liberty. This merger will bring together two financially 
      strong community banks with a long history of serving customers in Ohio. 
      Collectively, we will serve the Northern Ohio market with the same 
      dedication and attentiveness, while providing a broader range of 
      products and increased lending capabilities. We are enhancing value for 
      our shareholders, while building a compelling and growing community 
      banking franchise.”
    

      Pursuant to the Agreement, William A. Valerian and Thomas W. Bevan, two 
      current directors of Liberty, will be appointed to the Board of 
      Directors of Middlefield. Simultaneously upon entering into the 
      Agreement, Middlefield also entered into voting agreements with 
      Liberty’s directors in which they agree to vote the Liberty common stock 
      they own in favor of the Agreement.
    

      Upon completion of the transaction and after adjusting for the special 
      cash dividend paid to Liberty shareholders and purchase accounting, 
      Middlefield will have approximately $970 million in total assets, 
      approximately $820 million in total deposits, and 13 branches in the 
      state of Ohio among a seven county operating footprint. Middlefield’s 
      branch network will expand in the Cleveland MSA by adding Liberty’s 
      three branches located in Beachwood, Twinsburg, and Solon.
    

      Middlefield expects the transaction to be accretive to earnings in year 
      one and to earn back the tangible book value dilution created from the 
      transaction in less than four years. After completion of the 
      transaction, Middlefield anticipates it will remain well-capitalized.
    

      The transaction has been approved by the Boards of Directors of both 
      Middlefield and Liberty. Completion of the transaction is subject to 
      customary closing conditions, including the receipt of required 
      regulatory approvals and the approval of both Middlefield’s shareholders 
      and Liberty’s shareholders.

      Middlefield Banc Corp. and Grady & Associates is serving as legal 
      counsel to Middlefield on the transaction. Boenning & Scattergood, Inc. 
      is serving as financial advisor to Liberty Bank, N.A. and Tucker Ellis 
      LLP is serving as legal counsel to Liberty Bank, N.A. on the transaction.
