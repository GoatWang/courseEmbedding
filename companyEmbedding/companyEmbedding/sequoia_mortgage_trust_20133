Redwood Trust keeps on track with monthly RMBS issuance

February 19, 2013
Christina Mlynski




KEYWORDS Business Contact Details Economics Finance Financial economics Fitch Ratings Fixed income securities Fixed-rate mortgage Kroll Bond Mortgage industry of the United States Mortgage loan Mortgage-backed security Redwood Trust Securitization Sequoia Mortgage Trust Structured finance Tranche United States housing bubble

Real estate investment trust Redwood Trust (RWT) continues to meet its goal of monthly issuance as the firm sets out on its third private-label residential-mortgage backed securitization deal of 2013.Kroll Bond Ratings pre-rated Sequoia Mortgage Trust 2013-3, giving the majority of the deal’s tranches AAA ratings.Click on the chart to view the expected KBRA ratings.Fitch Ratings also pre-rated Sequoia Mortgage Trust 2013-3, with the expected outlook slated as 'stable' and the majority of the tranches also reaching AAA ratings.Click on the chart to view the capital structure.The platform will contain 746 loans in the deal with more than 99% of the loans in the pool classified as 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages. The remaining loans are 20-year fixed mortgages. About 2.4% of the loans are interest-only for the first 10 years while the remainder are fully amortizing. The total balance of the deal is roughly $600 million.The pool mainly contains fixed-rate mortgages, with First Republic Bank making up the majority of the transaction, or roughly 14% of the loan pool.Other originators include Cole Taylor Bank, United Shore Financial, PrimeLending with and Flagstar Capital Markets.Geographic concentration was a primary risk posted within the deal – similar to Redwood’s first and second deals of the year, Kroll noted. "Non-conforming prime mortgages are most frequently originated in those regions of the country where home prices are highest. As a result, the geographic concentration of the pool is high, with a significant exposure to assets located in California as well as a number of major metropolitan areas," the credit rating agency noted.However, Fitch Ratings noted that a key driver for this deal was the improvement of geographic mix.The overall geographic diversity improved from the last transaction, noting that the percentage of the top three metropolitan statistical areas is the lowest to date at 23%. In addition, the weighted average borrower credit score is 772, higher than average for recent Sequoia Mortgage Trust transactions as well within the ‘prime’ mortgage range.Another positive aspect of the mortgage pool is the documentation of each borrower’s income and assets. Of the loans in the pool, 2% are not fully amortizing.cmlynski@housingwire.com

Fannie Mae: from legacy to startup


        You'd be forgiven for thinking that a quasi-federal agency founded in the 1930s is the last place you’d describe using words like innovative or agile. But you’d be wrong. Defying all stereotypes, Fannie Mae’s recent actions read a lot more like a startup than a $2.8 billion company with more than 7,000 employees. In the last two years, the company has implemented a user experience strategy, adopted design thinking and accelerated time to market for an innovative array of products.

Prime status: an update on luxury residential real estate


Deborah Huso


Real Estate


        In the years leading up to the housing bubble of 2007, it seemed like everyone was getting a piece of the American Dream of homeownership (or maybe even second homeownership). Ten years after the Great Recession, how is luxury residential real estate faring? Was the recent market slowdown just a temporary blip on the radar and will the sector continue to draw the aspirational interest of buyers as it did in the early to mid-2000s?
      


Commentary

Convert leads like a top producer



Casey Cunningham


Lending


        Most mortgage professionals know that the client feels a sense of loyalty to the first person they speak with. When they establish themselves as the first contact, loan officers gain a critical sales advantage. In fact, speed-to-call is the single largest driver of conversion for new customer leads. 
Studies show that returning a call from a new customer within the first 30 minutes produces an average of a 62% increase in conversion rates.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.
