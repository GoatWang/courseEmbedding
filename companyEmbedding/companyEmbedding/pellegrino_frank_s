                            Mystery Diner                        


Immortalised by countless Hollywood set pieces, a central pillar of Chicago’s identity is the speakeasy. Tucked away in alleys, basements and backrooms, these underground establishments were the place to go for illicit booze and general debauchery during the Prohibition years (1920-33). When notorious Chicago gangster and bootlegger Al Capone was imprisoned in 1932 and Prohibition repealed the next year, the speakeasy lost its lustre among the city’s thrill seekers. More than 80 years later that spirit has been revitalised in the pursuit of hush-hush culinary delights. This has led to the development of a blossoming underground dining scene where food lovers gather by word-of-mouth in unconventional locations to celebrate creative expression through food. These underground experiences aren’t advertised or posted online, and seldom will you know the location until an hour before the meal. The chefs and dining curators – the bootleggers of this modern-day speakeasy movement – work tirelessly in pursuit of the one-of-a-kind experience.

                            Going Downtown                        


Downtown LA is the central business district, and until very recently, it was a wasteland of bland, glassy office blocks – but that’s all changed in the last year or two: there’s new energy, new art and very well-documented macadamia nut iced lattes. It’s the oldest bit of the city and there are enough interesting landmarks here, as well as spots you’ll recognise from the movies. Abandoned commercial buildings have been filled with creative people and their work – filmmakers, musicians and artists – with a result that feels a lot like Brooklyn, NY. At the centre of it all, the Grand Central Market has been in place since 1917, but has become a kind of hotbed for creative and cultural LA cuisine. You can get four different and invigorating falafel wraps at Madcapra, pupusas (Salvadoran corn tortillas stuffed with cheese, beans and pork) at Sarita’s, pastrami sandwiches at Wexler’s Deli, pad Thai at Sticky Rice, and that famous macadamia nut iced latte at G&B Coffee (described by The New York Times as the best iced latte in the US).

                            An Arts Crawl                        


The Wynwood Arts District has recently given Miami an edgy, trendy, artsy area that rivals the hippest neighborhoods of other international destinations. Featuring numerous local shops and restaurants, and art on almost every wall, Wynwood offers a cool, distinctive atmosphere in contrast with the more sleek (and expensive) vibe of the beach. Set among skillful street art on almost every visible surface, Wynwood's unique galleries, pubs, cafés and eateries have become the places-to-be. Located just southwest of Miami's recently developed and much-talked-about Design District, Wynwood has provided an affordable cool factor to the area.  The neighbourhood began its transition from manufacturing district to global destination in the mid-2000s, when developer Tony Goldman had a vision to bring attention to – rather than get rid of – the area's existing graffiti art. In 2009, he launched Wynwood Walls, a one-of-a-kind outdoor art installation and courtyard that set the stage for some of the world's top street artists to display their work.Crowds flocked to view the project, which lent the nearby galleries a robust swell of attention and resulted in a wave of new openings. Retail stores, cafés, restaurants and bars soon followed suit – all aligning with a mixture of chic and grit that has fed into the area’s specific aesthetic. The space has, in turn, given birth to one of the most creative communities in the country.

                            Having a ball on the dumpling trail                        


If New York was historically the primary gateway to America, then San Francisco was certainly a close second. In 1847, the provincial envelope of Yerba Buena had a population of just 400, crammed in to shanties clustered around a small natural harbour. It was gold that turned this village of dust tracks into the hub it is today. Though the gold was found in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada, the bars were traded and spent here in the port. Ships arrived full of people, and were then abandoned and sank into the mud to be claimed by the Bay. By 1850 the city population was at 20,000, mostly men. By 1860 it was up to more than 50,000. Europeans came by foot and wagon from the east; Chinese people came over the Pacific from the west. The city grew, as did the number of languages spoken within its confines – and the variety of flavours and customs at dinner tables. The Mission district was German and Irish before it was Mexican and Guatemalan. The Poles and Russians – and then the Italians – settled in North Beach. If one dish transcends cultures, it is the humble dumpling. The predominantly wheat comfort balls are synonymous with family cooking from Warsaw to Wenzhou, Tel Aviv to Trieste. The Italians stuff pasta dough with spinach and cheese, served in brown butter and sage as tortellini, while the Guatemalans wrap corn in banana leaves to create tamales. One of the best (and most delicious) ways to explore the many cultural groups that have made San Francisco their home, is by telling their stories through their appreciation of the hearty dumpling.

Chef Taste Guide







If you want to cut to the spirit of a city, talk to a chef. You might walk away with a list of must-hit restaurants; marching orders for exploring Chinatown; intel on that one oyster bar that pours moonshine for its favorite regulars. But talking to a chef is also a great way to understand the way a city can act as muse. A chef can use a restaurant to tell the story of their city’s diversity, or to tip their hat to the people who call it home. A menu can read like a torch song for the seasonal rhythms of a region, or the bounty of a local market. Talk to a chef and you can see the mark a city leaves on its creative class, and the way they use taste to carve a path right through the center of it. With that in mind, we asked chefs in five of our favorite american cities to show us the places, faces, flavors and ideas that shape their work, from the latin vitality and architectural splendor of Michelle Bernstein’s southern Florida, to the graffiti-splashed grit of Alex Stupak’s Manhattan. Here, we present the tales of New York, Miami, Chicago, Los Angeles and San Francisco as told through the minds and bellies of its favorite cooks. 










  
 April Bloomfield 
 “What I love about New York City is it's a big melting pot of energy, creativity, and delicious food.” – Chef April Bloomfield  

  
 Ludo Lefebvre 
 “I just love all the different cultures in LA, all these people together, and you feel that, in the creativity of the food.” – Chef Ludo Lefebvre  

 






  
 Danny Bowien 
 "San Francisco is an amazing springboard; it affords you the opportunity to be weird and to create anything you want." - Chef Danny Bowien  

  
 Alex Stupak 
 "New York is a creative city. It is a city that is always inventing and reinventing itself" - Chef Alex Stupak  

  
 Stephanie Izard 
 “One of the great things about Chicago is that you can travel the world just by visiting different neighborhoods, and exploring the cultures represented there.” - Chef Stephanie Izard
  

  
 Michelle Bernstein 
 “Miami is a crazy mix of cultures and flavors and languages and music. It is vibrant and powerful and loud. It can be obnoxious but it has a beauty and a sensuality that you can’t find anywhere else in this country” - Chef Michelle Bernstein  

  
 Jon Shook & Vinny Dotolo 
 “LA as a city really influences artist; being an artist and being a chef are very similar. Painting, sculpture, design, food - these have been huge parts of our existence here in Los Angeles."
- Chefs Jon Shook and Vinny Dotolo

Meet Our Family


Frank Pellegrino Jr. – Rao's Restaurant Group Author: Rao's On the Grill
 Being a restaurateur, let alone a successful one, has never been easy, even when you've got a legendary restaurant such as Rao's in New York in your arsenal. Frank Pellegrino, Jr., co-owner of the original Rao's in Harlem, Rao's at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, and Rao's in Hollywood, however knows that a successful restaurant is made by making guests feel like they're part of the family.
 "Frankie" as he is known to Rao's regulars, grew up helping his father and family at the restaurant – waiting tables, cooking, managing the restaurant – basically learning the family business, even though his father, Frank Sr. attempted to talk him out of it.
 The fourth generation owner of Rao's, Pellegrino attended Connecticut State University on a wrestling scholarship; where he studied graphic design and eventually went on to open his own advertising agency in New York. The restaurant business never left his blood, as he continued to work at the restaurant nights. Frank, however, knew that this was his legacy and where he belonged, ultimately returning to work at Rao's full-time.
 In 2000 he opened Baldoria in New York's tony Theater District, a 200 seat restaurant that managed to still carry off the intimate ambience, and stellar Italian cuisine of Rao's, except at Baldoria, people eventually would be able to get a reservation. Pellegrino then decided to bring his talents to Las Vegas to open the second outpost of Rao's, and eventually Los Angeles to open the third.
 Pellegrino moved to out west to open Rao's at Caesars Palace in 2006 and Rao's in Hollywood in 2013, and has since brought the same Southern Italian fare and sense of family and camaraderie that one used to only be able to get if they had their standing reservation at the original Rao's. He can be found not only greeting guests, but floating from table to table, ensuring that the Las Vegas and Hollywood experience is the same warm, familiar and inviting one they'd feel in New York.
 In 2012, Pellegrino released Rao's On the Grill (St. Martin's Press), which is full of signature Rao's dishes and new creations from "Uncle Vincent's Lemon Chicken," to pastas, salads and even desserts, this book is a must-have for anyone with a passion for cooking or dining al fresco.
 



Ron Straci
 Ron Straci is one of the founders and co-owners of Rao's Specialty Foods, Inc. A graduate of Fordham College & Law School, he is now of Counsel to Pitta & Giblin, LLP specializing in Labor Relations. Among other clients, they represent the Bakery and Confectionery Local Union 3. Rao's Specialty Foods, Inc. was started in 1992 to bring to the consumers' home the signature marinara sauce of the legendary Rao's Restaurant. A loyal Fancy Food Show exhibitor, for almost twenty years, Rao's Specialty Foods, Inc. has grown its product line to include a variety of flavors of pasta sauces – not to mention imported pastas, olive oils, vinegars, roasted peppers and dressings – with both domestic and international distribution to traditional gourmet stores and supermarkets.
 



Frank Pellegrino
 Proprietor and nightly host at the famous Rao's Restaurant in New York, Frank Pellegrino was born and raised in East Harlem, surrounded by a wonderful family including many good cooks!  Frank welcomes his guests to the restaurant and in part the East Harlem neighborhood, in the most hospitable and generous way.  After Frank's warm welcome, you are treated to the best southern Italian cooking in New York City, and now on the west coast at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas.
 To that end, Frank is constantly consulting with his Executive Chef Dino Gatto at Rao's New York, vigilantly ensuring the consistency of the food served at Rao's.  He does the same with Rao's Las Vegas Executive Chef Nicole Grimes.  They review the recipes regularly, discussing ingredients, preparation, and working on new dishes to serve while preserving the traditional foods of our ancestors.
 In 1992, Frank founded Rao's Specialty Foods to produce and sell the highest quality gourmet products.  In 1998, he wrote the Rao's Cookbook (Random House) providing a wonderful look back at family and neighborhood history, as well as sharing Italian recipes from  the  restaurant, giving everyone the opportunity and  the basics to prepare the simple recipes. The main theme of the cookbook is gathering family and friends around the dining table, sharing food and sharing lives.
 In 2004, Frank followed up with a second cookbook, Rao's Recipes From the Neighborhood (St. Martins Press) focusing on and giving credit to the many wonderful cooks who came from East Harlem. In each of the recipes, a bit of heritage and pride comes across; "food from the heart"; again also encouraging cooking at home, with family and friends around.
 Frank is a man of many talents; singer, actor, writer, producer, restaurateur and philanthropist.  He has a warm and gracious personality, which shines through at Rao's every night.

Now Frank Pellegrino, the third generation of his family to operate the impossible-to-get-into Rao’s restaurant in East Harlem and founder of Rao’s food products line, goes deep into the history of his family, the restaurant, and America’s love affair with Southern Italian cooking to create Rao’s biggest, best Italian cookbook yet.This complete cookbook’s 140+ recipes include:- Linguini Aglio Olio- Lobster Fra Diavolo- Eggplant Parmigiana- Margherita Pizza alla Rao's- Veal Chops Paillard- Beef Braciola- Stuffed Italian Frying Peppers- Blood Orange and Limoncello Panna Cotta

Former NYPD detective and mayoral candidate, Bo Dietl looks back on his friend’s life

Frank Pellegrino Sr.’s restaurant, Rao’s
Nick Solares



Frank Pellegrino Sr., 72, died of cancer yesterday. He was the owner and the heart of Rao’s, the storied East Harlem restaurant that’s the hardest table to get in New York. 
“Rao’s will never be Rao’s without Frankie,” says Bo Dietl, his closest friend and former NYPD detective (who helped catch the Son of Sam), founder of Beau Dietl & Associates — and now New York City mayoral candidate. 
Open since 1896, the restaurant was founded by the Rao family; when Vinnie Rao died, he willed his ownership of the restaurant to his wife, Anna Pellegrino Rao, Frank’s aunt. 
Dietl says he met Pellegrino in 1973, as a detective in the neighborhood, when Pellegrino was a bartender in the family restaurant, then a waiter, then the maitre d’. By 1977, Frankie gave Dietl his own table — “the big table toward the front,” he says. 
That gift is why it’s so hard to get a table at Rao’s: There are no reservations, just table assignments, designated decades ago by Pellegrino Sr. and his Aunt Anna. 
Shortly after Dietl got his table, Mimi Sheraton gave the restaurant three-stars from The New York Times, and a neighborhood restaurant that was often crowded became a destination restaurant that was impossible to get into — unless you knew someone.
Since then, “anyone who’s anyone,” has sat at that table, from Warren Buffett to Bill Gates, Bruce Willis, Tommy Mottola and Mariah Carey “when they first met,” Denzel Washington, and Leonardo DiCaprio, who was filmed eating in the restaurant for The Wolf of Wall Street.
Pellegrino’s role in the restaurant landed him a role in Martin Scorsese’s GoodFellas, as well as an FBI chef on “The Sopranos.” Dietl shared acting roles, also in GoodFellas, along with The Wolf of Wall Street, in which he played himself. 
When his aunt died in the 90s, Pellegrino inherited the restaurant, along with his cousin, Ron Straci (with whom he since had a storied dispute.) Even with the opening of restaurants in Las Vegas and LA — as well as the Rao's product line of pasta, sauces, and  olive oil — Rao’s has not lost luster, which many attribute to Pellegrino.  
That’s because there’s been no renovation or overhaul, with the exception of repairs after a fire in the 90s. Rao’s remained as it has been, with black and white football photos and Frank Sinatra memorabilia on the walls. Dino Gatto — who cooks for the Giants for Sunday home games — runs the kitchen, serving family-style plates of lemon chicken, meatballs, and eggplant parmesan. Thursdays has been the night to go, a night that Pellegrino was sure to be there. 
“He is and was the catalyst of the restaurant,” Dietl says. “We lost a little piece of New York when we lost Frankie yesterday.”
Pellegrino is survived by his son and daughter and his wife, Josephine. There will be a memorial service in the fall.

                            Mystery Diner                        


Immortalised by countless Hollywood set pieces, a central pillar of Chicago’s identity is the speakeasy. Tucked away in alleys, basements and backrooms, these underground establishments were the place to go for illicit booze and general debauchery during the Prohibition years (1920-33). When notorious Chicago gangster and bootlegger Al Capone was imprisoned in 1932 and Prohibition repealed the next year, the speakeasy lost its lustre among the city’s thrill seekers. More than 80 years later that spirit has been revitalised in the pursuit of hush-hush culinary delights. This has led to the development of a blossoming underground dining scene where food lovers gather by word-of-mouth in unconventional locations to celebrate creative expression through food. These underground experiences aren’t advertised or posted online, and seldom will you know the location until an hour before the meal. The chefs and dining curators – the bootleggers of this modern-day speakeasy movement – work tirelessly in pursuit of the one-of-a-kind experience.

                            Going Downtown                        


Downtown LA is the central business district, and until very recently, it was a wasteland of bland, glassy office blocks – but that’s all changed in the last year or two: there’s new energy, new art and very well-documented macadamia nut iced lattes. It’s the oldest bit of the city and there are enough interesting landmarks here, as well as spots you’ll recognise from the movies. Abandoned commercial buildings have been filled with creative people and their work – filmmakers, musicians and artists – with a result that feels a lot like Brooklyn, NY. At the centre of it all, the Grand Central Market has been in place since 1917, but has become a kind of hotbed for creative and cultural LA cuisine. You can get four different and invigorating falafel wraps at Madcapra, pupusas (Salvadoran corn tortillas stuffed with cheese, beans and pork) at Sarita’s, pastrami sandwiches at Wexler’s Deli, pad Thai at Sticky Rice, and that famous macadamia nut iced latte at G&B Coffee (described by The New York Times as the best iced latte in the US).

                            An Arts Crawl                        


The Wynwood Arts District has recently given Miami an edgy, trendy, artsy area that rivals the hippest neighborhoods of other international destinations. Featuring numerous local shops and restaurants, and art on almost every wall, Wynwood offers a cool, distinctive atmosphere in contrast with the more sleek (and expensive) vibe of the beach. Set among skillful street art on almost every visible surface, Wynwood's unique galleries, pubs, cafés and eateries have become the places-to-be. Located just southwest of Miami's recently developed and much-talked-about Design District, Wynwood has provided an affordable cool factor to the area.  The neighbourhood began its transition from manufacturing district to global destination in the mid-2000s, when developer Tony Goldman had a vision to bring attention to – rather than get rid of – the area's existing graffiti art. In 2009, he launched Wynwood Walls, a one-of-a-kind outdoor art installation and courtyard that set the stage for some of the world's top street artists to display their work.Crowds flocked to view the project, which lent the nearby galleries a robust swell of attention and resulted in a wave of new openings. Retail stores, cafés, restaurants and bars soon followed suit – all aligning with a mixture of chic and grit that has fed into the area’s specific aesthetic. The space has, in turn, given birth to one of the most creative communities in the country.

                            Having a ball on the dumpling trail                        


If New York was historically the primary gateway to America, then San Francisco was certainly a close second. In 1847, the provincial envelope of Yerba Buena had a population of just 400, crammed in to shanties clustered around a small natural harbour. It was gold that turned this village of dust tracks into the hub it is today. Though the gold was found in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada, the bars were traded and spent here in the port. Ships arrived full of people, and were then abandoned and sank into the mud to be claimed by the Bay. By 1850 the city population was at 20,000, mostly men. By 1860 it was up to more than 50,000. Europeans came by foot and wagon from the east; Chinese people came over the Pacific from the west. The city grew, as did the number of languages spoken within its confines – and the variety of flavours and customs at dinner tables. The Mission district was German and Irish before it was Mexican and Guatemalan. The Poles and Russians – and then the Italians – settled in North Beach. If one dish transcends cultures, it is the humble dumpling. The predominantly wheat comfort balls are synonymous with family cooking from Warsaw to Wenzhou, Tel Aviv to Trieste. The Italians stuff pasta dough with spinach and cheese, served in brown butter and sage as tortellini, while the Guatemalans wrap corn in banana leaves to create tamales. One of the best (and most delicious) ways to explore the many cultural groups that have made San Francisco their home, is by telling their stories through their appreciation of the hearty dumpling.

Chef Taste Guide







If you want to cut to the spirit of a city, talk to a chef. You might walk away with a list of must-hit restaurants; marching orders for exploring Chinatown; intel on that one oyster bar that pours moonshine for its favorite regulars. But talking to a chef is also a great way to understand the way a city can act as muse. A chef can use a restaurant to tell the story of their city’s diversity, or to tip their hat to the people who call it home. A menu can read like a torch song for the seasonal rhythms of a region, or the bounty of a local market. Talk to a chef and you can see the mark a city leaves on its creative class, and the way they use taste to carve a path right through the center of it. With that in mind, we asked chefs in five of our favorite american cities to show us the places, faces, flavors and ideas that shape their work, from the latin vitality and architectural splendor of Michelle Bernstein’s southern Florida, to the graffiti-splashed grit of Alex Stupak’s Manhattan. Here, we present the tales of New York, Miami, Chicago, Los Angeles and San Francisco as told through the minds and bellies of its favorite cooks. 










  
 April Bloomfield 
 “What I love about New York City is it's a big melting pot of energy, creativity, and delicious food.” – Chef April Bloomfield  

  
 Ludo Lefebvre 
 “I just love all the different cultures in LA, all these people together, and you feel that, in the creativity of the food.” – Chef Ludo Lefebvre  

 






  
 Danny Bowien 
 "San Francisco is an amazing springboard; it affords you the opportunity to be weird and to create anything you want." - Chef Danny Bowien  

  
 Alex Stupak 
 "New York is a creative city. It is a city that is always inventing and reinventing itself" - Chef Alex Stupak  

  
 Stephanie Izard 
 “One of the great things about Chicago is that you can travel the world just by visiting different neighborhoods, and exploring the cultures represented there.” - Chef Stephanie Izard
  

  
 Michelle Bernstein 
 “Miami is a crazy mix of cultures and flavors and languages and music. It is vibrant and powerful and loud. It can be obnoxious but it has a beauty and a sensuality that you can’t find anywhere else in this country” - Chef Michelle Bernstein  

  
 Jon Shook & Vinny Dotolo 
 “LA as a city really influences artist; being an artist and being a chef are very similar. Painting, sculpture, design, food - these have been huge parts of our existence here in Los Angeles."
- Chefs Jon Shook and Vinny Dotolo
