BBB Accreditation





                BBB Accredited Since 05/01/1956
            

                BBB has determined that Puget Sound Energy, INC. meets Standards of BBB Accreditation, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            

                BBB accreditation does not mean that the business's products or services have been evaluated or endorsed by BBB, or that BBB has made a determination as to the business's product quality or competency in performing services.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

                            2. cooperate with BBB's activities and efforts to promote voluntary self- regulation within the business' industry

4. Cooperate with BBB self-regulatory programs for the resolution of advertising disputes.
5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

                    6. Avoid misleading customers by creating the false impression of sponsorship, endorsement, popularity, trustworthiness, product quality or business size through the misuse of logos, trustmarks, pictures, testimonials, or other means

Be Responsive









            Address marketplace disputes quickly, professionally, and in good faith.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Promptly respond to all complaints forwarded by BBB by: 
1. Resolving the complaint directly with the complainant and notifying BBB, or

                            2. Providing BBB with a response that BBB determines: 

                                    1. is professional,
                                
2. addresses all of the issues raised by the complainant,

                    2. Make a good faith effort to resolve disputes, which includes mediation if requested by BBB. Other dispute resolution options, including arbitration, may be recommended by BBB when other efforts to resolve a dispute have failed. BBB may consider a business' willingness to participate in recommended dispute resolution options in determining compliance with these standards.
                

                    3. Comply with any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process.
                

                    4. Cooperate with BBB in efforts to eliminate the underlying cause of patterns of customer complaints that are identified by BBB.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

Composite Score:





                        Puget Sound Energy, INC. has received 3.68 out of 5 stars based on 11 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of A+.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

Unlimited Singing Bowls is honored to offer Crystal Tones Singing Bowls. These crystal bowls are made in the USA from extremely pure quartz. Some of the bowls from this collection are also blended and forged with gemstones and precious metals. Crystal Tones bowls are the highest quality, we have found, available in the world.
This collection of gemstone and precious metal infused Crystal Tones bowls is called the "Alchemy" series. We can attest from our study and usage of them, that they truly are alchemical, not in the base medieval sense of turning physical lead into gold, but in the spiritual sense, wherein these bowls, when played, offer you energetic transformations.  You can raise your vibration, and the energies of others when you play these bowls. The healings are deep in the aura, the chakras, and the soul - as well as within the body. The sounds these bowls create are more than just sound. They carry the energy of the quartz and all the specific infused elements.
Unlimited Singing Bowls offers our unique, clairvoyant assessments of each bowl where we can, and as time goes on, we will have sample videos of them as well. We highly recommend you consider adding Crystal Tones bowls to your sound healing instruments.

This bowl generates the connecting energy of love and caring. It embraces your spirit’s ageless feminine wisdom and the spiraling DNA of creation/birth. It is the embodiment of the consciousness of a life well lived and lived courageously.
The Tesseract Salt Grandmother Bowl is an incredible bowl. Traumas that happened to relatives long ago that you may not even be aware of can be passed on as energies, beliefs and even be imprinted on DNA.  This bowl is an excellent companion to your intention to break apart and remove inherited negative energies from your family line and ancestors. If you need to remove past-time energies anchored into your cell memory, this bowl is the catalyst to help you clear the path to greater freedom and higher energy.



Crystal Tones™ Description

Every Grandmother’s love and caring is represented in the Grandmother bowl. We honor the feminine energies in all and the Goddess/Crone as she reclaims her power on Earth. The Crone is Gaia energy. She is free of menses, aligned with the graceful strength and dreamtime magic of the Swan and shamanic practices, at home in her body. Time apart and discernment expand her divine wisdom.

The Turquoise Crystal Tones Bowl is a solid citizen; an overall sound healer. It creates a safe grounded space that works gently on the chakras to aid in accepting healing. People new to receiving sound healing will love this bowl.It works on all the endocrine glands, which are related to the chakras, so the spirit and body connect well. It is a good 'completer bowl' -  the one to play to close your event. After the other bowls have completed their work, you seal up the healing with the Turquoise bowl. Expressing an uplifting and calming aspect, Turquoise guides spiritual attunement, emotional healing, and balances the auric body. Compassionate in working with the throat chakra, Turquoise is a master healer, attractor of prosperity and fertility. A loving provider of strength during vision quests.


Crystal Tones™ Description
The name Turquoise is derived from the French, pierre turquoise, meaning “Turkish stone" so named likely because of its prevalence along early Turkish trade routes. Native American priests wore it in ceremonies when calling upon the great spirit of the sky. Turquoise is often honored as the universal stone as those who tuned into its energies believed their minds would become one with the universe. Turquoise was often used in prophesy or divining.  In Native American lore Turquoise is also reputed to be influenced by the physical condition of the person who wears it. It is thought to grow pale when its owner is sick or sad, lose all color when the person dies, and gradually recover its color when transferred to a new healthy owner. Turquoise is a protector against all things evil, promotes happiness and good fortune, restores clear vision to the mind, and in Eastern traditions is seen as symbolic of the yang (male) power. It promotes leadership, communication and the connection of 'self' to the elements of earth and sky.

If you are feeling stuck, this is a great bowl to get things moving again.



   
The stone of truth, integrity and prosperity, Lapis enhances wisdom, inner vision and mental clarity. It encourages feelings of serenity and loving acceptance of self. Lapis helps us exhibit our inner power while purifying the spirit and our thoughts. Lapis is supportive in our interactions with our spirit guardians.

Similar to Mt. Shasta rising high in the sky, this crystal singing bowl helps you connect to higher vibrations. It lends itself to working with the energy of the planetary changes happening on Earth right now. It uses its tones to connect listeners to the Solar System, Galactic guidance and other beings working with us and the planet. It works in the same arena as the Platonic Year Gongs and tunings, but with more direct connection. On a personal level it helps release fear, confusion and trauma that you can be picking up during these planetary changes. It helps you and your clients be present during the changes the planet is going through.
The Mt. Shasta Serpentine bowl is great for lightworkers, psychics, Reiki healers, shamans and anyone who works with energy and wants to help others to gracefully accept the changes we are living through.

Crystal Tones™ Description
Connect with the mystical and magical properties of the Mt. Shasta vortex, and commune with the earth divas of the plant kingdom by attuning yourself to the frequencies of the Serpentine Bowl. Its green color honors the wisdom keepers of the plant and mineral kingdom as the Serpentine alchemy gives voice to their sacred knowledge. The spiraling tones of Serpentine bowl uncoil the serpent of Kundalini energy that rises from the base of the spine, climbing upward through the trunk and bursting forth with the fruits of enlightenment. The natural green energy of Serpentine keeps you grounded for a more graceful transformation, and this makes it the ultimate Feng Shui bowl, linking you with the natural ebb and flow of all life.

The Crystal Tones Sage Forest Gold Bowl is a small yet powerful bowl that works well in conjunction with other bowls. Its talent lies in enabling the release of auric detritus and energy that no longer serves you. It's powerful harmonic emanations scrub the chakras and mental body - in a sense 'polishing' away any spiritual dullness you may be feeling and giving you a sense of resistance to others’ energies and thoughts. Let the vibrations of this bowl carry unproductive energy attachments away. Once clear of energies that are not yours, you can more easily hear yourself, and find your own truth. Find your truth and you become your own Sage.
Other Observations About This Bowl
Sage can mean 'wise counselor' or refer to the healing herb. This bowl is the embodiment of both - it offers healing and wisdom. The Sage Forest Gold bowl helps to create a sense of connectedness with all of nature and a feeling of oneness with the universe. It keeps one grounded in divine purpose and fluid in each moment. Sage is held sacred by the Native American culture as an effective energy purifier. It brings balance and cleanses the body and mind of negative spirits and impurities. Sage is thought to relieve worry, open the mind to positive energies, and de-stress. Sage blended with gold, the 'Master Healer', brings further balance to the heart center and opens the third eye and crown chakras. Consider this bowl a great spiritual  counselor and an effective tool to bringing you closer to your highest purpose.

This spunky Crystal Tones Singing Bowl brings you as a spirit back to present time (a la Be Here Now) and keeps you grounded comfortably in space time.  It helps you connect to your first chakra, and your lower body. With that, it also helps get you out of random thoughts that do not serve your higher purpose.
It also has the great ability, this Tiger’s Eye, to help you tune into your body and help you  feel out areas of dis-ease that might be developing in your body or mind. Once you see it, if you don’t resist it, you can acknowledge it, and start to release the energy that is creating it, to lessen it or release it fully and bring in more wellness into that space.*Please NOTE: This is NOT in any way, shape or form a medical site, nor are we suggesting you will receive medical information while meditating with this bowl. If you feel like you have something that needs further attention, please go see an actual physician. We are talking spiritual healing here, not medical healing.
Other observations about this bowl
Tiger Eye aids harmony and balance, and can help you to let go of fear and anxiety, and help you to make decisions with discernment and understanding outside of emotions. Traditionally, Tiger Eye stones were carried as an amulet against curses or ill-wishing. It is thought to give courage, self confidence and strength of will. It enhances creativity and is one of the stones that aid kundalini awakening. Tiger eye is also a profound amplifier of energy. Used for protection and higher guidance, the Tiger Eye prevents negative energies from overtaking your spiritual self.

The Yagna Bowl is a great facilitator for finishing cycles of growth. Honoring the end of a cycle helps to prevent resisting spiritual change or prematurely forcing your way through your growth. Spiritual growth holds important lessons that should not be dismissed. The end of a growth cycle comes when you have worked through almost all of the energies that have revealed themselves, and you are now ready to tie up loose ends. The Crystal Tones Yagna Bowl is great for this. Set your intention to aligning your chakras and removing remnants of old growth while playing the Yagna bowl and you will find validation in new growth and the momentum to move past what no longer serves your higher purpose. We have found that it is best to play this bowl for 15 to 20 minutes to see a cycle come to its completion.

Crystal Tones™ Description
The sacred ashes from yagna ceremonies across the world have been infused into this powerful bowl. They contain the offerings of many thousands of mantras to a large host of gods and goddesses such as Ganesha, Lakshmi, Durga, Kali, Shiva and Vishnu. The ash from these sacred fires has a very high frequency signature that carries all the values and blessings of the yagnas.

This Grandmother Bowl by Crystal Tones is a great healer. It specifically focuses on damage or whacks you may have in your chakras and aura. Conflicts and competition in all sections of our lives, from business to family to school or just driving on the highway, can cause us to receive energy blasts from other people. Heck, even just walking down the street being outwardly happy can cause someone who is less happy to toss a chunk of negative energy your way. It doesn’t always stick, but when it does, you get a little whack or tear. If you get enough of these, your energy feels off, you feel weak or tired, or get sick. If these tears land in the right space, they can stifle your upward momentum and cause you to become stuck.
This crystal bowl is named the Grandmother Bowl for good reason. It soothes these wounds like a grandmother preparing a nice dessert or meal and listening to you. It helps release the whacks and tears and knits them back together with loving energy. This bowl is fantastic for therapists and healers who work with clients who may have trust issues, and for clients who are working to let go of the past and victimhood.

Crystal Tones™ Description
Every Grandmother’s love and caring is represented in this beautiful bowl. We honor the feminine energies in all and the Goddess/Crone as she reclaims her power on Earth. Embrace your soul’s ageless feminine wisdom and the spiraling DNA of creation/birth with The Grandmother Bowl. The Crone is Gaia energy. She is aligned with the graceful strength and dreamtime magic of the Swan and shamanic practices, at home in her body. Time apart and discernment expand her divine wisdom. Grandmother, Crone and Goddess walk the Grande Mother path.

Crystal Tones Larimar Mother of Platinum Bowl works to help you open up your crown chakra and allow you connect to the Divine.  It removes blocks that prevent you to connect with the spiritual to make it easier to hear the Divine. It enables you to clear out the kundalini energy channels and your clairaudient channels.

When you or clients need guidance to connect with the Divine to find their greatest and highest good, this is the crystal bowl to use.
 


Crystal Tones™ Description
﻿Larimar, though born of volcanic fire, is one of the cardinal water element stones. It balances the polarities of the fire and water energies, cools tempers, calms fears and stresses while nurturing the physical and emotional bodies. It is a powerful meditation aid and is helpful in breaking patterns that no longer serve the highest good. Larimar helps to connect to the divine feminine, releases emotional bonds, strengthens communication, and helps to bolster courage to speak from the heart. Add the properties of Mother of Platinum and you have a natural harmonizer that is helpful in working through emotional issues and giving birth to mature Divine Mother/Gaia energies in a sound stream of comfort. Larimar and Platinum can help us to let go of thoughts and patterns that no longer serve us. It allows one to balance the Divine feminine. By doing this, one can better be able to approach and figure out situations from a place of calmness.

The Lemurian Seed Bowl possesses a concentrated energy that lends itself to specific healing; particularly the eighth, ninth and tenth chakras – those chakras outside the physical body. It helps you bring that which you are working on in the astral and higher bodies into the foreground and allows you to dissolve blocks that may be preventing higher consciousness. Focus your intention on opening your 3rd chakra and allow the healing vibrations to bring forth new energies.

Other observations about this bowlThere are many theories about the existence of the lost continent of Lemuria. Was it in fact an ancient continent that stretched from the Hawaiian Islands to Fiji and from Easter Island to the Marianas? Was Lemuria the lost civilization responsible for the mysterious stone monuments of Easter Island? Or is Lemuria merely a metaphor that illustrates creation and destruction in relation to the first stirrings of human awareness? Author James Churchward writes about Lemuria (also referred to as Mu) in his book “Cosmic Forces of Mu”. He describes these cosmic forces as “those which make changes in the position of bodies, and sometimes change the body itself. No body or matter, however infinitesimally small or ponderously large, can make any change without the aid of a force.” The Lemurian Seed Crystal singing bowl is the vector for that force. It resonates with the power of change and creation.
*Please note that although the bowl appears to have color, this is an artificial effect that is intended to show the texture of the bowl. This unique bowl is clear quartz with Lemurian Seed Crystal both incorporated within the bowl structure and fused to the outside. This creates a very distinct texture that is difficult to show (clear crystal on a clear bowl) in photographs. Make note that this bowl is indeed clear to opaque quartz and as such, is inherently colorless in reality.

This Crystal Tones Bowl helps move stuck emotions and the lies that hold these emotions. Emotions naturally want to move, flow and dissipate when they’ve cycled through, but when there are spiritual concepts or lies that keep them from moving, they become stuck. For example, anger can be a positive and cleansing emotion, but if somewhere along your life someone convinced you that your anger was too much for them, or that you did not use it in an appropriate manner, you may have difficulties moving through your anger. Grief or sadness, if stuck and controlled by a lie, can prevent you from moving on and creating new things. Not only does this bowl help you move your emotional energy, it also works with the creative channels. It is great for artists, performers, and creative people of all stripes. Highly recommended.

The Crystal Tones Rose Bowl's higher pitched vibrations softly resonate and mingle with your higher chakras, the 5th, 6th and 7th (throat, third eye and crown). This bowl works well when you set your intention to bring connectedness to the hemispheres of your brain. This balancing translates to opening up the mind to higher thoughts versus being focused on darker, ‘negative’ thinking. An example of how this bowl can manifest healing: When working with depressed or addictive clients, at certain points in their recovery process, they will struggle with old mental patterns. This is a great bowl to facilitate the destruction of old habits while creating the energy to help build new, healthy habits.

Play the Sage Aura Gold Bowl by Crystal Tones and allow the gentle energies to go to work on the parts of those listening that are not in alignment with their Higher Self and the Divine. It helps one to work on removing self-judgment; where you feel you are not good enough to be communicating and receiving Divine healing, be it from this life or past lives. It shifts and helps release fear, confusion and invalidation in that connection. When your openness to ask and receive from the Universe is limited by these energies, you ask for and receive less. You receive less guidance through your meditations, because you are have already judged yourself to be unworthy. The Sage Aura Gold bowl is out to change that space. And from there it works a lot on your fourth and fifth chakras, once your self-worth is upgraded, then better able to express your creativity and you are able to more easily create greater things for yourself.

Crystal Tones™ Description
The Sage Forest Gold bowl helps to create a sense of connectedness with all of nature and a feeling of oneness with the universe.  It keeps one grounded in divine purpose and fluid in each moment. Sage is held sacred by the Native American culture as an effective energy purifier. It brings balance and cleanses the body and mind of negative spirits and impurities.  Sage is thought to relieve worry, open the mind to positive energies, and de-stress. Sage blended with gold, the 'Master Healer', brings further balance to the heart center and opens the third eye and crown chakras.

The White Gold Alchemy Crystal Tones Singing Bowl is a very strong bowl. You feel it when you are in its presence. It affects everything in its proximity with its powerful healing energy.
This bowl allows the loosening of old limitations on the body –  be they self-imposed, culturally imposed, etched into your DNA, or the ever-present socially imposed limitations that we face every day. As limitations are acknowledged and dissolved, your spirit-self can more easily move into and act upon your physical-self. The miracles you seek for yourself can manifest more easily and smoothly for you.  Remember, you are Spirit, and Spirit is Unlimited. And remember, what you want to create, versus what you have been told you can create is itself a limitation. As you heal with this bowl, meditate on that which you are looking to manifest. Concentrate on raising your energy, and clearing blocks, and you will create it more easily.  Allow your will to communicate and connect with the Divine and this bowl will help you make it easier.

The Crystal Tones Indian Pipestone Bowl is very grounding. You feel it in your first (root) chakra and your legs and feet. It allows your cells to accept higher vibrations.  
Your body is naturally attuned to and accepting of certain energies, but if you want to manifest more energetic light, this is the bowl for you. It helps you release outdated concepts you may have based on third dimensional perceptions, and facilitates the acceptance of information from the higher realms. It aids in gleaning wisdom, compassion, acceptance and answers for self. It moves your mind and body to connect with humanity’s highest spiritual evolutionary purpose. This bowl has the vibrational energy capacity to be useful for big events, so if you like healing large groups, you would do well with this bowl as your healing catalyst and psychic partner.







Other observations about this bowlPipestone (also known as Catlinite) is a type of red, metamorphic rock. This stone has been traditionally quarried by Native Americans and used for sacred ceremonial pipes - thus the name 'pipestone'. The quarries are found and preserved in the Pipestone National Monument in Minnestota, in Minnehaha County, South Dakota, and at the Pipestone River in Canada. The metaphysical properties of Pipestone enable one to connect the spiritual and the physical. It is useful for grounding prayer and ritual into physical, everyday life. It is also a very protective stone. It is thought to enable communication with spirits and the ancestors. The metaphysical properties of pipestone infused into this bowl make it a more than apt catalyst for whatever kind of spiritual goals and healing you set your intentions to. We think it's an essential piece to add your sound healing collection.

 The Indigo Bowl by Crystal Tones allows you to let go of past trials and tribulations, the traumas that are in your body. It does it for the ones you have experienced, but miraculously also works to release the ones your ancestors had that were strong enough that they were carried in your DNA. The Indigo Bowl works on your cells, and RNA and DNA.  It revitalizes it, as it can suffer from all the stress and environmental toxins you have experienced. It also can de-energize potential predispositions to hereditary diseases.   (PLEASE NOTE: The statement above is not medical advice. We are talking about spiritual healing.  Spiritual healing can resonate through the body, but we are not making any medical claims.) By releasing the pains and traumas from your cells, your body has more space to allow more light into it. The more of your energy and light, the brighter your aura gets and the more your health improves.



Crystal Tones™ Description

 The Crystal Tones Lepidolite (li-pid-l-ahyt) Bowl helps to de-energize toxins in the cells of your body.  It does it in a special way; it focuses on the lies and programming that keeps you or your brain/body believing that you need these toxins. (E.g. – certain foods, recreational drugs, etc.)  Let us be clear, the Lepidolite Bowl is not going to instantly zap away addictions, but it does work in this arena. So if you have clients that are taking other concrete steps towards conquering their addictions, this bowl lends its energy well to recovery. Besides working with the body, it can help you to heal rips and tears in your aura. These rips and tears are the entry point for negative energies and influences to seep in and pull one back towards addictive thoughts and activities. This is a great bowl to add to your sound healing package. 





Crystal Tones™ Description
This synergistic blend of potassium, lithium, and aluminum silicate, generates profound emotional healing, generational balance, stress relief, and relaxing calm. As this stunningly potent alchemy clears depression, one becomes aware of their emotional body, moving it into the heart and clearing emotional energy through the heart. Lepidolite fosters the process of letting go of judgment and allowing forgiveness. Purification and clarification of the third eye, serenity and calmness, accepting, letting go of fear and anger, group alignment; these are all stimulated by Lepidolite. This alchemy also assists with calming the crown, centering the flow of balance, and restless sleep problems. (Enhance Lepidolite with: Androgynous Indium, Ruby, White Alchemy Gold)

Crystal Tones’ Phenacite (fen-uh-sahyt) Bowl has a strong powerful tone that resonates profoundly when played, but it is the energic component from within its sound vibrations that is the deep healer here. Phenacite ignites the communication between your conscious personality, the “I” of you, and your higher vibration, you as soul, and the Divine.    
What happens then? As the bowl’s energy connects these three elements - conscious awareness, you as spirit, and the Divine - it allows you to release blockage that may be keeping your mind from hearing what you truly want and need. It’s often hard to hear that in the day-to-day monologue of the ego.
When this happens, if you work with it, it can be a life changer! This is a great bowl for working with clients who report being stuck in a rut, unable to move forward with plans, feeling lost and adrift.

Crystal Tones™ Description
Start your energetic engine and get ready for inter-dimensional travel with the sound of Phenacite. This high-frequency alchemy resonates with the hexagonal sacred geometry of the Merkaba, and resonates with advanced beings who are ready to embrace their magnificence, activate their light body, and sail into the multi-universe. The Phenacite bowl spins a galactic vortex of dynamic energy for evolution, and becomes a birthing portal for quantum leap consciousness, clearing all obstacles to move one forward and up to the next level with lightning speed.
Ambassador of the mystical properties of the Mt Shasta vortex, the natural green energy of Serpentine keeps you grounded in grace during our journey of loving transformation, aligning you with the natural ebb and flow of all life.

The Crystal Tones Azeztulite (Uh-Zezz-too-lyt) Bowl is what we refer to as a 'binder' bowl. Azeztulite is a special type of white quartz that brings elements together. The soothing tones of this magnificent bowl help you to facilitate communication and connectedness between the body, spirit and mind. Play this bowl to make yourself whole, or use this bowl in group sound healings to bring connectedness and unity to your group. Bring the power of this bowl into sessions with clients who want to heal inter-familial rifts, or want to manifest healing and communication between cultural and social divisions or conflicts. 
Set your intention to finishing healing cycles and allow the Azeztulite energy to help you bring about closure with past issues you may be hanging onto that no longer serve you. Allow the sound and energy to give you gentle momentum to move past emotional grievances.

Crystal Tones™ Description
Azeztulite is a celestial connector of the “I AM” energy. The frequency of spiritual light above and below us is linked, and the resulting energy sphere is highlighted in the third dimension for heightened consciousness and understanding. This powerful alchemy changes our cellular energy, allowing our awareness to properly expand and illuminate. Azeztulite is said to be among the highest vibrations in the Mineral Kingdom. Attuning to it can activate the third eye and crown chakras, as well as chakras above the head in the etheric body. As a special conduit for this energy, the clearing of disease in its many forms is permitted, allowing for an ease in the experience of being in the world, but not being of it. Merkaba ascension is fostered as one more easily tunes in to the pulses of the universe, activating the bridges for dimensional travel. Azeztulite is considered to be the primary stone of the Great Central Sun, and can create many changes both personally and globally as we move into the Age of Awareness. Achieving this universal higher-state frequency is greatly accelerated with this potent crystal alchemy, as one more easily recognizes and claims their universe citizenship.

The Crystal Tones Charcoal Bowl is a fascinating sound healing instrument.
 Activated Charcoal is sometimes used in emergency rooms to aid in removal of poisons and drugs from the digestive system. By the process of adsorption, the toxic elements bind to the charcoal. This crystal bowl works in much the same way, but with energy. Play this bowl and it will fill you or your clients auras and chakras with a fine mist of charcoal energy. You can then ask this energy, while it is in your space, to help you release energies you are finishing with. The charcoal energy will bind with them and then you can ground them out, or visualize them leaving your aura and being neutralized. Do this several times and you will feel lighter, unburdened. Then fill up these spaces with your own light and healing energy. This is the only Crystal Tones bowl in which we have observed this property so far. It is really a unique one.







Crystal Tones™ Description
Move into uncharted spiritual and physical dimensions with the pure crystal charcoal bowl alchemy, a grounding tool for today’s rapidly accelerating and expansive energies. The ultimate sound portal for clarity, personal vision and release of physical, emotional, and spiritual toxins. Highly prized in ancient Egypt as early as 1550 BC, and for centuries in Japan, bamboo and other charcoals are often used in physical and spiritual healing because of their ability to absorb toxins and impurities. Quartz crystal with charcoal creates neutralizing positive ions in a waveform that “makes everyday life better.” An anecdote for poisons in the body and environment, charcoal can help uplift and remove negative states of being. The Charcoal Bowl can help dissipate confusion and achieve balance. As one moves through life’s crossroads this crystalline-infused energy offers guidance for problems or situations that are arising. With intention, this bowl can be a helping agent for removing negativity, bringing about hope, unconditional love, nurturing, grounding, appreciation of the feminine and nature. Evoke mystic visions, spiritual and romantic love, tenderness, kindness, sensitivity and psychic abilities.

Unlimited Singing Bowls Clairvoyant Assessment of This Bowl
This Frankincense bowl by Crystal Tones creates vibrations that work on removing and releasing energies that are in conflict and parts of you that are fighting your true self or holding you back from where you want to go. This bowl facilitates the dissolution of conflicting energies and allows you to create inner peace.
We find this bowl is good to play in concert with other healing bowls that focus on clearing energy. In this way when the conflicted parts of you that are struggling get energized to leave, they have help to depart. Then you can more easily become a whole and peaceful being.

Crystal Tones™ Description
Elevating personal and spiritual love, Frankincense heightens awareness by inspiring and awakening our spiritual senses. Transforming and expanding our consciousness; frankincense accelerates spiritual growth as it opens the crown chakra, causing the energy bodies to align within the physical.

The Green Heart Ocean Gold Singing Bowl lets you know, via its name, where it heals. It is ready, willing and able to work on your fourth (heart) chakra. Let its ocean vibrations loosen the grip of invalidation, guilt, judgment and other energies that hinder feelings of self-worth. Those energies will bring your thoughts down too. When you don’t like yourself, its hard to change your life and create the things you want.Be present with this bowl and set your intention to release fourth chakra blocks, and let the energy progress to other chakras that may be holding energy that no longer serves you. If you want more love for yourself and others, this bowl is the catalyst to giving and receiving love in abundance.

This bowl streams forth Neptunian pearl-like waveforms with bubbly, playful dolphin pod energies that encourage loving communication. It can enhance the immune system and activate the thymus gland. The "We Are One" throat chakra knowing promotes shared leadership and teamwork. Yang frequencies of gold and water elementals create love, balance, self-realization and attunement with nature's healing forces.

The Lavender Sunset Gold Bowl works on your ability to take in and process energy.  Think Prana. Prana is the Sanskrit word meaning 'breath' or 'life force'. Your breath literally moves life force energy through your body.
If your ability to receive and process prana is weakened, then your body will not be as strong a vessel for your spiritual self. The Lavender Sunset Gold bowl helps lighten, energize and update your system; enhancing your ability to re-vitalize yourself. You are strengthened in the fullest sense - in body and spirit. This beautiful bowl provides a “crystallized pranayama” healing.



 
Other observations about this bowl
Lavender, as an herb, possesses several healing properties. It has been used aromatically, to soothe and calm - for those who suffer anxiety, depression or mental exhaustion. It is also known to be used medicinally for all manner of ailments; rashes, fevers, sunburn. The Lavender Sunset Gold Bowl is the representation of these healing properties  - it is not a literal representation, nor is it literally infused with lavender itself - but helps you to manifest healing within yourself. The beautiful tones it creates generate powerful healing energy that anyone will find useful for cleansing and renewing the spirit.

This Pink Aura Gold Crystal Singing Bowl is a powerful catalyst for working on the seventh chakra (crown) and higher, external energy bodies. Set your intention for integrating higher energies into your consciousness and bathe in the healing frequency of this bowl. This bowl is a wonderful healing companion for the person who seeks to bring their higher knowledge and formerly shapeless ideas into their awareness and help them to take action:  inventors, scientists, creatives, entrepreneurs, healers, etc.
We see this as a great bowl for new lives and new learners that are struggling to understand higher spiritual information and how to integrate that information into their whole selves.
Some people will immediately think of  “Indigo Children,” but this is not a bowl for a narrow section of souls. All souls, when they are new, work to attain spiritual knowledge. For some it can be easier and others harder. This Pink Aura Crystal bowl can work for any soul that may not be adapting to this path smoothly - or anyone having troubles in school, home, etc.  

Crystal Tones™ Description
A high-frequency love alchemy resonating with the pure energy of the Magdalene. A companion of unconditional and courageous love, Pink Aura Gold resonates the enacting of all activities from a heart-centered origin. The radiant healing love source vibration guides the heart to inspire the mind.

The Tanzanite Crystal Tones Singing Bowl enables you to focus on healing where you have deep spiritual blocks and allows you to more easily channel other energies. 
While this is a solid bowl for helping clean out any spiritual detritus one might pick up from the various beings we come into contact with, it is also useful in recovering from psychic attack. Tanzanite is also a great healer for those in a leadership position – teachers, managers, politicians or performers.  These people can become affected by a wide spectrum of energies (both negative and positive) and find themselves overcome with uncertainty. This Tanzanite bowl facilitates cleansing of the space of 'self' and helps clarify purpose of being. It can help you clear the path to discover your latent talents and helps you see projects you put aside, because of self-doubt, through to completion. It is a deep core healer and illuminator of new information.
   



Crystal Tones™ Description
The sweet tones of Tanzanite sing the anthems of truth and celebrate the dance of the authentic self. Tanzanite sets the stage for you to drop the masks of self-protection and deception, and embrace your true self with enlightened compassion, inviting joy to join you in the dance. The song of Tanzanite creates a communion with body and soul, giving an eloquent voice to the heart. By calming your overactive mind and synchronizing the heart with the brain, Tanzanite allows you to clearly speak your truth, and claim your heart's desire. (Enhance Tanzanite with Moldavite, Phenacite, Mother of Platinum and Rhodochrosite)

The Violet Aura Gold Bowl by Crystal Tones is a bowl that wastes no time. It can help you to strengthen the astral body and enhance your aura - helping you to take care of “unfinished business.” The unfinished stuff could include lingering energy from past relationships, communications, businesses, projects, etc. These energies from the past can drag your high energy down. The Violet Aura Gold Crystal Bowl can help you move this energy. It allows you to bring in forgiveness and other healing energies to release these blocks. When this release happens, you become filled with your own energy and freed of impediments to creating new things and gives you a sense of new vitality. When you have more freedom, you can do more things. You might even be able to have more fun, relax more! Yes, of course, this bowl also works on past life unfinished business as well. It is a great karma releaser.

Crystal Tones™ Description

In Hinduism and Buddhism violet is associated with the crown chakra - the center for trust, devotion, inspiration, happiness, and positivity. Violet represents the future, imagination and dreams. It promotes the harmony of the mind and one’s emotions; creating a link between the spiritual and physical worlds and thought and activity. Violet also supports the practice of meditation and helps you connect to your higher self. This bowl combines the elements of violet and gold to help you transform your lower energies into upper energies, inspire knowledge and spirituality, and foster a deeper understanding of the self and the soul.

Unlimited Singing Bowls is honored to offer Crystal Tones Singing Bowls. These crystal bowls are made in the USA from extremely pure quartz. Some of the bowls from this collection are also blended and forged with gemstones and precious metals. Crystal Tones bowls are the highest quality, we have found, available in the world.
This collection of gemstone and precious metal infused Crystal Tones bowls is called the "Alchemy" series. We can attest from our study and usage of them, that they truly are alchemical, not in the base medieval sense of turning physical lead into gold, but in the spiritual sense, wherein these bowls, when played, offer you energetic transformations.  You can raise your vibration, and the energies of others when you play these bowls. The healings are deep in the aura, the chakras, and the soul - as well as within the body. The sounds these bowls create are more than just sound. They carry the energy of the quartz and all the specific infused elements.
Unlimited Singing Bowls offers our unique, clairvoyant assessments of each bowl where we can, and as time goes on, we will have sample videos of them as well. We highly recommend you consider adding Crystal Tones bowls to your sound healing instruments.

The Turquoise Crystal Tones Bowl is a solid citizen; an overall sound healer. It creates a safe grounded space that works gently on the chakras to aid in accepting healing. People new to receiving sound healing will love this bowl.It works on all the endocrine glands, which are related to the chakras, so the spirit and body connect well. It is a good 'completer bowl' -  the one to play to close your event. After the other bowls have completed their work, you seal up the healing with the Turquoise bowl. Expressing an uplifting and calming aspect, Turquoise guides spiritual attunement, emotional healing, and balances the auric body. Compassionate in working with the throat chakra, Turquoise is a master healer, attractor of prosperity and fertility. A loving provider of strength during vision quests.


Crystal Tones™ Description
The name Turquoise is derived from the French, pierre turquoise, meaning “Turkish stone" so named likely because of its prevalence along early Turkish trade routes. Native American priests wore it in ceremonies when calling upon the great spirit of the sky. Turquoise is often honored as the universal stone as those who tuned into its energies believed their minds would become one with the universe. Turquoise was often used in prophesy or divining.  In Native American lore Turquoise is also reputed to be influenced by the physical condition of the person who wears it. It is thought to grow pale when its owner is sick or sad, lose all color when the person dies, and gradually recover its color when transferred to a new healthy owner. Turquoise is a protector against all things evil, promotes happiness and good fortune, restores clear vision to the mind, and in Eastern traditions is seen as symbolic of the yang (male) power. It promotes leadership, communication and the connection of 'self' to the elements of earth and sky.

Similar to Mt. Shasta rising high in the sky, this crystal singing bowl helps you connect to higher vibrations. It lends itself to working with the energy of the planetary changes happening on Earth right now. It uses its tones to connect listeners to the Solar System, Galactic guidance and other beings working with us and the planet. It works in the same arena as the Platonic Year Gongs and tunings, but with more direct connection. On a personal level it helps release fear, confusion and trauma that you can be picking up during these planetary changes. It helps you and your clients be present during the changes the planet is going through.
The Mt. Shasta Serpentine bowl is great for lightworkers, psychics, Reiki healers, shamans and anyone who works with energy and wants to help others to gracefully accept the changes we are living through.

Crystal Tones™ Description
Connect with the mystical and magical properties of the Mt. Shasta vortex, and commune with the earth divas of the plant kingdom by attuning yourself to the frequencies of the Serpentine Bowl. Its green color honors the wisdom keepers of the plant and mineral kingdom as the Serpentine alchemy gives voice to their sacred knowledge. The spiraling tones of Serpentine bowl uncoil the serpent of Kundalini energy that rises from the base of the spine, climbing upward through the trunk and bursting forth with the fruits of enlightenment. The natural green energy of Serpentine keeps you grounded for a more graceful transformation, and this makes it the ultimate Feng Shui bowl, linking you with the natural ebb and flow of all life.

The Crystal Tones Sage Forest Gold Bowl is a small yet powerful bowl that works well in conjunction with other bowls. Its talent lies in enabling the release of auric detritus and energy that no longer serves you. It's powerful harmonic emanations scrub the chakras and mental body - in a sense 'polishing' away any spiritual dullness you may be feeling and giving you a sense of resistance to others’ energies and thoughts. Let the vibrations of this bowl carry unproductive energy attachments away. Once clear of energies that are not yours, you can more easily hear yourself, and find your own truth. Find your truth and you become your own Sage.
Other Observations About This Bowl
Sage can mean 'wise counselor' or refer to the healing herb. This bowl is the embodiment of both - it offers healing and wisdom. The Sage Forest Gold bowl helps to create a sense of connectedness with all of nature and a feeling of oneness with the universe. It keeps one grounded in divine purpose and fluid in each moment. Sage is held sacred by the Native American culture as an effective energy purifier. It brings balance and cleanses the body and mind of negative spirits and impurities. Sage is thought to relieve worry, open the mind to positive energies, and de-stress. Sage blended with gold, the 'Master Healer', brings further balance to the heart center and opens the third eye and crown chakras. Consider this bowl a great spiritual  counselor and an effective tool to bringing you closer to your highest purpose.

This spunky Crystal Tones Singing Bowl brings you as a spirit back to present time (a la Be Here Now) and keeps you grounded comfortably in space time.  It helps you connect to your first chakra, and your lower body. With that, it also helps get you out of random thoughts that do not serve your higher purpose.
It also has the great ability, this Tiger’s Eye, to help you tune into your body and help you  feel out areas of dis-ease that might be developing in your body or mind. Once you see it, if you don’t resist it, you can acknowledge it, and start to release the energy that is creating it, to lessen it or release it fully and bring in more wellness into that space.*Please NOTE: This is NOT in any way, shape or form a medical site, nor are we suggesting you will receive medical information while meditating with this bowl.

The Yagna Bowl is a great facilitator for finishing cycles of growth. Honoring the end of a cycle helps to prevent resisting spiritual change or prematurely forcing your way through your growth. Spiritual growth holds important lessons that should not be dismissed. The end of a growth cycle comes when you have worked through almost all of the energies that have revealed themselves, and you are now ready to tie up loose ends. The Crystal Tones Yagna Bowl is great for this. Set your intention to aligning your chakras and removing remnants of old growth while playing the Yagna bowl and you will find validation in new growth and the momentum to move past what no longer serves your higher purpose. We have found that it is best to play this bowl for 15 to 20 minutes to see a cycle come to its completion.

Crystal Tones™ Description
The sacred ashes from yagna ceremonies across the world have been infused into this powerful bowl. They contain the offerings of many thousands of mantras to a large host of gods and goddesses such as Ganesha, Lakshmi, Durga, Kali, Shiva and Vishnu. The ash from these sacred fires has a very high frequency signature that carries all the values and blessings of the yagnas. This energy is transmitted through the sound produced by the bowls and assists in the absorption of higher truth and wisdom.

This Grandmother Bowl by Crystal Tones is a great healer. It specifically focuses on damage or whacks you may have in your chakras and aura. Conflicts and competition in all sections of our lives, from business to family to school or just driving on the highway, can cause us to receive energy blasts from other people. Heck, even just walking down the street being outwardly happy can cause someone who is less happy to toss a chunk of negative energy your way. It doesn’t always stick, but when it does, you get a little whack or tear. If you get enough of these, your energy feels off, you feel weak or tired, or get sick. If these tears land in the right space, they can stifle your upward momentum and cause you to become stuck.
This crystal bowl is named the Grandmother Bowl for good reason. It soothes these wounds like a grandmother preparing a nice dessert or meal and listening to you. It helps release the whacks and tears and knits them back together with loving energy. This bowl is fantastic for therapists and healers who work with clients who may have trust issues, and for clients who are working to let go of the past and victimhood.

Crystal Tones™ Description
Every Grandmother’s love and caring is represented in this beautiful bowl. We honor the feminine energies in all and the Goddess/Crone as she reclaims her power on Earth.

The Lemurian Seed Bowl possesses a concentrated energy that lends itself to specific healing; particularly the eighth, ninth and tenth chakras – those chakras outside the physical body. It helps you bring that which you are working on in the astral and higher bodies into the foreground and allows you to dissolve blocks that may be preventing higher consciousness. Focus your intention on opening your 3rd chakra and allow the healing vibrations to bring forth new energies.

Other observations about this bowlThere are many theories about the existence of the lost continent of Lemuria. Was it in fact an ancient continent that stretched from the Hawaiian Islands to Fiji and from Easter Island to the Marianas? Was Lemuria the lost civilization responsible for the mysterious stone monuments of Easter Island? Or is Lemuria merely a metaphor that illustrates creation and destruction in relation to the first stirrings of human awareness? Author James Churchward writes about Lemuria (also referred to as Mu) in his book “Cosmic Forces of Mu”. He describes these cosmic forces as “those which make changes in the position of bodies, and sometimes change the body itself. No body or matter, however infinitesimally small or ponderously large, can make any change without the aid of a force.” The Lemurian Seed Crystal singing bowl is the vector for that force. It resonates with the power of change and creation.
*Please note that although the bowl appears to have color, this is an artificial effect that is intended to show the texture of the bowl. This unique bowl is clear quartz with Lemurian Seed Crystal both incorporated within the bowl structure and fused to the outside. This creates a very distinct texture that is difficult to show (clear crystal on a clear bowl) in photographs. Make note that this bowl is indeed clear to opaque quartz and as such, is inherently colorless in reality.

Emotions naturally want to move, flow and dissipate when they’ve cycled through, but when there are spiritual concepts or lies that keep them from moving, they become stuck. For example, anger can be a positive and cleansing emotion, but if somewhere along your life someone convinced you that your anger was too much for them, or that you did not use it in an appropriate manner, you may have difficulties moving through your anger. Grief or sadness, if stuck and controlled by a lie, can prevent you from moving on and creating new things. Not only does this bowl help you move your emotional energy, it also works with the creative channels. It is great for artists, performers, and creative people of all stripes. Highly recommended.

The Crystal Tones Rose Bowl's higher pitched vibrations softly resonate and mingle with your higher chakras, the 5th, 6th and 7th (throat, third eye and crown). This bowl works well when you set your intention to bring connectedness to the hemispheres of your brain. This balancing translates to opening up the mind to higher thoughts versus being focused on darker, ‘negative’ thinking. An example of how this bowl can manifest healing: When working with depressed or addictive clients, at certain points in their recovery process, they will struggle with old mental patterns. This is a great bowl to facilitate the destruction of old habits while creating the energy to help build new, healthy habits.

Play the Sage Aura Gold Bowl by Crystal Tones and allow the gentle energies to go to work on the parts of those listening that are not in alignment with their Higher Self and the Divine. It helps one to work on removing self-judgment; where you feel you are not good enough to be communicating and receiving Divine healing, be it from this life or past lives. It shifts and helps release fear, confusion and invalidation in that connection. When your openness to ask and receive from the Universe is limited by these energies, you ask for and receive less. You receive less guidance through your meditations, because you are have already judged yourself to be unworthy. The Sage Aura Gold bowl is out to change that space. And from there it works a lot on your fourth and fifth chakras, once your self-worth is upgraded, then better able to express your creativity and you are able to more easily create greater things for yourself.

Crystal Tones™ Description
The Sage Forest Gold bowl helps to create a sense of connectedness with all of nature and a feeling of oneness with the universe.  It keeps one grounded in divine purpose and fluid in each moment. Sage is held sacred by the Native American culture as an effective energy purifier. It brings balance and cleanses the body and mind of negative spirits and impurities.  Sage is thought to relieve worry, open the mind to positive energies, and de-stress. Sage blended with gold, the 'Master Healer', brings further balance to the heart center and opens the third eye and crown chakras.

The White Gold Alchemy Crystal Tones Singing Bowl is a very strong bowl. You feel it when you are in its presence. It affects everything in its proximity with its powerful healing energy.
This bowl allows the loosening of old limitations on the body –  be they self-imposed, culturally imposed, etched into your DNA, or the ever-present socially imposed limitations that we face every day. As limitations are acknowledged and dissolved, your spirit-self can more easily move into and act upon your physical-self. The miracles you seek for yourself can manifest more easily and smoothly for you.  Remember, you are Spirit, and Spirit is Unlimited. And remember, what you want to create, versus what you have been told you can create is itself a limitation. As you heal with this bowl, meditate on that which you are looking to manifest. Concentrate on raising your energy, and clearing blocks, and you will create it more easily.  Allow your will to communicate and connect with the Divine and this bowl will help you make it easier.

The Crystal Tones Indian Pipestone Bowl is very grounding. You feel it in your first (root) chakra and your legs and feet. It allows your cells to accept higher vibrations.  
Your body is naturally attuned to and accepting of certain energies, but if you want to manifest more energetic light, this is the bowl for you. It helps you release outdated concepts you may have based on third dimensional perceptions, and facilitates the acceptance of information from the higher realms. It aids in gleaning wisdom, compassion, acceptance and answers for self. It moves your mind and body to connect with humanity’s highest spiritual evolutionary purpose. This bowl has the vibrational energy capacity to be useful for big events, so if you like healing large groups, you would do well with this bowl as your healing catalyst and psychic partner.







Other observations about this bowlPipestone (also known as Catlinite) is a type of red, metamorphic rock. This stone has been traditionally quarried by Native Americans and used for sacred ceremonial pipes - thus the name 'pipestone'. The quarries are found and preserved in the Pipestone National Monument in Minnestota, in Minnehaha County, South Dakota, and at the Pipestone River in Canada. The metaphysical properties of Pipestone enable one to connect the spiritual and the physical. It is useful for grounding prayer and ritual into physical, everyday life. It is also a very protective stone. It is thought to enable communication with spirits and the ancestors. The metaphysical properties of pipestone infused into this bowl make it a more than apt catalyst for whatever kind of spiritual goals and healing you set your intentions to. We think it's an essential piece to add your sound healing collection.

 The Indigo Bowl by Crystal Tones allows you to let go of past trials and tribulations, the traumas that are in your body. It does it for the ones you have experienced, but miraculously also works to release the ones your ancestors had that were strong enough that they were carried in your DNA. The Indigo Bowl works on your cells, and RNA and DNA.  It revitalizes it, as it can suffer from all the stress and environmental toxins you have experienced. It also can de-energize potential predispositions to hereditary diseases.   (PLEASE NOTE: The statement above is not medical advice. We are talking about spiritual healing.  Spiritual healing can resonate through the body, but we are not making any medical claims.) By releasing the pains and traumas from your cells, your body has more space to allow more light into it. The more of your energy and light, the brighter your aura gets and the more your health improves.

 The Crystal Tones Lepidolite (li-pid-l-ahyt) Bowl helps to de-energize toxins in the cells of your body.  It does it in a special way; it focuses on the lies and programming that keeps you or your brain/body believing that you need these toxins. (E.g. – certain foods, recreational drugs, etc.)  Let us be clear, the Lepidolite Bowl is not going to instantly zap away addictions, but it does work in this arena. So if you have clients that are taking other concrete steps towards conquering their addictions, this bowl lends its energy well to recovery. Besides working with the body, it can help you to heal rips and tears in your aura. These rips and tears are the entry point for negative energies and influences to seep in and pull one back towards addictive thoughts and activities. This is a great bowl to add to your sound healing package.

Purification and clarification of the third eye, serenity and calmness, accepting, letting go of fear and anger, group alignment; these are all stimulated by Lepidolite. This alchemy also assists with calming the crown, centering the flow of balance, and restless sleep problems. (Enhance Lepidolite with: Androgynous Indium, Ruby, White Alchemy Gold)

With purity and gentle passion for divine will in action, the overtone that this beautiful alchemy exudes, promotes the Oneness that allows us to hold the love frequency with clarity, seeing the illusion of the past without regret, and helping manifest self-forgiveness. Morganite offers a confirmational energy that allows you better to see that everything is perfection in process. Old burdens and tragedies dissolve as we fulfill our self-teaching, and the realization that the hardest lessons in life are the most important to our alignment and mastery. The clearing of habitual relationship patterns that no longer serve us is often a by-product of this alchemy, as we honor the unity of Spirit and embrace the Angelic Heart. (Enhance Morganite with: Mother of Platinum, Azeztulite, Rhodochrosite)

Crystal Tones’ Phenacite (fen-uh-sahyt) Bowl has a strong powerful tone that resonates profoundly when played, but it is the energic component from within its sound vibrations that is the deep healer here. Phenacite ignites the communication between your conscious personality, the “I” of you, and your higher vibration, you as soul, and the Divine.    
What happens then? As the bowl’s energy connects these three elements - conscious awareness, you as spirit, and the Divine - it allows you to release blockage that may be keeping your mind from hearing what you truly want and need. It’s often hard to hear that in the day-to-day monologue of the ego.
When this happens, if you work with it, it can be a life changer! This is a great bowl for working with clients who report being stuck in a rut, unable to move forward with plans, feeling lost and adrift.

Crystal Tones™ Description
Start your energetic engine and get ready for inter-dimensional travel with the sound of Phenacite. This high-frequency alchemy resonates with the hexagonal sacred geometry of the Merkaba, and resonates with advanced beings who are ready to embrace their magnificence, activate their light body, and sail into the multi-universe. The Phenacite bowl spins a galactic vortex of dynamic energy for evolution, and becomes a birthing portal for quantum leap consciousness, clearing all obstacles to move one forward and up to the next level with lightning speed.
Ambassador of the mystical properties of the Mt Shasta vortex, the natural green energy of Serpentine keeps you grounded in grace during our journey of loving transformation, aligning you with the natural ebb and flow of all life.

This Ruby Bowl is an amazing fourth (heart) chakra healer. It helps heal by reconnecting us via the heart chakra to the Divine Givingness of the Universe.

It can help you attract more of what you want. If you pray for things and feel that you are unheard or that you don’t deserve what you ask for, this is a great crystal bowl. Sometimes we can ask for things, but the limits we carry within ourselves prevent us from receiving. This is a great bowl for working through your limits, a great bowl for people working with the Law of Attraction.
This Crystal Tones Ruby Bowl opens you up to Divine Grace and Abundance, and really helps you focus intention on what you wish to achieve through your prayers.

The Selenite Violet Flame Sky Bowl by Crystal Tones is a great purifier. It helps you to cleanse and purify energy channels and enable you to repel other people's unwanted negative spirits and energies. Have other people's ego games been getting in the way of you moving forward? This energy of this bowl can help you push them out of your space. We think this is a great bowl for those long days, interminable weeks, or big events when you get coated with other people’s thoughts or energies. Play this bowl with intentions for protection and purification and you can clean them out.

The more you have of just yourself, the brighter you will shine.

Crystal Tones™ Description
Selenite is the sonic wand of healing. The sound of selenite can be directed with laser-like intention to work on specific areas of the body or used to cut away etheric disharmony, disease or blocked energy. The sonic waves of selenite can also be used to cover thousands of directions at once, cutting cords and freeing you from the draining effect or bondage of unhealthy relationships or connections. Selinite combines synergistically with any bowl in a symphony of sound, amplifying whatever energies one wishes to work with. Its fiber optic quality makes it a powerful energy scanner, keeping you on the cutting edge of awareness and personal power.

This crystal bowl helps release guilt and gets more of your energy free and in the present so you can create more of what you want for yourself now.

The Crystal Tones Azeztulite (Uh-Zezz-too-lyt) Bowl is what we refer to as a 'binder' bowl. Azeztulite is a special type of white quartz that brings elements together. The soothing tones of this magnificent bowl help you to facilitate communication and connectedness between the body, spirit and mind. Play this bowl to make yourself whole, or use this bowl in group sound healings to bring connectedness and unity to your group. Bring the power of this bowl into sessions with clients who want to heal inter-familial rifts, or want to manifest healing and communication between cultural and social divisions or conflicts. 
Set your intention to finishing healing cycles and allow the Azeztulite energy to help you bring about closure with past issues you may be hanging onto that no longer serve you. Allow the sound and energy to give you gentle momentum to move past emotional grievances.

Crystal Tones™ Description
Azeztulite is a celestial connector of the “I AM” energy. The frequency of spiritual light above and below us is linked, and the resulting energy sphere is highlighted in the third dimension for heightened consciousness and understanding. This powerful alchemy changes our cellular energy, allowing our awareness to properly expand and illuminate. Azeztulite is said to be among the highest vibrations in the Mineral Kingdom. Attuning to it can activate the third eye and crown chakras, as well as chakras above the head in the etheric body. As a special conduit for this energy, the clearing of disease in its many forms is permitted, allowing for an ease in the experience of being in the world, but not being of it. Merkaba ascension is fostered as one more easily tunes in to the pulses of the universe, activating the bridges for dimensional travel. Azeztulite is considered to be the primary stone of the Great Central Sun, and can create many changes both personally and globally as we move into the Age of Awareness. Achieving this universal higher-state frequency is greatly accelerated with this potent crystal alchemy, as one more easily recognizes and claims their universe citizenship. (Enhance Azeztulite with: Diamond, Morganite, Sunstone)

The Crystal Tones Charcoal Bowl is a fascinating sound healing instrument.
 Activated Charcoal is sometimes used in emergency rooms to aid in removal of poisons and drugs from the digestive system. By the process of adsorption, the toxic elements bind to the charcoal. This crystal bowl works in much the same way, but with energy. Play this bowl and it will fill you or your clients auras and chakras with a fine mist of charcoal energy. You can then ask this energy, while it is in your space, to help you release energies you are finishing with. The charcoal energy will bind with them and then you can ground them out, or visualize them leaving your aura and being neutralized. Do this several times and you will feel lighter, unburdened. Then fill up these spaces with your own light and healing energy. This is the only Crystal Tones bowl in which we have observed this property so far. It is really a unique one.







Crystal Tones™ Description
Move into uncharted spiritual and physical dimensions with the pure crystal charcoal bowl alchemy, a grounding tool for today’s rapidly accelerating and expansive energies. The ultimate sound portal for clarity, personal vision and release of physical, emotional, and spiritual toxins. Highly prized in ancient Egypt as early as 1550 BC, and for centuries in Japan, bamboo and other charcoals are often used in physical and spiritual healing because of their ability to absorb toxins and impurities. Quartz crystal with charcoal creates neutralizing positive ions in a waveform that “makes everyday life better.” An anecdote for poisons in the body and environment, charcoal can help uplift and remove negative states of being. The Charcoal Bowl can help dissipate confusion and achieve balance. As one moves through life’s crossroads this crystalline-infused energy offers guidance for problems or situations that are arising. With intention, this bowl can be a helping agent for removing negativity, bringing about hope, unconditional love, nurturing, grounding, appreciation of the feminine and nature. Evoke mystic visions, spiritual and romantic love, tenderness, kindness, sensitivity and psychic abilities.

The Lavender Sunset Gold Bowl works on your ability to take in and process energy.  Think Prana. Prana is the Sanskrit word meaning 'breath' or 'life force'. Your breath literally moves life force energy through your body.
If your ability to receive and process prana is weakened, then your body will not be as strong a vessel for your spiritual self. The Lavender Sunset Gold bowl helps lighten, energize and update your system; enhancing your ability to re-vitalize yourself. You are strengthened in the fullest sense - in body and spirit. This beautiful bowl provides a “crystallized pranayama” healing.



 
Other observations about this bowl
Lavender, as an herb, possesses several healing properties. It has been used aromatically, to soothe and calm - for those who suffer anxiety, depression or mental exhaustion. It is also known to be used medicinally for all manner of ailments; rashes, fevers, sunburn. The Lavender Sunset Gold Bowl is the representation of these healing properties  - it is not a literal representation, nor is it literally infused with lavender itself - but helps you to manifest healing within yourself. The beautiful tones it creates generate powerful healing energy that anyone will find useful for cleansing and renewing the spirit.

Some people will immediately think of  “Indigo Children,” but this is not a bowl for a narrow section of souls. All souls, when they are new, work to attain spiritual knowledge. For some it can be easier and others harder. This Pink Aura Crystal bowl can work for any soul that may not be adapting to this path smoothly - or anyone having troubles in school, home, etc.  

Crystal Tones™ Description
A high-frequency love alchemy resonating with the pure energy of the Magdalene. A companion of unconditional and courageous love, Pink Aura Gold resonates the enacting of all activities from a heart-centered origin. The radiant healing love source vibration guides the heart to inspire the mind.

The Tanzanite Crystal Tones Singing Bowl enables you to focus on healing where you have deep spiritual blocks and allows you to more easily channel other energies. 
While this is a solid bowl for helping clean out any spiritual detritus one might pick up from the various beings we come into contact with, it is also useful in recovering from psychic attack. Tanzanite is also a great healer for those in a leadership position – teachers, managers, politicians or performers.  These people can become affected by a wide spectrum of energies (both negative and positive) and find themselves overcome with uncertainty. This Tanzanite bowl facilitates cleansing of the space of 'self' and helps clarify purpose of being. It can help you clear the path to discover your latent talents and helps you see projects you put aside, because of self-doubt, through to completion. It is a deep core healer and illuminator of new information.
   



Crystal Tones™ Description
The sweet tones of Tanzanite sing the anthems of truth and celebrate the dance of the authentic self. Tanzanite sets the stage for you to drop the masks of self-protection and deception, and embrace your true self with enlightened compassion, inviting joy to join you in the dance. The song of Tanzanite creates a communion with body and soul, giving an eloquent voice to the heart. By calming your overactive mind and synchronizing the heart with the brain, Tanzanite allows you to clearly speak your truth, and claim your heart's desire. (Enhance Tanzanite with Moldavite, Phenacite, Mother of Platinum and Rhodochrosite)

The Violet Aura Gold Bowl by Crystal Tones is a bowl that wastes no time. It can help you to strengthen the astral body and enhance your aura - helping you to take care of “unfinished business.” The unfinished stuff could include lingering energy from past relationships, communications, businesses, projects, etc. These energies from the past can drag your high energy down. The Violet Aura Gold Crystal Bowl can help you move this energy. It allows you to bring in forgiveness and other healing energies to release these blocks. When this release happens, you become filled with your own energy and freed of impediments to creating new things and gives you a sense of new vitality. When you have more freedom, you can do more things. You might even be able to have more fun, relax more! Yes, of course, this bowl also works on past life unfinished business as well. It is a great karma releaser.

Crystal Tones™ Description

In Hinduism and Buddhism violet is associated with the crown chakra - the center for trust, devotion, inspiration, happiness, and positivity. Violet represents the future, imagination and dreams. It promotes the harmony of the mind and one’s emotions; creating a link between the spiritual and physical worlds and thought and activity. Violet also supports the practice of meditation and helps you connect to your higher self. This bowl combines the elements of violet and gold to help you transform your lower energies into upper energies, inspire knowledge and spirituality, and foster a deeper understanding of the self and the soul.

Unlimited Singing Bowls is honored to offer Crystal Tones Singing Bowls. These crystal bowls are made in the USA from extremely pure quartz. Some of the bowls from this collection are also blended and forged with gemstones and precious metals. Crystal Tones bowls are the highest quality, we have found, available in the world.
This collection of gemstone and precious metal infused Crystal Tones bowls is called the "Alchemy" series. We can attest from our study and usage of them, that they truly are alchemical, not in the base medieval sense of turning physical lead into gold, but in the spiritual sense, wherein these bowls, when played, offer you energetic transformations.  You can raise your vibration, and the energies of others when you play these bowls. The healings are deep in the aura, the chakras, and the soul - as well as within the body. The sounds these bowls create are more than just sound. They carry the energy of the quartz and all the specific infused elements.
Unlimited Singing Bowls offers our unique, clairvoyant assessments of each bowl where we can, and as time goes on, we will have sample videos of them as well. We highly recommend you consider adding Crystal Tones bowls to your sound healing instruments.

If you need to remove past-time energies anchored into your cell memory, this bowl is the catalyst to help you clear the path to greater freedom and higher energy.



Crystal Tones™ Description

Every Grandmother’s love and caring is represented in the Grandmother bowl. We honor the feminine energies in all and the Goddess/Crone as she reclaims her power on Earth. The Crone is Gaia energy. She is free of menses, aligned with the graceful strength and dreamtime magic of the Swan and shamanic practices, at home in her body. Time apart and discernment expand her divine wisdom.

The Turquoise Crystal Tones Bowl is a solid citizen; an overall sound healer. It creates a safe grounded space that works gently on the chakras to aid in accepting healing. People new to receiving sound healing will love this bowl.It works on all the endocrine glands, which are related to the chakras, so the spirit and body connect well. It is a good 'completer bowl' -  the one to play to close your event. After the other bowls have completed their work, you seal up the healing with the Turquoise bowl. Expressing an uplifting and calming aspect, Turquoise guides spiritual attunement, emotional healing, and balances the auric body. Compassionate in working with the throat chakra, Turquoise is a master healer, attractor of prosperity and fertility. A loving provider of strength during vision quests.


Crystal Tones™ Description
The name Turquoise is derived from the French, pierre turquoise, meaning “Turkish stone" so named likely because of its prevalence along early Turkish trade routes. Native American priests wore it in ceremonies when calling upon the great spirit of the sky. Turquoise is often honored as the universal stone as those who tuned into its energies believed their minds would become one with the universe. Turquoise was often used in prophesy or divining.  In Native American lore Turquoise is also reputed to be influenced by the physical condition of the person who wears it. It is thought to grow pale when its owner is sick or sad, lose all color when the person dies, and gradually recover its color when transferred to a new healthy owner. Turquoise is a protector against all things evil, promotes happiness and good fortune, restores clear vision to the mind, and in Eastern traditions is seen as symbolic of the yang (male) power. It promotes leadership, communication and the connection of 'self' to the elements of earth and sky.

If you are feeling stuck, this is a great bowl to get things moving again.

Lapis helps us exhibit our inner power while purifying the spirit and our thoughts. Lapis is supportive in our interactions with our spirit guardians.

Similar to Mt. Shasta rising high in the sky, this crystal singing bowl helps you connect to higher vibrations. It lends itself to working with the energy of the planetary changes happening on Earth right now. It uses its tones to connect listeners to the Solar System, Galactic guidance and other beings working with us and the planet. It works in the same arena as the Platonic Year Gongs and tunings, but with more direct connection. On a personal level it helps release fear, confusion and trauma that you can be picking up during these planetary changes. It helps you and your clients be present during the changes the planet is going through.
The Mt. Shasta Serpentine bowl is great for lightworkers, psychics, Reiki healers, shamans and anyone who works with energy and wants to help others to gracefully accept the changes we are living through.

Crystal Tones™ Description
Connect with the mystical and magical properties of the Mt. Shasta vortex, and commune with the earth divas of the plant kingdom by attuning yourself to the frequencies of the Serpentine Bowl. Its green color honors the wisdom keepers of the plant and mineral kingdom as the Serpentine alchemy gives voice to their sacred knowledge. The spiraling tones of Serpentine bowl uncoil the serpent of Kundalini energy that rises from the base of the spine, climbing upward through the trunk and bursting forth with the fruits of enlightenment. The natural green energy of Serpentine keeps you grounded for a more graceful transformation, and this makes it the ultimate Feng Shui bowl, linking you with the natural ebb and flow of all life.

The Crystal Tones Sage Forest Gold Bowl is a small yet powerful bowl that works well in conjunction with other bowls. Its talent lies in enabling the release of auric detritus and energy that no longer serves you. It's powerful harmonic emanations scrub the chakras and mental body - in a sense 'polishing' away any spiritual dullness you may be feeling and giving you a sense of resistance to others’ energies and thoughts. Let the vibrations of this bowl carry unproductive energy attachments away. Once clear of energies that are not yours, you can more easily hear yourself, and find your own truth. Find your truth and you become your own Sage.
Other Observations About This Bowl
Sage can mean 'wise counselor' or refer to the healing herb. This bowl is the embodiment of both - it offers healing and wisdom. The Sage Forest Gold bowl helps to create a sense of connectedness with all of nature and a feeling of oneness with the universe. It keeps one grounded in divine purpose and fluid in each moment. Sage is held sacred by the Native American culture as an effective energy purifier. It brings balance and cleanses the body and mind of negative spirits and impurities. Sage is thought to relieve worry, open the mind to positive energies, and de-stress. Sage blended with gold, the 'Master Healer', brings further balance to the heart center and opens the third eye and crown chakras. Consider this bowl a great spiritual  counselor and an effective tool to bringing you closer to your highest purpose.

This spunky Crystal Tones Singing Bowl brings you as a spirit back to present time (a la Be Here Now) and keeps you grounded comfortably in space time.  It helps you connect to your first chakra, and your lower body. With that, it also helps get you out of random thoughts that do not serve your higher purpose.
It also has the great ability, this Tiger’s Eye, to help you tune into your body and help you  feel out areas of dis-ease that might be developing in your body or mind. Once you see it, if you don’t resist it, you can acknowledge it, and start to release the energy that is creating it, to lessen it or release it fully and bring in more wellness into that space.*Please NOTE: This is NOT in any way, shape or form a medical site, nor are we suggesting you will receive medical information while meditating with this bowl. If you feel like you have something that needs further attention, please go see an actual physician. We are talking spiritual healing here, not medical healing.
Other observations about this bowl
Tiger Eye aids harmony and balance, and can help you to let go of fear and anxiety, and help you to make decisions with discernment and understanding outside of emotions. Traditionally, Tiger Eye stones were carried as an amulet against curses or ill-wishing. It is thought to give courage, self confidence and strength of will. It enhances creativity and is one of the stones that aid kundalini awakening. Tiger eye is also a profound amplifier of energy. Used for protection and higher guidance, the Tiger Eye prevents negative energies from overtaking your spiritual self.

The Yagna Bowl is a great facilitator for finishing cycles of growth. Honoring the end of a cycle helps to prevent resisting spiritual change or prematurely forcing your way through your growth. Spiritual growth holds important lessons that should not be dismissed. The end of a growth cycle comes when you have worked through almost all of the energies that have revealed themselves, and you are now ready to tie up loose ends. The Crystal Tones Yagna Bowl is great for this. Set your intention to aligning your chakras and removing remnants of old growth while playing the Yagna bowl and you will find validation in new growth and the momentum to move past what no longer serves your higher purpose. We have found that it is best to play this bowl for 15 to 20 minutes to see a cycle come to its completion.

Crystal Tones™ Description
The sacred ashes from yagna ceremonies across the world have been infused into this powerful bowl. They contain the offerings of many thousands of mantras to a large host of gods and goddesses such as Ganesha, Lakshmi, Durga, Kali, Shiva and Vishnu. The ash from these sacred fires has a very high frequency signature that carries all the values and blessings of the yagnas. This energy is transmitted through the sound produced by the bowls and assists in the absorption of higher truth and wisdom.

This Grandmother Bowl by Crystal Tones is a great healer. It specifically focuses on damage or whacks you may have in your chakras and aura. Conflicts and competition in all sections of our lives, from business to family to school or just driving on the highway, can cause us to receive energy blasts from other people. Heck, even just walking down the street being outwardly happy can cause someone who is less happy to toss a chunk of negative energy your way. It doesn’t always stick, but when it does, you get a little whack or tear. If you get enough of these, your energy feels off, you feel weak or tired, or get sick. If these tears land in the right space, they can stifle your upward momentum and cause you to become stuck.
This crystal bowl is named the Grandmother Bowl for good reason. It soothes these wounds like a grandmother preparing a nice dessert or meal and listening to you. It helps release the whacks and tears and knits them back together with loving energy. This bowl is fantastic for therapists and healers who work with clients who may have trust issues, and for clients who are working to let go of the past and victimhood.

Crystal Tones™ Description
Every Grandmother’s love and caring is represented in this beautiful bowl. We honor the feminine energies in all and the Goddess/Crone as she reclaims her power on Earth. Embrace your soul’s ageless feminine wisdom and the spiraling DNA of creation/birth with The Grandmother Bowl. The Crone is Gaia energy. She is aligned with the graceful strength and dreamtime magic of the Swan and shamanic practices, at home in her body. Time apart and discernment expand her divine wisdom. Grandmother, Crone and Goddess walk the Grande Mother path.

The Lemurian Seed Bowl possesses a concentrated energy that lends itself to specific healing; particularly the eighth, ninth and tenth chakras – those chakras outside the physical body. It helps you bring that which you are working on in the astral and higher bodies into the foreground and allows you to dissolve blocks that may be preventing higher consciousness. Focus your intention on opening your 3rd chakra and allow the healing vibrations to bring forth new energies.

Other observations about this bowlThere are many theories about the existence of the lost continent of Lemuria. Was it in fact an ancient continent that stretched from the Hawaiian Islands to Fiji and from Easter Island to the Marianas? Was Lemuria the lost civilization responsible for the mysterious stone monuments of Easter Island? Or is Lemuria merely a metaphor that illustrates creation and destruction in relation to the first stirrings of human awareness? Author James Churchward writes about Lemuria (also referred to as Mu) in his book “Cosmic Forces of Mu”. He describes these cosmic forces as “those which make changes in the position of bodies, and sometimes change the body itself. No body or matter, however infinitesimally small or ponderously large, can make any change without the aid of a force.” The Lemurian Seed Crystal singing bowl is the vector for that force. It resonates with the power of change and creation.
*Please note that although the bowl appears to have color, this is an artificial effect that is intended to show the texture of the bowl. This unique bowl is clear quartz with Lemurian Seed Crystal both incorporated within the bowl structure and fused to the outside. This creates a very distinct texture that is difficult to show (clear crystal on a clear bowl) in photographs. Make note that this bowl is indeed clear to opaque quartz and as such, is inherently colorless in reality.

This Crystal Tones Bowl helps move stuck emotions and the lies that hold these emotions. Emotions naturally want to move, flow and dissipate when they’ve cycled through, but when there are spiritual concepts or lies that keep them from moving, they become stuck. For example, anger can be a positive and cleansing emotion, but if somewhere along your life someone convinced you that your anger was too much for them, or that you did not use it in an appropriate manner, you may have difficulties moving through your anger. Grief or sadness, if stuck and controlled by a lie, can prevent you from moving on and creating new things. Not only does this bowl help you move your emotional energy, it also works with the creative channels. It is great for artists, performers, and creative people of all stripes. Highly recommended.

The Crystal Tones Rose Bowl's higher pitched vibrations softly resonate and mingle with your higher chakras, the 5th, 6th and 7th (throat, third eye and crown). This bowl works well when you set your intention to bring connectedness to the hemispheres of your brain. This balancing translates to opening up the mind to higher thoughts versus being focused on darker, ‘negative’ thinking. An example of how this bowl can manifest healing: When working with depressed or addictive clients, at certain points in their recovery process, they will struggle with old mental patterns. This is a great bowl to facilitate the destruction of old habits while creating the energy to help build new, healthy habits.

Play the Sage Aura Gold Bowl by Crystal Tones and allow the gentle energies to go to work on the parts of those listening that are not in alignment with their Higher Self and the Divine. It helps one to work on removing self-judgment; where you feel you are not good enough to be communicating and receiving Divine healing, be it from this life or past lives. It shifts and helps release fear, confusion and invalidation in that connection. When your openness to ask and receive from the Universe is limited by these energies, you ask for and receive less. You receive less guidance through your meditations, because you are have already judged yourself to be unworthy. The Sage Aura Gold bowl is out to change that space. And from there it works a lot on your fourth and fifth chakras, once your self-worth is upgraded, then better able to express your creativity and you are able to more easily create greater things for yourself.

The White Gold Alchemy Crystal Tones Singing Bowl is a very strong bowl. You feel it when you are in its presence. It affects everything in its proximity with its powerful healing energy.
This bowl allows the loosening of old limitations on the body –  be they self-imposed, culturally imposed, etched into your DNA, or the ever-present socially imposed limitations that we face every day. As limitations are acknowledged and dissolved, your spirit-self can more easily move into and act upon your physical-self. The miracles you seek for yourself can manifest more easily and smoothly for you.  Remember, you are Spirit, and Spirit is Unlimited. And remember, what you want to create, versus what you have been told you can create is itself a limitation. As you heal with this bowl, meditate on that which you are looking to manifest. Concentrate on raising your energy, and clearing blocks, and you will create it more easily.  Allow your will to communicate and connect with the Divine and this bowl will help you make it easier.

The Crystal Tones Indian Pipestone Bowl is very grounding. You feel it in your first (root) chakra and your legs and feet. It allows your cells to accept higher vibrations.  
Your body is naturally attuned to and accepting of certain energies, but if you want to manifest more energetic light, this is the bowl for you. It helps you release outdated concepts you may have based on third dimensional perceptions, and facilitates the acceptance of information from the higher realms. It aids in gleaning wisdom, compassion, acceptance and answers for self. It moves your mind and body to connect with humanity’s highest spiritual evolutionary purpose. This bowl has the vibrational energy capacity to be useful for big events, so if you like healing large groups, you would do well with this bowl as your healing catalyst and psychic partner.







Other observations about this bowlPipestone (also known as Catlinite) is a type of red, metamorphic rock. This stone has been traditionally quarried by Native Americans and used for sacred ceremonial pipes - thus the name 'pipestone'. The quarries are found and preserved in the Pipestone National Monument in Minnestota, in Minnehaha County, South Dakota, and at the Pipestone River in Canada. The metaphysical properties of Pipestone enable one to connect the spiritual and the physical. It is useful for grounding prayer and ritual into physical, everyday life. It is also a very protective stone. It is thought to enable communication with spirits and the ancestors. The metaphysical properties of pipestone infused into this bowl make it a more than apt catalyst for whatever kind of spiritual goals and healing you set your intentions to. We think it's an essential piece to add your sound healing collection.

 The Indigo Bowl by Crystal Tones allows you to let go of past trials and tribulations, the traumas that are in your body. It does it for the ones you have experienced, but miraculously also works to release the ones your ancestors had that were strong enough that they were carried in your DNA. The Indigo Bowl works on your cells, and RNA and DNA.  It revitalizes it, as it can suffer from all the stress and environmental toxins you have experienced. It also can de-energize potential predispositions to hereditary diseases.   (PLEASE NOTE: The statement above is not medical advice. We are talking about spiritual healing.  Spiritual healing can resonate through the body, but we are not making any medical claims.) By releasing the pains and traumas from your cells, your body has more space to allow more light into it. The more of your energy and light, the brighter your aura gets and the more your health improves.



Crystal Tones™ Description

This bowl is perfect for Indigo children/adults and for visualizing global peace.

 The Crystal Tones Lepidolite (li-pid-l-ahyt) Bowl helps to de-energize toxins in the cells of your body.  It does it in a special way; it focuses on the lies and programming that keeps you or your brain/body believing that you need these toxins. (E.g. – certain foods, recreational drugs, etc.)  Let us be clear, the Lepidolite Bowl is not going to instantly zap away addictions, but it does work in this arena. So if you have clients that are taking other concrete steps towards conquering their addictions, this bowl lends its energy well to recovery. Besides working with the body, it can help you to heal rips and tears in your aura. These rips and tears are the entry point for negative energies and influences to seep in and pull one back towards addictive thoughts and activities. This is a great bowl to add to your sound healing package.

Purification and clarification of the third eye, serenity and calmness, accepting, letting go of fear and anger, group alignment; these are all stimulated by Lepidolite. This alchemy also assists with calming the crown, centering the flow of balance, and restless sleep problems. (Enhance Lepidolite with: Androgynous Indium, Ruby, White Alchemy Gold)

Crystal Tones’ Phenacite (fen-uh-sahyt) Bowl has a strong powerful tone that resonates profoundly when played, but it is the energic component from within its sound vibrations that is the deep healer here. Phenacite ignites the communication between your conscious personality, the “I” of you, and your higher vibration, you as soul, and the Divine.    
What happens then? As the bowl’s energy connects these three elements - conscious awareness, you as spirit, and the Divine - it allows you to release blockage that may be keeping your mind from hearing what you truly want and need. It’s often hard to hear that in the day-to-day monologue of the ego.
When this happens, if you work with it, it can be a life changer! This is a great bowl for working with clients who report being stuck in a rut, unable to move forward with plans, feeling lost and adrift.

Crystal Tones™ Description
Start your energetic engine and get ready for inter-dimensional travel with the sound of Phenacite. This high-frequency alchemy resonates with the hexagonal sacred geometry of the Merkaba, and resonates with advanced beings who are ready to embrace their magnificence, activate their light body, and sail into the multi-universe. The Phenacite bowl spins a galactic vortex of dynamic energy for evolution, and becomes a birthing portal for quantum leap consciousness, clearing all obstacles to move one forward and up to the next level with lightning speed.
Ambassador of the mystical properties of the Mt Shasta vortex, the natural green energy of Serpentine keeps you grounded in grace during our journey of loving transformation, aligning you with the natural ebb and flow of all life.

It helps you to cleanse and purify energy channels and enable you to repel other people's unwanted negative spirits and energies. Have other people's ego games been getting in the way of you moving forward? This energy of this bowl can help you push them out of your space. We think this is a great bowl for those long days, interminable weeks, or big events when you get coated with other people’s thoughts or energies. Play this bowl with intentions for protection and purification and you can clean them out. As indicated by the name, using this bowl can allow for an easier connection with St. Germain, of the Violet Flame. Invoke this the Violet Flame and create an even deeper purification of your energy. The more you have of just yourself, the brighter you will shine.

Crystal Tones™ Description
Selenite is the sonic wand of healing. The sound of selenite can be directed with laser-like intention to work on specific areas of the body or used to cut away etheric disharmony, disease or blocked energy. The sonic waves of selenite can also be used to cover thousands of directions at once, cutting cords and freeing you from the draining effect or bondage of unhealthy relationships or connections. Selinite combines synergistically with any bowl in a symphony of sound, amplifying whatever energies one wishes to work with. Its fiber optic quality makes it a powerful energy scanner, keeping you on the cutting edge of awareness and personal power.

The Aqua Aura Gold Bowl focuses on helping you remove distortions of yourself or other peoples’ judgments you’ve believed and held as true. These can be judgments from this life or past lives. This crystal bowl helps release guilt and gets more of your energy free and in the present so you can create more of what you want for yourself now. When you have a distorted self-image, you limit what you can have, do, or be.  When you have judged yourself to be unworthy of what you desire, you block yourself from receiving your rewards. The Aqua Aura Gold Bowl helps to center on your heart chakra and brings you into your astral body. 

Crystal Tones™ Description
This powerful Alchemy bowl helps balance the overly analytical mind and transmute blockages that cause disharmony. A psychic center and yang alignment activator, this Bowl deeply and quickly entrains the auric fields for shifting, cleansing and activating upper chakras. Its yang energy and color help relieve depression and lift spirits. The energetic properties of fused gold and quartz undergo a metamorphosis that results in an entirely new, elevated aqua-opalescent healing vibration.

The Crystal Tones Azeztulite (Uh-Zezz-too-lyt) Bowl is what we refer to as a 'binder' bowl. Azeztulite is a special type of white quartz that brings elements together. The soothing tones of this magnificent bowl help you to facilitate communication and connectedness between the body, spirit and mind. Play this bowl to make yourself whole, or use this bowl in group sound healings to bring connectedness and unity to your group. Bring the power of this bowl into sessions with clients who want to heal inter-familial rifts, or want to manifest healing and communication between cultural and social divisions or conflicts. 
Set your intention to finishing healing cycles and allow the Azeztulite energy to help you bring about closure with past issues you may be hanging onto that no longer serve you. Allow the sound and energy to give you gentle momentum to move past emotional grievances.

Crystal Tones™ Description
Azeztulite is a celestial connector of the “I AM” energy. The frequency of spiritual light above and below us is linked, and the resulting energy sphere is highlighted in the third dimension for heightened consciousness and understanding. This powerful alchemy changes our cellular energy, allowing our awareness to properly expand and illuminate. Azeztulite is said to be among the highest vibrations in the Mineral Kingdom. Attuning to it can activate the third eye and crown chakras, as well as chakras above the head in the etheric body. As a special conduit for this energy, the clearing of disease in its many forms is permitted, allowing for an ease in the experience of being in the world, but not being of it. Merkaba ascension is fostered as one more easily tunes in to the pulses of the universe, activating the bridges for dimensional travel. Azeztulite is considered to be the primary stone of the Great Central Sun, and can create many changes both personally and globally as we move into the Age of Awareness. Achieving this universal higher-state frequency is greatly accelerated with this potent crystal alchemy, as one more easily recognizes and claims their universe citizenship. (Enhance Azeztulite with: Diamond, Morganite, Sunstone)

The Crystal Tones Charcoal Bowl is a fascinating sound healing instrument.
 Activated Charcoal is sometimes used in emergency rooms to aid in removal of poisons and drugs from the digestive system. By the process of adsorption, the toxic elements bind to the charcoal. This crystal bowl works in much the same way, but with energy. Play this bowl and it will fill you or your clients auras and chakras with a fine mist of charcoal energy. You can then ask this energy, while it is in your space, to help you release energies you are finishing with. The charcoal energy will bind with them and then you can ground them out, or visualize them leaving your aura and being neutralized. Do this several times and you will feel lighter, unburdened. Then fill up these spaces with your own light and healing energy. This is the only Crystal Tones bowl in which we have observed this property so far. It is really a unique one.







Crystal Tones™ Description
Move into uncharted spiritual and physical dimensions with the pure crystal charcoal bowl alchemy, a grounding tool for today’s rapidly accelerating and expansive energies. The ultimate sound portal for clarity, personal vision and release of physical, emotional, and spiritual toxins. Highly prized in ancient Egypt as early as 1550 BC, and for centuries in Japan, bamboo and other charcoals are often used in physical and spiritual healing because of their ability to absorb toxins and impurities. Quartz crystal with charcoal creates neutralizing positive ions in a waveform that “makes everyday life better.” An anecdote for poisons in the body and environment, charcoal can help uplift and remove negative states of being. The Charcoal Bowl can help dissipate confusion and achieve balance. As one moves through life’s crossroads this crystalline-infused energy offers guidance for problems or situations that are arising. With intention, this bowl can be a helping agent for removing negativity, bringing about hope, unconditional love, nurturing, grounding, appreciation of the feminine and nature. Evoke mystic visions, spiritual and romantic love, tenderness, kindness, sensitivity and psychic abilities.

This Frankincense bowl by Crystal Tones creates vibrations that work on removing and releasing energies that are in conflict and parts of you that are fighting your true self or holding you back from where you want to go. This bowl facilitates the dissolution of conflicting energies and allows you to create inner peace.
We find this bowl is good to play in concert with other healing bowls that focus on clearing energy. In this way when the conflicted parts of you that are struggling get energized to leave, they have help to depart. Then you can more easily become a whole and peaceful being.

Elevating personal and spiritual love, Frankincense heightens awareness by inspiring and awakening our spiritual senses. Transforming and expanding our consciousness; frankincense accelerates spiritual growth as it opens the crown chakra, causing the energy bodies to align within the physical.

The Lavender Sunset Gold Bowl works on your ability to take in and process energy.  Think Prana. Prana is the Sanskrit word meaning 'breath' or 'life force'. Your breath literally moves life force energy through your body.
If your ability to receive and process prana is weakened, then your body will not be as strong a vessel for your spiritual self. The Lavender Sunset Gold bowl helps lighten, energize and update your system; enhancing your ability to re-vitalize yourself. You are strengthened in the fullest sense - in body and spirit. This beautiful bowl provides a “crystallized pranayama” healing.



 
Other observations about this bowl
Lavender, as an herb, possesses several healing properties. It has been used aromatically, to soothe and calm - for those who suffer anxiety, depression or mental exhaustion. It is also known to be used medicinally for all manner of ailments; rashes, fevers, sunburn. The Lavender Sunset Gold Bowl is the representation of these healing properties  - it is not a literal representation, nor is it literally infused with lavender itself - but helps you to manifest healing within yourself. The beautiful tones it creates generate powerful healing energy that anyone will find useful for cleansing and renewing the spirit.

Set your intention for integrating higher energies into your consciousness and bathe in the healing frequency of this bowl. This bowl is a wonderful healing companion for the person who seeks to bring their higher knowledge and formerly shapeless ideas into their awareness and help them to take action:  inventors, scientists, creatives, entrepreneurs, healers, etc.
We see this as a great bowl for new lives and new learners that are struggling to understand higher spiritual information and how to integrate that information into their whole selves.
Some people will immediately think of  “Indigo Children,” but this is not a bowl for a narrow section of souls. All souls, when they are new, work to attain spiritual knowledge. For some it can be easier and others harder. This Pink Aura Crystal bowl can work for any soul that may not be adapting to this path smoothly - or anyone having troubles in school, home, etc.

The Tanzanite Crystal Tones Singing Bowl enables you to focus on healing where you have deep spiritual blocks and allows you to more easily channel other energies. 
While this is a solid bowl for helping clean out any spiritual detritus one might pick up from the various beings we come into contact with, it is also useful in recovering from psychic attack. Tanzanite is also a great healer for those in a leadership position – teachers, managers, politicians or performers.  These people can become affected by a wide spectrum of energies (both negative and positive) and find themselves overcome with uncertainty. This Tanzanite bowl facilitates cleansing of the space of 'self' and helps clarify purpose of being. It can help you clear the path to discover your latent talents and helps you see projects you put aside, because of self-doubt, through to completion. It is a deep core healer and illuminator of new information.
   



Crystal Tones™ Description
The sweet tones of Tanzanite sing the anthems of truth and celebrate the dance of the authentic self. Tanzanite sets the stage for you to drop the masks of self-protection and deception, and embrace your true self with enlightened compassion, inviting joy to join you in the dance. The song of Tanzanite creates a communion with body and soul, giving an eloquent voice to the heart. By calming your overactive mind and synchronizing the heart with the brain, Tanzanite allows you to clearly speak your truth, and claim your heart's desire. (Enhance Tanzanite with Moldavite, Phenacite, Mother of Platinum and Rhodochrosite)

The Violet Aura Gold Bowl by Crystal Tones is a bowl that wastes no time. It can help you to strengthen the astral body and enhance your aura - helping you to take care of “unfinished business.” The unfinished stuff could include lingering energy from past relationships, communications, businesses, projects, etc. These energies from the past can drag your high energy down. The Violet Aura Gold Crystal Bowl can help you move this energy. It allows you to bring in forgiveness and other healing energies to release these blocks. When this release happens, you become filled with your own energy and freed of impediments to creating new things and gives you a sense of new vitality. When you have more freedom, you can do more things. You might even be able to have more fun, relax more! Yes, of course, this bowl also works on past life unfinished business as well. It is a great karma releaser.

Crystal Tones™ Description

In Hinduism and Buddhism violet is associated with the crown chakra - the center for trust, devotion, inspiration, happiness, and positivity. Violet represents the future, imagination and dreams. It promotes the harmony of the mind and one’s emotions; creating a link between the spiritual and physical worlds and thought and activity. Violet also supports the practice of meditation and helps you connect to your higher self. This bowl combines the elements of violet and gold to help you transform your lower energies into upper energies, inspire knowledge and spirituality, and foster a deeper understanding of the self and the soul.

This is a great beginner’s singing bowl, or for people who have a lot of first timers and beginners attending their sound healing events.
It opens the chakras gently, including the sixth chakra (third eye). We have found it allows the fourth chakra (heart) to open up and allow peace and acceptance in. 
You can’t go wrong with the energy that this antique singing bowl provides
Thadobati Singing Bowls are one of the oldest forms of singing bowls, dating back to the 15th Century. Thadobatis have nearly straight, high-sided walls and a flat bottom that is slightly less wide than the rim. Thadobati Bowls’ walls can bethin or thick. This style of antique singing bowl generally has minimal decoration. It’s not fancy in appearance, butit is easy to play and will produce beautiful sounds.
Being a smaller bowl, Thadobati bowls are generally held in one’s hand when played. Different mallets – suede, fabric, or wood – will produce different tones. It should be noted that smaller bowls respond better to wooden ringers, and larger bowls respond better to suede ringers. The tones this style bowl produces are powerful, clear and direct.

Yes, each bowl comes with a pillow and mallet.Approximate Bowl Measurements: Bowl Diameter: 7.25" Height: 3.5" Weight: 1134 gr - 2lbs 8ozThe amazing tones on this rare bowl help transmute vibrations from the lower chakras. It gets your kundalini energy flowing. We see that small groups of monks would sit around this bowl and chant and get healings from it. Try chanting “Om” and similar tones while playing this bowl. It is truly a spiritually sonic experience, that will open you up. Purported to be the most rare of the Himalayan singing bowls, Lingam bowls have a range of shapes and sizes but are easily identified by a conical protrusion in the center of the basin (the lingam) and its corresponding concave dimple on the bottom of the bowl. This protruding feature is said represent the male phallus. Lingam, is a Sanskrit word that actually has several definitions: it can mean mark or symbol, or a representation of the divine generative energy represented via the Hindu God Shiva. Ornamentation of this type of bowl is fairly consistent, however minimal, with a couple concentric circles at the foot of the lingam, and one or two radiating from the center of the bowl. The Lingam bowl’s sound is characterized by a deep, full voice - sometimes pulsating and often with a long sustain. Notes generally occupy the middle and higher octaves with the fundamental and rim notes being very nearly the same.

This is a remarkable bowl. Definitely recommended for the mystic or healer. It was set by those who created and used to help you send prayers to the astral and higher dimensions. 
When playing it, visualize the energy of the prayer above the bowl, and the sound immediately escorts it to where it can be seen and heard by those beings entrusted with answering prayers, and then this bowl even helps ground the prayer.
Whether the prayer is for you or others, this bowl is a channel of Light to God and for healing.
After a healing session, when you or your clients are energetically clean and centered, this is the bowl to bring out and use.

This singing bowl is a great healer or the mind and mental realms. We can see clairvoyantly that this bowl was given to young novices who were struggling to stay mentally focused, clear-headed when learning prayers, and spiritually focused.
Among many other things, this bowl helps remove distracting thoughts and other hypnotic elements you can get caught on, and then helps you refocus.

This is an invitation bowl. You can invite God in with this bowl. It is a welcoming bowl. A peacemaking bowl that has its goal is to make peace for you in all your situations, or for those who you meet who are searching for connections to create more peace .
Its high pitch makes it a great complementary bowl to others you have in your set.
This style of antique singing bowl, named for the region of Manipur in the Eastern Himalayas where it originated, exhibits a shallow and dish-like shape with an outward directed lip and small, rounded base. Manipuri bowls can be very plain or more ornate, (some bowls have ornamentation inside and out) but are most easily identified by their low-profile. These bowls are small, responsive and have a voice in the higher octaves. Manipuri bowls are easy to play. Because of their small size, these bowls are also well suited for body work and can be placed alongside or on top of the body and struck softly. Given their soft resonance, they can also be played by the head.

It is interesting that they call this a “Void Bowl” because its energies really work to fill in what is lacking in you, the energies you need, of which you have a void.
Play it for yourself or others for a bit of time and you will soon feel your body, aura, and chakras fill up with the energies you need.
This bowl really wants to heal, full of energy and a desire to help.
