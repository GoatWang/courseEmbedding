Investment Overview
The Gotham Absolute Return Fund (the "Fund") is a long/short U.S. equity fund with a net long exposure of 50%-60% (e.g., 120% long vs. 60% short = 60% net long). The Fund seeks long-term capital appreciation and to achieve positive returns during most annual periods in an efficient, risk-adjusted manner. Joel Greenblatt and Robert Goldstein are the Managing Principals and Co-CIOs of Gotham Asset Management, LLC, the Advisor to this Fund.
Investment Strategy & Process
Gotham's proprietary equity research and risk controls are used to select long and short stock portfolios primarily from the U.S. large and mid-cap range.The Co-CIOs and their team of equity analysts employ Gotham’s proprietary analytical framework to evaluate stocks within the coverage universe on measures of absolute and relative value.The long portfolio is rebalanced daily to weight most heavily those stocks that are priced at the largest discount to Gotham's assessment of value. In general, as a company appears cheaper its weight in the portfolio increases.Similarly, the short portfolio is rebalanced daily to weight most heavily those short positions selling at the largest premium to Gotham's measures of value.Risk for the Fund's integrated long/short portfolio is managed following a disciplined proprietary process limiting concentration in any one company, industry or sector. In addition, gross and net exposures are managed daily to remain within carefully defined ranges.
