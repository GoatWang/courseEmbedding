(JNP), today publishes an open letter.James A. Geraghty Chairman Juniper Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 33 Arch Street Suite 3110 Boston, MA 02110April 12, 2017Dear Mr. Geraghty,As the fifth-largest shareholder of Juniper Pharmaceuticals(1), we implore you to quit spending shareholders' money on failed science projects and instead consider selling the company. Juniper's cash, supply agreement with Merck KGaA and pharmaceutical-services business suggest a potential takeover value of more than twice the company's stock price(2).Since Juniper went public in 1988, it has spent $237 million, or almost $22 a share, on science of dubious value. Its most-recent failure, a topical lidocaine to prevent the pain of gynecological procedures, helped consume almost $17 million on research and development during the last two years. Lidocaine is a proven painkiller available in over-the-counter sunburn lotions. Yours still managed to fail.The lidocaine debacle follows Juniper's failed bid to develop a progesterone gel, Prochieve, to prevent preterm birth.  Physicians embrace progesterone as a prophylactic against premature labor. Juniper and a partner, the former Watson Pharmaceuticals, spent almost a decade and tens of millions of dollars testing Prochieve on more than 1,000 pregnant women. Regulators in 2012 rejected the drug.Now Juniper is threatening to repeat this pattern by testing a drug that delivers progesterone via a vaginal ring. Its development likely would consume tens of millions of dollars and take at least five years while providing no guarantees of safety and efficacy.Even if Juniper's progesterone ring were to win approval, it likely would compete with clones of an injectable progesterone approved in 2011, Makena. The prospects are slim that Juniper would ever recover its investment.Juniper also is considering the development of a vaginal ring for incontinence. At first blush, its potential tantalizes: The ring would bypass the body's first-pass metabolism and spare the patient side effects such as dry mouth.But a competing patch and gel that also avoids first-pass side effects have generated disappointing sales, perhaps because they compete with generic pills that retail for pennies. A patch sells over the counter for $30 a month. Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited abandoned its oxybutynin vaginal ring. Juniper should do the same.Juniper, with a market value less than $50 million, seems to have forgotten the difficulty small companies face promoting drugs. Management during its third-quarter earnings call on Nov. 15 said it would consider buying commercial operations.In 2003, Juniper built a 122-person sales force to promote its testosterone supplement, Striant. Its revenue totaled $14.8 million when Juniper divested it in 2011. The list of small companies that failed to launch medicines includes Dendreon Corp., and Savient Pharmaceuticals Inc.Any efforts by Juniper to develop or promote drugs likely would detract from the company's intrinsic value, we estimate, of almost $9 a share.Juniper's most-valuable asset, in our opinion, is its pharmaceutical-services business. We value it at more than $36 million, or $3.35 a share. Juniper in 2013 paid $27 million for the business, based in the United Kingdom. Its revenues have since grown 45%. Molecular Profiles can operate independently. It doesn't need supervision from a team of executives in the United States.Read MoreJuniper also has a supply agreement with Merck KGaA on Crinone, a progesterone approved to help women become pregnant. The Merck contract, in our opinion, probably is worth at least $3.30 a share, or twice that were Juniper to extend the Merck agreement beyond its expiration of May, 2020.Other Juniper assets include net cash of more than $2 a share. We exclude the value of $156 million of tax-loss carryforwards because we find them difficult to assess.  Asset   Per-Share Value   Notes     Net cash   $2.12   Current assets less current liabilities plus deferred revenue less notes payable as of Dec. 31.     Merck KGaA revenue   $3.30   Assumes Merck revenue growth of 3% annually until agreement ends May 19, 2020; gross margin of 43%, and Bloomberg's weighted-average cost of capital of 12.2%.     Juniper Pharma Services   $3.35   Assumes 2.8 times 2016 revenue. Juniper acquired the business for 2.95 times revenue in 2013.     Sum   $8.77   Assumes 10.9 million shares outstanding.  Juniper management has an incentive to maintain the status quo, with its top-four executives earning $2.3 million a year and its non-employee directors earning more than $736,000 in 2015, according to the proxy.Shareholders are paying executives more than 6% of the market capitalization a year. On April 11, the stock hit a record low.  While the company's executives continue to draw rich compensation, its investors suffer. We implore the company to act now and stop the downward spiral.Regards,Michael P. Krensavage Founder Krensavage Asset Management LLC(1)   Bloomberg as of Dec. 31.

NEW YORK, May 17, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Krensavage Asset Management LLC, a 6.0% shareholder of RTI Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:   RTIX), urges shareholders to protect their stakes in RTI by voting the GREEN proxy card at the company's May 26 annual meeting.








RTI in its April 28 first-quarter earnings report disclosed that it may squander about $2.5 million of shareholders' money to wage a proxy battle against Krensavage, which is seeking to install directors who would help end years of poor performance and questionable corporate governance. RTI's first-quarter earnings declined 47% on a 1% revenue decrease.
"RTI's willingness to spend more than 20% of its cash on hand to thwart a large shareholder's efforts to improve RTI for the benefit of all shareholders is utterly unconscionable," said Michael P. Krensavage, managing member of Krensavage Asset Management. "We believe the company's obstinance underscores its utter contempt for those who have used their own money to buy shares of RTI."
After Krensavage complained about RTI's spending to maintain the troubling status quo under CEO Brian Hutchison, the company offered Krensavage a single board seat—increasing the number of directors to 10 from 9--following months of refusing to embrace any of the four highly-qualified nominees Krensavage proposes for RTI's May 26 annual meeting.
While we would prefer RTI management focus on running the company instead of waging a proxy battle, its offer falls short of the change that we believe is required at RTI to enhance value for all shareholders.
RTI's first-quarter earnings report underscores the need for reform. Net income applicable to common shares in the three months ended March declined 47% from the year-ago period. Revenue declined 1%, hurt by a 12.4% drop in sales to commercial customers. The segment represents 38% of RTI's revenue.
Worse, RTI cuts its guidance for the commercial segment. The company on April 28 said it expects revenue from commercial and "other" to decline at least 13% and as much as 16% in 2016, a deterioration from its previously-implied drop of 9.4% to 13.6%.
For the second quarter, RTI said it expects company-wide revenue to decline between 6.4% and 7.8% from the year-ago period. The midpoint of RTI's guidance implies a 4.1% decline in first-half revenue from the year-ago period. 
Krensavage remains concerned about RTI's spending. Operating expenses climbed 3.8% in the first-quarter from the year-ago period while revenue declined 1%. Operating margin declined to 5.9% in the first quarter of 2016 from 9.1% in the year-ago period. Capital spending increased 8.7% from the prior-year period to $4.6 million, or more than 70% of first-quarter operating cash flow.
Krensavage repeatedly has criticized RTI for failing to generate cash. It has produced positive free-cash flow in four of its 16 years as a public company.
RTI's performance raises questions about a plan the company disclosed in November, 2014, to build its annual revenue to $500 million and lift its operating margin to 20%. RTI generated 2015 revenue of $282.3 million and an operating margin of 8.72%. The company's shares have dropped 25% since it disclosed its plan.
While the company repeated its $500 million goal in a May 12 letter to shareholders, it again omitted a timetable. Were sales to grow at the 1.3% rate implied by the midpoint of its 2016 guidance, revenue would breach $500 million in 2060. 
"We seriously question whether RTI will ever hit its revenue target," Krensavage said. "RTI desperately needs the guidance our independent directors would provide. We urge shareholders to fortify the future of RTI and vote the green card."
Vote GREEN
Krensavage proposes highly qualified independent nominees who will act on behalf of all shareholders.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
