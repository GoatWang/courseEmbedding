Arvind K.
R&D
Pune, India
Innovation: Nuance is like a $2-billion start-up. There are so many things we are doing for the first time, but the scale is huge and the machinery is complex.
We are a matrix organization: It is challenging but very rewarding to build collaborations with stakeholders that are halfway around the world.
Impact: It boggles the mind to think that such a simple thing like software can not only change lives, but actually save lives.
And finally, to paraphrase a quote from an unknown source: You have to be a little bit crazy to work at Nuance, but you have to be completely crazy to work anywhere else.

Nuance Communications is an American multinational computer software technology corporation, headquartered in Burlington, Massachusetts, United States on the outskirts of Boston, that provides speech and imaging applications. Current business products focus on server and embedded speech recognition, telephone call steering systems, automated telephone directory services, medical transcription software and systems, optical character recognition software, and desktop imaging software. The company also maintains a small division which does software and system development for military and government agencies.
Nuance merged with its competitor in the commercial large-scale speech application business, ScanSoft, in October 2005. ScanSoft was a Xerox spin-off that was bought in 1999 by Visioneer, a hardware and software scanner company, which adopted ScanSoft as the new merged company name. The original ScanSoft had its roots in Kurzweil Computer Products, a software company that developed the first omni-font character recognition system.[citation needed]

Company history[edit]
In September 2005, ScanSoft Inc. acquired and merged with Nuance Communications, and the resulting company adopted the Nuance name. For a decade prior to that, the two companies competed in the commercial large-scale speech application business.
ScanSoft origins[edit]
In 1974, Raymond Kurzweil founded the Kurzweil Computer Products, Inc. to develop the first omni-font optical character-recognition system—a computer program capable of recognizing text written in any normal font.[4] In 1980, Kurzweil sold his company to Xerox.[4] The company became known as Xerox Imaging Systems (XIS), and later ScanSoft.
In March 1992, a new company called Visioneer, Inc. was founded to develop scanner hardware and software products, such as a sheetfed scanner called PaperMax[5] and the document management software PaperPort. Visioneer eventually sold its hardware division to Primax Electronics, Ltd. in January 1999. Two months later, in March, Visioneer acquired ScanSoft from Xerox to form a new public company with ScanSoft as the new company-wide name.
Prior to 2001, ScanSoft focused primarily on desktop imaging software such as TextBridge,[6] PaperPort and OmniPage. Beginning with the December 2001 acquisition of Lernout & Hauspie, the company moved into the speech recognition business and began to compete with Nuance.
Nuance history prior to the 2005 merger with ScanSoft[edit]
Nuance was founded in 1994 as a spin-off of SRI International's Speech Technology and Research (STAR) Laboratory to commercialize the speaker-independent speech recognition technology developed for the US government at SRI. Based in Menlo Park, California, Nuance deployed their first commercial large-scale speech application in 1996. Their initial route to market was through call center automation. Call centers had just centralized the branch-office telephone handling function throughout many large companies. The highest cost of running call centers is the cost of staff. Early projects were completely developed by Nuance to prove the commercial practicality and benefits.
Early Nuance applications ran on Windows NT-based and Solaris operating systems, and commonly relied on Dialogic boards for the telephony hardware.
In 1994, Nuance was spun off from SRI's STAR Lab. Two years later, Nuance deployed its first commercial speech application. On 13 April 2000, Nuance filed an initial public offering (IPO) on the NASDAQ under the symbol NUAN. On 15 November 2000, Nuance acquired SpeechFront voice instant messaging company for $10.5 million in cash and stock.
In simple terms, the technology produced allowed a computer to determine what a speaker was saying within a specific and limited vocabulary of phrases. Its key advantage over technologies such as ViaVoice was that the system did not need training for the specific speaker. This permitted the use of the system, so-called speaker-independent natural-language speech recognition (abbreviated as SI-NLSR or just NLSR), for call automation.[citation needed]
The limited vocabulary was typically a few thousand different variations of phrases. In complex systems this could be in the low millions. At the time, these systems were pushing the limits of computer processing power in commodity Intel x86 servers until the early 2000s.[citation needed]
During the late 1990s and into the 2000s, Nuance competed against other NLSR vendors including Philips SpeechPearl, SpeechWorks and other smaller players which were typically geographically focused such as Vocalis in the UK which used proprietary PCI cards with DSPs on board to improve the efficiency and density of the system.
Each speech-recognition engine provider had to determine how to convert written text into sounds. Determining how written text is spoken is a hugely challenging task in itself. Languages are "modeled", samples of real spoken language is recorded and analyzed to create a language model. The higher the quality the language model the better the experience of the user, especially in complex interactions. Different language models were required for different dialects such as Flemish being a variant of Dutch, or Swiss German being a dialect of High German. Different models were also created for different qualities of telephone connection. Europe's Philips had by far the largest language coverage which included Flemish and Welsh.
Later, Nuance sold licenses (training and consulting) to their technology to third parties, including independent software vendors and interactive voice response (IVR) vendors who would build applications on top of an IVR platform. SpeechWorks on the other hand would typically deliver the application with the technology or with a group of key delivery partners. The technology was integrated into most of the leading IVR products from Avaya, Nortel Periphonics, Envox, Syntellect and many others. The requirements of telephony reliability meant many of these solutions ran on various versions of UNIX.
Nuance 7 was launched in the late 1990s and was an efficient network-distributed NLSR speech recognition solution; it ran on Unix and Windows. Nuance 8 added Statistical Language Modeling, an adaption of technologies used in technologies, such as ViaVoice to improve the range of phrases that the system could recognize at the expense of greater implementation cost and complexity. Nuance 8.x series also introduced the W3C vocabulary definition language GrXML in addition to and eventual replacement of Nuance's proprietary and very concise Grammar Specification Language, GSL.
Nuance 8.5 was the last point release before the takeover by ScanSoft. These systems were significantly different from the technology used in consumer speech recognition products such as ViaVoice, which is now also a Nuance product.[citation needed]
While Nuance marketed their technology at call-center exhibitions, they rarely delivered solutions directly. Instead, Nuance relied on telecommunications partners, such as Nortel Periphonics, Avaya and Syntellect. Nuance realised that designing and developing speech-based solutions requires a different skill set and to that of traditional DTMF solutions.
For a couple of years prior to the takeover by ScanSoft, Nuance started selling products directly, including their call-routing product ("Call Steering"), which determined the "skill group" required for the call based on responses to reasonably open questions asked of the caller.
Nuance 9.0 is the first release (excluding service packs) of the recognizer product since the acquisition and is an amalgam of the technologies acquired from various companies including Philips Speech Pearl, Speechworks, Nuance Recognizer and others. Further information is not known about this product
Partnership with the Siri and Apple Inc.[edit]
Siri is an application that combines speech recognition with advanced natural-language processing. The artificial intelligence, which required both advances in the underlying algorithms and leaps in processing power both on mobile devices and the servers that share the workload, allows software to understand words and their intentions.[7]
Telephony application process[edit]

User invokes the telephony application for call automation
Application loads the phrases for the application and prompts the user to ask a question, opening a stream from the telephony input to the speech recognition software.
User speaks and this is streamed to the recognizer.
Recognizer returns a number of potential results with probability for each one that it is correct.

Recognizer process[edit]

Determines the start of speech input
uses audio techniques to remove background noise
slices the audio into small sections (10 to 100 ms in length)
determines the sound in each slice
matches the combination of sounds for the spoken phrase with the possible sound combinations provided by the possible phrases[citation needed]

Topology[edit]
A typical Nuance recognizer configuration required four or five applications to be started, often monitored by a sixth application.

NLM
Nuance License Manager: kept a watch on the number of concurrent speech calls in use.
recclient
recognition client: it is the interface between the IVR speech path and the speech recognizing software, the recserver. The recclient can be developed into the IVR software.
resource-manager
distributes the load over the recservers as required to balance load and to provide fault-tolerance.
recserver
where the speech is compared and processed against known vocabulary.
grammar-compiler
an application that dynamically adds words or phrases to an expected vocabulary for recognition.
watchdog
a Windows service or Unix daemon that monitors and maintains the above processes, restarting them if required.

Except for the watchdog which should be running on all the nuance speech servers, the other processes may be spread over a farm of servers, connected by an IP network with low latency and high-bandwidth, usually a dedicated LAN segment. The resource manager directs which resources it thinks are least utilized.
Acquisitions[edit]
Prior to the 2005 merger, ScanSoft acquired other companies to expand its business. Unlike ScanSoft, Nuance did not actively acquire companies prior to their merger. After the merge, the company continued to grow through acquisition.

PDF Reader











Nuance - PDF Reader Free Download
Introducing a free PDF reader that's small in size and big on features.
PDF Reader
Get ready to rethink your choice of free PDF reader. Nuance PDF Reader enables you to do much more than just view PDF files. You can convert PDF files to Word, Excel, and RTF via a hosted web service. Use annotation tools to highlight, cross-out, and underline text for more effective collaboration. Even fill out and save PDF forms. Nuance PDF Reader takes up less disk space, is more secure than Adobe Reader, and works with virtually any PDF file. Best of all, it's absolutely free, proving that you really can get a whole lot of something for nothing.

Details
What sets Nuance PDF Reader apart from other free PDF software?  It includes features typically found in premium products.
Consider these advantages:
ENHANCED! Create a condensed, "paper-friendly" summary of all comments that have been added to a PDF document. Get a complete view of who added which comment and when.
NEW! With Nuance PDF Reader you can view rich media including Silverlight® directly within PDF files. 
NEW! Perform Smarter Searches with the intelligent Looks Like Search™ to quickly find content - such as phone numbers, e-mail addresses, and Social Security numbers - via an alphanumeric pattern rather than exact text.  
NEW! View multi-layer graphics - Get better visibility into graphics by viewing individual layers created by programs like AutoCAD® and Microsoft Visio®. 
NEW! Preview MS Office files directly within PDF Portfolios, eliminating the hassle of having to open each file within the native authoring software to see what is contained in the document. When a PDF Portfolio can contain hundreds of files you can quickly identify the single document you need. 
NEW! Got Pro? Enjoy the convenience of complete desktop conversion with PDF Converter Professional while maintaining Nuance PDF Reader as your default viewer. Get the best of both worlds when you have PDF Converter Professional installed on your PC but prefer to use Nuance PDF Reader as your default viewer.  
NEW! Store the digital ID certificates of your partners and colleagues in Nuance PDF Reader and use them to verify digitally signed documents.  
NEW! Use the improved interface for multiple-string searches and locate sensitive information within a searchable PDF file. Multiple-string searches allow you to refine your search criteria and pinpoint exactly what you are looking for.
NEW! View messages and notifications directly within Nuance PDF Reader. With the new Messages Panel you have the option to view messages and notifications from Nuance and take advantage of special discounts on Nuance products. Saving you time and money when researching additional Nuance products or upgrade information.
Fill and save PDF forms - Most other PDF viewers do not enable you to fill and save PDF forms without support from a premium product. Nuance PDF Reader is perfect for all kinds of applications and forms, including childcare reimbursement forms, quarterly tax forms, expense reports, purchase orders, surveys and more.
Use less disk space - At 200 MB, Adobe® Reader® takes up some serious disk space. Fully installed, Nuance PDF Reader uses less than 60 MB and you get features that you do not find in Adobe Reader. Talk about getting more for less.
Annotate PDFs - PDF files are great for sharing information, but without the right tools, they're not so great for collaboration. Nuance PDF Reader provides frequently used annotation tools, letting you highlight, cross-out, and underline text for real collaboration.
Convert PDF files to Word, Excel, or RTF - With our free PDF Reader, you get the most accurate online PDF conversion available - without having to install extra software. No more copying and pasting or retyping PDF documents. Just use our hosted web service to convert PDF to Word, Excel, RTF or WordPerfect using Nuance's industry-leading OCR technology. It's never been easier to upload, convert, and start using information previously trapped in a PDF.
Keep Your Documents Safe - Nuance knows that hackers can use JavaScript to gain control of your computer and your personal information. That's why, unlike Adobe Reader, Nuance PDF Reader can be installed with JavaScript turned off. So you gain peace of mind knowing that your valuable data is protected. If needed, JavaScript can be turned on easily during the installation process.
Enjoy 100% Compatibility With Adobe Acrobat - With support for all PDF standards up to the current version (1.7), Nuance Reader is 100% compatible with Adobe Acrobat®. So you can be confident that it will work with virtually any PDF file.
Work With PDF Portfolios - In addition to supporting the full set of PDF standards, Nuance Reader supports PDF portfolios - collections of various file types assembled into a PDF. You can access each file independently of others in the portfolio and open them using the native authoring software.
Integration With Microsoft SharePoint - Now you can access and open files stored in your SharePoint® repository, or save edited files directly back to SharePoint all from within our free PDF Reader.

Stop wasting time with free PDF viewers that fall short of your needs. Download the new Nuance PDF Reader for free and enjoy a better reader experience.

Upgrade

R&D
Pune, India
Innovation: Nuance is like a $2-billion start-up. There are so many things we are doing for the first time, but the scale is huge and the machinery is complex.
We are a matrix organization: It is challenging but very rewarding to build collaborations with stakeholders that are halfway around the world.
Impact: It boggles the mind to think that such a simple thing like software can not only change lives, but actually save lives.
And finally, to paraphrase a quote from an unknown source: You have to be a little bit crazy to work at Nuance, but you have to be completely crazy to work anywhere else.

Nuance Communications is an American multinational computer software technology corporation, headquartered in Burlington, Massachusetts, United States on the outskirts of Boston, that provides speech and imaging applications. Current business products focus on server and embedded speech recognition, telephone call steering systems, automated telephone directory services, medical transcription software and systems, optical character recognition software, and desktop imaging software. The company also maintains a small division which does software and system development for military and government agencies.
Nuance merged with its competitor in the commercial large-scale speech application business, ScanSoft, in October 2005. ScanSoft was a Xerox spin-off that was bought in 1999 by Visioneer, a hardware and software scanner company, which adopted ScanSoft as the new merged company name. The original ScanSoft had its roots in Kurzweil Computer Products, a software company that developed the first omni-font character recognition system.[citation needed]

Company history[edit]
In September 2005, ScanSoft Inc. acquired and merged with Nuance Communications, and the resulting company adopted the Nuance name. For a decade prior to that, the two companies competed in the commercial large-scale speech application business.
ScanSoft origins[edit]
In 1974, Raymond Kurzweil founded the Kurzweil Computer Products, Inc. to develop the first omni-font optical character-recognition system—a computer program capable of recognizing text written in any normal font.[4] In 1980, Kurzweil sold his company to Xerox.[4] The company became known as Xerox Imaging Systems (XIS), and later ScanSoft.
In March 1992, a new company called Visioneer, Inc. was founded to develop scanner hardware and software products, such as a sheetfed scanner called PaperMax[5] and the document management software PaperPort. Visioneer eventually sold its hardware division to Primax Electronics, Ltd. in January 1999. Two months later, in March, Visioneer acquired ScanSoft from Xerox to form a new public company with ScanSoft as the new company-wide name.
Prior to 2001, ScanSoft focused primarily on desktop imaging software such as TextBridge,[6] PaperPort and OmniPage. Beginning with the December 2001 acquisition of Lernout & Hauspie, the company moved into the speech recognition business and began to compete with Nuance.
Nuance history prior to the 2005 merger with ScanSoft[edit]
Nuance was founded in 1994 as a spin-off of SRI International's Speech Technology and Research (STAR) Laboratory to commercialize the speaker-independent speech recognition technology developed for the US government at SRI. Based in Menlo Park, California, Nuance deployed their first commercial large-scale speech application in 1996. Their initial route to market was through call center automation. Call centers had just centralized the branch-office telephone handling function throughout many large companies. The highest cost of running call centers is the cost of staff. Early projects were completely developed by Nuance to prove the commercial practicality and benefits.
Early Nuance applications ran on Windows NT-based and Solaris operating systems, and commonly relied on Dialogic boards for the telephony hardware.
In 1994, Nuance was spun off from SRI's STAR Lab. Two years later, Nuance deployed its first commercial speech application. On 13 April 2000, Nuance filed an initial public offering (IPO) on the NASDAQ under the symbol NUAN. On 15 November 2000, Nuance acquired SpeechFront voice instant messaging company for $10.5 million in cash and stock.
In simple terms, the technology produced allowed a computer to determine what a speaker was saying within a specific and limited vocabulary of phrases. Its key advantage over technologies such as ViaVoice was that the system did not need training for the specific speaker. This permitted the use of the system, so-called speaker-independent natural-language speech recognition (abbreviated as SI-NLSR or just NLSR), for call automation.[citation needed]
The limited vocabulary was typically a few thousand different variations of phrases. In complex systems this could be in the low millions. At the time, these systems were pushing the limits of computer processing power in commodity Intel x86 servers until the early 2000s.[citation needed]
During the late 1990s and into the 2000s, Nuance competed against other NLSR vendors including Philips SpeechPearl, SpeechWorks and other smaller players which were typically geographically focused such as Vocalis in the UK which used proprietary PCI cards with DSPs on board to improve the efficiency and density of the system.
Each speech-recognition engine provider had to determine how to convert written text into sounds. Determining how written text is spoken is a hugely challenging task in itself. Languages are "modeled", samples of real spoken language is recorded and analyzed to create a language model. The higher the quality the language model the better the experience of the user, especially in complex interactions. Different language models were required for different dialects such as Flemish being a variant of Dutch, or Swiss German being a dialect of High German. Different models were also created for different qualities of telephone connection. Europe's Philips had by far the largest language coverage which included Flemish and Welsh.
Later, Nuance sold licenses (training and consulting) to their technology to third parties, including independent software vendors and interactive voice response (IVR) vendors who would build applications on top of an IVR platform. SpeechWorks on the other hand would typically deliver the application with the technology or with a group of key delivery partners. The technology was integrated into most of the leading IVR products from Avaya, Nortel Periphonics, Envox, Syntellect and many others. The requirements of telephony reliability meant many of these solutions ran on various versions of UNIX.
Nuance 7 was launched in the late 1990s and was an efficient network-distributed NLSR speech recognition solution; it ran on Unix and Windows. Nuance 8 added Statistical Language Modeling, an adaption of technologies used in technologies, such as ViaVoice to improve the range of phrases that the system could recognize at the expense of greater implementation cost and complexity. Nuance 8.x series also introduced the W3C vocabulary definition language GrXML in addition to and eventual replacement of Nuance's proprietary and very concise Grammar Specification Language, GSL.
Nuance 8.5 was the last point release before the takeover by ScanSoft. These systems were significantly different from the technology used in consumer speech recognition products such as ViaVoice, which is now also a Nuance product.[citation needed]
While Nuance marketed their technology at call-center exhibitions, they rarely delivered solutions directly. Instead, Nuance relied on telecommunications partners, such as Nortel Periphonics, Avaya and Syntellect. Nuance realised that designing and developing speech-based solutions requires a different skill set and to that of traditional DTMF solutions.
For a couple of years prior to the takeover by ScanSoft, Nuance started selling products directly, including their call-routing product ("Call Steering"), which determined the "skill group" required for the call based on responses to reasonably open questions asked of the caller.
Nuance 9.0 is the first release (excluding service packs) of the recognizer product since the acquisition and is an amalgam of the technologies acquired from various companies including Philips Speech Pearl, Speechworks, Nuance Recognizer and others. Further information is not known about this product
Partnership with the Siri and Apple Inc.[edit]
Siri is an application that combines speech recognition with advanced natural-language processing. The artificial intelligence, which required both advances in the underlying algorithms and leaps in processing power both on mobile devices and the servers that share the workload, allows software to understand words and their intentions.[7]
Telephony application process[edit]

User invokes the telephony application for call automation
Application loads the phrases for the application and prompts the user to ask a question, opening a stream from the telephony input to the speech recognition software.
User speaks and this is streamed to the recognizer.
Recognizer returns a number of potential results with probability for each one that it is correct.

Recognizer process[edit]

Determines the start of speech input
uses audio techniques to remove background noise
slices the audio into small sections (10 to 100 ms in length)
determines the sound in each slice
matches the combination of sounds for the spoken phrase with the possible sound combinations provided by the possible phrases[citation needed]

Topology[edit]
A typical Nuance recognizer configuration required four or five applications to be started, often monitored by a sixth application.

NLM
Nuance License Manager: kept a watch on the number of concurrent speech calls in use.
recclient
recognition client: it is the interface between the IVR speech path and the speech recognizing software, the recserver. The recclient can be developed into the IVR software.
resource-manager
distributes the load over the recservers as required to balance load and to provide fault-tolerance.
recserver
where the speech is compared and processed against known vocabulary.
grammar-compiler
an application that dynamically adds words or phrases to an expected vocabulary for recognition.
watchdog
a Windows service or Unix daemon that monitors and maintains the above processes, restarting them if required.

Except for the watchdog which should be running on all the nuance speech servers, the other processes may be spread over a farm of servers, connected by an IP network with low latency and high-bandwidth, usually a dedicated LAN segment. The resource manager directs which resources it thinks are least utilized.
Acquisitions[edit]
Prior to the 2005 merger, ScanSoft acquired other companies to expand its business. Unlike ScanSoft, Nuance did not actively acquire companies prior to their merger. After the merge, the company continued to grow through acquisition.

Nuance Communications is an American multinational computer software technology corporation, headquartered in Burlington, Massachusetts, United States on the outskirts of Boston, that provides speech and imaging applications. Current business products focus on server and embedded speech recognition, telephone call steering systems, automated telephone directory services, medical transcription software and systems, optical character recognition software, and desktop imaging software. The company also maintains a small division which does software and system development for military and government agencies.
Nuance merged with its competitor in the commercial large-scale speech application business, ScanSoft, in October 2005. ScanSoft was a Xerox spin-off that was bought in 1999 by Visioneer, a hardware and software scanner company, which adopted ScanSoft as the new merged company name. The original ScanSoft had its roots in Kurzweil Computer Products, a software company that developed the first omni-font character recognition system.[citation needed]

Company history[edit]
In September 2005, ScanSoft Inc. acquired and merged with Nuance Communications, and the resulting company adopted the Nuance name. For a decade prior to that, the two companies competed in the commercial large-scale speech application business.
ScanSoft origins[edit]
In 1974, Raymond Kurzweil founded the Kurzweil Computer Products, Inc. to develop the first omni-font optical character-recognition system—a computer program capable of recognizing text written in any normal font.[4] In 1980, Kurzweil sold his company to Xerox.[4] The company became known as Xerox Imaging Systems (XIS), and later ScanSoft.
In March 1992, a new company called Visioneer, Inc. was founded to develop scanner hardware and software products, such as a sheetfed scanner called PaperMax[5] and the document management software PaperPort. Visioneer eventually sold its hardware division to Primax Electronics, Ltd. in January 1999. Two months later, in March, Visioneer acquired ScanSoft from Xerox to form a new public company with ScanSoft as the new company-wide name.
Prior to 2001, ScanSoft focused primarily on desktop imaging software such as TextBridge,[6] PaperPort and OmniPage. Beginning with the December 2001 acquisition of Lernout & Hauspie, the company moved into the speech recognition business and began to compete with Nuance.
Nuance history prior to the 2005 merger with ScanSoft[edit]
Nuance was founded in 1994 as a spin-off of SRI International's Speech Technology and Research (STAR) Laboratory to commercialize the speaker-independent speech recognition technology developed for the US government at SRI. Based in Menlo Park, California, Nuance deployed their first commercial large-scale speech application in 1996. Their initial route to market was through call center automation. Call centers had just centralized the branch-office telephone handling function throughout many large companies. The highest cost of running call centers is the cost of staff. Early projects were completely developed by Nuance to prove the commercial practicality and benefits.
Early Nuance applications ran on Windows NT-based and Solaris operating systems, and commonly relied on Dialogic boards for the telephony hardware.
In 1994, Nuance was spun off from SRI's STAR Lab. Two years later, Nuance deployed its first commercial speech application. On 13 April 2000, Nuance filed an initial public offering (IPO) on the NASDAQ under the symbol NUAN. On 15 November 2000, Nuance acquired SpeechFront voice instant messaging company for $10.5 million in cash and stock.
In simple terms, the technology produced allowed a computer to determine what a speaker was saying within a specific and limited vocabulary of phrases. Its key advantage over technologies such as ViaVoice was that the system did not need training for the specific speaker. This permitted the use of the system, so-called speaker-independent natural-language speech recognition (abbreviated as SI-NLSR or just NLSR), for call automation.[citation needed]
The limited vocabulary was typically a few thousand different variations of phrases. In complex systems this could be in the low millions. At the time, these systems were pushing the limits of computer processing power in commodity Intel x86 servers until the early 2000s.[citation needed]
During the late 1990s and into the 2000s, Nuance competed against other NLSR vendors including Philips SpeechPearl, SpeechWorks and other smaller players which were typically geographically focused such as Vocalis in the UK which used proprietary PCI cards with DSPs on board to improve the efficiency and density of the system.
Each speech-recognition engine provider had to determine how to convert written text into sounds. Determining how written text is spoken is a hugely challenging task in itself. Languages are "modeled", samples of real spoken language is recorded and analyzed to create a language model. The higher the quality the language model the better the experience of the user, especially in complex interactions. Different language models were required for different dialects such as Flemish being a variant of Dutch, or Swiss German being a dialect of High German. Different models were also created for different qualities of telephone connection. Europe's Philips had by far the largest language coverage which included Flemish and Welsh.
Later, Nuance sold licenses (training and consulting) to their technology to third parties, including independent software vendors and interactive voice response (IVR) vendors who would build applications on top of an IVR platform. SpeechWorks on the other hand would typically deliver the application with the technology or with a group of key delivery partners. The technology was integrated into most of the leading IVR products from Avaya, Nortel Periphonics, Envox, Syntellect and many others. The requirements of telephony reliability meant many of these solutions ran on various versions of UNIX.
Nuance 7 was launched in the late 1990s and was an efficient network-distributed NLSR speech recognition solution; it ran on Unix and Windows. Nuance 8 added Statistical Language Modeling, an adaption of technologies used in technologies, such as ViaVoice to improve the range of phrases that the system could recognize at the expense of greater implementation cost and complexity. Nuance 8.x series also introduced the W3C vocabulary definition language GrXML in addition to and eventual replacement of Nuance's proprietary and very concise Grammar Specification Language, GSL.
Nuance 8.5 was the last point release before the takeover by ScanSoft. These systems were significantly different from the technology used in consumer speech recognition products such as ViaVoice, which is now also a Nuance product.[citation needed]
While Nuance marketed their technology at call-center exhibitions, they rarely delivered solutions directly. Instead, Nuance relied on telecommunications partners, such as Nortel Periphonics, Avaya and Syntellect. Nuance realised that designing and developing speech-based solutions requires a different skill set and to that of traditional DTMF solutions.
For a couple of years prior to the takeover by ScanSoft, Nuance started selling products directly, including their call-routing product ("Call Steering"), which determined the "skill group" required for the call based on responses to reasonably open questions asked of the caller.
Nuance 9.0 is the first release (excluding service packs) of the recognizer product since the acquisition and is an amalgam of the technologies acquired from various companies including Philips Speech Pearl, Speechworks, Nuance Recognizer and others. Further information is not known about this product
Partnership with the Siri and Apple Inc.[edit]
Siri is an application that combines speech recognition with advanced natural-language processing. The artificial intelligence, which required both advances in the underlying algorithms and leaps in processing power both on mobile devices and the servers that share the workload, allows software to understand words and their intentions.[7]
Telephony application process[edit]

User invokes the telephony application for call automation
Application loads the phrases for the application and prompts the user to ask a question, opening a stream from the telephony input to the speech recognition software.
User speaks and this is streamed to the recognizer.
Recognizer returns a number of potential results with probability for each one that it is correct.

Recognizer process[edit]

Determines the start of speech input
uses audio techniques to remove background noise
slices the audio into small sections (10 to 100 ms in length)
determines the sound in each slice
matches the combination of sounds for the spoken phrase with the possible sound combinations provided by the possible phrases[citation needed]

Topology[edit]
A typical Nuance recognizer configuration required four or five applications to be started, often monitored by a sixth application.

NLM
Nuance License Manager: kept a watch on the number of concurrent speech calls in use.
recclient
recognition client: it is the interface between the IVR speech path and the speech recognizing software, the recserver. The recclient can be developed into the IVR software.
resource-manager
distributes the load over the recservers as required to balance load and to provide fault-tolerance.
recserver
where the speech is compared and processed against known vocabulary.
grammar-compiler
an application that dynamically adds words or phrases to an expected vocabulary for recognition.
watchdog
a Windows service or Unix daemon that monitors and maintains the above processes, restarting them if required.

Except for the watchdog which should be running on all the nuance speech servers, the other processes may be spread over a farm of servers, connected by an IP network with low latency and high-bandwidth, usually a dedicated LAN segment.

Nuance Communications is an American multinational computer software technology corporation, headquartered in Burlington, Massachusetts, United States on the outskirts of Boston, that provides speech and imaging applications. Current business products focus on server and embedded speech recognition, telephone call steering systems, automated telephone directory services, medical transcription software and systems, optical character recognition software, and desktop imaging software. The company also maintains a small division which does software and system development for military and government agencies.
Nuance merged with its competitor in the commercial large-scale speech application business, ScanSoft, in October 2005. ScanSoft was a Xerox spin-off that was bought in 1999 by Visioneer, a hardware and software scanner company, which adopted ScanSoft as the new merged company name. The original ScanSoft had its roots in Kurzweil Computer Products, a software company that developed the first omni-font character recognition system.[citation needed]

Company history[edit]
In September 2005, ScanSoft Inc. acquired and merged with Nuance Communications, and the resulting company adopted the Nuance name. For a decade prior to that, the two companies competed in the commercial large-scale speech application business.
ScanSoft origins[edit]
In 1974, Raymond Kurzweil founded the Kurzweil Computer Products, Inc. to develop the first omni-font optical character-recognition system—a computer program capable of recognizing text written in any normal font.[4] In 1980, Kurzweil sold his company to Xerox.[4] The company became known as Xerox Imaging Systems (XIS), and later ScanSoft.
In March 1992, a new company called Visioneer, Inc. was founded to develop scanner hardware and software products, such as a sheetfed scanner called PaperMax[5] and the document management software PaperPort. Visioneer eventually sold its hardware division to Primax Electronics, Ltd. in January 1999. Two months later, in March, Visioneer acquired ScanSoft from Xerox to form a new public company with ScanSoft as the new company-wide name.
Prior to 2001, ScanSoft focused primarily on desktop imaging software such as TextBridge,[6] PaperPort and OmniPage. Beginning with the December 2001 acquisition of Lernout & Hauspie, the company moved into the speech recognition business and began to compete with Nuance.
Nuance history prior to the 2005 merger with ScanSoft[edit]
Nuance was founded in 1994 as a spin-off of SRI International's Speech Technology and Research (STAR) Laboratory to commercialize the speaker-independent speech recognition technology developed for the US government at SRI. Based in Menlo Park, California, Nuance deployed their first commercial large-scale speech application in 1996. Their initial route to market was through call center automation. Call centers had just centralized the branch-office telephone handling function throughout many large companies. The highest cost of running call centers is the cost of staff. Early projects were completely developed by Nuance to prove the commercial practicality and benefits.
Early Nuance applications ran on Windows NT-based and Solaris operating systems, and commonly relied on Dialogic boards for the telephony hardware.
In 1994, Nuance was spun off from SRI's STAR Lab. Two years later, Nuance deployed its first commercial speech application. On 13 April 2000, Nuance filed an initial public offering (IPO) on the NASDAQ under the symbol NUAN. On 15 November 2000, Nuance acquired SpeechFront voice instant messaging company for $10.5 million in cash and stock.
In simple terms, the technology produced allowed a computer to determine what a speaker was saying within a specific and limited vocabulary of phrases. Its key advantage over technologies such as ViaVoice was that the system did not need training for the specific speaker. This permitted the use of the system, so-called speaker-independent natural-language speech recognition (abbreviated as SI-NLSR or just NLSR), for call automation.[citation needed]
The limited vocabulary was typically a few thousand different variations of phrases. In complex systems this could be in the low millions. At the time, these systems were pushing the limits of computer processing power in commodity Intel x86 servers until the early 2000s.[citation needed]
During the late 1990s and into the 2000s, Nuance competed against other NLSR vendors including Philips SpeechPearl, SpeechWorks and other smaller players which were typically geographically focused such as Vocalis in the UK which used proprietary PCI cards with DSPs on board to improve the efficiency and density of the system.
Each speech-recognition engine provider had to determine how to convert written text into sounds. Determining how written text is spoken is a hugely challenging task in itself. Languages are "modeled", samples of real spoken language is recorded and analyzed to create a language model. The higher the quality the language model the better the experience of the user, especially in complex interactions. Different language models were required for different dialects such as Flemish being a variant of Dutch, or Swiss German being a dialect of High German. Different models were also created for different qualities of telephone connection. Europe's Philips had by far the largest language coverage which included Flemish and Welsh.
Later, Nuance sold licenses (training and consulting) to their technology to third parties, including independent software vendors and interactive voice response (IVR) vendors who would build applications on top of an IVR platform. SpeechWorks on the other hand would typically deliver the application with the technology or with a group of key delivery partners. The technology was integrated into most of the leading IVR products from Avaya, Nortel Periphonics, Envox, Syntellect and many others. The requirements of telephony reliability meant many of these solutions ran on various versions of UNIX.
Nuance 7 was launched in the late 1990s and was an efficient network-distributed NLSR speech recognition solution; it ran on Unix and Windows. Nuance 8 added Statistical Language Modeling, an adaption of technologies used in technologies, such as ViaVoice to improve the range of phrases that the system could recognize at the expense of greater implementation cost and complexity. Nuance 8.x series also introduced the W3C vocabulary definition language GrXML in addition to and eventual replacement of Nuance's proprietary and very concise Grammar Specification Language, GSL.
Nuance 8.5 was the last point release before the takeover by ScanSoft. These systems were significantly different from the technology used in consumer speech recognition products such as ViaVoice, which is now also a Nuance product.[citation needed]
While Nuance marketed their technology at call-center exhibitions, they rarely delivered solutions directly. Instead, Nuance relied on telecommunications partners, such as Nortel Periphonics, Avaya and Syntellect. Nuance realised that designing and developing speech-based solutions requires a different skill set and to that of traditional DTMF solutions.
For a couple of years prior to the takeover by ScanSoft, Nuance started selling products directly, including their call-routing product ("Call Steering"), which determined the "skill group" required for the call based on responses to reasonably open questions asked of the caller.
Nuance 9.0 is the first release (excluding service packs) of the recognizer product since the acquisition and is an amalgam of the technologies acquired from various companies including Philips Speech Pearl, Speechworks, Nuance Recognizer and others. Further information is not known about this product
Partnership with the Siri and Apple Inc.[edit]
Siri is an application that combines speech recognition with advanced natural-language processing. The artificial intelligence, which required both advances in the underlying algorithms and leaps in processing power both on mobile devices and the servers that share the workload, allows software to understand words and their intentions.[7]
Telephony application process[edit]

User invokes the telephony application for call automation
Application loads the phrases for the application and prompts the user to ask a question, opening a stream from the telephony input to the speech recognition software.
User speaks and this is streamed to the recognizer.
Recognizer returns a number of potential results with probability for each one that it is correct.

Recognizer process[edit]

Determines the start of speech input
uses audio techniques to remove background noise
slices the audio into small sections (10 to 100 ms in length)
determines the sound in each slice
matches the combination of sounds for the spoken phrase with the possible sound combinations provided by the possible phrases[citation needed]

Topology[edit]
A typical Nuance recognizer configuration required four or five applications to be started, often monitored by a sixth application.

NLM
Nuance License Manager: kept a watch on the number of concurrent speech calls in use.
recclient
recognition client: it is the interface between the IVR speech path and the speech recognizing software, the recserver. The recclient can be developed into the IVR software.
resource-manager
distributes the load over the recservers as required to balance load and to provide fault-tolerance.
recserver
where the speech is compared and processed against known vocabulary.
grammar-compiler
an application that dynamically adds words or phrases to an expected vocabulary for recognition.
watchdog
a Windows service or Unix daemon that monitors and maintains the above processes, restarting them if required.

Except for the watchdog which should be running on all the nuance speech servers, the other processes may be spread over a farm of servers, connected by an IP network with low latency and high-bandwidth, usually a dedicated LAN segment. The resource manager directs which resources it thinks are least utilized.
Acquisitions[edit]
Prior to the 2005 merger, ScanSoft acquired other companies to expand its business. Unlike ScanSoft, Nuance did not actively acquire companies prior to their merger. After the merge, the company continued to grow through acquisition.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
