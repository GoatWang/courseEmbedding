I'll go to another branch location next time and might even consider switching banks.  I felt un-welcome and not at all treated with respect.  That manager acted as if she was too good to even greet me. She never even smiled.   Unbelievable.  * this reviewer has be with this bank for >10 years* this reviewer had 1 - 2 banks before.* this review was made on U.S. Bank, Eau Claire Sky Park Branch at Eau Claire, WI2 of 3 people found this review helpful.

Add a commentWorst Customer Service Overall Rating Interest Rate and Cost Office Environment & Staff Waiting Time Other Servicesby NellyT, Jul. 17, 2017Recently got married and have not had time to change my name with the bank.  Have been a customer for over 10 years. Enrolled in direct deposit from my job so I rarely have to walk into a branch.  Received a payroll check this time-and customer service said I just needed my marriage certificate and ID.When I walked into the Branch, Ariel(Assistant Manager) was very rude and condescending. Saying she couldn't verify my identity with just "a piece of paper", since my DL had already my married name.  In no way was she even apologetic with the wrong information I was given.  Nor did she even try to explain why my original copy of Marriage Certificate(which has my old name and new name) wasn't enough.Called customer service again, they said I should be able to simply "cash" the check since the name matched with my new DL.  Ariel again, did not even try to explain why she couldn't. I was confused since I was under the impression Banks are supposed to do that, she went on to say "this isn't a check cashing place" wow...Im extremely disappointed with the way I was treated and how insensitive she was with my situation.* this reviewer has be with this bank for >10 years* this reviewer had 1 - 2 banks before.* this review was made on U.S. Bank, Platt Avenue Vons Branch at West Hills, CA3 of 3 people found this review helpful.

Cookies

					Cookies are small text files placed on your computer and are commonly used on the internet.

				how cookies work and how they can be managed. 
			

Transfer of personal data to third parties
				Any information you supply may be stored and processed on computers outside of the European Union (e.g. USA), 
				which does not have data protection laws that provide the same protections as the laws of the Member States of 
				the European Economic Area. However, your information will be handled in compliance with this Privacy Policy and applicable laws. 
			



						We are committed to protecting your privacy during your visits to our website and recognise our responsibility to hold 
						your information securely and confidentially. Processing of personal data

				no longer agree with the storage of your data before that time or if such data has become incorrect, they will be deleted 
				or, as the case may be, corrected, according to your instruction. The data will principally be stored by Elavon. If you 
				have questions relating to the processing of your personal data on this website please contact us.
