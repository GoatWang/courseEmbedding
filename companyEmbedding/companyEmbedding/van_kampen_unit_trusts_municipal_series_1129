Investors' Quality Tax-Exempt Trust, Series 178



Investors' Quality Tax-Exempt Trust, Series 178 invests in a portfolio of
tax-exempt municipal bonds. The Trust seeks to provide federal tax-exempt
income and to preserve capital. The Trust is a unit investment trust included
in Invesco Unit Trusts, Municipal Series 1145.


Monthly

Distributions




Estimated Current Return:       3.82%
Estimated Long Term Return:     3.11%


Estimated current return shows the estimated cash you should receive each
year divided by the Unit price. Estimated long term return shows the estimated
return over the estimated life of your Trust. These estimates are as of the
opening of business on the Date of Deposit and will vary thereafter. We base
this estimate on an average of the bond yields over their estimated life. This
estimate also reflects the sales charge and estimated expenses. We derive the
average yield for your portfolio by weighting each bond's yield by its value
and estimated life. Unlike estimated current return, estimated long term return
accounts for maturities, discounts and premiums of the bonds. These estimates
show a comparison rather than a prediction of returns. No return calculation
can predict your actual return. Your actual return may vary from these
estimates.

This prospectus contains two parts.



No one may use this Prospectus Part I unless accompanied by Prospectus Part II.


You should read this prospectus and retain it for future reference.




The Securities and Exchange Commission has not approved or disapproved of the
Trust Units or passed upon the adequacy or accuracy of this prospectus.

Any contrary representation is a criminal offense.



INVESCO



Investment Objective. The Trust seeks to provide federal tax-exempt income
and to preserve capital.


Principal Investment Strategy. The Trust invests in a portfolio of municipal
bonds issued by or on behalf of states and territories of the United States,
and political subdivisions and authorities thereof, the interest on which is,
in the opinion of recognized bond counsel to the issuing authorities,
excludable from gross income for federal personal income tax purposes under
existing law. In selecting bonds for the Trust, the Sponsor considered the
following factors, among others:


o    a Standard & Poor's rating of at least "A-", a Moody's Investors
Service, Inc. rating of at least "A3" or, if not rated, the bonds had
credit characteristics sufficiently similar to those of comparable
bonds that were so rated as to be acceptable for acquisition by the
Trust in the opinion of the Sponsor;


o    the prices of the bonds relative to other bonds of comparable quality
and maturity;


o    the diversification of bonds as to purpose of issue and location of
issuer; and


o    the probability of early return of principal or high legal or event
risk.


The portfolio generally consists of bonds maturing approximately 15 to 40
years from the Date of Deposit. Following the Date of Deposit, a bond may cease
to be rated or its rating may be reduced and the Trust could continue to hold
such bond. See "Trust Administration--Portfolio Administration" in Prospectus


Part II.


Principal Risks. As with all investments, you can lose money by investing in
the Trust. The Trust also might not perform as well as you expect. This can
happen for reasons such as these:


o    Bond prices will fluctuate. The value of your investment may fall over
time.


o    The value of the bonds will generally fall if interest rates, in
general, rise. No one can predict whether interest rates will rise or
fall in the future.


o    A bond issuer or insurer may be unable to make interest and/or
principal payments in the future.


o    The financial condition of an issuer may worsen or its credit ratings
may drop, resulting in a reduction in the value of your Units. This
may occur at any point in time, including during the primary offering
period.


o    A bond issuer might prepay or "call" a bond before its stated
maturity. If this happens, the Trust will distribute the principal to
you but future interest distributions will fall. A bond's call price
could be less than the price the Trust paid for the bond. If enough
bonds are called, the Trust could terminate earlier than expected.


o    The Trust may concentrate in bonds of a particular type of issuer.
This makes the Trust less diversified and subject to greater risk than
a more diversified portfolio. The types of bonds in the portfolio are
listed under "The Bonds" in Prospectus Part II.


o    We do not actively manage the Trust's portfolio. Except in limited
circumstances, the Trust will hold the same bonds even if the market
value declines.

(1)  Some bonds may mature or be called or sold during your Trust's life. This
could include a call or sale at a price below par value. We cannot
guarantee that the value of your Units will equal the principal amount of
bonds per Unit when you redeem them or when your Trust terminates.


(2)  During the initial offering period, part of the value of the Units
represents an amount of cash deposited to pay all or a portion of the costs
of organizing the Trust. The estimated organization costs per Unit will be
deducted from the assets of the Trust at the earlier of six months after
the Date of Deposit or the end of the initial offering period. If Units are
redeemed prior to any such reduction, these costs will not be deducted from
the redemption proceeds. Organization costs are not included in the Public
Offering Price per Unit for purposes of calculating the sales charge.


(3)  After the first settlement date (March 25, 2013), you will pay accrued
interest from this date to your settlement date less interest
distributions.


(4)  This shows estimated expenses in the first year other than organization
costs. Organization costs are not deducted from interest income.


(5)  Your Trust assesses this fee per $1,000 principal amount of bonds. Your
Trust assesses other fees per Unit.


(6)  We base this amount on estimated cash flows per Unit. This amount will vary
with changes in expenses, interest rates and maturity, call or sale of
bonds. The Information Supplement includes the estimated cash flows.

Notes to Portfolio



(1)  The bonds are represented by "regular way" or "when issued" contracts for
the performance of which an irrevocable letter of credit, obtained from an
affiliate of the Trustee, has been deposited with the Trustee. Contracts to
acquire the bonds were entered into during the period from March 18, 2013
to March 20, 2013.


(2)  The Offering Price to Trust of the bonds is based on the offering side
valuation as of the opening of business on the Date of Deposit determined
by the Evaluator, a third party valuation provider, on the basis set forth
under "Public Offering--Unit Price" in Prospectus Part II. In accordance
with FASB Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC"), ASC 820, Fair Value
Measurements and Disclosures, the Trust's investments are classified as
Level 2, which refers to security prices determined using other significant
observable inputs. Observable inputs are inputs that other market
participants would use in pricing a security. These may include quoted
market prices for similar securities, interest rates, prepayment speeds and
credit risk. The cost of the bonds to the Sponsor for the Trust is
$6,556,226 and the Sponsor's profit or (loss) is $78,341.


The Sponsor may have entered into contracts which hedge interest rate
fluctuations on certain bonds. The cost of any such contracts and the
corresponding gain or loss as of the evaluation time of the bonds is
included in the Cost to Sponsor. Bonds marked by "##" following the
maturity date have been purchased on a "when, as and if issued" or "delayed
delivery" basis. Interest on these bonds begins accruing to the benefit of
Unitholders on their respective dates of delivery. Delivery is expected to
take place at various dates after the first settlement date.


"#" prior to the coupon rate indicates that the bond was issued at an
original issue discount. See "The Trusts--Risk Factors" in Prospectus Part

II. The tax effect of bonds issued at an original issue discount is
described in "Federal Tax Status" in Prospectus Part II.


(3)  "o" indicates that the rating is contingent upon receipt by the rating
agency of a policy of insurance obtained by the issuer of the bonds. "NR"
indicates that the rating service did not provide a rating for that bond.
For a brief description of the ratings see "Description of Ratings" in the
Information Supplement.


(4)  This is the year in which each bond is initially or currently callable and
the call price for that year. Each bond continues to be callable at
declining prices thereafter (but not below par value) except for original
issue discount bonds which are redeemable at prices based on the issue
price plus the amount of original issue discount accreted to redemption
date plus, if applicable, some premium, the amount of which will decline in
subsequent years. "S.F." indicates a sinking fund is established with
respect to an issue of bonds. The bonds may also be subject to redemption
without premium at any time pursuant to extraordinary optional or mandatory
redemptions if certain events occur. See "The Trusts--Risk Factors" in
Prospectus Part II.


Federal Tax Status--Exchange Option. The following sentence is added
immediately the first sentence under "Federal Tax Status--Exchange Option" in
Prospectus Part II:


"An exchange does not avoid a taxable disposition of your redeemed Units."


Federal Tax Status--Distributions. In both the second and third paragraphs
under "Federal Tax Status--Distributions" in Prospectus Part II, references to
"15%" are replaced with "20%".


The eleventh paragraph under "Federal Tax Status--Distributions" in
Prospectus Part II is replaced with the following:


"If a Trust declares dividends in October, November or December that are
payable to Unitholders of record on a date during those months, Unitholders
must take the dividends into account for tax purposes in the year the dividend
was declared, if the dividend is paid either in the year declared or in January
of the following year."


The last sentence of the fourteenth paragraph under "Federal Tax
Status--Distributions" in Prospectus Part II is replaced with the following:


"Distributions by a Trust reduce the net asset value of such Trust's Units,
and if a distribution reduces the net asset value below a Unitholder's cost
basis, such distribution, nevertheless, could be taxable to the Unitholder as
ordinary income or capital gain as described above, even though, from an
economic standpoint, it may constitute a partial return of capital."


Federal Tax Status--Sale or Redemption of Units. The third sentence under
"Federal Tax Status--Sale or Redemption of Units" in Prospectus Part II is
replaced with the following:


"Non-corporate Unitholders are currently subject to tax at a maximum federal
rate of 20% on capital gains resulting from the disposition of Units held for
more than 12 months (zero if the taxpayer is, and would be after accounting for
such gains, subject to a federal tax bracket for ordinary income of 25% or
less)."


Insurance on the Bonds. Any downgrade in the rating of an insurer of the
bonds in the Trust may result in a downgrade in the rating of the issuer of the
related bond and therefore may have a material adverse effect on the value of
the bonds in the Trust and the value of your Units. The following is a
description of the various bond insurers:


ACA Financial Guaranty Corporation ("ACA Financial Guaranty"). On December
15, 2008, Standard & Poor's Ratings Services ("S&P") withdrew the financial
strength, financial enhancement, and issuer credit ratings of ACA Financial
Guaranty.


Ambac Assurance Corporation ("Ambac"). On November 8, 2010, Ambac Financial
Group, Inc., the holding company of Ambac, announced that it has filed for a
voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy
Code (the "Bankruptcy Code") in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the
Southern District of New York (the "Bankruptcy Court"). Ambac Financial Group,
Inc. will continue to operate in the ordinary course of business as
"debtor-in-possession" under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in
accordance with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and the orders
of the Bankruptcy Court.


On November 30, 2010, S&P withdrew the counterparty credit, financial
strength, and financial enhancement ratings of Ambac at the company's request.
The November 30, 2010 rating action followed a directive by the Commissioner of
Insurance of the State of Wisconsin to Ambac to establish a segregated account
for certain insured exposure, primarily policies related to credit derivatives,
residential mortgage-backed securities, and other structured finance
transactions. On April 7, 2011, Moody's Investors Service, Inc. ("Moody's")
withdrew the insurance financial strength rating of Ambac Assurance.


Assured Guaranty Corp. ("Assured Guaranty") and Assured Guaranty Municipal
Corp. ("Assured Municipal") (formerly Financial Security Assurance, Inc.
("FSA")). On July 1, 2009, Assured Guaranty Ltd. ("Assured"), the parent
company of Assured Guaranty, completed the purchase of Financial Security
Assurance Holdings Ltd., the parent of financial guaranty insurance company,
FSA. Effective November 9, 2009, FSA was renamed "Assured Municipal." In
certain states, Assured Municipal may operate under its prior name. Assured
Municipal, a separately capitalized company, provides municipal bond insurance,
while Assured Guaranty provides financial guaranty insurance to both the
municipal and structured finance sectors.


On November 30, 2011 S&P lowered the counterparty credit and financial
strength ratings of both Assured Guaranty and Assured Municipal to AA- from
AA+, with a stable outlook. The November 30, 2011 downgrades reflect S&P's view
that Assured Guaranty and Assured Municipal do not maintain enough capital to
mitigate the largest obligor concentrations for a higher rating. On January 17,
2013, Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength ratings of Assured
Guaranty to A3 from Aa3 and of Assured Municipal to A2 from Aa3, both with a
stable outlook. The January 17, 2013 downgrade reflects Moody's reassessment of
the business franchise, expected future profitability and financial flexibility
of Assured Guaranty and Assured Municipal.


Build America Mutual Assurance Company ("BAM"). On July 23, 2012, S&P
assigned an initial rating of AA to BAM's financial strength and counterparty
credit ratings, with a stable outlook. These ratings based upon S&P's view that
BAM holds a very strong competitive position with low industry risk, along with
extremely strong capital adequacy and strong operating performance.


Berkshire Hathaway Assurance Corp. ("BHAC"). On April 8, 2009, Moody's
downgraded the insurance financial strength rating of BHAC from Aaa to Aa1,
with a stable outlook. This downgrade reflects Moody's view concerning "the
impact on Berkshire's key businesses of the severe decline in equity markets
over the past year as well as the protracted economic recession." On February
4, 2010, S&P lowered the financial strength rating of BHAC from AAA to AA+,
with a stable outlook, reflecting S&P's view that Berkshire's overall capital
adequacy has weakened to levels no longer consistent with a AAA rating and is
not expected to return to extremely strong levels in the near term.


CIFG Assurance North America, Inc. ("CIFG"). On November 11, 2009, Moody's
announced that it will withdraw the insurance financial strength rating of
CIFG. On February 16, 2010, S&P withdrew the counterparty credit, financial
strength, and financial enhancement ratings of CIFG.


Financial Guaranty Insurance Company ("FGIC"). On March 24, 2009, Moody's
withdrew the insurance financial strength rating of FGIC. On April 22, 2009,
S&P withdrew the counterparty credit, financial strength, and financial
enhancement ratings of FGIC.


On November 24, 2009, FGIC announced that pursuant to an order of the New
York Insurance Department, the company must suspend any and all claims payments
until it has removed the impairment of its capital and restored to compliance
its minimum surplus to policyholders requirement.


National Public Finance Guarantee Corporation ("National Guarantee")
(formerly MBIA Insurance Corp. of Illinois ("MBIA Illinois")). On February 18,
2009, MBIA, Inc., the parent company of MBIA Insurance Corporation ("MBIA
Corp."), announced the restructuring of its financial guaranty insurance
operations following the approval of the New York and Illinois insurance
regulators. The restructuring involves the segregation of its financial
guaranty insurance operations into two separately capitalized sister companies,
with MBIA Illinois assuming the risk associated with its US municipal
exposures, and with MBIA Corp. insuring the remainder of the portfolio,
including all international and structured finance exposures. Business recently
ceded to MBIA Corp. from FGIC has been assigned to MBIA Illinois. On March 19,
2009, MBIA Illinois formally changed its name to National Public Finance
Guarantee Corporation. National Guarantee is a wholly owned subsidiary of MBIA,
Inc. and independently capitalized with $5.6 billion in claims-paying resources
as of December 31, 2010. In certain states, National Guarantee may operate
under its prior name.


On July 24, 2009, Moody's confirmed National Guarantee's insurance financial
strength rating of Baa1, with a developing outlook. On December 22, 2010, S&P
lowered the counterparty credit, financial strength, and financial enhancement
ratings of National Guarantee to BBB from A, with a developing outlook.


Radian Asset Assurance, Inc. ("Radian"). On November 10, 2010, Moody's
confirmed Radian's Ba1 insurance financial strength rating, with a stable
outlook. On December 23, 2010, S&P confirmed Radian's BB- financial strength,
financial enhancement, and corporate credit ratings, with a negative outlook.


Syncora Guarantee Inc. ("Syncora Guarantee") (formerly XL Capital Assurance
Inc. ("XLCA")). On March 9, 2009, Moody's downgraded the insurance financial
strength rating of Syncora Guarantee from Caa1 to Ca, with a developing
outlook. On July 28, 2010, S&P withdrew the counterparty credit, financial
strength and financial enhancement ratings of Syncora Guarantee.

following amounts from the Sponsor, the sole and exclusive principal
underwriter. See "Public Offering--Sponsor and Underwriter Compensation" in

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm



To the Unitholders of Investors' Quality Tax-Exempt Trust, Series 178
(included in Invesco Unit Trusts, Municipal Series 1145):


We have audited the accompanying statement of condition including the
related portfolio of Investors' Quality Tax-Exempt Trust, Series 178 (included
in Invesco Unit Trusts, Municipal Series 1145) as of March 20, 2013. The
statement of condition is the responsibility of the Sponsor. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on such statement of condition based on our audit.


We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the statement of condition is free of material misstatement. The Trust is not
required to have, nor were we engaged to perform an audit of its internal
control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal
control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that
are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an
opinion on the effectiveness of the Trust's internal control over financial
reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the statement of condition, assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by the Sponsor, as well as evaluating the overall
statement of condition presentation. Our procedures included confirmation with
The Bank of New York Mellon, Trustee, of cash or an irrevocable letter of
credit deposited for the purchase of securities as shown in the statement of
condition as of March 20, 2013. We believe that our audit of the statement of
condition provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.


In our opinion, the statement of condition referred to above presents
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Investors' Quality
Tax-Exempt Trust, Series 178 (included in Invesco Unit Trusts, Municipal Series
1145) as of March 20, 2013, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America.

(1)  The value of the bonds is determined by Standard & Poor's Securities
Evaluations, Inc. on the bases set forth under "Public Offering--Unit
Price" in Prospectus Part II. The contracts to purchase bonds are
collateralized by an irrevocable letter of credit in an amount sufficient
to satisfy such contracts.


(2)  The Trustee will advance the amount of the net interest accrued to the
first settlement date to the Trust for distribution to the Sponsor as the
Unitholder of record as of such date.


(3)  A portion of the public offering price represents an amount of cash
sufficient to pay for all or a portion of the costs incurred in
establishing the Trust. The amount of these costs are set forth under
"Summary of Essential Financial Information--Expenses". A distribution will
be made as of the earlier of six months after the Date of Deposit or the
close of the initial offering period to an account maintained by the
Trustee from which the organization expense obligation of the investors
will be satisfied. To the extent that actual organization costs of the
Trust are greater than the estimated amount, only the estimated
organization costs added to the public offering price will be reimbursed to
the Sponsor and deducted from the net assets of the Trust.

THE TRUSTS





General. Your Trust is one of several unit investment trusts created under
the name Invesco Unit Trusts, Municipal Series. The Trusts were created under
the laws of the State of New York pursuant to a Trust Indenture and Agreement
(the "Trust Agreement"), dated the date of Prospectus Part I (the "Date of
Deposit") among Invesco Capital Markets, Inc. (formerly Van Kampen Funds Inc.)
as Sponsor, Invesco Investment Advisers LLC, as Supervisor, Standard & Poor's
Securities Evaluations, Inc., as Evaluator, and The Bank of New York Mellon, as
Trustee.


The Trusts are separate portfolios of interest-bearing obligations issued by
or on behalf of states and territories of the United States, and political
subdivisions and authorities thereof, the interest on which is, in the opinion
of recognized bond counsel to the issuing authorities, excludable from gross
income for Federal income tax purposes under existing law. All issuers of bonds
in a "State Trust" are located in the state for which the Trust is named or in
United States territories or possessions and their public authorities;
consequently, in the opinion of recognized bond counsel to the bond issuers, the
interest earned on the bonds is exempt to the extent indicated in Prospectus
Part I from state and local taxes. Further, in the opinion of bond counsel to
the respective issuers, the interest income of each bond in a U.S. Territorial
IM-IT Trust is exempt from state, Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and local income
taxation. With the exception of Kansas, Missouri, New York and Pennsylvania
Trusts, Units of a State Trust may be purchased only by residents of the state
for which the Trust is named. Units of a Kansas Trust may be purchased by
residents of Kansas and Missouri. Units of a Missouri Trust may be purchased by
residents of Missouri and Kansas. Units of a New York Trust may be purchased by
residents of New York, Connecticut, Florida and New Jersey. Units of a
Pennsylvania Trust may be purchased by residents of Pennsylvania, Connecticut,
Florida, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Ohio and West Virginia. Trusts that
hold only insured bonds are referred to herein as "Insured Trusts". "Long-Term
Trust" refers to IM-IT, Investment Grade Municipal, U.S. Territorial IM-IT, High
Grade Tax-Exempt Bond, 20+ Year Series, Long-Term State and National Quality
Trusts. "Investment Grade Municipal Intermediate Trust" refers to an Investment
Grade Municipal Trust which is designated as an "intermediate series" in the
name of such Trust. "IGMT 3-7 Year Series" refers to an Investment Grade
Municipal Trust which is designated as a "3-7 year series" in the name of such
Trust. "Intermediate-Term Trust" refers to Strategic Municipal Trust
Intermediate Series, State Intermediate Trusts, Investment Grade Municipal
Intermediate Trusts and State Intermediate Laddered Maturity Trusts. Trusts that
are named for a particular state are referred to herein as "State Trusts".
"State Intermediate Trust" refers to a State Trust which is designated as an
"intermediate series" in the name of such Trust. "State Intermediate Laddered
Maturity Trust" refers to a State Trust which is designated as an "intermediate
laddered maturity series" in the name of such Trust. State Trusts, other than
State Intermediate Laddered Maturity Trusts or State Intermediate Trusts, are
referred to herein as "Long-Term State Trusts". "Investment Grade Municipal
Limited Maturity Trust" refers to an Investment Grade Municipal Trust which is
designated as a "limited maturity series" in the name of such Trust.


On the Date of Deposit, the Sponsor deposited with the Trustee the aggregate
principal amount of bonds indicated in the "Summary of Essential Financial
Information" in Prospectus Part I. The bonds in a Trust initially consist of
delivery statements relating to contracts for their purchase and cash, cash
equivalents and/or irrevocable letters of credit issued by a financial
institution. Thereafter, the Trustee, in exchange for the bonds in a Trust,
delivered to the Sponsor evidence of ownership of the number of Units indicated
under "Summary of Essential Financial Information" in Prospectus Part I.


The following table sets forth the approximate range of maturities in years
from the Date of Deposit for bonds held in the indicated Trusts:








                                                                             Approximate Maturity
                                                                             From Date of Deposit
Trust                                                                              in Years

approximately 20% of the bonds will mature every five years, beginning in
approximately the tenth year of the Trust, entitling each Unitholder to return
of principal. The portfolio of any State Intermediate Laddered Maturity Trust
is generally structured so that approximately 20% of the bonds will mature each
year, beginning in approximately the fifth year of the Trust, entitling each
Unitholder to a return of principal. This return of principal may offer
Unitholders the opportunity to respond to changing economic conditions and to
specific financial needs that may arise during the periods of the scheduled
maturities. However, the flexibility provided by the return of principal may
also eliminate a Unitholder's ability to reinvest at a rate as high as the
yield on the bonds which matured.


Each Unit initially offered represents a fractional undivided interest in
the principal and net income of a Trust. To the extent that any Units are
redeemed by the Trustee, the fractional undivided interest in a Trust
represented by each Unit will increase, although the actual interest in the
Trust will remain unchanged. Units will remain outstanding until redeemed by
Unitholders or until the termination of the Trust Agreement.


Objectives and Bond Selection. The Trusts seek to preserve capital and to
provide federal tax-exempt income and, in the case of most State Trusts,
Federal and state tax-exempt income taxation. The Trusts invest in portfolios
of municipal bonds issued by or on behalf of states and territories of the
United States, and political subdivisions and authorities thereof, the interest
on which is, in the opinion of recognized bond counsel to the issuing
authorities, excludable from gross income for federal and, for State Trusts,
state personal income tax purposes under existing law. An IM-IT Laddered Series
has additional objectives of providing protection against changes in interest
rates and investment flexibility through an investment in a laddered portfolio
of interest-bearing obligations with maturities ranging from approximately 10
to 30 years in which roughly 20% of the bonds mature every five years beginning
in approximately the tenth year of the Trust. A State Intermediate Laddered
Maturity Trust has additional objectives of providing protection against
changes in interest rates and investment flexibility through an investment in a
laddered portfolio of intermediate-term interest-bearing obligations with
maturities ranging from approximately 5 to 10 years in which roughly 20% of the
bonds mature each year beginning in approximately the fifth year of the Trust.
There is, of course, no guarantee that any Trust will achieve its objectives. A
Trust may be an appropriate investment vehicle for investors who desire to
participate in a portfolio of tax-exempt fixed income bonds with greater
diversification than they might be able to acquire individually.

Diversification of a Trust's assets will not eliminate the risk of loss always
inherent in the ownership of bonds. Insurance guaranteeing the timely payment,
when due, of all principal and interest on the bonds in each Insured Trust has
been obtained from municipal bond insurance companies. For information relating
to insurance on the bonds, see "Insurance on the Bonds in the Insured Trusts".


In selecting bonds for a Trust, the Sponsor considered the following factors,
among others: (a) as of the Date of Deposit, the bonds are rated by at least one
nationally recognized statistical rating organization in the category described
in Prospectus Part I for the particular Trust or, if not rated, have credit
characteristics sufficiently similar to those of comparable bonds that were so
rated as to be acceptable for acquisition by such Trust in the opinion of the
Sponsor, (b) the prices of the bonds relative to other bonds of comparable
quality and maturity, (c) the current income provided by the bonds, (d) the
diversification of bonds as to purpose of issue and location of issuer and (e)
the probability of early return of principal or high legal or event risk. After
the Date of Deposit, a bond may cease to be rated or its rating may be reduced
below the minimum required as of the Date of Deposit. Neither event requires
elimination of a bond from a Trust but may be considered in the Sponsor's
determination as to whether or not to direct the Trustee to dispose of the bond
(see "Trust Administration--Portfolio Administration").


The Bonds. Your Trust invests in municipal bonds. States, municipalities and
public authorities issue these bonds to raise money for a variety of purposes.
In selecting bonds, the Sponsor seeks to diversify your portfolio by type of
bond purpose. This section briefly describes different bond types to help you
better understand your investment. The types of bonds and percentages they
represent in your portfolio are listed in Prospectus Part I. These bonds are
also described in greater detail in the Information Supplement.


General Obligation Bonds and Revenue Bonds. General obligation bonds are
backed by the general taxing power of the issuer. The issuer secures these
bonds by pledging its faith, credit and unlimited taxing power for the payment
of principal and interest. All other bonds in the Trusts are revenue bonds.


Revenue bonds are payable only from the revenue of a specific project or
authority. They are not supported by the issuer's general power to levy taxes.
The risk of default in payment of interest or principal increases if the income
of the related project falters because that income is the only source of
payment. All of the following bonds are revenue bonds.


Airport bonds are obligations of issuers that own and operate airports. The
ability of the issuer to make payments on these bonds primarily depends on the
ability of airlines to meet their obligations under use agreements. Due to
increased competition, deregulation, increased fuel costs and other factors,
some airlines may have difficulty meeting these obligations.


Bond banks are vehicles that pool various municipal obligations into larger
offerings. This reduces the cost of borrowing for the municipalities. The types
of financing projects that these obligations support vary.


Certificates of participation are generally a type of municipal lease
obligation. Lease payments of a governmental entity secure payments on these
bonds. These payments depend on the governmental entity budgeting
appropriations for the lease payments. A governmental body cannot obligate
future governments to appropriate for or make lease payments, but governments
typically promise to take action necessary to include lease payments in their
budgets. If a government fails to budget for or make lease payments, sufficient
funds may not exist to pay interest or principal on these bonds.


Health care bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenue from
hospitals and hospital systems. The ability of these issuers to make payments
on bonds depends on factors such as facility occupancy levels, demand for
services, competition resulting from hospital mergers and affiliations, the
need to reduce costs, government regulation, costs of malpractice insurance and
claims, and government financial assistance (such as Medicare and Medicaid).


Higher education bonds are obligations of issuers that operate universities
and colleges. These issuers derive revenues from tuition, dormitories, grants
and endowments. These issuers face problems related to declines in the number
of college-age individuals, possible inability to raise tuitions and fees,
uncertainty of continued federal grants, state funding or donations, and
government legislation or regulation.


Industrial revenue bonds finance the cost of acquiring, building or
improving industrial projects. Private corporations usually operate these
projects. The ability of the issuer to make payments on these bonds depends on
factors such as the creditworthiness of the corporation operating the project,
revenues generated by the project, expenses of the project and environmental or
other regulatory restrictions.


Multi-family housing bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues
from mortgage loans on multiple family residences, retirement housing or
housing projects for low to moderate-income families. These bonds are generally
pre-payable at any time. It is likely that their life will be less than their
stated maturity. The ability of these issuers to make payments on bonds depends
on such factors as rental income, occupancy levels, operating expenses,
mortgage default rates, taxes, government regulations and appropriation of
subsidies.


Other care bonds include obligations of issuers that derive revenue from
mental health facilities, nursing homes and intermediate care facilities. These
bonds are similar to health care bonds and the issuers face the same general
risks.


Public building bonds finance the cost of acquiring, leasing, building or
improving public buildings such as offices, recreation facilities, convention
centers, police stations, correctional institutions and parking garages. The
ability of the issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on factors such
as the government budgeting sufficient funds to make lease or mortgage payments
on the facility, user fees or rents, costs of maintenance and decreases in use
of the facility.


Public education bonds are obligations of issuers that operate primary and
secondary schools. The ability of these issuers to make payments on these bonds
depends primarily on ad valorem taxes. These issuers may also face problems
related to litigation contesting state constitutionality of public education
financing.


Retail electric/gas/telephone bonds are obligations of issuers that derive
revenues from the retail sale of utilities to customers. The ability of these
issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on factors such as the rates
and demand for these utilities, competition, government regulation and rate
approvals, overhead expenses and the cost of fuels.


Single family housing bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues
from mortgage loans on single family residences. Single family residences
generally include one to four-family dwellings. These bonds are similar to
multi-family housing bonds and the issuers face the same general risks.


Tax district bonds are obligations secured by a pledge of taxing power by a
municipality, such as tax increment financing or tax allocation bonds. These
bonds are similar to general obligation bonds. Unlike general obligation bonds,
however, the municipality does not pledge its unlimited taxing power to pay
these bonds. Instead, the municipality pledges revenues from a specific tax to
pay these bonds. If the tax cannot support payment of interest and principal, a
municipality may need to raise the related tax to pay these bonds. An inability
to raise the tax could have an adverse affect on these bonds.


Transportation bonds are obligations of issuers that own and operate public
transit systems, ports, highways, turnpikes, bridges and other transportation
systems. The ability of these issuers to make payments on these bonds depends
on variations in use, the degree of government subsidization, competition from
other forms of transportation and increased costs. Port authorities derive
revenues primarily from fees imposed on ships using the port facilities. These
fees can fluctuate depending on the local economy and competition from air,
rail and truck transportation. Increased fuel costs, alternative transportation
modes and competition from toll-free bridges and roads will impact revenues of
issuers that operate bridges, roads or tunnels.


Waste disposal bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from
resource recovery facilities. These facilities process solid waste, generate
steam and convert steam to electricity. These issuers face problems such as
costs and delays due to environmental concerns, effects of conservation and
recycling, destruction or condemnation of a project, void or unenforceable
contracts, changes in the economic availability of raw materials, operating
supplies or facilities, and other unavoidable changes that adversely affect
operation of a project.


Water and sewer bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from
user fees from the sale of water and sewerage services. These issuers face
problems such as the ability to obtain rate increases, population declines,
difficulties in obtaining new fresh water supplies and "no-growth" zoning
ordinances. These issuers also face many of the same problems of waste disposal
issuers.


Wholesale electric bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues
from selling electricity to other utilities. The ability of these issuers to
make payments on these bonds depends on factors such as the rates and demand
for electric utilities, competition, overhead expenses and government
regulation and rate approvals.


More About the Bonds. In addition to describing the purpose of the bonds,
other information about the bonds is also included in the "Portfolio" and notes
thereto in Prospectus Part I. This information relates to other characteristics
of the bonds. This section briefly describes some of these characteristics.


Original issue discount bonds were initially issued at a price below their
face (or par) value. These bonds typically pay a lower interest rate than
comparable bonds that were issued at or above their par value. In a stable
interest rate environment, the market value of these bonds tends to increase
more slowly in early years and in greater increments as the bonds approach
maturity. The issuers of these bonds may be able to call or redeem a bond
before its stated maturity date and at a price less than the bond's par value.


Zero coupon bonds are a type of original issue discount bond. These bonds do
not pay any current interest during their life. If an investor owns this type
of bond, the investor has the right to receive a final payment of the bond's
par value at maturity. The price of these bonds often fluctuates greatly during
periods of changing market interest rates compared to bonds that make current
interest payments. The issuers of these bonds may be able to call or redeem a
bond before its stated maturity date and at a price less than the bond's par
value.


"When, as and if issued" bonds are bonds that trade before they are actually
issued. This means that the Sponsor can only deliver them to your Trust "when,
as and if" the bonds are actually issued. Delivery of these bonds may be
delayed or may not occur. Interest on these bonds does not begin accruing to
your Trust until the Sponsor delivers the bond to the Trust. You may have to
adjust your tax basis if the Sponsor delivers any of these bonds after the
expected delivery date. Any adjustment would reflect interest that accrued
between the time you purchased your Units and the delivery of the bonds to your
Trust. This could lower your first year estimated current return. You may
experience gains or losses on these bonds from the time you purchase Units even
though your Trust has not yet received them.


In order to acquire certain bonds, it may be necessary for the Sponsor or
Trustee to pay amounts covering accrued interest on the bonds which exceed the
amounts which will be made available through cash furnished by the Sponsor on
the Date of Deposit. This cash may exceed the interest which would accrue to
the First Settlement Date. The Trustee has agreed to pay for any amounts
necessary to cover any excess and will be reimbursed when funds become
available from interest payments on the related bonds. Also, since interest on
any "when, as and if issued" bonds does not begin accruing as tax-exempt
interest income to the benefit of Unitholders until the date of delivery, the
Trustee may reduce its fee and pay Trust expenses in order to maintain or
approach the same estimated net annual interest income during the first year of
the Trust's operations as described under "Summary of Essential Financial
Information" in Prospectus Part I.


Municipal Bond Risk Factors. All investments involve risk. This section
describes the main risks that can impact the value of bonds in your Trust. You
should understand these risks before you invest. If the value of the bonds
falls, the value of your Units will also fall. You can lose money by investing
in a Trust. No one can guarantee that your Trust will achieve its objective or
that your investment return will be positive over any period. The Information
Supplement contains a more detailed discussion of risks related to your
investment.


Current economic conditions. The markets for credit instruments, including
corporate bonds and municipal securities, have experienced periods of extreme
illiquidity and volatility since the latter half of 2007. The current economic
environment has made conditions difficult for virtually all industries and
companies to operate in an efficient manner. General market uncertainty and
consequent repricing risk have led to market imbalances of sellers and buyers,
which in turn have resulted in significant valuation uncertainties in a variety
of debt securities. These conditions resulted, and in many cases continue to
result in, greater volatility, less liquidity, widening credit spreads and a
lack of price transparency, with many debt securities remaining illiquid and of
uncertain value. These market conditions may make valuation of some of the
Trust's bonds uncertain and/or result in sudden and significant valuation
increases or declines in its holdings.


Market risk is the risk that the value of the bonds in your Trust will
fluctuate. This could cause the value of your Units to fall below your original
purchase price or below the par value. Market value fluctuates in response to
various factors. These can include changes in interest rates, inflation, the
financial condition of a bond's issuer or insurer, perceptions of the issuer or
insurer, or ratings on a bond. Even though the Supervisor supervises your
portfolio, you should remember that no one manages your portfolio. Your Trust
will not sell a bond solely because the market value falls as is possible in a
managed fund.


Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of bonds will fall if interest
rates increase. Bonds typically fall in value when interest rates rise and rise
in value when interest rates fall. Bonds with longer periods before maturity
are often more sensitive to interest rate changes.


Credit risk is the risk that a bond's issuer or insurer is unable to meet
its obligation to pay principal or interest on the bond.


Call risk is the risk that the issuer prepays or "calls" a bond before its
stated maturity. An issuer might call a bond if interest rates fall and the
bond pays a higher interest rate or if it no longer needs the money for the
original purpose. If an issuer calls a bond, your Trust will distribute the
principal to you but your future interest distributions will fall. You might
not be able to reinvest this principal at as high a yield. A bond's call price
could be less than the price your Trust paid for the bond and could be below
the bond's par value. This means that you could receive less than the amount
you paid for your Units. If enough bonds in your Trust are called, your Trust
could terminate early. The first date that the issuer can call each bond is
listed in the "Portfolio" in Prospectus Part I along with the price the issuer
would have to pay. Some or all of the bonds may also be subject to
extraordinary optional or mandatory redemptions if certain events occur, such
as certain changes in tax laws, the substantial damage or destruction by fire
or other casualty of the project for which the proceeds of the bonds were used,
and various other events. The call provisions are described in general terms in
the "Redemption Feature" column of the "Portfolio" section in Prospectus Part
I, and the notes thereto. Additional discussion of call provisions appears in
the Information Supplement.


Bond quality risk is the risk that a bond will fall in value if a rating
agency decreases the bond's rating.


Bond concentration risk is the risk that your Trust is less diversified
because it concentrates in a particular type of bond. When a certain type of
bond makes up 25% or more of a Trust, the Trust is considered to be
"concentrated" in that bond type. The different bond types are described under
"The Bonds".


Reduced diversification risk is the risk that your Trust will become smaller
and less diversified as bonds are sold, are called or mature. This could
increase your risk of loss and increase your share of Trust expenses.


Insurer default risk is the risk that an investor of an insured trust could
lose income and/or principal if the issuer and the insurer of a municipal bond
both default in making their payment obligations.


Liquidity risk is the risk that the value of a bond will fall if trading in
the bond is limited or absent. No one can guarantee that a liquid trading
market will exist for any bond because these bonds generally trade in the
over-the-counter market (they are not listed on a securities exchange).


Litigation and legislation risk is the risk that future litigation or
legislation could affect the value of your Trust. For example, future
legislation could reduce tax rates, impose a flat tax, exempt all investment
income from tax or change the tax status of the bonds. Litigation could
challenge an issuer's authority to issue or make payments on bonds.


State Risk Factors. Your Trust may invest significantly in tax-exempt
municipal bonds of issuers from a particular state. The financial condition of
a state may be affected by various national, economic, social and environmental
policies and conditions. Additionally, limitations imposed by constitutional
amendments, legislative measures, or voter initiatives on a state and its local
governments concerning taxes, bond indebtedness and other matters may constrain
the revenue-generating capacity of the state and its local governments and,
therefore, the ability of the issuers of the bonds to satisfy their
obligations.


The economic vitality of a state and its various regions and, therefore, the
ability of the state and its local governments to satisfy the bonds, are
affected by numerous factors, such as natural disasters, complications with
exports and industry deregulation.


A state may be a party to numerous lawsuits in which an adverse final
decision could materially affect the state's governmental operations and
consequently its ability to pay debt service on its obligations.


No FDIC Guarantee. An investment in your Trust is not a deposit of any bank
and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
or any other government agency.



ESTIMATED CURRENT AND LONG-TERM RETURNS





The Estimated Current Return and the Estimated Long-Term Return as of the
Date of Deposit are set forth on the cover of the Prospectus Part I. Estimated
Current Return is calculated by dividing the estimated net annual interest
income per Unit by the Public Offering Price. The estimated net annual interest
income per Unit will vary with changes in fees and expenses of the Trust and
with the principal prepayment, default (if any), redemption, maturity, exchange
or sale of bonds. The Public Offering Price will vary with changes in the price
of the bonds. Accordingly, there is no assurance that the present Estimated
Current Return will be realized in the future. Estimated Long-Term Return is
calculated using a formula which (1) takes into consideration, and determines
and factors in the relative weightings of, the market values, yields (which
takes into account the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts)
and estimated retirements of the bonds and (2) takes into account the expenses
and sales charge associated with Units. Since the value and estimated
retirements of the bonds and the expenses of a Trust will change, there is no
assurance that the present Estimated Long-Term Return will be realized in the
future. The Estimated Current Return and Estimated Long-Term Return are
expected to differ because the calculation of Estimated Long-Term Return
reflects the estimated dates and amounts of principal returned on the bonds
while the Estimated Current Return calculation includes only net annual
interest income and Public Offering Price.



PUBLIC OFFERING





General. Units are offered at the Public Offering Price. During the initial
offering period the Public Offering Price is based on the aggregate offering
price of the bonds, the sales charge described below, cash, if any, in the
Principal Account (including cash to pay organization costs) and accrued
interest, if any. Organization costs are not included in the Public Offering
Price per Unit for purposes of calculating the sales charge.


If you purchase Units during the initial offering period of a Trust with a
deferred sales charge, your sales charge will consist of (i) an initial sales
charge paid upon the purchase of your Units and (ii) the remaining deferred
sales charge, which consists of a fixed dollar amount per Unit paid in
installments on specified deferred sales charge payment dates. In no event will
your combined initial sales charge and deferred sales charge exceed the maximum
percentage sales charge for the applicable Trust as set forth above. For more
details, including the specific amount and method of calculation of the initial
and deferred sales charge, for those Trusts which offer a deferred sales
charge, see the "Fee Table" in Prospectus Part I of the applicable Trust.


After the initial public offering period, the secondary market Public
Offering Price is based on the bid prices of the bonds, the sales charge
described below, cash, if any, in the Principal Account and accrued interest,
if any. The actual sales charge that may be paid by an investor may differ
slightly from the sales charges shown herein due to rounding that occurs in the
calculation of the Public Offering Price and in the number of Units purchased.
The minimum purchase in the primary and secondary market is one Unit. Certain
broker-dealers or selling firms may charge an order handling fee for processing
Unit purchases.


The maximum initial offering period sales charges are as follows:








                                                                            Initial Offering Period Sales Charge
                                                                                         as Percent of
                                                                            ------------------------------------

The maximum secondary market sales charge is computed as described in the
following table based upon the estimated long-term return life in years ("ELTR
Life") of a Trust's portfolio:








 ELTR Life (Years)    Sales Charge    ELTR Life (Years)     Sales Charge    ELTR Life (Years)     Sales Charge
------------------    ------------   -------------------    ------------   -------------------    ------------
Less than 2 .........    1.00%      8 but less than 9 .....    3.50%      15 but less than 16 ...    4.80%
2 but less than 3 ...    1.50       9 but less than 10 ....    4.00       16 but less than 17 ...    4.90
3 but less than 4 ...    2.00       10 but less than 11 ...    4.20       17 but less than 18 ...    5.00

5 but less than 6 ...    2.50       12 but less than 13 ...    4.50       19 but less than 20 ...    5.20
6 but less than 7 ...    2.75       13 but less than 14 ...    4.60       20 but less than 21 ...    5.30
7 but less than 8 ...    3.00       14 but less than 15 ...    4.70       21 and over ...........    5.40








The ELTR Life represents the estimated life of the bonds in a Trust's
portfolio as determined for purposes of calculating Estimated Long-Term Return.
See "Estimated Current and Long-Term Returns". The sales charges in the above
table are expressed as a percentage of the secondary market Public Offering
Price per Unit. For example, the maximum secondary market sales charge for a
Trust with an ELTR Life of "9 but less than 10" years would be 4.00% of the
Public Offering Price per Unit (4.167% of the aggregate bid price of the
bonds).


If you purchase Units in the secondary market of a Trust with a deferred
sales charge, your maximum sales charge will be based on the remaining ELTR
Life of the Trust as described above and will consist of an initial sales
charge and the remaining deferred sales charge, if any. If the secondary market
Units are purchased prior to the final deferred sales charge payment date, the
initial sales charge, which you pay at the time of purchase, is the difference
between the secondary market sales charge based on the ELTR Life listed above
and the maximum remaining deferred sales charge. If you purchase Units after
the last deferred sales charge payment has been assessed, your maximum sales
charge will consist of the one time initial sales charge based on the ELTR
Life.


Reducing Your Sales Charge. The Sponsor offers a variety of ways for you to
reduce the sales charge that you pay. It is your financial professional's
responsibility to alert the Sponsor of any discount when you purchase Units.
Before you purchase Units you must also inform your broker-dealer of your
qualification for any discount or of any combined purchases to be eligible for
a reduced sales charge. You may not combine discounts.


For Trusts with a deferred sales charge, these charges are fixed dollar
amounts per Unit, and your Trust must charge these amounts per Unit regardless
of any discounts. However, if you are eligible to receive a discount such that
your total sales charge is less than the fixed dollar amounts of the deferred
sales charges, you will receive a credit equal to the difference between your
total sales charge and these fixed dollar charges at the time you buy Units.


Large Quantity Purchases. You can reduce your sales charge by increasing the
size of your investment. If you purchase the amount of Units shown in the table
below during the initial offering period, your sales charge will be as
follows:








                                                Sales Charge Reduction Per Unit

Except as described below, these quantity discount levels apply only to
purchases of a single Trust made by the same person on a single day from a
single broker-dealer. We also apply the different purchase levels on a dollar
basis using a $1,000 Unit equivalent. For example, if you purchase between
$250,000 and $499,999, your sales charge discount per Unit for an IM-IT will
be $6.


Aggregated Purchases--For purposes of achieving these levels you may combine
purchases of Units of a Trust offered in this prospectus with purchases of units
of any other Invesco-sponsored unit investment trusts in the initial offering
period (including other Trusts offered in this prospectus) which are not already
subject to a reduced sales charge. In addition, Units purchased in the name of
your spouse or children under 21 living in the same household as you will be
deemed to be additional purchases by you for the purposes of calculating the
applicable quantity discount level. The reduced sales charge levels will also be
applicable to a trustee or other fiduciary purchasing Units for a single trust,
estate (including multiple trusts created under a single estate) or fiduciary
account. To be eligible for aggregation as described in this paragraph, all
purchases must be made on the same day through a single broker-dealer or selling
agent. You must inform your broker-dealer of any combined purchases before your
purchase to be eligible for a reduced sales charge.


Fee Accounts. A portion of the sales charge is waived for certain accounts
described in this paragraph. Purchases by these accounts are subject only to
the portion of the sales charge that is retained by the Sponsor. Please refer
to the section called "Fee Accounts" for additional information on these
purchases. Units may be purchased in the initial offering period at the Public
Offering Price less the maximum applicable concession the Sponsor typically
allows to brokers and dealers (either non-Underwriter or Underwriter
concession, whichever is greater) for purchases by investors who purchase Units
through registered investment advisers, certified financial planners and
registered broker-dealers who in each case either charge periodic fees for
brokerage services, financial planning, investment advisory or asset management
services, or provide such services in connection with the establishment of an
investment account for which a comprehensive "wrap fee" charge ("Wrap Fee") is
imposed ("Fee Accounts") if the Units are purchased for a Fee Account and the
Trust is subject to a Wrap Fee (i.e. the Trust is "Wrap Fee Eligible"). For
example, with respect to a Long-Term Trust such as IM-IT, Wrap Fee Eligible
purchasers would pay $9 per Unit, which represents the maximum sales charge of
$49 per Unit minus the maximum applicable concession of $40 per Unit. The
Sponsor reserves the right to limit or deny purchases of Units described in
this paragraph by investors or selling firms whose frequent trading activity is
determined to be detrimental to a Trust.


Exchanges. During the initial offering period of a Trust, unitholders of any
Invesco-sponsored unit investment trust and unitholders of unaffiliated unit
investment trusts may utilize their redemption or termination proceeds from such
a trust to purchase Units of a Trust offered in this prospectus at a reduced
sales charge. The sales charge will be reduced by $14.00 per Unit for IM-IT,
Investment Grade Municipal, IM-IT Discount, U.S. Territorial IM-IT, High Grade
Tax-Exempt Bond, 20+ Year Series, Long-Term State and National Quality Trusts,
by $9.00 per Unit for IM-IT Limited Maturity, QM-IT Limited Maturity Series,
Investment Grade Municipal Limited Maturity Trusts, IM-IT Laddered Series and
Intermediate-Term Trusts and by $4.50 per Unit for IGMT 3-7 Year Series. In
order to be eligible for the sales charge discounts applicable to Unit purchases
made with redemption or termination proceeds from other unit investment trusts,
the termination or redemption proceeds used to purchase Units of the Trust must
be derived from a transaction that occurred within 30 days of your Unit
purchase. In addition, the discounts will only be available for investors that
utilize the same broker-dealer (or a different broker-dealer with appropriate
notification) for both the Unit purchase and the transaction resulting in the
receipt of the termination or redemption proceeds used for the Unit purchase.
You may be required to provide appropriate documentation or other information to
your broker-dealer to evidence your eligibility for these reduced sales charge
discounts. An exchange does not avoid a taxable event on the redemption or
termination of an interest in a Trust.


Employees. Employees, officers and directors (including their spouses and
children under 21 living in the same household, and trustees, custodians or
fiduciaries for the benefit of such persons (collectively referred to herein as
"related purchasers")) of Invesco Capital Markets, Inc. and its affiliates and,
when permitted, Underwriters and their affiliates may purchase Units at the
Public Offering Price less the applicable underwriting commission or less the
applicable dealer concession in the absence of an underwriting commission.
Employees, officers and directors (including related purchasers) of dealers and
their affiliates may purchase Units at the Public Offering Price less the
applicable dealer concession. All employee discounts are subject to the policies
of the related selling firm. Only employees, officers and directors of companies
that allow their employees to participate in this employee discount program are
eligible for the discounts.


Unit Price. The Public Offering Price of Units will vary from the amounts
stated under "Summary of Essential Financial Information" in Prospectus Part I
in accordance with fluctuations in the prices of the bonds. The price of Units
as of the opening of business on the Date of Deposit was determined by adding
the applicable sales charge and organization costs to the aggregate offering
price of the bonds and dividing the sum by the number of Units outstanding. This
price determination was made on the basis of an evaluation of the bonds prepared
by the Evaluator. During the initial offering period, the Evaluator will value
the bonds as of the Evaluation Time on days the New York Stock Exchange is open
for business and will adjust the Public Offering Price of Units accordingly. The
"Evaluation Time" is the close of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange
on each day that the Exchange is open for trading, or earlier on days where the
Bond Market Association recommends an early bond market close, provided,
however, on the Date of Deposit the "Evaluation Time" will be the close of
regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange or the time the registration
statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") becomes
effective, if later. The secondary market Public Offering Price per Unit will be
equal to the aggregate bid price of the bonds plus the applicable secondary
market sales charge and dividing the sum by the number of Units outstanding. For
secondary market purposes, this computation will be made by the Evaluator as of
the Evaluation Time for each day on which any Unit is tendered for redemption
and as necessary. The offering price of bonds may be expected to range
approximately from 0.125% to 1.375% more than the bid price.


The Public Offering Price per Unit will be effective for all orders received
prior to the Evaluation Time on each business day. Orders received by the
Sponsor prior to the Evaluation Time and orders received by authorized
financial professionals prior to the Evaluation Time that are properly
transmitted to the Sponsor by the time designated by the Sponsor, are priced
based on the date of receipt. Orders received by the Sponsor after the
Evaluation Time, and orders received by authorized financial professionals
after the Evaluation Time or orders received by such persons that are not
transmitted to the Sponsor until after the time designated by the Sponsor, are
priced based on the date of the next determined Public Offering Price per Unit
provided they are received timely by the Sponsor on such date. It is the
responsibility of authorized financial professionals to transmit orders
received by them to the Sponsor so they will be received in a timely manner.


The aggregate price of the bonds is determined on the basis of bid prices or
offering prices, as is appropriate, (a) on the basis of current market prices
obtained from dealers or brokers who customarily deal in bonds comparable to
those held by the Trusts; (b) if these prices are not available, on the basis
of current market prices for comparable bonds; (c) by causing the value of the
bonds to be determined by others engaged in the practice of evaluation, quoting
or appraising comparable bonds; or (d) by any combination of the above. Market
prices of the bonds will generally fluctuate with changes in market interest
rates.


A person will become the owner of Units on the date of settlement provided
payment has been received. Cash, if any, made available to the Sponsor prior to
the date of settlement for the purchase of Units may be used in the Sponsor's
business and may be deemed to be a benefit to the Sponsor, subject to the
limitations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.


Organization Costs. During the initial offering period, part of the Public
Offering Price represents an amount of cash deposited to pay the estimated
costs incurred in establishing your Trust. These costs include the costs of
preparing documents relating to the Trust (such as the registration statement,
prospectus, trust agreement and legal documents), federal and state
registration fees, the initial fees and expenses of the Trustee and the initial
audit. Your Trust will reimburse us for these costs at the end of the initial
offering period or after six months, if earlier. The value of your Units will
decline when the Trust deducts these costs from the Trust assets.


Accrued Interest. Accrued interest is an accumulation of unpaid interest on
securities which generally is paid by the bonds semi-annually, although each
Trust accrues interest daily. Because of this, a Trust always has an amount of
interest earned but not yet collected by the Trustee. For this reason, with
respect to sales settling after the First Settlement Date, the proportionate
share of accrued interest to the settlement date is added to the Public Offering
Price of Units. You will receive the amount of accrued interest paid on your
Units on the next distribution date. In an effort to reduce the accrued interest
which would have to be paid by Unitholders, the Trustee will advance the amount
of accrued interest to the Sponsor as the Unitholder of record as of the First
Settlement Date. Consequently, the accrued interest added to the Public Offering
Price of Units will include only accrued interest from the First Settlement Date
to the date of settlement, less any distributions from the Interest Account
after the First Settlement Date. Because of the varying interest payment dates
of the bonds, accrued interest at any point in time will be greater than the
amount of interest actually received by a Trust and distributed to Unitholders.
If you sell or redeem all or a portion of your Units, you will be entitled to
receive your proportionate share of the accrued interest from the purchaser of
your Units.


Unit Distribution. Units will be distributed to the public by Underwriters,
broker-dealers and others at the Public Offering Price, plus accrued interest.
The Sponsor intends to qualify Units for sale in a number of states. During the
initial offering period, the Sponsor and Underwriters will sell Units to
non-Underwriter broker-dealers and selling agents at the Public Offering Price
(net of any sales charge discount) less the concession or agency commission
described in the following sections.


IGMT 3-7 Year Series. During the initial offering period, the Sponsor will
sell Units of IGMT 3-7 Year Series to non-Underwriter broker-dealers and
selling agents at the Public Offering Price (net of any sales charge discount)
less the gross concession or agency commission set forth in the following
table.

investment trusts who use their redemption or termination proceeds to purchase
Units of a Trust, the regular concession or agency commission allowed by the
Sponsor to broker-dealers and other selling agents will equal $8 per Unit for
an IGMT 3-7 Year Series.


Underwriters other than the Sponsor will sell Units to other broker-dealers

investment trusts who use their redemption or termination proceeds to purchase
Units of a Trust, the regular concession or agency commission allowed by the
Sponsor to broker-dealers and other selling agents will equal $15 per Unit for
an Intermediate-Term Trust.


Underwriters other than the Sponsor will sell Units to other broker-dealers
and selling agents at the Public Offering Price less a concession or agency
commission not in excess of the concession allowed to the Underwriter by the
Sponsor as described under "Sponsor and Underwriter Compensation" below.


IM-IT Laddered Series, QM-IT Limited Maturity Series, Investment Grade
Municipal Limited Maturity Trusts and IM-IT Limited Maturity Trusts. During the
initial offering period, the Sponsor will sell Units of IM-IT Laddered Series,
QM-IT Limited Maturity Series, Investment Grade Municipal Limited Maturity
Trusts, or IM-IT Limited Maturity Trusts to non-Underwriter broker-dealers and
selling agents at the Public Offering Price (net of any sales charge discount)

investment trusts who use their redemption or termination proceeds to purchase
Units of an IM-IT Laddered Series, QM-IT Limited Maturity Series, Investment
Grade Municipal Limited Maturity Trust, or IM-IT Limited Maturity Trust, the
regular concession or agency commission allowed by the Sponsor to
broker-dealers and other selling agents will equal $22 per Unit for the Trust.

and selling agents at the Public Offering Price less a concession or agency
commission not in excess of the concession allowed to the Underwriter by the
Sponsor as described under "Sponsor and Underwriter Compensation" below.


Long-Term and IM-IT Discount Trusts. During the initial offering period, the
Sponsor will sell Units of Long-Term and IM-IT Discount Trusts to
non-Underwriter broker-dealers and selling agents at the Public Offering Price
(net of any sales charge discount) less the gross concession or agency
commission set forth in the following table.

                           or Agency

3,000 Units - 4,999 Units      16
5,000 Units or more            10








For initial offering period transactions involving unitholders of other unit
investment trusts who use their redemption or termination proceeds to purchase
Units of a Trust, the regular concession or agency commission allowed by the
Sponsor to broker-dealers and other selling agents will equal $25 per Unit for
a Long-Term Trust.


Underwriters other than the Sponsor will sell Units to other broker-dealers
and selling agents at the Public Offering Price less a concession or agency
commission not in excess of the concession allowed to the Underwriter by the
Sponsor as described under "Sponsor and Underwriter Compensation" below.


General. The breakpoint concessions or agency commissions above are also
applied on a dollar basis utilizing a breakpoint equivalent of $1,000 per Unit
and will be applied on whichever basis is more favorable to the distributor. The
breakpoints above will be adjusted to take into consideration purchase orders
stated in dollars which cannot be completely fulfilled due to the requirement
that only whole Units be issued.


Notwithstanding the preceding tables, non-Underwriter broker-dealers and
other selling agents that purchase 250 or more Units of a Trust from the Sponsor
on the Date of Deposit ("Qualifying Broker-Dealers") will be allowed a
concession or agency commission on such Units equal to the regular concession
allowed to Underwriters described under "Sponsor and Underwriter Compensation"
below. In addition, Qualifying Broker-Dealers will be allowed a concession or
agency commission equal to the dollar amount of the first level of underwriter
concession set forth for the appropriate Trust under "Sponsor and Underwriter
Compensation" below (for example $31 per Unit for an IM-IT Laddered Series or
$35 per Unit for a Long-Term Trust) on subsequent Unit purchases from the
Sponsor throughout the remainder of the initial offering period of a Trust,
provided, however, that a Qualifying Broker-Dealer will be allowed a concession
or agency commission equal to the concession or agency commission allowed to
such firm on the Date of Deposit for subsequent purchases on a single day equal
to the lesser of (a) 1,000 Units of a Trust (or all remaining Units if the
Sponsor has less than 1,000 unsold Units available for sale) or (b) the number
of Units of a Trust purchased on the Date of Deposit.


In addition to the concession or agency commission and rebates described in
the sections above, all broker-dealers and other selling firms (including
Underwriters) will be eligible to receive additional compensation based on total
initial offering period sales of all eligible Invesco unit investment trusts
during a Quarterly Period as set forth in the following table:








                                      Additional
Initial Offering Period Sales           Volume
During Quarterly Period               Concession
------------------------------------  ----------
$2 million but less than $5 million     0.025%
$5 million but less than $10 million    0.050
$10 million but less than $50 million   0.075
$50 million or more                     0.100








"Quarterly Period" means the following periods: January -- March; April --
June; July -- September; and October --December. Broker-dealers and other
selling firms will not receive these additional volume concessions on the sale
of units which are not subject to a transactional sales charge (as defined in
applicable prospectuses), however, such sales will be included in determining
whether a firm has met the sales level breakpoints set forth in the table
above. Secondary market sales of all unit investment trusts are excluded for
purposes of these volume concessions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Wells
Fargo Advisors will receive the maximum volume concession set forth in the
table above for all eligible unit sales. The Sponsor will pay these amounts out
of the sales charge received on units within a reasonable time following each
Quarterly Period. For a trust to be eligible for this additional compensation
for Quarterly Period sales, the trust's prospectus must include disclosure
related to this additional compensation; a trust is not eligible for this
additional compensation if the prospectus for such trust does not include
disclosure related to this additional compensation. The Investment Grade
Municipal Intermediate Trusts and the Investment Grade Municipal Limited
Maturity Trusts will not be eligible for the Additional Volume Concession
described above.


Certain commercial banks may be making Units available to their customers on
an agency basis. A portion of the sales charge paid by these customers (equal
to the agency commission referred to above) is retained by or remitted to the
banks. Any discount provided to investors will be borne by the selling dealer
or agent. For secondary market transactions, the Sponsor will sell Units to
broker-dealers and selling agents at the Public Offering Price less a
concession or agency commission of 80% of the applicable sales charge. Dealers
other than the Sponsor may sell Units in the secondary market to other
broker-dealers and selling agents at the Public Offering Price less a
concession or agency commission not in excess of the secondary market
concession allowed to the dealer. The Sponsor reserves the right to reject, in
whole or in part, any order for the purchase of Units and to change the amount
of the concession or agency commission to dealers and others from time to
time.


Sponsor and Underwriter Compensation. The Sponsor will sell Units to
Underwriters at the regular Public Offering Price per Unit less a gross
concession described in the sections below. For a list of the Underwriters that
have purchased Units from the Sponsor, see "Underwriting" in Prospectus Part I.


IGMT 3-7 Year Series. The Sponsor will sell Units of IGMT 3-7 Year Series to
Underwriters at the regular Public Offering Price per Unit less a concession of
$12 per Unit underwritten.


If a firm commits to act as an Underwriter for an IGMT 3-7 Year Series, the
concessions or agency commissions allowed will equal the amounts shown above on
all Units of such Trust distributed during the initial offering period and
purchased directly from the Sponsor rather than the broker-dealer concessions
described under "Unit Distribution".


Each Underwriter who underwrites 1,000 or more Units in an IGMT 3-7 Year
Series will receive additional compensation from the Sponsor of $0.50 for each
Unit it underwrites.


Intermediate Term Trusts. The Sponsor will sell Units of Intermediate-Term
Trusts to Underwriters at the regular Public Offering Price per Unit less the
concession per Unit underwritten set forth in the following table.








                          Underwriter
Units                     Concession
------------------------  -----------
100 Units - 999 Units         $22.00
1,000 Units - 2,999 Units      23.00
3,000 Units or more            23.50










IM-IT Laddered Series, QM-IT Limited Maturity Series, Investment Grade
Municipal Limited Maturity Trusts and IM-IT Limited Maturity Trusts. The
Sponsor will sell Units of IM-IT Laddered Series, QM-IT Limited Maturity
Series, Investment Grade Municipal Limited Maturity Trusts or IM-IT Limited
Maturity Trusts to Underwriters at the regular Public Offering Price per Unit
less the concession per Unit underwritten set forth in the following table.






                          Underwriter
Units                     Concession
------------------------  -----------
250 Units - 999 Units         $31
1,000 Units - 2,999 Units      32
3,000 Units or more            33








IM-IT Discount Trusts. The Sponsor will sell Units of IM-IT Discount Trusts
to Underwriters at the regular Public Offering Price per Unit less the
concession per Unit underwritten set forth in the following table.








                          Underwriter
Units                     Concession
------------------------  -----------
Less than 500 Units           $35
500 Units - 999 Units          36
1,000 Units or more            37








Long-Term Trusts. The Sponsor will sell Units of Long-Term Trusts to
Underwriters at the regular Public Offering Price per Unit less the concession
per Unit underwritten set forth in the following table.








                          Underwriter
Units                     Concession
------------------------  -----------
250 - 500 Units               $35
500 Units - 999 Units          36
1,000 Units - 1,999 Units      37
2,000 Units - 2,999 Units      38
3,000 Units or more            40








General. The breakpoints listed herein will also be applied on a dollar basis
utilizing a breakpoint equivalent of $1,000 per Unit and will be applied on
whichever basis is more favorable to the Underwriter. The breakpoints will be
adjusted to take into consideration purchase orders stated in dollars which
cannot be completely fulfilled due to the requirement that only whole Units be
issued.


An Underwriter will be allowed a concession equal to the Underwriter
concession allowed to such firm on the Date of Deposit for subsequent purchases
on a single day equal to the lesser of (a) 1,000 Units of a Trust (or all
remaining Units if the Sponsor has less than 1,000 unsold Units available for
sale) or (b) the number of Units of a Trust purchased on the Date of Deposit.


In connection with Underwriter sales of Units to non-Underwriter
broker-dealers and other selling agents which Units in turn are sold to
investors in sufficient size to qualify for quantity discounts, Underwriters
are eligible to receive a rebate from the Sponsor. This rebate is intended to
reimburse Underwriters for discounts provided to such broker-dealers and
agents, and on these transactions will equal the amount by which the sum of the
related broker-dealer concession and the sales charge discount exceeds the
regular Underwriter concession.


In addition, the Sponsor and certain Underwriters will realize a profit or
loss, as a result of the difference between the price paid for the bonds by the
Sponsor and the cost of the bonds to a Trust. See "Portfolio" and "Notes to
Portfolio" in Prospectus Part I. The Sponsor and the Underwriters may also
realize profits or losses with respect to bonds which were acquired by the
Sponsor from underwriting syndicates of which they were members. The Sponsor has
not participated as sole underwriter or as manager or as a member of the
underwriting syndicates from which the bonds were acquired. Underwriters may
further realize profit or loss during the initial offering period as a result of
possible fluctuations in the market value of the bonds since all proceeds
received from purchasers of Units (excluding dealer concessions or agency
commissions allowed, if any) will be retained by the Underwriters. Affiliates of
an Underwriter are entitled to the same dealer concessions or agency commissions
that are available to the Underwriter. In addition to any other benefits
Underwriters may realize from the sale of Units, the Sponsor will share on a pro
rata basis among senior Underwriters (those who underwrite at least 250 Units)
50% of any gain (less deductions for accrued interest and certain costs)
represented by the difference between the cost of the bonds to the Sponsor and
the evaluation of the bonds on the Date of Deposit. The Sponsor and certain of
the other Underwriters will also realize profits or losses in the amount of any
difference between the price at which Units are purchased and the price at which
Units are resold in connection with maintaining a secondary market for Units and
will also realize profits or losses resulting from a redemption of repurchased
Units at a price above or below the purchase price.


We may provide, at our own expense and out of our own profits, additional
compensation and benefits to broker-dealers who sell Units of Trusts and our
other products. This compensation is intended to result in additional sales of
our products and/or compensate broker-dealers and financial advisers for past
sales. We may make these payments for marketing, promotional or related
expenses, including, but not limited to, expenses of entertaining retail
customers and financial advisers, advertising, sponsorship of events or
seminars, obtaining shelf space in broker-dealer firms and similar activities
designed to promote the sale of Trusts and our other products. Fees may include
payment for travel expenses, including lodging, incurred in connection with
trips taken by invited registered representatives for meetings or seminars of a
business nature. These arrangements will not change the price you pay for your
Units.


Market for Units. Although not obligated to do so, the Sponsor intends to,
and certain of the other Underwriters may, maintain a market for Units and offer
to purchase Units at prices, subject to change at any time, based upon the
aggregate bid prices of the bonds plus accrued interest and any principal cash
on hand, less any amounts representing taxes or other governmental charges
payable out of the Trust and less any accrued Trust expenses. If the supply of
Units exceeds demand or if some other business reason warrants it, the Sponsor
and/or the Underwriters may either discontinue all purchases of Units or
discontinue purchases of Units at these prices. If a market is not maintained
and the Unitholder cannot find another purchaser, a Unitholder will be able to
dispose of Units by tendering them to the Trustee for redemption at the
Redemption Price. See "Rights of Unitholders--Redemption of Units". A Unitholder
who wishes to dispose of his Units should inquire of his broker as to current
market prices in order to determine whether there is in any price in excess of
the Redemption Price and, if so, the amount thereof. With respect to Units of
Trusts with a deferred sales charge, any such Units sold prior to the time the
entire deferred sales charge has been collected will be assessed the amount of
any remaining deferred sales charge at the time of sale. The Trustee will notify
the Sponsor of any tender of Units for redemption. If the Sponsor's bid in the
secondary market at that time equals or exceeds the Redemption Price per Unit,
it may purchase the Units not later than the day on which the Units would
otherwise have been redeemed by the Trustee.



FEE ACCOUNTS





As described above, Units may be available for purchase by investors in Fee
Accounts where the Trust is Wrap Fee Eligible. You should consult your financial
professional to determine whether you can benefit from these accounts. For these
purchases you generally only pay the portion of the sales charge that is
retained by your Trust's Sponsor, Invesco Capital Markets, Inc. You should
consult the "Public Offering--Reducing Your Sales Charge" section for specific
information on this and other sales charge discounts. That section governs the
calculation of all sales charge discounts. The Sponsor reserves the right to
limit or deny purchases of Units in Fee Accounts by investors or selling firms
whose frequent trading activity is determined to be detrimental to a Trust.



RIGHTS OF UNITHOLDERS





Distributions of Interest and Principal. Interest received by a Trust, pro
rated on an annual basis, will be distributed monthly. The amount and time of
the first distribution is described in Prospectus Part I under "Summary of
Essential Financial Information". In addition, a Trust that has elected to be
structured as a "regulated investment company" for federal tax purposes may
make additional required distributions at the end of each year.


Interest received by a Trust, including that part of the proceeds of any
disposition of bonds which represents accrued interest, is credited by the
Trustee to the Interest Account. Other receipts are credited to the Principal
Account. After deduction of amounts sufficient to reimburse the Trustee,
without interest, for any amounts advanced and paid to the Sponsor as the
Unitholder of record as of the First Settlement Date, interest received will be
distributed on each distribution date to Unitholders of record as of the
preceding record date. All distributions will be net of estimated expenses. The
Trustee is not required to pay interest on funds held in the Principal or
Interest Account (but may itself earn interest thereon and therefore benefits
from the use of these funds). Should the amount available for distribution in
the Principal Account equal or exceed $5.00 per Unit, the Trustee will make a
distribution from the Principal Account on the next monthly distribution date
to Unitholders of record on the related monthly record date. However, funds in
the Principal Account will be distributed on the last distribution date of each
calendar year to Unitholders of record as of the preceding record date if the
amount available for distribution shall equal at least $1.00 per Unit.


Because interest payments are not received by a Trust at a constant rate
throughout the year, interest distributions may be more or less than the amount
credited to the Interest Account as of the record date. For the purpose of
minimizing fluctuations in interest distributions, the Trustee is authorized to
advance amounts necessary to provide interest distributions of approximately
equal amounts. The Trustee is reimbursed for these advances from funds in the
Interest Account on the next record date. Persons who purchase Units between a
record date and a distribution date will receive their first distribution on
the second distribution date after the purchase.


Redemption of Units. All or a portion of your Units may be tendered to The
Bank of New York Mellon, the Trustee, for redemption at Unit Investment Trust
Division, 111 Sanders Creek Parkway, East Syracuse, New York 13057, on any day
the New York Stock Exchange is open. No redemption fee will be charged by the
Sponsor or the Trustee, but you are responsible for applicable governmental
charges, if any. Units redeemed by the Trustee will be canceled. You may redeem
all or a portion of your Units by sending a request for redemption to your bank
or broker-dealer through which you hold your Units. No later than three business
days following satisfactory tender, the Unitholder will receive an amount for
each Unit equal to the Redemption Price per Unit next computed after receipt by
the Trustee of the tender of Units. The "date of tender" is deemed to be the
date on which Units are received by the Trustee, except that as regards Units
received after the Evaluation Time on days of trading on the New York Stock
Exchange, the date of tender is the next day on which that Exchange is open and
the Units will be deemed to have been tendered to the Trustee on that day for
redemption at the Redemption Price. Redemption requests received by authorized
financial professionals prior to the Evaluation Time that are properly
transmitted to the Trustee by the time designated by the Trustee, are priced
based on the date of receipt. Redemption requests received by the Trustee after
the Evaluation Time, and redemption requests received by authorized financial
professionals after the Evaluation Time or redemption requests received by such
persons that are not transmitted to the Trustee until after the time designated
by the Trustee, are priced based on the date of the next determined redemption
price provided they are received timely by the Trustee on such date. It is the
responsibility of authorized financial professionals to transmit redemption
requests received by them to the Trustee so they will be received in a timely
manner. Certain broker-dealers or selling firms may charge an order handling fee
for processing redemption requests. Units redeemed directly through the Trustee
are not subject to such fees.


Under Internal Revenue Service regulations, the Trustee is required to
withhold a specified percentage of a Unit redemption if the Trustee has not
received the Unitholder's tax identification number as required by such
regulations. Any amount withheld is transmitted to the Internal Revenue Service
and may be recovered by the Unitholder only when filing a return. Under normal
circumstances the Trustee obtains the Unitholder's tax identification number
from the selling broker. However, at any time a Unitholder elects to tender
Units for redemption, the Unitholder should provide a tax identification number
to the Trustee in order to avoid this possible "back-up withholding".


The Redemption Price per Unit (as well as the secondary market Public
Offering Price) will be determined on the basis of the bid price of the bonds as
of the Evaluation Time on days of trading on the New York Stock Exchange on the
date any such determination is made. The Evaluator determines the Redemption
Price per Unit on days Units are tendered for redemption. The Redemption Price
per Unit is the pro rata share of each Unit on the basis of (i) the cash on hand
in the Trust or moneys in the process of being collected, (ii) the value of the
bonds based on the bid prices of the bonds, (iii) accrued interest, less (a)
amounts representing taxes or other governmental charges, (b) the accrued Trust
expenses and (c) for Trusts with a deferred sales charge, any unpaid deferred
sales charge payments. During the initial offering period, the Redemption Price
and secondary market repurchase price are not reduced by estimated organization
costs. The Evaluator may determine the value of the bonds by employing any of
the methods set forth in "Public Offering--Unit Price". Accrued interest paid on
redemption shall be withdrawn from the Interest Account or, if the balance
therein is insufficient, from the Principal Account. All other amounts will be
withdrawn from the Principal Account. Units so redeemed shall be cancelled.


The price at which Units may be redeemed could be less than the price paid
by the Unitholder and may be less than the par value of the bonds represented
by the Units redeemed. The Trustee may sell bonds to cover redemptions. When
bonds are sold, the size and diversity of the Trust will be reduced. Sales may
be required at a time when bonds would not otherwise be sold and might result
in lower prices than might otherwise be realized.


The Trustee reserves the right to satisfy any redemption of 1,000 or more
Units with an aggregate redemption price of $1,000,000 or more in an in kind
distribution of bonds. An in kind distribution of bonds will be made by the
Trustee through the distribution of each of the bonds in the Trust in
book-entry form to the account of the Unitholder's broker-dealer at Depository
Trust Company. Amounts representing fractional portions of a bond will be
distributed in cash. The Trustee may adjust the bonds included in a
Unitholder's in kind distribution to facilitate the distribution of whole
bonds. Special tax consequences will result if a Unitholder receives an in kind
distribution.


The right of redemption may be suspended and payment postponed for any
period during which the New York Stock Exchange is closed, other than for
customary weekend and holiday closings, or during which the SEC determines that
trading on that Exchange is restricted or an emergency exists, as a result of
which disposal or evaluation of the bonds is not reasonably practicable, or for
other periods as the SEC may by order permit. Under certain extreme
circumstances the Sponsor may apply to the SEC for an order permitting a full
or partial suspension of the right of Unitholders to redeem their Units.


Exchange Option. When you redeem Units of your Trust or when your Trust
terminates, you may be able to exchange your Units for units of other Invesco
unit trusts at a reduced sales charge. You should contact your financial
professional for more information about trusts currently available for
exchanges. Before you exchange Units, you should read the prospectus of the new
trust carefully and understand the risks and fees. You should then discuss this
option with your financial professional to determine whether your investment
goals have changed, whether current trusts suit you and to discuss tax
consequences. We may discontinue this option at any time.


Units. Ownership of Units is evidenced in book-entry form only and will not
be evidenced by certificates. Units purchased or held through your bank or
broker-dealer will be recorded in book-entry form and credited to the account
of your bank or broker-dealer at the Depository Trust Company ("DTC"). Units
are transferable by contacting your bank or broker-dealer through which you
hold your Units. Transfer, and the requirements therefore, will be governed by
the applicable procedures of DTC and your agreement with the DTC participant in
whose name your Units are registered on the transfer records of DTC.


Reports Provided. Unitholders will receive a statement of interest and other
receipts received for each distribution. For as long as the Sponsor deems it to
be in the best interest of Unitholders, the accounts of each Trust will be
audited annually by an independent registered public accounting firm and the
report of the accountants will be furnished to Unitholders upon request. Within
a reasonable period of time after the end of each year, the Trustee will
furnish to each person who was a registered Unitholder during that year a
statement describing the interest and principal received on the bonds, actual
Trust distributions, Trust expenses, a list of the bonds and other Trust
information. Unitholders will be furnished the Evaluator's evaluations of the
bonds upon request to the Trustee. If you have questions regarding your account
or your Trust, please contact your financial advisor or the Trustee. The
Sponsor does not have access to individual account information.



INSURANCE ON THE BONDS IN THE INSURED TRUSTS





Insurance has been obtained guaranteeing prompt payment of interest and
principal, when due, in respect of the bonds in each Insured Trust. The premium
for any preinsured bond insurance has been paid by the issuer, by a prior owner
of the bonds and any policy is non-cancelable and will continue in force so long
as the bonds so insured are outstanding and the preinsured bond insurer remains
in business. The preinsured bond insurers are described in "Portfolio" and the
notes thereto in Prospectus Part I. More detailed information regarding
insurance on the bonds and the preinsured bond insurers is included in the
Information Supplement. See "Additional Information".


Each insurer is subject to regulation by the department of insurance in the
state in which it is qualified to do business. Such regulation, however, is no
guarantee that each insurer will be able to perform on its contract of
insurance in the event a claim should be made. The financial information with
respect to each insurer appears in reports filed with state insurance
regulatory authorities and is subject to audit and review by such authorities.
No representation is made herein as to the accuracy or adequacy of such
information or as to the absence of material adverse changes in such
information subsequent to the dates thereof.



TRUST ADMINISTRATION





Sponsor. Invesco Capital Markets, Inc. is the Sponsor of your Trust. The
Sponsor is a wholly owned subsidiary of Invesco Advisers, Inc. ("Invesco
Advisers"). Invesco Advisers is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Invesco
Ltd., a leading independent global investment manager that provides a wide range
of investment strategies and vehicles to its retail, institutional and high net
worth clients around the globe. On June 1, 2010, Invesco Ltd. acquired the
retail asset management business, including Invesco Capital Markets, Inc. (then
known as Van Kampen Funds Inc.), from Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated. The
Sponsor's principal office is located at 11 Greenway Plaza, Houston, Texas
77046-1173. As of September 30, 2012, the total stockholders' equity of Invesco
Capital Markets, Inc. was $95,560,974 (unaudited). The current assets under
management and supervision by Invesco Ltd. and its affiliates were valued at
approximately $683.0 billion as of September 30, 2012.


The Sponsor and your Trust have adopted a code of ethics requiring Invesco
Ltd.'s employees who have access to information on Trust transactions to report
personal securities transactions. The purpose of the code is to avoid potential
conflicts of interest and to prevent fraud, deception or misconduct with respect
to your Trust. The Information Supplement contains additional information about
the Sponsor.


If the Sponsor shall fail to perform any of its duties under the Trust
Agreement or become incapable of acting or shall become bankrupt or its affairs
are taken over by public authorities, then the Trustee may (i) appoint a
successor Sponsor at rates of compensation deemed by the Trustee to be
reasonable and not exceeding amounts prescribed by the Securities and Exchange
Commission, (ii) terminate the Trust Agreement and liquidate the Trusts as
provided therein or (iii) continue to act as Trustee without terminating the
Trust Agreement.


Trustee. The Trustee is The Bank of New York Mellon, a trust company
organized under the laws of New York. The Bank of New York Mellon has its
principal unit investment trust division offices at 2 Hanson Place, 12th Floor,
Brooklyn, New York 11217, telephone (800) 856-8487. If you have any questions
regarding your account or your Trust, please contact the Trustee at its
principal unit investment trust division offices or your financial advisor. The
Sponsor does not have access to individual account information. The Bank of New
York Mellon is subject to supervision and examination by the Superintendent of
Banks of the State of New York and the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System, and its deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation to the extent permitted by law. Additional information regarding
the Trustee is set forth in the Information Supplement, including the Trustee's
qualifications and duties, its ability to resign, the effect of a merger
involving the Trustee and the Sponsor's ability to remove and replace the
Trustee. See "Additional Information".


Portfolio Administration. The Trusts are not managed funds and, except as
provided in the Trust Agreement, bonds generally will not be sold or replaced.
The Sponsor may, however, direct that bonds be sold in certain limited
situations to protect the Trust based on advice from the Supervisor. These
situations may include default in interest or principal payments on the bonds
or other obligations of an issuer, an advanced refunding or institution of
certain legal proceedings. In addition, the Trustee may sell bonds designated
by the Supervisor for purposes of redeeming Units or payment of expenses. The
Supervisor will consider a variety of factors in designating bonds to be sold
including interest rates, market value and marketability. Except in limited
circumstances, the Trustee will generally reject any offer by an issuer to
issue bonds in exchange or substitution for the bonds (such as a refunding or
refinancing plan). The Trustee will promptly notify Unitholders of any exchange
or substitution. The Information Supplement contains a more detailed
description of circumstances in which bonds may be sold or replaced. See
"Additional Information".


If a Trust is structured as a "regulated investment company" for federal tax
purposes, the Sponsor may direct the reinvestment of proceeds of the sale of
bonds if the sale is the direct result of serious adverse credit factors which,
in the opinion of the Sponsor, would make retention of the bonds detrimental to
the Trust. In such a case, the Sponsor may, but is not obligated to, direct the
reinvestment of sale proceeds in any other securities that meet the criteria
for inclusion in the trust on the Date of Deposit. The Sponsor may also
instruct the Trustee to take action necessary to ensure that such a Trust
continues to satisfy the qualifications of a regulated investment company and
to avoid imposition of tax on undistributed income of the Trust.


Replacement Bonds. No assurance can be given that a Trust will retain its
present size or composition because bonds may be sold, redeemed or mature from
time to time and the proceeds will be distributed to Unitholders and will not be
reinvested. In the event of a failure to deliver any bond that has been
purchased under a contract ("Failed Bonds"), the Sponsor is authorized under the
Trust Agreement to direct the Trustee to acquire other bonds ("Replacement
Bonds") to make up the original portfolio of a Trust. Replacement Bonds must be
purchased within 20 days after delivery of the notice of the failed contract and
the purchase price (exclusive of accrued interest) may not exceed the amount of
funds reserved for the purchase of the Failed Bonds. The Replacement Bonds must
be substantially identical to the Failed Bonds in terms of (i) the exemption
from federal and state taxation, (ii) maturity, (iii) yield to maturity and
current return, (iv) Standard & Poor's or Moody's ratings, and (v) insurance in
an Insured Trust. The Trustee shall notify all Unitholders of a Trust within
five days after the acquisition of a Replacement Bond and shall make a pro rata
distribution of the amount, if any, by which the cost of the Failed Bond
exceeded the cost of the Replacement Bond plus accrued interest. If Failed Bonds
are not replaced, the Sponsor will refund the sales charge attributable to the
Failed Bonds to all Unitholders of the Trust and distribute the principal and
accrued interest (at the coupon rate of the Failed Bonds to the date of removal
from the Trust) attributable to the Failed Bonds within 30 days after removal.
All interest paid to a Unitholder which accrued after the expected date of
settlement for Units will be paid by the Sponsor and accordingly will not be
treated as tax-exempt income. If Failed Bonds are not replaced, the Estimated
Net Annual Interest Income per Unit would be reduced and the Estimated Current
Return and Estimated Long-Term Return might be lowered. Unitholders may not be
able to reinvest their proceeds in other securities at a yield equal to or in
excess of the yield of the Failed Bonds.


Amendment of Trust Agreement. The Sponsor and the Trustee may amend the Trust
Agreement without the consent of Unitholders to correct any provision which may
be defective or to make other provisions that will not materially adversely
affect the interest of the Unitholders (as determined in good faith by the
Sponsor and the Trustee) or to maintain the tax status of a Trust. The Trust
Agreement may not be amended to increase the number of Units or to permit the
acquisition of bonds in addition to or in substitution for any of the bonds
initially deposited in a Trust, except for the substitution of certain refunding
bonds. The Trustee will notify Unitholders of any amendment.


Termination of Trust Agreement. A Trust will terminate upon the redemption,
sale or other disposition of the last bond held in the Trust. A Trust may also
be terminated at any time by consent of Unitholders of 75% of the Units then
outstanding or by the Trustee when the value of the Trust is less than 20% of
the original principal amount of bonds. A Trust will be liquidated by the
Trustee in the event that a sufficient number of Units not yet sold are
tendered for redemption by the Underwriters, including the Sponsor, so that the
net worth of such Trust would be reduced to less than 40% of the initial
principal amount of such Trust. If a Trust is liquidated because of the
redemption of unsold Units by the Underwriter, the Sponsor will refund to each
purchaser of Units the entire sales charge paid by such purchaser. The Trustee
will notify each Unitholder of any termination within a reasonable time and
will then liquidate any remaining bonds. The sale of bonds upon termination may
result in a lower amount than might otherwise be realized if the sale was not
required at that time. For this reason, among others, the amount realized by a
Unitholder upon termination may be less than the principal amount of bonds per
Unit or value at the time of purchase. The Trustee will distribute to each
Unitholder his share of the balance of the Interest and Principal Accounts
after deduction of costs, expenses or indemnities. The Unitholder will receive
a final distribution statement with this distribution. When the Trustee in its
sole discretion determines that any amounts held in reserve are no longer
necessary, it will distribute these amounts to Unitholders. The Information
Supplement contains further information regarding termination of a Trust. See
"Additional Information".


Limitation on Liabilities. The Sponsor, Supervisor, Evaluator and Trustee
shall be under no liability to Unitholders for taking any action or for
refraining from taking any action in good faith pursuant to the Trust
Agreement, or for errors in judgment, but shall be liable only for their own
willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence (negligence in the case of
the Trustee) in the performance of their duties or by reason of their reckless
disregard of their obligations and duties hereunder. The Trustee shall not be
liable for depreciation or loss incurred by reason of the sale by the Trustee
of any of the bonds. In the event of the failure of the Sponsor to act under
the Trust Agreement, the Trustee may act thereunder and shall not be liable for
any action taken by it in good faith under the Trust Agreement. The Trustee is
not liable for any taxes or governmental charges imposed on the bonds, on it as
Trustee under the Trust Agreement or on a Trust which the Trustee may be
required to pay under any present or future law of the United States of America
or of any other taxing authority having jurisdiction. In addition, the Trust
Agreement contains other customary provisions limiting the liability of the
Trustee. The Trustee and Sponsor may rely on any evaluation furnished by the
Evaluator and have no responsibility for the accuracy thereof. Determinations
by the Evaluator shall be made in good faith upon the basis of the best
information available to it; provided, however, that the Evaluator shall be
under no liability to the Trustee, Sponsor or Unitholders for errors in
judgment.



FEDERAL TAX STATUS





This is a general discussion of certain federal income tax consequences
arising from the purchase, ownership and disposition of Units of a Trust that
intends to qualify as a "regulated investment company" for federal income tax
purposes. The summary is limited to investors who hold the Units as "capital
assets" (generally, property held for investment) within the meaning of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). Unitholders should
consult their tax advisers in determining the federal, state, local and any
other tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of Units.


Tax Status of the Trusts. The Trusts have elected to qualify and intend to
qualify annually as regulated investment companies under Subchapter M of the
Code. To qualify as a regulated investment company, a Trust must distribute to
its Unitholders at least 90% of its investment company taxable income (which
includes, among other items, dividends, taxable interest, if any, and the excess
of net short-term capital gains over net long-term capital losses) and 90% of
its tax-exempt interest income, and meet certain diversification of assets,
source of income, and other requirements. By meeting these requirements, a Trust
generally will not be subject to federal income tax on investment company
taxable income, and on net capital gains (the excess of net long-term capital
gains over net short-term capital losses) reported by a Trust as capital gain
dividends, distributed to Unitholders. A Trust can also avoid an annual
nondeductible 4% excise tax if each calendar year it distributes substantially
all of its ordinary income, short and long-term capital gain, and any previously
undistributed and untaxed amounts.


If for any taxable year a Trust did not qualify as a regulated investment
company, all of its taxable income would be subject to tax at regular corporate
rates without any deduction for distributions to Unitholders, and any
distributions would be taxable to the Unitholders as ordinary dividends to the
extent of such Trust's current or accumulated earnings and profits. Such
distributions generally would be eligible for the dividends received deduction
in the case of corporate Unitholders and the lower federal income tax rate
currently applicable to qualifying dividend income for individual Unitholders,
provided certain holding period requirements were satisfied by the Trust and
the respective Unitholders.


The Trusts may be subject to state or local tax in jurisdictions in which
the Trusts are organized or may be deemed to be doing business.


Distributions. Each Trust intends to make sufficient distributions of
investment company taxable income, if any, capital gains, if any, and
exempt-interest dividends each year in order to qualify as a regulated
investment company and to avoid any Trust-level federal income or excise taxes.
Each Trust intends to be eligible to distribute exempt-interest dividends to
Unitholders by holding a sufficient amount of its assets in bonds generating
interest that is exempt from federal income taxation under Section 103 of the
Code. Such exempt-interest dividends are not subject to regular federal income
tax, but may be subject to alternative minimum tax.


Distributions of investment company taxable income (including net short-term
capital gains), if any, are taxable to Unitholders as ordinary income, and
generally will not qualify for treatment as qualified dividend income currently
taxed at a maximum rate of 15% for individual Unitholders or for the
dividends-received deduction for corporate Unitholders. Any income from your
Trust that you must take into account for federal tax purposes is not reduced
by amounts used to pay a deferred sales charge, if any.


Net capital gains of a Trust (net long-term capital gain over net short-term
capital loss), if any, realized and distributed by such Trust and reported as
capital gain dividends are taxable to Unitholders as long-term capital gains
currently at a maximum rate of 15%, without regard to the length of time the
Unitholder may have held his or her Units in the Trust. Capital gain dividends
are not eligible for the dividends-received deduction for corporate Unitholders.
In determining the amount of capital gains to be distributed by a Trust, any
capital loss carry over from a prior year will be taken into account in
determining the amount of net long-term capital gain. Taxable distributions are
taxable to investors whether received in cash or reinvested in additional Units.


When the bonds owned by the Trusts were issued, special bond counsel issued
opinions that the interest on the bonds is not subject to regular federal
income tax (except in the limited circumstances referred to below). Payments
that a Trust receives on a bank letter of credit, guarantee or insurance policy
because the bond issuer has defaulted should be treated as payments on the
bond, namely as payments of principal or interest that are not subject to
regular federal income tax or taxable market discount or capital gain. The
tax-exempt status of the interest depends on compliance by the issuer and
others with ongoing requirements, and the opinions of bond counsel assume that
these requirements will be met. However, there is no guarantee that the issuers
(and other users) will comply with these requirements.


A Trust may have to accrue and distribute income not yet received if it
invests in bonds issued at a discount. A Trust may be required to sell bonds
that it otherwise would have continued to hold in order to generate sufficient
cash to make this distribution.


The interest on some private activity bonds is a preference item included in
alternative minimum taxable income. Each year the Trusts will give to
Unitholders a report showing the percentage of the Trust's income that is a
preference item. In addition, alternative minimum taxable income of a corporate
Unitholder is increased by part of the excess of its "adjusted current earnings"
(an alternative measure of income that includes interest on all tax exempt
securities) over the amount otherwise determined to be alternative minimum
taxable income. Therefore, the exempt-interest dividends may cause a Unitholder
to have to pay the federal alternative minimum tax or may increase the amount of
that tax payable by a Unitholder already subject to federal alternative minimum
tax.


The Trusts may own bonds originally issued at a discount. In general,
original issue discount is the difference between the price at which a bond was
issued and its stated redemption price at maturity. Original issue discount on
tax-exempt bonds accrues as tax-exempt interest over the life of the bond. A
Trust's adjusted tax basis for a bond issued with original issue discount will
include original issue discount accrued during the period it held the bond. A
Trust may also pay a premium when it buys a bond, even a bond issued with
original issue discount. A Trust may be required to amortize the premium over
the term of the bond and reduce its basis for the bond even though it does not
get any deduction for the amortization. Therefore, sometimes the Trust may have
a taxable gain when it sells a bond for an amount equal to or less than its
original tax basis.


Unitholders may receive ordinary income dividends from a Trust if the Trust
sells or redeems bonds that were acquired at a market discount, or sells bonds
at a short term capital gain. In general, the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS")
will treat Bonds as market discount bonds when the cost of the bond, plus any
original issue discount that has not yet accrued, is less than the amount due
to be paid at the maturity of the bond. The IRS generally taxes all or a
portion of the gain on the sale of a market discount bond as ordinary income
when the bond is sold, redeemed or paid. The portion of the gain taxed by the
IRS as ordinary income is equal to the portion of the market discount that has
accrued since the seller purchased the bond.


Some of the bonds held by the Trusts may lose their tax-exempt status while
they are owned by a "substantial user" of the facilities being financed with
the proceeds of those bonds, or by persons related to a substantial user. A
"substantial user" is a person whose gross revenue derived with respect to the
facilities financed by the bonds is more than 5% of the total revenue derived
by all users of those facilities, or who occupies more than 5% of the usable
area of the facilities or for whom the facilities or a part thereof were
specifically constructed, reconstructed or acquired. "Related persons" are
certain related individuals, affiliated corporations, partners and
partnerships. This rule would not change the tax-exempt status of interest on
bonds held by other persons. These rules may apply to a Unitholder who receives
exempt-interest dividends attributable to interest on bonds that financed
facilities for which such Unitholder or a related person is a "substantial
user."


Individuals must take exempt-interest dividends into consideration in
computing the portion, if any, of social security benefits that will be included
in their gross income and subject to federal income tax.


If a Trust declares dividends in October, November or December that are
payable to Unitholders of record on a date during those months, Unitholders
must take the dividends into account for tax purposes in the current year, if
the dividend is paid either in the current year or in January of the following
year.


Ordinary, exempt-interest and capital gain dividends will be taxable as
described above whether received in cash or reinvested in additional Units.


If a Trust invests in securities of foreign issuers, it may be subject to
withholding and other similar income taxes imposed by a foreign country.
Dividends and distributions may also be subject to state and local taxes.


Investors should carefully consider the tax implications of buying Units
prior to a distribution by a Trust. The price of Units purchased at that time
includes the amount of the forthcoming distributions. Distributions by a Trust
reduce the net asset value of such Trust's Units, and if a distribution reduces
the net asset value below a Unitholder's cost basis, such distribution,
nevertheless, could be taxable to the Unitholder as ordinary income or capital
gain as described above, even though, from an investment standpoint, it may
constitute a partial return of capital.


Sale or Redemption of Units. Upon the taxable disposition (including a sale
or redemption) of Units of a Trust, a Unitholder may realize a gain or loss
depending upon such Unitholder's adjusted tax basis in the Units and the amount
of sale or redemption proceeds. Such gain or loss will be treated as capital
gain or loss if the Units are capital assets in the Unitholder's hands, and will
be long-term or short-term, generally depending upon the Unitholder's holding
period for the Units. Non-corporate Unitholders are currently subject to tax at
a maximum federal rate of 15% on capital gains resulting from the disposition of
Units held for more than 12 months (zero if the taxpayer is, and would be after
accounting for such gains, subject to the federal 10% or 15% tax bracket for
ordinary income). However, a loss realized by a Unitholder on the disposition of
Units with respect to which capital gains dividends have been paid will, to the
extent of such capital gain dividends, also be treated as long-term capital loss
if such shares have been held by the Unitholder for six months or less. Further,
a loss realized on a disposition will be disallowed to the extent the Units
disposed of are replaced (whether by reinvestment of distributions or otherwise)
within a period of 61 days beginning 30 days before and ending 30 days after the
Units are disposed of. In such a case, the basis of the Units acquired will be
adjusted to reflect the disallowed loss. Capital losses in any year are
deductible only to the extent of capital gains plus, in the case of a
non-corporate taxpayer, $3,000 of ordinary income ($1,500 for married
individuals filing separately).


Backup Withholding. The Trusts generally must withhold and pay over to the
U.S. Treasury as backup withholding at a current rate of 28% of the taxable
dividends and other distributions paid to any individual Unitholder who either
does not supply its taxpayer identification number, has not reported all of its
dividends and interest income, or does not certify to a Trust that he or she is
not subject to withholding. The social security number of an individual is his
or her taxpayer identification number. Backup withholding also may be required
for a Unitholder upon notification of the Trust by the IRS. Backup withholding
is not an additional tax and any amounts withheld may be credited against a
Unitholder's ultimate federal income tax liability if proper documentation is
provided.


Foreign Withholding. Unitholders who are not U.S. persons should consult
their tax adviser regarding the U.S. and foreign tax consequences of ownership
of Units, including the possibility that such a Unitholder may be subject to a
U.S. withholding tax at a rate of 30% (or at a lower rate under an applicable
income tax treaty) on amounts received from a Trust.


Information Statements. After the end of each fiscal year for a Trust, the
Trustee will furnish to each Unitholder a statement containing information
regarding the amount of exempt-interest dividends, ordinary dividends, and
capital gain dividends distributed to such Unitholder during the fiscal year.


Investors Should Consult Their Tax Advisers. Prospective investors are urged
to consult their own tax advisers concerning the federal, state, local,
foreign, and any other tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and
disposition of Units based on their individual circumstances. Additional tax
information is contained in the Information Supplement.



EXPENSES





General. The Trustee will periodically deduct from the Interest Account and,
to the extent funds are not sufficient therein, from the Principal Account,
amounts necessary to pay the expenses of the Trusts, provided that organization
costs, and deferred sales charges, if any, are generally paid out of cash
deposited in the Principal Account. The Trustee also may withdraw from these
Accounts such amounts, if any, as it deems necessary to establish a reserve for
any governmental charges payable out of the Trusts. Amounts so withdrawn shall
not be considered a part of a Trust's assets until such time as the Trustee
shall return all or any part of such amounts to the appropriate Accounts.


Organization Costs. You and the other Unitholders will bear all or a portion
of the organization costs and charges incurred in connection with the
establishment of your Trust. These costs and charges will include the cost of
the preparation, printing and execution of the trust agreement, registration
statement and other documents relating to your Trust, federal and state
registration fees and costs, the initial fees and expenses of the Trustee, and
legal and auditing expenses. The Public Offering Price of Units includes the
estimated amount of these costs. The Trustee will deduct these expenses from
your Trust's assets at the end of the initial offering period or after six
months, if earlier.


Sponsor, Supervisor, Evaluator and Trustee. The Sponsor and the Supervisor,
which is an affiliate of the Sponsor, will receive the annual fee indicated
under "Summary of Essential Financial Information" in Prospectus Part I for
providing bookkeeping and administrative services and for providing portfolio
supervisory services for the Trusts. These fees may exceed the actual costs of
providing these services for a Trust but the total amount received for providing
these services to all Invesco unit investment trusts will not exceed the total
cost of providing the services in any calendar year. The Evaluator will receive
the annual evaluation fee indicated under "Summary of Essential Financial
Information" in Prospectus Part I for evaluating each Trust's portfolio. For its
services the Trustee will receive the fee indicated under "Summary of Essential
Financial Information" in Prospectus Part I (which may be reduced as described
therein). Part of the Trustee's compensation for its services is expected to
result from the use of the funds being held in the Principal and Interest
Accounts for future distributions, payment of expenses and redemptions since
these Accounts are non-interest bearing to Unitholders. These fees are based on
the outstanding principal amount of bonds and Units on the Date of Deposit for
the first year and as of the close of business on January 1 for each year
thereafter. The Sponsor's, Supervisor's, Evaluator's and Trustee's fees may be
increased without approval of the Unitholders by amounts not exceeding
proportionate increases under the category "Services Less Rent of Shelter" in
the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers or, if this category is not
published, in a comparable category.


Miscellaneous Expenses. The following additional charges are or may be
incurred by the Trusts: (a) fees of the Trustee for extraordinary services, (b)
expenses of the Trustee (including legal and auditing expenses) and of counsel
designated by the Sponsor, (c) various governmental charges, (d) expenses and
costs of any action taken by the Trustee to protect the Trusts and the rights
and interests of Unitholders, (e) indemnification of the Trustee for any loss,
liability or expenses incurred by it in the administration of the Trusts
without negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct on its part, (f) any
special custodial fees payable in connection with the sale of any of the bonds
in a Trust, (g) expenditures incurred in contacting Unitholders upon
termination of the Trusts and (h) costs incurred to reimburse the Trustee for
advancing funds to the Trusts to meet scheduled distributions (which costs may
be adjusted periodically in response to fluctuations in short-term interest
rates). Each Trust will pay the costs associated with updating its registration
statement each year. The fees and expenses set forth herein are payable out of
the Trusts. When such fees and expenses are paid by or owing to the Trustee,
they are secured by a lien on the portfolio of the applicable Trust. If the
balances in the Interest and Principal Accounts are insufficient to provide for
amounts payable by a Trust, the Trustee has the power to sell bonds to pay such
amounts.

Municipal Bond Risk Factors



The Trusts include certain types of bonds described below. Accordingly, an
investment in a Trust should be made with an understanding of the
characteristics of and risks associated with such bonds. The types of bonds
included in each Trust are described under "Portfolio" in the related Prospectus
Part I. Neither the Sponsor nor the Trustee shall be liable in any way for any
default, failure or defect in any of the bonds.


General Obligation Bonds and Revenue Bonds. Certain of the bonds may be
general obligations of a governmental entity that are backed by the taxing power
of such entity. All other bonds in the Trusts are revenue bonds payable from the
income of a specific project or authority and are not supported by the issuer's
power to levy taxes. General obligation bonds are secured by the issuer's pledge
of its faith, credit and taxing power for the payment of principal and interest.
However, the taxing power of any governmental entity may be limited by
provisions of state constitutions or laws and an entity's credit will depend on
many factors. Some such factors are the entity's tax base, the extent to which
the entity relies on federal or state aid, and other factors which are beyond
the entity's control. Revenue bonds, on the other hand, are payable only from
the revenues derived from a particular facility or class of facilities or, in
some cases, from the proceeds of a special excise tax or other specific revenue
source. There are, of course, variations in the security of the different bonds
in a Trust, both within a particular classification and between classifications,
depending on numerous factors.


Housing Bonds. Certain of the bonds may be obligations which derive their
payments from mortgage loans. Certain of such housing bonds may be FHA insured.
Multi-family housing revenue bonds are payable primarily from mortgage loans to
housing projects for low to moderate income families. Single family mortgage
revenue bonds are issued for the purpose of acquiring from originating financial
institutions notes secured by mortgages on residences located within the
issuer's boundaries and owned by persons of low or moderate income. The ability
of housing issuers to make debt service payments on their obligations may be
affected by various economic and non-economic factors. Such factors include:

occupancy levels, adequate rental income in multi-family projects, the rate of
default on mortgage loans underlying single family issuers and the ability of
mortgage insurers to pay claims. Mortgage loans are generally partially or
completely prepaid prior to their final maturities as a result of events such as
sale of the mortgaged premises, default, condemnation or casualty loss. Because
these bonds are subject to extraordinary mandatory redemption in whole or in
part from such prepayments of mortgage loans, a substantial portion of such
bonds will probably be redeemed prior to their scheduled maturities or even
prior to their ordinary call dates. Extraordinary mandatory redemption without
premium could also result from the failure of the originating financial
institutions to make mortgage loans in sufficient amounts within a specified
time period. Additionally, unusually high rates of default on the underlying
mortgage loans may reduce revenues available for the payment of principal of or
interest on such mortgage revenue bonds. In each case the issuer of the bonds
has covenanted to comply with applicable requirements and bond counsel to such
issuer has issued an opinion that the interest on the bonds is exempt from
federal income tax under existing laws and regulations. Certain issuers of
housing bonds have considered various ways to redeem bonds they have issued
prior to the stated first redemption dates for such bonds. In connection with
the housing bonds held by a Trust, the Sponsor at the Date of Deposit is not
aware that any of the respective issuers of such bonds are actively considering
the redemption of such bonds prior to their respective stated initial call
dates.


Health Care Bonds. Certain of the bonds may be health care revenue bonds.
Ratings of bonds issued for health care facilities are often based on
feasibility studies that contain projections of occupancy levels, revenues and
expenses. A facility's gross receipts and net income available for debt service
may be affected by future events and conditions including, among other things,
demand for services and the ability of the facility to provide the services
required, physicians' confidence in the facility, management capabilities,
competition with other health care facilities, efforts by insurers and
governmental agencies to limit rates, legislation establishing state
rate-setting agencies, expenses, the cost and possible unavailability of
malpractice insurance, the funding of Medicare, Medicaid and other similar third
party payor programs, government regulation and the termination or restriction
of governmental financial assistance, including that associated with Medicare,
Medicaid and other similar third party payor programs. It also may be necessary
for a hospital or other health care facility to incur substantial capital
expenditures or increased operating expenses to effect changes in its
facilities, equipment, personnel and services. Hospitals and other health care
facilities are additionally subject to claims and legal actions by patients and
others in the ordinary course of business. There can be no assurance that a
claim will not exceed the insurance coverage of a health care facility or that
insurance coverage will be available to a facility.


Public Utility and Wholesale Electric Bonds. Certain of the bonds may be
obligations of public utility issuers, including those selling wholesale and
retail electric power and gas. General problems of such issuers would include
the difficulty in financing large construction programs in an inflationary
period, the limitations on operations and increased costs and delays
attributable to environmental considerations, the difficulty of the capital
market in absorbing utility debt, the difficulty in obtaining fuel at reasonable
prices and the effect of energy conservation. In addition, federal, state and
municipal governmental authorities may from time to time review existing, and
impose additional, regulations governing the licensing, construction and
operation of nuclear power plants, which may adversely affect the ability of the
issuers of certain of the bonds to make payments of principal and/or interest on
such bonds.


Water and Sewer Bonds. Certain of the bonds may be obligations of issuers
whose revenues are derived from the sale of water and/or sewerage services. Such
bonds are generally payable from user fees. The problems of such issuers include
the ability to obtain timely and adequate rate increases, population decline
resulting in decreased user fees, the difficulty of financing large construction
programs, the limitations on operations and increased costs and delays
attributable to environmental considerations, the increasing difficulty of
obtaining or discovering new supplies of fresh water, the effect of conservation
programs and the impact of "no-growth" zoning ordinances.


Industrial Revenue Bonds. Certain of the bonds may be industrial revenue
bonds ("IRBs"). IRBs have generally been issued under bond resolutions pursuant
to which the revenues and receipts payable under the arrangements with the
operator of a particular project have been assigned and pledged to purchasers.
In some cases, a mortgage on the underlying project may have been granted as
security for the IRBs. Regardless of the structure, payment of IRBs is solely
dependent upon the creditworthiness of the corporate operator of the project or
corporate guarantor. Corporate operators or guarantors may be affected by many
factors which may have an adverse impact on the credit quality of the particular
company or industry. These include cyclicality of revenues and earnings,
regulatory and environmental restrictions, litigation resulting from accidents
or environmentally-caused illnesses, extensive competition and financial
deterioration resulting from a corporate restructuring pursuant to a leveraged
buy-out, takeover or otherwise. Such a restructuring may result in the operator
of a project becoming highly leveraged which may impact on such operator's
creditworthiness which in turn would have an adverse impact on the rating and/or
market value of such bonds. Further, the possibility of such a restructuring may
have an adverse impact on the market for and consequently the value of such
bonds, even though no actual takeover or other action is ever contemplated or
effected.


Lease Obligation Bonds. Certain of the bonds may be obligations that are
secured by lease payments of a governmental entity (hereinafter called "lease
obligations"). Lease obligations are often in the form of certificates of
participation. Although the lease obligations do not constitute general
obligations of the municipality for which the municipality's taxing power is
pledged, a lease obligation is ordinarily backed by the municipality's covenant
to appropriate for and make the payments due under the lease obligation.
However, certain lease obligations contain "nonappropriation" clauses which
provide that the municipality has no obligation to make lease payments in future
years unless money is appropriated for such purpose on a yearly basis. A
governmental entity that enters into such a lease agreement cannot obligate
future governments to appropriate for and make lease payments but covenants to
take such action as is necessary to include any lease payments due in its
budgets and to make the appropriations therefor. A governmental entity's failure
to appropriate for and to make payments under its lease obligation could result
in insufficient funds available for payment of the obligations secured thereby.
Although "non-appropriation" lease obligations are secured by the leased
property, disposition of the property in the event of foreclosure might prove
difficult.


Higher Educations and Public Education Bonds. Certain of the bonds may be
obligations of issuers which are, or which govern the operation of, schools,
colleges and universities and whose revenues are derived mainly from ad valorem
taxes or for higher education systems, from tuition, dormitory revenues, grants
and endowments. General problems relating to school bonds include litigation
contesting the state constitutionality of financing public education in part
from ad valorem taxes, thereby creating a disparity in educational funds
available to schools in wealthy areas and schools in poor areas. Litigation or
legislation on this issue may affect the sources of funds available for the
payment of school bonds in the Trusts. General problems relating to college and
university obligations include the prospect of a declining percentage of the
population consisting of "college" age individuals, possible inability to raise
tuitions and fees sufficiently to cover increased operating costs, the
availability and restrictions on the use of endowments and other funds, the
uncertainty of continued receipt of federal grants and state funding, and
government legislation or regulations which may adversely affect the revenues or
costs of such issuers.


Airport and Transportation Bonds. Certain of the bonds in certain of the
Trusts may be obligations which are payable from and secured by revenues derived
from the ownership and operation of facilities such as airports, bridges,
turnpikes, port authorities, convention centers and arenas. The major portion of
an airport's gross operating income is generally derived from fees received from
signatory airlines pursuant to use agreements which consist of annual payments
for leases, occupancy of certain terminal space and service fees. Airport
operating income may therefore be affected by the ability of the airlines to
meet their obligations under the use agreements. From time to time the air
transport industry has experienced significant variations in earnings and
traffic, due to increased competition, excess capacity, increased costs,
deregulation, traffic constraints, acts of terrorism and other factors, and
several airlines have experienced severe financial difficulties. Similarly,
payment on bonds related to other facilities is dependent on revenues from the
projects, such as user fees from ports, tolls on turnpikes and bridges and rents
from buildings. Therefore, payment may be adversely affected by reduction in
revenues due to such factors as increased cost of maintenance, decreased use of
a facility, lower cost of alternative modes of transportation, scarcity of fuel
and reduction or loss of rents.


Waste Disposal Bonds. Certain of the bonds may be obligations which are
payable from and secured by revenues derived from the operation of resource
recovery facilities. Resource recovery facilities are designed to process solid
waste, generate steam and convert steam to electricity. Resource recovery bonds
may be subject to extraordinary optional redemption at par upon the occurrence
of certain circumstances, including but not limited to: destruction or
condemnation of a project; contracts relating to a project becoming void,
unenforceable or impossible to perform; changes in the economic availability of
raw materials, operating supplies or facilities necessary for the operation of a
project or technological or other unavoidable changes adversely affecting the
operation of a project; and administrative or judicial actions which render
contracts relating to the projects void, unenforceable or impossible to perform
or impose unreasonable burdens or excessive liabilities. The Sponsor cannot
predict the causes or likelihood of the redemption of resource recovery bonds in
a Trust prior to the stated maturity of the bonds.


Original Issue Discount Bonds. Certain of the bonds may have been acquired at
a market discount from par value at maturity. The coupon interest rates on
discount bonds at the time they were purchased and deposited in a Trust were
lower than the current market interest rates for newly issued bonds of
comparable rating and type. If such interest rates for newly issued comparable
bonds increase, the market discount of previously issued bonds will become
greater, and if such interest rates for newly issued comparable bonds decline,
the market discount of previously issued bonds will be reduced, other things
being equal. Investors should also note that the value of bonds purchased at a
market discount will increase in value faster than bonds purchased at a market
premium if interest rates decrease. Conversely, if interest rates increase, the
value of bonds purchased at a market discount will decrease faster than bonds
purchased at a market premium. In addition, if interest rates rise, the
prepayment risk of higher yielding, premium Securities and the prepayment
benefit for lower yielding, discount bonds will be reduced. A bond purchased at
a market discount and held to maturity will have a larger portion of its total
return in the form of taxable income and capital gain and less in the form of
tax-exempt interest income than a comparable bond newly issued at current market
rates. See "Federal Tax Status" in Prospectus Part II. Market discount
attributable to interest changes does not indicate a lack of market confidence
in the issue.


Zero Coupon Bonds. Certain of the bonds may be "zero coupon" bonds. Zero
coupon bonds are purchased at a deep discount because the buyer receives only
the right to receive a final payment at the maturity of the bond and does not
receive any periodic interest payments. The effect of owning deep discount bonds
which do not make current interest payments (such as the zero coupon bonds) is
that a fixed yield is earned not only on the original investment but also, in
effect, on all discount earned during the life of such obligation. This implicit
reinvestment of earnings at the same rate eliminates the risk of being unable to
reinvest the income on such obligation at a rate as high as the implicit yield
on the discount obligation, but at the same time eliminates the holder's ability
to reinvest at higher rates in the future. For this reason, zero coupon bonds
are subject to substantially greater price fluctuations during periods of
changing market interest rates than are securities of comparable quality which
pay interest.


"When, as and if Issued" Bonds. Certain of the bonds may have been purchased
on a "when, as and if issued" or "delayed delivery" basis. The delivery of any
such bonds may be delayed or may not occur. Interest on these bonds begins
accruing to the benefit of Unitholders on their respective dates of delivery. To
the extent any bonds are actually delivered to a Trust after their respective
expected dates of delivery, Unitholders who purchase their Units prior to the
date such bonds are actually delivered to the Trustee would be required to
adjust their tax basis in their Units for a portion of the interest accruing on
such bonds during the interval between their purchase of Units and the actual
delivery of such bonds. As a result of any such adjustment, the Estimated
Current Returns during the first year would be slightly lower than those stated
in the prospectus which would be the returns after the first year, assuming the
portfolio of a Trust and estimated annual expenses other than that of the
Trustee (which may be reduced in the first year only) do not vary from that set
forth in Prospectus Part I. Unitholders will be "at risk" with respect to all
bonds in the portfolios including "when, as and if issued" and "delayed
delivery" bonds (i.e., may derive either gain or loss from fluctuations in the
evaluation of such bonds) from the date they commit for Units.


Redemption or Sale Prior to Maturity. Certain of the bonds may be subject to
redemption prior to their stated maturity date pursuant to sinking fund
provisions, call provisions or extraordinary optional or mandatory redemption
provisions or otherwise. A sinking fund is a reserve fund accumulated over a
period of time for retirement of debt. A callable debt obligation is one which
is subject to redemption or refunding prior to maturity at the option of the
issuer. A refunding is a method by which a debt obligation is redeemed, at or
before maturity, by the proceeds of a new debt obligation. In general, call
provisions are more likely to be exercised when the offering side valuation is
at a premium over par than when it is at a discount from par. The exercise of
redemption or call provisions will (except to the extent the proceeds of the
called bonds are used to pay for Unit redemptions) result in the distribution of
principal and may result in a reduction in the amount of subsequent interest
distributions; it may also affect the current return on Units of the Trust
involved. Each Trust portfolio contains a listing of the sinking fund and call
provisions, if any, with respect to each of the debt obligations. Extraordinary
optional redemptions and mandatory redemptions result from the happening of
certain events. Generally, events that may permit the extraordinary optional
redemption of bonds or may require the mandatory redemption of bonds include,
among others: a final determination that the interest on the bonds is taxable;
the substantial damage or destruction by fire or other casualty of the project
for which the proceeds of the bonds were used; an exercise by a local, state or
federal governmental unit of its power of eminent domain to take all or
substantially all of the project for which the proceeds of the bonds were used;
changes in the economic availability of raw materials, operating supplies or
facilities or technological or other changes which render the operation of the
project for which the proceeds of the bonds were used uneconomic; changes in law
or an administrative or judicial decree which renders the performance of the
agreement under which the proceeds of the bonds were made available to finance
the project impossible or which creates unreasonable burdens or which imposes
excessive liabilities, such as taxes, not imposed on the date the bonds are
issued on the issuer of the bonds or the user of the proceeds of the bonds; an
administrative or judicial decree which requires the cessation of a substantial
part of the operations of the project financed with the proceeds of the bonds;
an overestimate of the costs of the project to be financed with the proceeds of
the bonds resulting in excess proceeds of the bonds which may be applied to
redeem bonds; or an underestimate of a source of funds securing the bonds
resulting in excess funds which may be applied to redeem bonds. The issuer of
certain bonds in a Trust may have sold or reserved the right to sell, upon the
satisfaction of certain conditions, to third parties all or any portion of its
rights to call bonds in accordance with the stated redemption provisions of such
bonds. In such a case the issuer no longer has the right to call the bonds for
redemption unless it reacquires the rights from such third party. A third party
pursuant to these rights may exercise the redemption provisions with respect to
a bond at a time when the issuer of the bond might not have called a bond for
redemption had it not sold such rights. The Sponsor is unable to predict all of
the circumstances which may result in such redemption of an issue of bonds. See
also the discussion of single family mortgage and multi-family revenue bonds
above for more information on the call provisions of such bonds.


To the best knowledge of the Sponsor, there is no litigation pending as of
the Date of Deposit in respect of any bonds which might reasonably be expected
to have a material adverse effect upon any of the Trusts.


At any time after the Date of Deposit, litigation may be initiated on a
variety of grounds with respect to bonds in a Trust. Such litigation, as, for
example, suits challenging the issuance of pollution control revenue bonds under
environmental protection statutes, may affect the validity of such bonds or the
tax-free nature of the interest thereon. While the outcome of litigation of such
nature can never be entirely predicted, each Trust has received or will receive
opinions of bond counsel to the issuing authorities of each bond on the date of
issuance to the effect that such bonds have been validly issued and that the
interest thereon is exempt from federal income tax. In addition, other factors
may arise from time to time which potentially may impair the ability of issuers
to meet obligations undertaken with respect to the bonds.



Puerto Rico Risk Factors



Your Trust may significantly invest in bonds issued by issuers located in
Puerto Rico. Accordingly, an investment in such a Trust should be made with an
understanding of the general risks associated with the Commonwealth of Puerto
Rico.


Geographic Location and Demography. The Commonwealth of Puerto Rico ("Puerto
Rico," or the "Commonwealth") is the fourth largest of the Caribbean islands and
is located approximately 1,600 miles Southeast of New York. It is approximately
100 miles long and 35 miles wide. According to the United States Census Bureau,
the population of Puerto Rico was approximately 3,808,610 in 2000 (3,954,037 as
of July 1, 2008, according to a United States Census Bureau estimate), compared
to 3,522,000 in 1990. However, the Puerto Rico Planning Board (the "Planning
Board") estimates that as of July 2010, the population will be approximately
4,022,446.


Relationship with the United States. Puerto Rico came under United States
sovereignty pursuant to the Treaty of Paris, signed on December 10, 1898, which
ended the Spanish-American War. Puerto Ricans have been citizens of the United
States since 1917. In 1950, after a long evolution toward greater
self-government, Congress enacted Public Law 600, which provided that the
existing political, economic and fiscal relationship between Puerto Rico and the
United States would remain the same, but Puerto Rico would be authorized to
draft and approve its own Constitution, guaranteeing a republican form of
government. The Constitution of Puerto Rico was drafted by a Constituent
Commission, approved in a special referendum by the people of Puerto Rico,
amended and ratified by the United States Congress, and subsequently approved by
the President of the United States. The official designation of the Government
or body politic has henceforth been "Estado Libre Asociado," which literally
translates to "Free Associated State," and has been called "Commonwealth" by the
United States Government.


The United States and the Commonwealth share a common defense, market and
currency. Puerto Rico exercises virtually the same control over its internal
affairs as any of the fifty states of the United States. However, it differs
from the states in its relationship with the United States federal government.
The people of Puerto Rico are citizens of the United States but do not vote in
national elections (they can only vote in local (Puerto Rico) elections). The
people of the Commonwealth are represented in Congress by a Resident
Commissioner who has a voice in the House of Representatives and limited voting
power. Puerto Rico is a self-governing commonwealth in association with the
United States. The chief of state of the Commonwealth is the President of the
United States. The head of government is an elected Governor. There are two
legislative chambers: the House of Representatives, 51 seats, and the Senate, 27
seats.


While Puerto Rico has authority over its internal affairs, the United States
controls interstate trade, foreign relations and commerce, customs
administration, control of air, land and sea, immigration and emigration,
nationality and citizenship, currency, maritime laws, military service, military
bases, army, navy and air force, declaration of war, constitutionality of laws,
jurisdictions and legal procedures, treaties, radio and television
communications, agriculture, mining and minerals, highways, postal system,
social security, and other areas generally controlled by the federal government
in the United States. Puerto Rican institutions control internal affairs unless
U.S. law is involved, as in matters of public health and pollution. The major
differences between Puerto Rico and the 50 states are Puerto Rico's local
taxation system and exemption from Internal Revenue Code, its lack of voting
representation in either house of the U.S. Congress, the ineligibility of Puerto
Ricans to vote in presidential elections, and its lack of assignation of some
revenues reserved for the states.


Economy. The Commonwealth has established policies and programs directed
principally at developing the manufacturing and services sectors of the economy
and expanding and modernizing the Commonwealth's infrastructure. Domestic and
foreign investment have been stimulated by selective tax exemptions, development
loans, and other financial and tax incentives. Infrastructure expansion and
modernization have been primarily financed by bonds and notes issued by the
Commonwealth, its public corporations and municipalities.


Economic progress has been aided by significant increases in the levels of
education and occupational skills of the Commonwealth's population.


The economy of Puerto Rico is closely linked to the United States economy, as
most of the external factors that affect the Puerto Rico economy (other than oil
prices) are determined by the policies and performance of the mainland economy.
These external factors include exports, direct investment, the amount of federal
transfer payments, the level of interest rates, the rate of inflation, and
tourist expenditures. During fiscal year 2008 (July 2007 through June 2008),
approximately 74% of Puerto Rico's exports went to the United States mainland,
which was also the source of approximately 47% of Puerto Rico's imports.


Puerto Rico's economy has been in a recession that began in the fourth
quarter of fiscal year 2006, a fiscal year in which the real gross national
product grew by only 0.5%. Although Puerto Rico's economy is closely linked with
the United States economy, for fiscal years 2007 and 2008, Puerto Rico's real
gross national product decreased by 1.9% and 2.5%, respectively, while the
United States economy grew at a rate of 1.8% and 2.8%, respectively, during the
same periods. According to the Planning Board's recent projections, the economic
contraction has accelerated in fiscal year 2009, with an expected further
reduction in real gross national product of 4.8%. While this trend was expected
to continue in fiscal year 2010, the expected positive impact of the U.S.
federal and local economic stimulus measures led the Planning Board to announce
revised projections for fiscal year 2010 reflecting a projected increase in real
gross national product of 0.7%. The Planning Board is also projecting increases
in real gross national product of 0.9% and 1.0% for fiscal years 2011 and 2012,
respectively.


The dominant sectors of the Puerto Rico economy are manufacturing and
services. The manufacturing sector has undergone fundamental changes over the
years as a result of increased emphasis on higher wage, high technology
industries, such as pharmaceuticals, electronics, computers, microprocessors,
professional and scientific instruments and certain high technology machinery
and equipment. The service sector, including finance, insurance, real estate,
wholesale and retail trade and tourism, also plays a major role in the economy.
It ranks second only to manufacturing in contribution to the gross domestic
product and leads all sectors in providing employment.


The Puerto Rico Planning Board's preliminary reports of the performance of
the Puerto Rico's economy during fiscal year 2008 indicate that the economy
registered a decrease of 2.5% over fiscal year 2007 in total real gross product.
Gross product in fiscal year 2000 was $41.4 billion and gross product in fiscal
year 2008 was $60.8 billion. This represents an increase in gross product of
46.9% from fiscal year 2000 to fiscal year 2008. Aggregate personal income
increased from $52.3 billion in fiscal year 2007 to $56.2 billion in fiscal year
2008, and personal income per capita increased from $13,269 in fiscal year 2007
to $14,237 in fiscal year 2008. The significant increase in personal income in
fiscal year 2008 is due in part to the tax rebate program implemented by the
Bush Administration during that fiscal year.


Among the variables contributing to the decrease in gross national product
were the continuous contraction of the manufacturing and construction sectors,
as well as the current contraction of U.S. economic activity. Furthermore, the
decline in Puerto Rico's gross national product was not offset by the federal
tax rebates due to the high levels of oil prices during fiscal year 2008. The
persistent high level of the price of oil and its derivatives (such as gasoline)
during that period served to reduce the income available for other purchases
and, thereby, negatively affected domestic demand. Due to the Commonwealth's
dependence on oil for power generation and gasoline (in spite of its recent
improvements in power-production diversification), the high level of oil prices
accounted for an increased outflow of local income in fiscal year 2008. The
current difficulties associated with the financial crisis resulted in lower
short-term interest rates, but this did not translate into an improvement in the
construction sector.


According to the Department of Labor and Human Resources Household Employment
Survey, total employment for fiscal year 2009 averaged 1,168,200, a decrease of
4.1% from the previous fiscal year. The unemployment rate for fiscal year 2009
was 13.496, an increase from 11% for fiscal year 2008.


Debt, Revenues and Expenditures. The Constitution of Puerto Rico limits the
amount of general obligation (full faith and credit) debt that can be issued or
guaranteed by the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth's policy has been and continues
to be to maintain the amount of such debt prudently below the constitutional
limitation. Direct debt of the Commonwealth is supported by Commonwealth taxes.
Debt of municipalities of the Commonwealth, other than bond anticipation notes,
is supported by real and personal property taxes and municipal license taxes. As
of December 31, 2008, total public sector debt of the Commonwealth was equal to
$56,455 million.


The General Fund revenue projection for fiscal year 2009 was $8.488 billion,
an increase of $235 million, or 2.8%, from estimated net revenues for fiscal
year 2008 of $8.253 billion. The Commonwealth's budgeted expenditures for fiscal
year 2009 of $9.484 billion exceed projected revenues by approximately $1
billion.


Bond Ratings. As of January 2010, all outstanding general obligation bonds of
the Commonwealth are rated BBB- (with a stable outlook) by Standard & Poor's
Ratings Services ("S&P") and Baa3 by Moody's Investors Service, Inc.
("Moody's"). Any explanation concerning the significance of such ratings must be
obtained from the rating agencies. There is no assurance that any ratings will
continue for any period of time or that they will not be revised or withdrawn.


Local Issuances. It should be noted that the creditworthiness of obligations
issued by local Puerto Rican issuers may be unrelated to the creditworthiness of
obligations issued by the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and there is no
obligation on the part of the Commonwealth to make payment on such local
obligations in the event of default.


The information provided above is only a brief summary of the complex factors
affecting the financial situation in Puerto Rico and is derived from sources
that are generally available to investors and are believed to be accurate. No
independent verification has been made as to the accuracy or completeness of any
of the preceding information. It is based in part on information obtained from
Commonwealth and local agencies in Puerto Rico or contained in Official
Statements for various Puerto Rico obligations.



Insurance on the Bonds



Insurance has been obtained by the issuer of bonds or by a prior owner of
such bonds prior to the deposit of such bonds in an Insured Trust guaranteeing
prompt payment of interest and principal, when due, in respect of the bonds in
such Insured Trust. See "The Trusts--Objective and Bond Selection" in Prospectus
Part II. The premium for any insurance policy or policies obtained by an issuer
of bonds has been paid by such issuer, and any such policy or policies are
non-cancelable and will continue in force so long as the bonds so insured are
outstanding and the preinsured bond insurer remains in business.


Bond Insurers. The following is a description of the various preinsured bond
insurers:


ACA Financial Guaranty Corporation ("ACA Financial Guaranty"). ACA Financial
Guaranty is organized and domiciled in the State of Maryland. Since December
2007, ACA Financial Guaranty has not issued any new financial guaranty insurance
policies and is currently operating as a runoff insurance company.


On August 8, 2008, ACA Financial Guaranty and counterparties to its
structured finance products reached an agreement on a restructuring plan for ACA
Financial Guaranty. The plan, approved by the Maryland Insurance Administration,
provided for settlement of the structured finance obligations and protection for
ACA Financial Guaranty's municipal policyholders. The settlement required that
ACA Financial Guaranty make a $209 million cash payment and a distribution of
surplus notes. The surplus notes provide the former collateralized debt
obligation ("CDO") counterparties and certain other counterparties with
approximately a 95% economic interest in ACA Financial Guaranty. ACA Financial
Guaranty continues to operate as a runoff insurance company and focus on
actively monitoring its remaining insured municipal obligations.


As of September 30, 2012, ACA Financial Guaranty had total admitted assets of
$436.3 million and total liabilities of $328.7 million, resulting in a surplus
as regards policyholders of $107.6 million.


On December 15, 2008, S&P raised the financial strength, financial
enhancement, and issuer credit ratings on ACA Financial Guaranty to B from CCC,
with a developing outlook. The upgrade reflected the positive effects of the
restructuring transaction completed in August 2008 that settled all outstanding
CDO and reinsurance exposures of the company, including the significantly
deteriorated CDO of asset-backed securities ("ABS") transactions, eliminating a
requirement to post a significant amount of collateral to the CDO of ABS
counterparties. At the same time, S&P also withdrew the ratings at ACA Financial
Guaranty's request.


The information relating to ACA Financial Guaranty contained above has been
furnished by ACA Financial Guaranty or the rating agencies. No representation is
made herein as to the accuracy or adequacy of such information, or as to the
existence of any adverse changes in such information subsequent to the date
hereof.


Ambac Assurance Corporation ("Ambac Assurance"). Ambac Financial Group, Inc.
("Ambac"), headquartered in New York City, is a holding company incorporated in
the state of Delaware on April 29, 1991. Ambac's activities are divided into two
business segments: (i) financial guarantee and (ii) financial services. Ambac
provides financial guarantee insurance for public and structured finance
obligations through its principal operating subsidiary, Ambac Assurance. As a
holding company, Ambac is largely dependent on dividends from Ambac Assurance to
pay principal and interest on its indebtedness and to pay its operating
expenses.


On June 5, 2008, S&P downgraded Ambac Assurance's insurance financial
strength rating to AA from AAA, with negative implications. On June 19, 2008,
Moody's downgraded Ambac Assurance's insurance financial strength rating from
Aaa to Aa3, with a negative outlook. Moody's June 19, 2008 downgrade of Ambac
Assurance's insurance financial strength rating reflects Ambac Assurance's
overall credit profile in the current environment, including its significantly
constrained new business prospects, its impaired financial flexibility and
increased expected and stress loss projections among its mortgage-related risk
exposures relative to previous estimates. On November 5, 2008, Moody's
downgraded the insurance financial strength rating of Ambac Assurance from Aa3
to Baa1, with a developing outlook, as a result of greater than expected
mortgage-related losses in the third quarter. On November 19, 2008, S&P lowered
its insurance financial strength rating of Ambac Assurance to A from AA, with a
negative outlook. The November 19, 2008 rating action on Ambac Assurance
reflects S&P's view that Ambac Assurance's exposures in the U.S. residential
mortgage sector and particularly the related collateralized debt obligation
structures have been a source of significant and comparatively
greater-than-competitor losses and will continue to expose the company to the
potential for further adverse loss development. On April 13, 2009, Moody's
downgraded the insurance financial strength rating of Ambac Assurance from Baa1
to Ba3, with a developing outlook, reflecting Ambac Assurance's weakened
business position and very constrained financial flexibility, as well as its
weakened risk adjusted capitalization, as Moody's loss estimates on residential
mortgage-backed securities ("RMBS") have increased significantly. In Moody's
view, these higher loss estimates increase the estimated capital required to
support Ambac Assurance's sizable direct RMBS portfolio (including securities
owned as well as securities guaranteed) and also the insurer's large portfolio
of ABS CDO risks. On June 24, 2009, S&P lowered the counterparty credit,
financial strength, and financial enhancement ratings of Ambac Assurance to BBB
from A with negative implications. The June 24, 2009 rating action on Ambac
Assurance reflects S&P's view that Ambac Assurance is effectively in runoff and
the likelihood of the company continuing as an operating entity capable of
writing new business has decreased significantly. On July 28, 2009, S&P lowered
the counterparty credit, financial strength, and financial enhancement ratings
of Ambac Assurance to CC from BBB, with a developing outlook. The July 28, 2009
rating action on Ambac Assurance reflects S&P's view of the significant
deterioration in the Ambac Assurance's insured portfolio of nonprime RMBS and
related CDOs, which has required the company to strengthen reserves to account
for higher projected claims. In S&P's view, the additional reserves will have a
significant negative effect on operating results, which will likely cause
surplus to decline to below regulator required minimums. On July 29, 2009,
Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength rating of Ambac Assurance
from Ba3 to Caa2, with a developing outlook, reflecting Moody's belief that, as
a result of Ambac Assurance's recently announced large loss reserve increase and
credit impairment charge estimated for the second quarter of 2009 which would
reduce Ambac Assurance's regulatory capital to levels below the required minimum
threshold, there will be increased pressure on Ambac Assurance's counterparties
to commute outstanding exposures on terms that could imply a distressed
exchange. On March 25, 2010, S&P revised the counterparty credit, financial
strength, and financial enhancement ratings of Ambac Assurance to R from CC (an
issuer rated "R" by S&P is under regulatory supervision because of its financial
condition). S&P's March 25, 2010 rating action resulted following a directive by
the Commissioner of Insurance of the State of Wisconsin to Ambac Assurance to
establish a segregated account for certain insured exposure, primarily policies
related to credit derivatives, RMBS, and other structured finance transactions.
On March 26, 2010, Moody's placed the Caa2 insurance financial strength rating
of Ambac Assurance on review for possible upgrade. On November 23, 2010, Moody's
affirmed Ambac's Caa2 insurance financial strength rating, with a developing
outlook. On November 30, 2010, S&P withdrew the counterparty credit, financial
strength, and financial enhancement ratings of Ambac at the company's request.
The November 30, 2010 rating action followed a directive by the Commissioner of
Insurance of the State of Wisconsin to Ambac to establish a segregated account
for certain insured exposure, primarily policies related to credit derivatives,
residential mortgage-backed securities, and other structured finance
transactions. On April 7, 2011, Moody's withdrew the insurance financial
strength rating of Ambac Assurance.


There have been a number of developments with respect to ratings actions by
the rating agencies. As a result of these rating agency actions, as well as
investor concern with respect to these actions, Ambac Assurance and its
operating subsidiaries have been able to originate only a de minimis amount of
new financial guarantee business since November 2007, and no new business in
2009. As a result, Ambac is no longer competing for new business.


On March 25, 2010, Ambac announced that, at the direction of the Office of
the Commissioner of Insurance of the State of Wisconsin ("OCI"), Ambac Assurance
had established a segregated account for certain of its liabilities, primarily
policies related to credit derivatives, RMBS and other structured finance
transactions. This action derives from the OCI's view that immediate action is
necessary to address Ambac Assurance's financial position. In conjunction with
the establishment of the segregated account, the OCI has commenced
rehabilitation proceedings with respect to liabilities contained in the
segregated account in order to facilitate an orderly run-off and/or settlement
of those specific liabilities. On June 7, 2010 Ambac announced that it had
commuted all of its remaining CDOs of ABS and that certain other non-CDO of ABS
exposures would be commuted within the next twelve months.


On November 8, 2010, Ambac announced that it has filed for a voluntary
petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (the
"Bankruptcy Code") in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern
District of New York (the "Bankruptcy Court"). Ambac will continue to operate in
the ordinary course of business as "debtor-in-possession" under the jurisdiction
of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the
Bankruptcy Code and the orders of the Bankruptcy Court. Ambac Assurance is
subject to insurance regulatory requirements of the States of Wisconsin and New
York, and the other jurisdictions in which it is licensed to conduct business.


Ambac Assurance's statutory policyholder surplus and qualified statutory
capital were $100.0 million and $628.3 million at September 30, 2012,
respectively as compared to $495.3 million and $684.6 million as of December 31,
2011, respectively. As of September 30, 2012, total stockholders' deficit was
$3.49 billion; at December 31, 2011, total stockholders' deficit was $3.15
billion. This increased deficit was primarily caused by the net loss for the
nine months ended September 30, 2012, partially offset by unrealized gains on
investment securities during the period.


The information relating to Ambac Assurance contained above has been
furnished by Ambac Assurance or the rating agencies. No representation is made
herein as to the accuracy or adequacy of such information, or as to the
existence of any adverse changes in such information subsequent to the date
hereof.


Assured Guaranty Corp. ("Assured Guaranty") and Assured Guaranty Municipal
Corp. ("Assured Municipal") (formerly Financial Security Assurance Inc.
("FSA")). Assured Guaranty, a subsidiary of Assured Guaranty Ltd. ("Assured"),
is organized in the State of Maryland and provides financial guaranty insurance
to both the municipal and structured finance sectors. Assured Municipal, also a
subsidiary of Assured, is a separately capitalized company organized in the
State of New York and provides municipal bond insurance.


In January 2009, Assured Guaranty finalized an agreement with CIFG Assurance
North America, Inc. to assume a diversified portfolio of financial guaranty
contracts totaling approximately $13.3 billion of net par outstanding. Assured
Guaranty received $75.6 million, which included $85.7 million of upfront
premiums net of ceding commissions and approximately $12.2 million of future
installments related to this transaction.


On July 1, 2009, Assured completed the purchase of Financial Security
Assurance Holdings Ltd., the parent of financial guaranty insurance company,
FSA, from Dexia Holdings Inc. Effective November 9, 2009, FSA was renamed
Assured Guaranty Municipal Corp. In certain states, Assured Guaranty Municipal
Corp. may operate under its prior name, Financial Security Assurance Inc.


On June 24, 2010, S&P published a Full Analysis in which it affirmed its
"AAA" financial strength ratings of Assured Guaranty and Assured Municipal,
reflecting S&P's view of the companies' dominant market position in the bond
insurance industry and their strong combined capital position. On October 25,
2010, S&P lowered the counterparty credit and financial strength ratings of both
Assured Guaranty and Assured Municipal to AA+ from AAA, with a stable outlook.
The downgrades reflect S&P's view of a struggling financial guarantee market,
each company's weak statutory operating performance, and also the quality of
each company's capital within S&P's capital adequacy analysis. On November 30,
2011 S&P lowered the counterparty credit and financial strength ratings of both
Assured Guaranty and Assured Municipal to AA- from AA+, with a stable outlook.
The November 30, 2011 downgrades reflect S&P's view that Assured Guaranty and
Assured Municipal do not maintain enough capital to mitigate the largest obligor
concentrations for a higher rating.


On November 21, 2008, Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength
rating of Assured Guaranty from Aaa to Aa2, primarily reflecting Moody's updated
view on Assured Guaranty's exposure to weakness inherent in the financial
guaranty business model. Also on November 21, 2008, Moody's downgraded the
insurance financial strength rating of FSA from Aaa to Aa3, reflecting Moody's
view of FSA's diminished business and financial profile resulting from its
exposure to losses on U.S. mortgage risks and disruption in the financial
guaranty business more broadly. On November 12, 2009, Moody's downgraded the
insurance financial strength rating of Assured Guaranty from Aa2 to Aa3, with a
negative outlook. Moody's November 12, 2009 downgrade results from Moody's
review of the performance of Assured's RMBS exposures. Moody's said that adverse
trends in RMBS loss estimates have had varying effects on Assured's main
insurance subsidiaries. On March 5, 2010, Moody's confirmed the insurance
financial strength ratings of both Assured Guaranty and Assured Municipal at
Aa3, with a negative outlook. On January 17, 2013, Moody's downgraded the
insurance financial strength ratings of Assured Guaranty to A3 from Aa3 and of
Assured Municipal to A2 from Aa3, both with a stable outlook. The January 17,
2013 downgrade reflects Moody's reassessment of the business franchise, expected
future profitability and financial flexibility of Assured Guaranty and Assured
Municipal.


Assured's third quarter 2012 net income declined to $142 million from $761
million in third quarter 2011 due primarily to the effects of changes in credit
spreads on the fair value of credit derivatives, offset in part by a decline in
loss expense, which was significantly higher in the prior year due mainly to the
effects of declining discount rates in the third quarter of 2011. Non-GAAP
operating income in third quarter 2012 was $166 million, an increase from
operating income in third quarter 2011, due primarily to higher net earned
premiums due to refundings, accelerations and terminations, lower loss expense,
and a lower effective tax rate on operating income. As of September 30, 2012,
Assured Guaranty had total assets of $5.28 billion and total liabilities of
$4.13 billion, resulting in total shareholder equity of $1.15 billion. As of
September 30, 2012, Assured Municipal had total assets of $10.74 billion and
total liabilities of $7.64 billion, resulting in total shareholder equity of
$3.10 billion.

Build America Mutual Assurance Company ("BAM"). BAM is a New York domiciled
mutual insurance company owned by the issuers of municipal bonds who use BAM to
insure their debt obligations. BAM officially launched on July 23, 2012 and
began writing policies in September of 2012.


On July 23, 2012, S&P assigned an initial rating of AA to BAM's financial
strength and counterparty credit ratings, with a stable outlook. These ratings
based upon S&P's view that BAM holds a very strong competitive position with low
industry risk, along with extremely strong capital adequacy and strong operating
performance.


As of September 30, 2012 BAM had total net admitted assets of $518.9 million
and total liabilities of $27.9 million, resulting in a surplus as regards
policyholders of $491.0 million.

Berkshire Hathaway Assurance Corp ("BHAC"). BHAC is a bond insurance company
created by Berkshire Hathaway, Inc. ("Berkshire") in December 2007 and is
licensed to write financial guarantee insurance in 49 states.


On April 11, 2008, S&P assigned an initial rating of AAA to BHAC's insurance
financial strength, with a stable outlook. On April 25, 2008, Moody's assigned
an initial rating of Aaa to BHAC's insurance financial strength, with a stable
outlook. On April 8, 2009, Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength
rating of BHAC from Aaa to Aa1, with a stable outlook. This downgrade reflects
Moody's view concerning "the impact on Berkshire's key businesses of the severe
decline in equity markets over the past year as well as the protracted economic
recession." Moody's noted that Berkshire is also exposed to heightened
volatility in its earnings and capital base related to market value fluctuations
within its large portfolio of equity derivatives. On February 4, 2010, S&P
lowered the financial strength rating of BHAC from AAA to AA+, with a stable
outlook. The February 4, 2010 rating action was taken in anticipation of
Berkshire's acquisition of Northern Santa Fe Corporation reflecting S&P's
expectation that a significant part of the internal cash for the acquisition
will come from Berkshire's core insurance operations and that Berkshire's
overall capital adequacy has weakened to levels no longer consistent with a AAA
rating and is not expected to return to extremely strong levels in the near
term.


As of September 30, 2012, Berkshire had total assets of $424.1 billion and
total liabilities of $235.0 billion, resulting in total shareholder equity of
$189.1 billion.

CIFG Assurance North America, Inc. ("CIFG"). CIFG Holding, Inc. is the
holding company for the CIFG group of financial guaranty insurance and
reinsurance companies ("CIFG Group"), including CIFG Assurance North America,
Inc., a New York corporation and its subsidiaries. The CIFG Group is actively
managing the runoff of a portfolio of insured structured finance, municipal and
infrastructure risks. On September 29, 2010, CIFG and CIFG Guaranty entered into
a merger agreement which resulted in CIFG Guaranty merging into CIFG (together
with related transactions, the "CIFG Merger").


On March 6, 2008, Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength ratings
of CIFG from Aaa to A1, with a stable outlook. This rating action reflected
Moody's assessment of CIFG's weakened capitalization, impaired business
opportunities, and uncertain strategic direction, as a result, in part, of its
exposures to the U.S. residential mortgage market. Moody's believed that CIFG's
significant exposure to the mortgage sector, especially ABS CDOs is indicative
of a risk posture far greater than would be consistent with a Aaa rating going
forward. On May 20, 2008, Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength
ratings of CIFG to Ba2 from A1, with direction uncertain, reflecting the high
likelihood that, absent material developments, the company would fail minimum
regulatory capital requirements in New York and Bermuda due to expected
significant increases in modeled loss reserves on ABS CDOs. In Moody's view, the
breach of such regulatory capital requirements would put the company in a
precarious position, especially in light of the solvency provisions embedded in
its CDS exposures. On October 28, 2008, Moody's downgraded the insurance
financial strength rating of CIFG from Ba2 to B3, with direction uncertain,
reflecting Moody's expectation of substantially higher mortgage-related losses
arising from CIFG's insured portfolio, as well as the possibility that certain
troubled exposures could be commuted. On January 22, 2009, Moody's upgraded the
insurance financial strength rating of CIFG from B3 to Ba3, with a developing
outlook, reflecting the strengthened capital adequacy profile of CIFG following
its restructuring and the commutation of substantially all of its ABS CDO risks.
Also on January 22, 2009, S&P raised the insurance financial strength rating of
CIFG to BB from B, with a developing outlook. S&P's January 22, 2009 upgrade
results from the completion of CIFG's restructuring plan involving key
policyholders, creditors, and equity owners (counterparties) who had hedged
their ABS CDO and commercial real estate CDO exposures with CIFG and which were
significantly affected by defaults and downgrades of the underlying collateral.
On June 15, 2009, S&P lowered the counterparty credit, financial strength, and
financial enhancement ratings of CIFG to CC from BB, with a negative outlook,
reflecting S&P's view of the significant deterioration in the company's insured
portfolio of nonprime RMBS which has necessitated that CIFG strengthen reserves
to account for the higher projected claims. On August 20, 2009, Moody's
downgraded the insurance financial strength ratings of CIFG from Ba3to Caa2,
resulting from significant deterioration in the company's remaining insured
portfolio since January, 2009 when CIFG initiated a broad restructuring. On
November 11, 2009, Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength ratings
of CIFG from Caa2 to Ca. Also on November 11, 2009, Moody's announced that it
will withdraw the insurance financial strength rating of CIFG. The November 11,
2009 rating actions reflect Moody's view that material deterioration in CIFG's
insured portfolio adversely affected the guarantor's capital adequacy profile
and Moody's believes that CIFG may no longer have sufficient financial resources
to pay all insurance claims. On February 16, 2010, S&P withdrew the counterparty
credit, financial strength, and financial enhancement ratings of CIFG.


As of September 30, 2012, CIFG had net admitted assets of $742.3 million and
total liabilities of $385.5 million. CIFG's statutory surplus as of September
30, 2012 is approximately $356.7 million, a decrease of approximately $227.8
million from approximately $584.5 million at December 31, 2011. This decrease is
primarily attributable to unpaid losses and loss adjustment expense reserves
established for student loans of approximately $252.3 million, which is
partially offset by other income statement balances resulting in a net loss of
approximately $227.0 million and an increase in contingency reserves of
approximately $3.5 million.

the accuracy or adequacy of such information, or as to the existence of any
adverse changes in such information subsequent to the date hereof.


Financial Guaranty Insurance Company ("FGIC"). FGIC is a wholly owned
subsidiary of FGIC Corporation. The company was engaged in the business of
providing financial guaranty insurance and other forms of credit enhancement for
public finance and structured finance obligations. In January 2008, FGIC
voluntarily ceased writing financial guaranty policies concerning new or
additional risks.


The deterioration in the U.S. housing and mortgage markets and the global
credit markets, which accelerated in the fourth quarter of 2007 and continued
through the fourth quarter of 2009, has adversely affected the company's
business, results of operations and financial condition. Specifically, the
company incurred significant losses related to its exposure to certain ABS CDOs,
which are backed primarily by subprime RMBS, and to certain RMBS, primarily
backed by first-lien or second-lien mortgages. These losses have resulted in a
substantial reduction of FGIC's statutory policyholders' surplus over time. On
November 24, 2009, the New York State Insurance Department, the predecessor to
the New York State Department of Financial Services, issued an order pursuant to

Section 1310 of the New York Insurance Law requiring FGIC to, among other
things, suspend paying any and all claims. FGIC was subsequently unable to
eliminate the impairment of its policyholders' surplus through an out-of-court
Surplus Restoration Plan. On June 11, 2012, Benjamin M. Lawsky, Superintendent
of Financial Services of the State of New York (the "Superintendent") filed a
verified petition with the Supreme Court of the State of New York for an order
of rehabilitation (i) appointing the Superintendent as rehabilitator
("Rehabilitator") of FGIC, (ii) directing the Rehabilitator to take possession
of the property and assets of FGIC and to conduct the business thereof, and

(iii) directing the Rehabilitator to take steps towards the removal of the
causes and conditions which have made FGIC's rehabilitation proceeding (the
"Rehabilitation Proceeding") necessary. FGIC consented to the commencement of
the Rehabilitation Proceeding.


Prior to the fourth quarter of 2007, FGIC's financial strength was rated
"Aaa" by Moody's "AAA" by S&P, and "AAA" by Fitch Ratings, Inc. ("Fitch").
Moody's, S&P and Fitch have since completed several assessments of FGIC's
capital adequacy in relation to the company's exposure to ABS CDOs which are
backed primarily by subprime RMBS, and its exposure to first-lien and
second-lien RMBS. As a result of these assessments, Moody's, S&P and Fitch
downgraded the financial strength ratings of FGIC. As of March 31, 2008, Fitch
had downgraded FGIC from AA to BBB with Rating Watch Negative; Moody's had
downgraded FGIC from A3 to Baa3; and S&P had downgraded FGIC from A to BB. On
June 20, 2008, Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength rating of
FGIC from Baa3 to B1, reflecting FGIC's severely impaired financial flexibility
and proximity to minimum regulatory capital requirements relative to Moody's
estimates of expected case losses. On November 24, 2008, S&P lowered its
insurance financial strength rating of FGIC to CCC from BB, with a negative
outlook. S&P's November 24, 2008 downgrade results from FGIC's exposure to
nonprime and second-lien mortgages and related CDO of ABS. On December 19, 2008,
Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength rating of FGIC from B1 to
Caa1, with a negative outlook, reflecting Moody's expectation of higher
mortgage-related losses arising from FGIC's insured portfolio and the
constrained liquidity and financial flexibility of the holding company. On March
24, 2009, Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength rating of FGIC
from Caa1 to Caa3, with a negative outlook, reflecting Moody's expectation of
higher mortgage-related losses arising from FGIC's insured portfolio,
insufficient claims paying resources to cover Moody's estimate of expected loss,
and the constrained liquidity and financial flexibility of FGIC's holding
company. Also on March 24, 2009, Moody's withdrew the insurance financial
strength rating of FGIC. On April 22, 2009, S&P lowered the counterparty credit,
financial strength, and financial enhancement ratings of FGIC to CC from CCC,
with a negative outlook. Also on April 22, 2009, S&P withdrew the ratings on
FGIC and the counterparty credit rating on the holding company, FGIC
Corporation, because of S&P's expectation that timely and comprehensive
financial information will no longer be available.


As of September 30, 2012, FGIC had net admitted assets of approximately $2.1
billion and total liabilities of approximately $5.8 billion.


On August 4, 2010, FGIC Corporation announced that it had filed a voluntary
petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the
Southern District of New York. None of FGIC Corporation's subsidiaries or
affiliates, including FGIC, are part of the Chapter 11 filing.


The information relating to FGIC and its affiliates contained above has been
furnished by FGIC or the rating agencies. No representation is made herein as to
the accuracy or adequacy of such information, or as to the existence of any
adverse changes in such information subsequent to the date hereof.


National Public Finance Guarantee Corporation ("National Guarantee")
(formerly MBIA Insurance Corp. of Illinois ("MBIA Illinois")). MBIA, Inc., a
Connecticut corporation, conducts its financial guarantee business through
though its wholly-owned subsidiaries MBIA Insurance Corporation ("MBIA Corp."),
which writes global structured finance and non-U.S. public finance financial
guarantee insurance, and National Guarantee, which writes U.S. public finance
guarantees.


On February 18, 2009, MBIA, Inc., the parent company of MBIA Corp., announced
the restructuring of its financial guaranty insurance operations following the
approval of the New York and Illinois insurance regulators. The restructuring
involved the segregation of its financial guaranty insurance operations into two
separately capitalized sister companies, with National Guarantee assuming the
risk associated with its U.S. municipal exposures, and with MBIA Corp. insuring
the remainder of the portfolio, including all international and structured
finance exposures. Business ceded to MBIA Corp. from FGIC in 2008 has been
assigned to National Guarantee. To provide additional protection for its
municipal bond policyholders, National Guarantee has also issued second-to-pay
policies for the benefit of the policyholders covered by the reinsurance and
assignment. The second-to-pay policies, which are a direct obligation of
National Guarantee, will be held by The Bank of New York Mellon as insurance
trustee. These policies provide that if MBIA Corp. or FGIC, as applicable, do
not pay valid claims of their policyholders, the policyholders will then be able
to make a claim directly against National Guarantee under the second-to-pay
policies. On March 19, 2009, MBIA Illinois formally changed its name to National
Public Finance Guarantee Corporation. Effective December 1, 2009, National
Guarantee was redomesticated to the State of New York and is subject to
insurance regulations and supervision of the State of New York. National
Guarantee is a wholly owned subsidiary of MBIA, Inc. and independently
capitalized with $5.6 billion in claims-paying resources as of December 31,
2010. In certain states, National Public Finance Guarantee Corporation may
operate under its prior name, MBIA Insurance Corp. of Illinois.


On June 5, 2008, S&P downgraded MBIA Corp.'s insurance financial strength
rating to AA from AAA. On June 19, 2008, Moody's downgraded the insurance
financial strength ratings of MBIA Corp. and its insurance affiliates from Aaa
to A2. Moody's June 19, 2008 downgrade of MBIA Corp. and its insurance
affiliates reflects MBIA Corp.'s limited financial flexibility and impaired
franchise, as well as the substantial risk within its portfolio of insured
exposures and a movement toward more aggressive capital management within the
group. On November 7, 2008, Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength
rating of MBIA Corp. and its insurance affiliates from A2 to Baa1, with a
developing outlook. Moody's November 7, 2008 downgrade of MBIA Corp. and its
insurance affiliates reflects MBIA Corp.'s diminished business and financial
profile resulting from its exposure to losses from U.S. mortgage risks and
disruption in the financial guaranty business more broadly. On February 18,
2009, Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength rating of MBIA Corp.
from Baa1 to B3, with a developing outlook, reflecting MBIA Corp.'s substantial
reduction in claims-paying resources relative to the remaining higher-risk
exposures in its insured portfolio, given the removal of capital, and the
transfer of unearned premium reserves associated with the ceding of its
municipal portfolio to MBIA Illinois, as well as the continued deterioration of
MBIA Corp.'s insured portfolio of largely structured credits, with stress
reaching sectors beyond residential mortgage-related securities. Also on
February 18, 2009, S&P lowered the counterparty credit, financial strength, and
financial enhancement ratings of MBIA Corp. to BBB+ from AA, with a negative
outlook. The February 18, 2009 rating action on MBIA Corp. reflects S&P's view
that MBIA Corp.'s retained insured portfolio lacks sufficient sector diversity
and with time could become more concentrated, and that MBIA Corp.'s 2005-2007
vintage direct RMBS, CDO of ABS, and other structured exposures are subject to
continued adverse loss development that could erode capital adequacy. At the
same time, S&P lowered the counterparty credit and financial strength ratings of
MBIA Illinois to AA- from AA, reflecting MBIA Illinois's uncertain business
prospects and capital. On June 5, 2009, S&P lowered the counterparty credit,
financial strength, and financial enhancement ratings of MBIA Corp. to BBB from
BBB+, with a negative outlook, resulting from MBIA Corp.'s increased loss
assumptions on its 2005-2007 vintage direct RMBS and CDO of ABS and a change in
the assumed tax benefit of tax-loss carryforwards. Also on June 5, 2009, S&P
lowered the counterparty credit, financial strength, and financial enhancement
ratings of National Guarantee to A from AA-, with a negative outlook, reflecting
S&P's view of National Guarantee's uncertain business and capital-raising
prospects. On September 28, 2009, S&P lowered the counterparty credit, financial
strength, and financial enhancement ratings of MBIA Corp. to BB+ from BBB, with
a negative outlook, reflecting S&P's view that macroeconomic conditions continue
to contribute to losses on the group's structured finance products. On December
22, 2010 S&P lowered the counterparty credit, financial strength, and financial
enhancement ratings of MBIA Corp. to B from BB+, with a negative outlook,
reflecting increased stress case loss projections. Also on December 22, 2010 S&P
lowered the counterparty credit, financial strength, and financial enhancement
ratings of National Guarantee to BBB from A, with a developing outlook.


As of September 30, 2012, National Guarantee had total net admitted assets of
$5.9 billion and total liabilities of $4.1 billion, resulting in a surplus as
regard policyholders of $1.8 billion.


As of September 30, 2012, MBIA, Inc. and its subsidiaries had total assets of
$22.1 billion and total liabilities of $19.6 billion. MBIA, Inc.'s total
shareholders' equity as of September 30, 2012 was $2.6 billion, increasing from
$1.7 billion as of December 31, 2011.


The information relating to MBIA and its affiliates contained above has been

Radian Asset Assurance, Inc. ("Radian"). Radian Group Inc. ("Radian Group"),
headquartered in Philadelphia, provides private mortgage insurance and related
risk mitigation products and services to mortgage lenders nationwide through its
principal operating subsidiary, Radian Guaranty Inc. ("Radian Guaranty").
Radian, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Radian Guaranty, is domiciled and licensed
in New York as a financial guaranty insurer. In the third quarter of 2008,
Radian discontinued writing any new financial guaranty business, including
accepting reinsurance.


On March 12, 2009, Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength rating
of Radian, as well as the ratings of its operational affiliates, from A3 to Ba1,
with a stable outlook, reflecting the substantial deterioration in the credit
profile of Radian Guaranty, coupled with increased loss estimates on Radian's
pooled corporate exposures. On November 24, 2009, S&P lowered the financial
strength, financial enhancement, and corporate credit ratings of Radian to BB
from BBB- and left the ratings on CreditWatch with negative implications,
reflecting S&P's view that adverse loss development in Radian's insured
portfolio has resulted in higher capital charges and could result in further
losses. On December 22, 2009, S&P lowered the financial strength, financial
enhancement, and corporate credit ratings of Radian to BB- from BB, with a
negative outlook.


As of September 30, 2012, Radian Group had total assets of $6.45 billion and
total liabilities of $5.43 billion. As of September 30, 2012, Radian had a
statutory policyholders' surplus of $1.02 billion and a contingency reserve of
$290.9 million.


The information relating to Radian and its affiliates contained above has
been furnished by Radian or the rating agencies. No representation is made
herein as to the accuracy or adequacy of such information, or as to the
existence of any adverse changes in such information subsequent to the date
hereof.


Syncora Guarantee Inc. ("Syncora Guarantee") (formerly XL Capital Assurance
Inc. ("XLCA")). Syncora Guarantee, a wholly owned subsidiary of Syncora Holdings
Ltd. ("Syncora Holdings"), is a New York domiciled financial guarantee insurance
company which provides credit enhancement and protection products to the public
finance and structured finance markets throughout the United States and
internationally.


In February 2008, Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength ratings
of XLCA to A3 from Aaa. On June 20, 2008, Moody's downgraded the insurance
financial strength rating of XLCA from A3 to B2, reflecting XLCA's severely
impaired financial flexibility and proximity to minimum regulatory capital
requirements relative to Moody's estimates of expected case losses. On October
24, 2008, Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength rating of Syncora
Guarantee from B2 to Caa1. On November 18, 2008, S&P lowered its insurance
financial strength rating of Syncora Guarantee to B from BBB- with developing
expectations. S&P's November 18, 2008 downgrade resulted from the Syncora
Guarantee's delay in implementing its restructuring plan and slow progress in
its negotiations with counterparties of its CDO of ABS exposure. On January 29,
2009, S&P lowered the issuer credit and financial strength ratings of Syncora
Guarantee to CC from B, with a negative outlook. S&P's January 29, 2009
downgrade resulted from S&P's recent update to its distressed exchange criteria.
On March 9, 2009, Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength rating of
Syncora Guarantee from Caa1 to Ca, with a developing outlook, as a result of the
large loss reserve and credit impairment charges taken by Syncora Guarantee on
its mortgage-related exposures during the fourth quarter, which have resulted in
a $2.4 billion statutory deficit at Syncora Guarantee as of December 31, 2008.
On April 27, 2009, S&P revised the financial strength and financial enhancement
ratings of Syncora Guarantee to R from CC (an issuer rated "R" by S&P is under
regulatory supervision because of its financial condition). Also on April 27,
2009, S&P revised the counterparty credit rating of Syncora Guarantee to D from
CC (an issuer rated "D" by S&P has failed to pay one or more of its financial
obligation when it became due). S&P's April 27, 2009 rating actions resulted
from Syncora Guarantee's announcement that pursuant to an order of the New York
Insurance Department ("NYID"), the company must suspend any and all claims
payments until it has restored its policyholders' surplus to a level greater
than or equal to $65 million, the minimum the state requires. On July 28, 2010,
S&P withdrew the D counterparty credit rating and the R financial strength and
financial enhancement ratings of Syncora Guarantee. S&P's July 28, 2010 ratings
actions resulted from S&P's belief that there is not sufficient information to
judge Syncora Guarantee's claims paying ability.


As of September 30, 2012, Syncora Guarantee had total assets of $1.17 billion
and total liabilities of $639 million, resulting in a policyholders' surplus of
$504.2 million.


On July 20, 2010, Syncora Holdings announced that Syncora Guarantee has
completed its remediation plan sufficient to meet its minimum statutory
policyholder surplus requirements and address previously announced short and
medium term liquidity issues. Also on July 20, 2010, Syncora Holdings announced
that the NYID had approved Syncora Guarantee's plan for the payment of accrued
and unpaid claims and for the payment of new claims as they become due in the
ordinary course of business, resulting in the recommencement of claim payments
by Syncora Guaranty on regularly scheduled payment dates occurring on or after
July 21, 2010.

Portfolio Administration



The Trustee is empowered to sell, for the purpose of redeeming Units tendered
by any Unitholder, and for the payment of expenses for which funds may not be
available, such of the bonds designated by the Supervisor as the Trustee in its
sole discretion may deem necessary. The Supervisor, in designating such bonds,
will consider a variety of factors including (a) interest rates, (b) market
value and (c) marketability. The Sponsor, in connection with the Quality Trusts
and Investment Grade Municipal Trusts, may direct the Trustee to dispose of
bonds if the Supervisor determines that there exists any default in payment of
principal or interest, institution of certain legal proceedings, default under
other documents adversely affecting debt service, default in payment of
principal or interest or other obligations of the same issuer, decline in
projected income pledged for debt service on revenue bonds or decline in price
or occurrence of other market or credit factors, including advance refunding
(i.e., the issuance of refunding securities and the deposit of the proceeds
thereof in trust or escrow to retire the refunded securities on their respective
redemption dates), so that in the opinion of the Supervisor the retention of
such bonds would be detrimental to the interest of the Unitholders. In
connection with the Insured Trusts to the extent that bonds are sold which are
current in payment of principal and interest in order to meet redemption
requests and defaulted bonds are retained in the portfolio in order to preserve
the related insurance protection applicable to said bonds, the overall quality
of the bonds remaining in such Trust's portfolio will tend to diminish. Except
as described in this section and in certain other unusual circumstances for
which it is determined by the Trustee to be in the best interests of the
Unitholders or if there is no alternative, the Trustee is not empowered to sell
bonds from an Insured Trust which are in default in payment of principal or
interest or in significant risk of such default and for which value has been
attributed for the insurance obtained by such Insured Trust. Because of
restrictions on the Trustee under certain circumstances, the Sponsor may seek a
full or partial suspension of the right of Unitholders to redeem their Units in
an Insured Trust. See "Rights of Unitholders--Redemption of Units" in Prospectus
Part II. The Sponsor is empowered, but not obligated, to direct the Trustee to
dispose of bonds in the event of an advanced refunding.


The Trust is structured as a "regulated investment company" for federal tax
purposes. The Sponsor may direct the reinvestment of proceeds of the sale of
bonds if the sale is the direct result of serious adverse credit factors which,
in the opinion of the Sponsor, would make retention of the bonds detrimental to
the Trust. In such a case, the Sponsor may, but is not obligated to, direct the
reinvestment of sale proceeds in any other securities that meet the criteria for
inclusion in the trust on the Date of Deposit. The Sponsor may also instruct the
Trustee to take action necessary to ensure that such a Trust continues to
satisfy the qualifications of a regulated investment company and to avoid
imposition of tax on undistributed income of the Trust.


The Sponsor will generally instruct the Trustee to reject any offer made by
an issuer of any of the bonds to issue new obligations in exchange or
substitution for any bond pursuant to a refunding or refinancing plan, except
that the Sponsor may instruct the Trustee to accept or reject such an offer or
to take any other action with respect thereto as the Sponsor may deem proper if

(1) the issuer is in default with respect to such bond or (2) in the written
opinion of the Sponsor the issuer will probably default with respect to such
bond in the reasonably foreseeable future. Any obligation so received in
exchange or substitution will be held by the Trustee subject to the terms and
conditions of the Trust Agreement to the same extent as bonds originally
deposited thereunder. Within five days after the deposit of obligations in
exchange or substitution for underlying bonds, the Trustee is required to give
notice thereof to each Unitholder of the Trust thereby affected, identifying the
bonds eliminated and the bonds substituted therefor. Except as stated herein and
under "Trust Administration--Replacement Bonds" in Prospectus Part II regarding
the substitution of Replacement Bonds for Failed Bonds, the acquisition by a
Trust of any securities other than the bonds initially deposited is not
permitted.


If any default in the payment of principal or interest on any bonds occurs
and no provision for payment is made therefor within 30 days, the Trustee is
required to notify the Sponsor thereof. If the Sponsor fails to instruct the
Trustee to sell or to hold such bonds within 30 days after notification by the
Trustee to the Sponsor of such default, the Trustee may in its discretion sell
the defaulted bond and not be liable for any depreciation or loss thereby
incurred.

personal securities transactions. The purpose of the code is to avoid potential
conflicts of interest and to prevent fraud, deception or misconduct with respect
to your Trust.


If the Sponsor shall fail to perform any of its duties under the Trust
Agreement or become incapable of acting or shall become bankrupt or its affairs
are taken over by public authorities, then the Trustee may (i) appoint a
successor Sponsor at rates of compensation deemed by the Trustee to be
reasonable and not exceeding amounts prescribed by the Securities and Exchange
Commission, (ii) terminate the Trust Agreement and liquidate the Trusts as
provided therein or (iii) continue to act as Trustee without terminating the
Trust Agreement.



Trustee Information



The Trustee is The Bank of New York Mellon, a trust company organized under
the laws of New York. The Bank of New York Mellon has its principal unit
investment trust division offices at 2 Hanson Place, 12th Floor, Brooklyn, New
York 11217, telephone (800) 856-8487. The Bank of New York Mellon is subject to
supervision and examination by the Superintendent of Banks of the State of New
York and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and its deposits
are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to the extent permitted
by law.


The duties of the Trustee are primarily ministerial in nature. It did not
participate in the selection of bonds for the portfolios of any of the Trusts.
In accordance with the Trust Agreement, the Trustee shall keep proper books of
record and account of all transactions at its office for the Trusts. Such
records shall include the name and address of every Unitholder of the Trusts.
Such books and records shall be open to inspection by any Unitholder at all
reasonable times during the usual business hours. The Trustee shall make such
annual or other reports as may from time to time be required under any
applicable state or Federal statute, rule or regulation. The Trustee is required
to keep a certified copy or duplicate original of the Trust Agreement on file in
its office available for inspection at all reasonable times during the usual
business hours by any Unitholder, together with a current list of the bonds held
in the Trusts.


Under the Trust Agreement, the Trustee or any successor trustee may resign
and be discharged of the trusts created by the Trust Agreement by executing an
instrument in writing and filing the same with the Sponsor. The Trustee or
successor trustee must mail a copy of the notice of resignation to all
Unitholders then of record, not less than 60 days before the date specified in
such notice when such resignation is to take effect. The Sponsor upon receiving
notice of such resignation is obligated to appoint a successor trustee promptly.
If, upon such resignation, no successor trustee has been appointed and has
accepted the appointment within 30 days after notification, the retiring Trustee
may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a
successor. The Sponsor may remove the Trustee and appoint a successor trustee as
provided in the Trust Agreement at any time with or without cause. Notice of
such removal and appointment shall be mailed to each Unitholder by the Sponsor.
Upon execution of a written acceptance of such appointment by such successor
trustee, all the rights, powers, duties and obligations of the original trustee
shall vest in the successor. The resignation or removal of a Trustee becomes
effective only when the successor trustee accepts its appointment as such or
when a court of competent jurisdiction appoints a successor trustee. Any
corporation into which a Trustee may be merged or with which it may be
consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger or consolidation to
which a Trustee shall be a party, shall be the successor trustee. The Trustee
must be a banking corporation organized under the laws of the United States or
any state and having at all times an aggregate capital, surplus and undivided
profits of not less than $5,000,000.



Taxation



The prospectus contains a discussion of certain material U.S. federal income
tax issues concerning your Trust and the purchase, ownership and disposition of
Trust Units. The discussion below supplements the prospectus discussion and is
qualified in its entirety by the prospectus discussion. Prospective investors
should consult their own tax advisors with regard to the federal tax
consequences of the purchase, ownership, or disposition of Trust Units, as well
as the tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, locality, non-U.S.
country, or other taxing jurisdiction.


The federal income tax summary below and in the prospectus is based in part
on the advice of counsel to your Trust. The Internal Revenue Service could
disagree with any conclusions set forth in these discussions. In addition, our
counsel was not asked to review the assets to be held by your Trust.


Your Trust intends to elect and to qualify annually as a "regulated
investment company" under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
"Code") and to comply with applicable distribution requirements so that it will
not pay federal income tax on income and capital gains distributed to its
Unitholders.


In addition, your Trust intends to hold a sufficient amount of its assets in
bonds that are exempt from U.S. federal income taxation under Section 103 of the
Code so as to qualify to distribute exempt-interest dividends to you. Such
exempt-interest dividends are not subject to regular U.S. federal income tax,
but may be subject to the alternative minimum tax. Your Trust may hold bonds
issued by the Government of Puerto Rico or by its authority. Such bonds are
exempt from taxation by the U.S. federal government, the government of Puerto
Rico, any state or its political subdivisions, any possession of the United
States, or the District of Columbia.


To qualify for the favorable U.S. federal income tax treatment generally
accorded to regulated investment companies, your Trust must, among other things,

(a) derive in each taxable year at least 90% of its gross income from dividends,
interest, payments with respect to securities loans and gains from the sale or
other disposition of stock, securities or foreign currencies or other income
derived with respect to its business of investing in such stock, securities or
currencies, and net income from qualified publicly traded partnerships; (b)
diversify its holdings so that, at the end of each quarter of the taxable year,

(i) at least 50% of the market value of the Trust's assets is represented by
cash and cash items (including receivables), U.S. Government securities, the
securities of other regulated investment companies and other securities, with
such other securities of any one issuer generally limited for the purposes of
this calculation to an amount not greater than 5% of the value of the Trust's
total assets and not greater than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of
such issuer, and (ii) not more than 25% of the value of its total assets is
invested in the securities (other than U.S. Government securities or the
securities of other regulated investment companies) of any one issuer, or two or
more issuers which the Trust controls (by owning 20% or more of the issuer's
outstanding voting securities) and which are engaged in the same, similar or
related trades or businesses, or the securities of qualified publicly traded
partnerships; and (c) distribute at least 90% of its investment company taxable
income (which includes, among other items, dividends, interest and net
short-term capital gains in excess of net long-term capital losses but excludes
net capital gain, if any) and at least 90% of its net tax-exempt interest income
each taxable year.


As a regulated investment company, your Trust generally will not be subject
to U.S. federal income tax on its investment company taxable income (as that
term is defined in the Code, but without regard to the deduction for dividends
paid), if any, and net capital gain (the excess of net long-term capital gain
over net short-term capital loss), if any, that it distributes to Unitholders.
Your Trust intends to distribute to its Unitholders, at least annually,
substantially all of its investment company taxable income and net capital gain,
if any. If your Trust retains any net capital gain or investment company taxable
income, it will generally be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate
rates on the amount retained. In addition, amounts not distributed on a timely
basis in accordance with a calendar year distribution requirement are subject to
a nondeductible 4% excise tax unless, generally, your Trust distributes during
each calendar year an amount equal to the sum of (1) at least 98% of its
ordinary income (not taking into account any capital gains or losses) for the
calendar year, (2) at least 98.2% of its capital gains in excess of its capital
losses (adjusted for certain ordinary losses) for the one-year period ending
October 31 of the calendar year, and (3) any ordinary income and capital gains
for previous years that were not distributed or taxed during those years. To
prevent application of the excise tax, your Trust intends to make its
distributions in accordance with the calendar year distribution requirement.
Further, if your Trust retains any net capital gain, the Trust may report the
retained amount as undistributed capital gains in a notice to Unitholders who,
if subject to federal income tax on long-term capital gains (i) will be required
to include in income for federal income tax purposes, as long-term capital gain,
their share of such undistributed amount, and (ii) will be entitled to credit
their proportionate share of the tax paid by the Trust against their federal
income tax liabilities if any, and to claim refunds to the extent the credit
exceeds such liabilities. A distribution will be treated as paid on December 31
of the current calendar year if it is declared by your Trust in October,
November or December with a record date in such a month and paid by your Trust
during January of the following calendar year. These distributions will be
taxable to Unitholders in the calendar year in which the distributions are
declared, rather than the calendar year in which the distributions are received.


If your Trust failed to qualify as a regulated investment company or failed
to satisfy the 90% distribution requirement in any taxable year, the Trust would
be taxed as an ordinary corporation on its taxable income (even if such income
were distributed to its Unitholders) and all distributions out of earnings and
profits would be taxed to Unitholders as ordinary dividend income.


Investors in the Trust may be subject to state, local, or foreign taxes in
connection with their investment in the Trust. Investors are encouraged to
consult their own tax advisors regarding the specific federal (including the
federal alternative minimum tax), state, local, and foreign tax consequences
that may affect them as a result of an investment in the Trust.



Termination of the Trust Agreement



A Trust may be terminated at any time by consent of Unitholders of 75% of the
Units of such Trust then outstanding or by the Trustee when the value of such
Trust, as shown by any semi-annual evaluation, is less than 20% of the original
principal amount of bonds. A Trust will be liquidated by the Trustee in the
event that a sufficient number of Units not yet sold are tendered for redemption
by the Underwriters, including the Sponsor, so that the net worth of such Trust
would be reduced to less than 40% of the initial principal amount of such Trust.
If a Trust is liquidated because of the redemption of unsold Units by the
Underwriters, the Sponsor will refund to each purchaser of Units the entire
sales charge paid by such purchaser. The Trust Agreement provides that each
Trust shall terminate upon the redemption, sale or other disposition of the last
bond held in such Trust, but in no event shall it continue beyond the end of the
year preceding the fiftieth anniversary of the Trust Agreement in the case of an
IM-IT, an IM-IT Laddered Series, an Investment Grade Municipal, an Investment
Grade Municipal Limited Maturity Trust, an IM-IT Discount, a U.S. Territorial
IM-IT, a High Grade Tax-Exempt Bond, 20+ Year Series, a Long-Term State or a
National Quality Trust, or beyond the end of the year preceding the twentieth
anniversary of the Trust Agreement in the case of a Strategic Municipal Trust
Intermediate Series, an IM-IT Limited Maturity Trust, an IM-IT Intermediate
Trust, a State Intermediate Trust, a State Intermediate Laddered Maturity Trust,
an IM-IT Short Intermediate Trust, an Investment Grade Municipal Intermediate
Trust and a Quality Municipals Income Trust Limited Maturity Series. In the
event of termination of any Trust, written notice thereof will be sent by the
Trustee to each Unitholder of such Trust at his address appearing on the
registration books of a Trust maintained by the Trustee. Within a reasonable
time thereafter the Trustee shall liquidate any bond then held in such Trust and
shall deduct from the funds of such Trust any accrued costs, expenses or
indemnities provided by the Trust Agreement, including estimated compensation of
the Trustee and costs of liquidation and any amounts required as a reserve to
provide for payment of any applicable taxes or other government charges. The
sale of bonds in the Trust upon termination may result in a lower amount than
might otherwise be realized if such sale were not required at such time. For
this reason, among others, the amount realized by a Unitholder upon termination
may be less than the principal amount or par amount of bonds represented by the
Units held by such Unitholder. The Trustee shall then distribute to each
Unitholder his share of the balance of the Interest and Principal Accounts. With
such distribution the Unitholder shall be furnished a final distribution
statement of the amount distributable. At such time as the Trustee in its sole
discretion shall determine that any amounts held in reserve are no longer
necessary, it shall make distribution thereof to Unitholders in the same manner.


Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with final distributions to
Unitholders of an Insured Trust, it should be noted that because the portfolio
insurance obtained by an Insured Trust, if any, is applicable only while bonds
so insured are held by such Trust, the price to be received by such Trust upon
the disposition of any such bond which is in default, by reason of nonpayment of
principal or interest, will not reflect any value based on such insurance.
Therefore, in connection with any liquidation, it shall not be necessary for the
Trustee to, and the Trustee does not currently intend to, dispose of any bond or
bonds if retention of such bond or bonds, until due, shall be deemed to be in
the best interest of Unitholders, including, but not limited to, situations in
which a bond or bonds so insured have deteriorated market prices resulting from
a significant risk of default. Since the Preinsured Bonds will reflect the value
of the related insurance, it is the present intention of the Sponsor not to
direct the Trustee to hold any of such Preinsured Bonds after the date of
termination. All proceeds received, less applicable expenses, from insurance on
defaulted bonds not disposed of at the date of termination will ultimately be
distributed to Unitholders of record as of such date of termination as soon as
practicable after the date such defaulted bond or bonds become due and
applicable insurance proceeds have been received by the Trustee.



Description of Ratings



Standard & Poor's, A Division of the McGraw-Hill Companies. A Standard &
Poor's long-term debt obligation credit rating is a current opinion of the
creditworthiness of an obligor with respect to a specific debt obligation. This
opinion of creditworthiness may take into consideration the creditworthiness of
guarantors, insurers or other forms of credit enhancement on the obligation.


The long-term debt obligation credit ratings are not a recommendation to
purchase, sell or hold the debt obligation, inasmuch as they do not comment as
to market price or suitability for a particular investor.


The long-term debt obligation credit ratings are based on current information
furnished by the obligor or obtained by Standard & Poor's from other sources it
considers reliable. Standard & Poor's does not perform an audit in connection
with any credit rating and may, on occasion, rely on unaudited financial
information. Credit ratings may be changed, suspended or withdrawn as a result
of changes in, or unavailability of, such information, or based on other
circumstances.


The long-term debt obligation credit ratings are based, in varying degrees,
on the following considerations:


I.   Likelihood of payment--capacity and willingness of the obligor to meet
its financial commitment on an obligation in accordance with the terms
of the obligation.


II.  Nature of and provisions of the obligation.


III. Protection afforded by, and relative position of, the obligation in
the event of bankruptcy, reorganization or other arrangement under the
laws of bankruptcy and other laws affecting creditors' rights.


The credit rating definitions are expressed in terms of default risk. As
such, they pertain to senior obligations of an entity. Junior obligations are
typically rated lower than senior obligations to reflect the lower priority in
bankruptcy, as noted above. (Such differentiation applies when an entity has
both senior and subordinate obligations, secured and unsecured obligations or
operating company and holding company obligations.) Accordingly, in the case of
junior debt, the rating may not conform exactly with the category definition.


AAA--An obligation rated "AAA" has the highest rating assigned by Standard &
Poor's. The obligor's capacity to meet its financial commitment on the
obligation is extremely strong.


AA--An obligation rated "AA" differs from the highest-rated obligations only
in small degree. The obligor's capacity to meet its financial commitment on the
obligation is very strong.


A--An obligation rated "A" is somewhat more susceptible to adverse effects of
changes in circumstances and economic conditions than obligations in
higher-rated categories. However, the obligor's capacity to meet its financial
commitment on the obligation is still strong.


BBB--An obligation rated "BBB" exhibits adequate protection parameters.
However, adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances are more likely
to lead to a weakened capacity of the obligor to meet its financial commitment
on the obligation.


Obligations rated "BB," "B," "CCC," "CC" and "C" are regarded as having
significant speculative characteristics. "BB" indicates the least degree of
speculation and "C" the highest. While such obligations will likely have some
quality and protective characteristics, these may be outweighed by large
uncertainties or major exposures to adverse conditions.


Plus (+) or Minus (-): The ratings from "AA" to "CCC" may be modified by the
addition of a plus or minus sign to show relative standing within the major
rating categories.


NR--This indicates that no rating has been requested, that there is
insufficient information on which to base a rating or that Standard & Poor's
does not rate a particular obligation as a matter of policy.


Moody's Investors Service. Moody's municipal ratings are opinions of the
investment quality of issuers and issues in the U.S. municipal and tax-exempt
markets. As such, these ratings incorporate Moody's assessment of the default
probability and loss severity of these issuers and issues. The default and loss
content for Moody's municipal long-term rating scale differs from Moody's
general long-term rating scale.


Municipal ratings are based upon the analysis of five primary factors
relating to municipal finance: market position, financial position, debt levels,
governance, and covenants. Each of the factors is evaluated individually and for
its effect on the other factors in the context of the municipality's ability to
repay its debt.


Aaa--Issuers or issues rated Aaa demonstrate the strongest creditworthiness
relative to other U.S. municipal or tax-exempt issuers or issues.


Aa--Issuers or issues rated Aa demonstrate very strong creditworthiness
relative to other U.S. municipal or tax-exempt issuers or issues.


A--Issuers or issues rated A present above-average creditworthiness relative
to other U.S. municipal or tax-exempt issuers or issues.


Baa--Issuers or issues rated Baa represent average creditworthiness relative
to other U.S. municipal or tax-exempt issuers or issues.


Obligations rated "Ba," "B," "Caa," "Ca" and "C" are regarded as having
significant speculative characteristics. "Ba" indicates the least degree of
speculation and "C" the highest. While such obligations will likely have some
quality and protective characteristics, these may be outweighed by large
uncertainties or major exposures to adverse conditions.


Note: Moody's appends numerical modifiers 1, 2, and 3 to each generic rating
category from Aa through Caa. The modifier 1 indicates that the issuer or
obligation ranks in the higher end of its generic rating category; the modifier
2 indicates a mid-range ranking; and the modifier 3 indicates a ranking in the
lower end of that generic rating category.



Equivalent Taxable Estimated Current Return Tables



As of the date of the Prospectus Part I, the following tables show the
approximate taxable estimated current returns for individuals that are
equivalent to tax-exempt estimated current returns under combined federal and
state taxes (where applicable) using the published marginal federal and state
tax rates currently scheduled to be in effect in 2013. These tables illustrate
approximately what you would have to earn on taxable investments to equal the
tax-exempt estimated current return in your income tax bracket. The tables
assume that federal taxable income is equal to state income subject to tax, and
for cases in which more than one state rate falls within a federal bracket, the
state rate corresponding to the highest income within that federal bracket is
used. The combined federal and state tax rates shown reflect the fact that state
tax payments are currently deductible for federal tax purposes. The tables do
not reflect any local taxes, any alternative minimum taxes or any taxes other
than personal income taxes. The tables do not show the approximate taxable
estimated current returns for individuals that are subject to the alternative
minimum tax. The tables do not reflect the effect of federal or state
limitations (if any) on the amount of allowable itemized deductions or credits.
See "Federal Tax Status" in Prospectus Part II for a more detailed discussion of
federal tax rules applicable to an investment in the Trust.

A comparison of tax-free and equivalent taxable estimated current returns
with the returns on various taxable investments is one element to consider in
making an investment decision. The Sponsor may from time to time in its
advertising and sales materials compare the then current estimated returns on
the Trusts and returns over specified periods on other similar Invesco
sponsored unit investment trusts with inflation rates and with returns on
taxable investments such as corporate or U.S. Government bonds, bank CDs and
money market accounts or money market funds, each of which has investment
characteristics that may differ from those of the Trusts. U.S. Government bonds,
for example, are backed by the full faith and credit of the federal government.
Money market accounts and money market funds provide stability of principal, but
pay interest at rates that vary with the condition of the short-term debt
market. The investment characteristics of the Trusts are described more fully in
the prospectus.



Estimated Cash Flows to Unitholders



The table below sets forth the per Unit estimated monthly distributions of
interest and principal to Unitholders. The table assumes no changes in expenses,
no changes in the current interest rates, no exchanges, redemptions, sales or
prepayments of the underlying bonds prior to maturity or expected retirement
date and the receipt of principal upon maturity or expected retirement date. To
the extent the foregoing assumptions change actual distributions will vary.

Re:      Invesco Unit Trusts, Municipal Series 1145 (the "Trust")




Ladies and Gentlemen:


We have acted as counsel for Invesco Capital Markets, Inc. as depositor and
sponsor (the "Depositor") of the Trust in connection with the deposit of
securities (the "Securities") therein pursuant to the Indenture referred to
below, by which the Trust was created and under which the units of fractional
undivided interest (collectively, the "Units") have been issued. Pursuant to the
Indenture, the Depositor has transferred to the Trust certain bonds and
contracts to purchase certain bonds together with irrevocable letters of credit
to be held by the Trustee upon the terms and conditions set forth in the
Indenture. (All bonds to be acquired by the Trust are collectively referred to
as the "Bonds.")


In connection with our representation, we have examined the originals or
certified copies of the following documents relating to the creation of the
Trust, the deposit of the Securities and the issuance and sale of the Units: (a)
the Standard Terms and Conditions of Trust For Invesco Unit Trusts, Municipal
Series, Effective for Unit Investment Trusts Established On and After December
4, 2012 (Including Invesco Unit Trusts, Municipal Series 1130 and Subsequent
Series) and the Trust Agreement of even date herewith relating to the Trust
(collectively, the "Indenture") among the Depositor, Invesco Investment Advisers
LLC, as supervisor, The Bank of New York Mellon, as trustee (the "Trustee"), and
Standard & Poor's Securities Evaluations, Inc., a subsidiary of the McGraw-Hill
Companies, Inc., as evaluator; (b) the Closing Memorandum relating to the
deposit of the Securities in the Trust, which includes certification by an
authorized officer of the Depositor with respect to certain factual matters
contained therein ("Officer's Certification"); (c) the Notification of
Registration on Form N-8A and the Registration Statements on Form N-8B-2, as
amended, relating to the Trust, as filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the "Commission") pursuant to the Investment Company Act of 1940, as
amended (the "1940 Act"); (d) the Registration Statement on Form S-6
(Registration No. 333-185915) filed with the Commission pursuant to the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "1933 Act"), and all Amendments thereto
(said Registration Statement, as amended by said Amendment(s) being herein
called the "Registration Statement"); (e) the proposed form of final prospectus
(the "Prospectus") relating to the Units, which is expected to be filed with the
Commission this day; (f) the Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws of the
Depositor, as amended, each certified to by an authorized officer of the
Depositor; and (g) certificates or telegrams of public officials as to matters
set forth upon therein.


We have assumed the genuineness of all agreements, instruments and documents
submitted to us as originals and the conformity to originals of all copies
thereof submitted to us. We have also assumed the genuineness of all signatures
and the legal capacity of all persons executing agreements, instruments and
documents examined or relied upon by us.


Where matters are stated to be "to the best of our knowledge" or "known to us,"
our knowledge is limited to the actual knowledge of those attorneys in our
office who have performed services for the Trust, their review of documents
provided to us by the Depositor in connection with this engagement and inquiries
of officers of the Depositor, the results of which are reflected in the
Officer's Certification. We have not independently verified the accuracy of the
matters set forth in the written statements or certificates upon which we have
relied. We have not reviewed the financial statements, compilation of the Bonds
held by the Trust, or other financial or statistical data contained in the
Registration Statement and the Prospectus, as to which we understand you have
been furnished with the reports of the accountants appearing in the Registration
Statement and the Prospectus. In addition, we have made no specific inquiry as
to whether any stop order or investigatory proceedings have been commenced with
respect to the Registration Statement or the Depositor nor have we reviewed
court or governmental agency dockets.


Statements in this opinion as to the validity, binding effect and enforceability
of agreements, instruments and documents are subject: (i) to limitations as to
enforceability imposed by bankruptcy, reorganization, moratorium, insolvency and
other laws of general application relating to or affecting the enforceability of
creditors' rights, and (ii) to limitations under equitable principles governing
the availability of equitable remedies.


We are not admitted to the practice of law in any jurisdiction but the State of
New York and we do not hold ourselves out as experts in or express any opinion
as to the laws of other states or jurisdictions except as to matters of federal
law. No opinion is expressed as to the effect that the law of any other
jurisdiction might have upon the subject matter of the opinions expressed herein
under applicable conflicts of law principles, rules or regulations or otherwise.
Based on and subject to the foregoing, we are of the opinion that:


(1) The Indenture has been duly authorized and executed and delivered by an
authorized officer of the Depositor and is a valid and binding obligation of the
Depositor in accordance with its terms.


(2) The registration of the Units on the registration books of the Trust by the
Trustee has been duly authorized by the Depositor in accordance with the
provisions of the Indenture and issued for the consideration contemplated
therein, the Units will constitute fractional undivided interests in the Trust,
will be entitled to the benefits of the Indenture, and will conform in all
material respects to the description thereof contained in the Prospectus. Upon
payment of the consideration for the Units as provided in the Indenture and the
Registration Statement, the Units will be validly issued, fully paid and
non-assessable by the Trust.


We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to the
Registration Statement and to the use of our name in the Registration Statement
and in the related Prospectus. This opinion is intended solely for the benefit
of the addressee in connection with the issuance of the Units of the Trust and
may not be relied upon in any other manner or by any other person without our
express written consent.


Very truly yours,

Ladies and Gentlemen:


We are acting as your counsel in connection with the execution and delivery
by you of a certain trust agreement, dated as of today (the "Indenture"), among
Invesco Capital Markets, Inc. (the "Depositor"), Invesco Investment Advisers
LLC, as supervisor (the "Supervisor"), Standard & Poor's Securities Evaluations,
Inc., a subsidiary of McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. (the "Evaluator"), and you, as
Trustee, establishing Invesco Unit Trusts, Municipal Series 1145 (the "Trust"),
and the registration by you, as Trustee, on the registration books of the Trust,
of ownership of all of the units of fractional undivided interests ("Units") in
the Trust, as set forth in the prospectus, dated today, for filing as an
amendment to the registration statement heretofore filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (respectively
the "Prospectus" and the "Registration Statement"), relating to the Trust (File
Number 333-185915). The Trust consists of the securities set forth in the
Prospectus (including delivery statements relating to contracts for the purchase
of certain securities not yet delivered and cash, cash equivalents, an
irrevocable letter of credit, or a combination thereof, in the amount required
to pay for such purchase upon the receipt of such securities) defined in the
Indenture as "Securities" and listed in Schedule A to the Indenture (such
securities, delivery statements and cash, cash equivalents or letter of credit
being herein called the "Underlying Securities").


We have examined the Indenture and originals (or copies certified or
otherwise identified to our satisfaction) of such other instruments,
certificates and documents, as we have deemed necessary or appropriate for the
purpose of rendering this opinion letter. In such examination, we have assumed
the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents submitted
to us as originals and the conformity to the original documents of all documents
submitted to us as copies. As to any facts material to this opinion letter, we
have, when relevant facts were not independently established, relied upon the
aforesaid instruments, certificates and documents.


Based on the foregoing, we are of the opinion that:


1.   The Bank of New York Mellon is a corporation organized under the laws of
the State of New York with the powers of a trust company under the Banking
Law of the State of New York.


2.   The execution of the Indenture is within the authorization of the executing
officers of The Bank of New York Mellon.


3.   The Indenture is in proper form for execution and delivery by you as
Trustee.


4.   Upon receipt by you of the Underlying Securities you may properly register
the units on the registration books of the Trust in the name of Cede & Co.,
as nominee of Depository Trust Company ("DTC"). Upon receipt of advice of
the effectiveness of the Registration Statement, you may cause the Units to
be credited to, or upon the order of, the Depositor, as provided in the
Closing Memorandum being executed and delivered today by the parties to the
Indenture.

Unit Trusts
Unit Trusts provide a simple, convenient way to gain exposure to an asset class, market sector or investment discipline. Like a traditional mutual fund, unit trusts hold a pool of securities (such as stocks, bonds or alternative investments) chosen by a professional investment manager and are available with a wide range of objectives and risk levels.

Unit Trusts
Unit Trusts provide a simple, convenient way to gain exposure to an asset class, market sector or investment discipline. Like a traditional mutual fund, unit trusts hold a pool of securities (such as stocks, bonds or alternative investments) chosen by a professional investment manager and are available with a wide range of objectives and risk levels.

Build America Bonds Income Trust (BABS0037)
	
		





Objective
		  	
		
		Build America Bonds are new taxable municipal bonds created from the $787 billion stimulus package passed in 2009 by Congress. The purpose of the bonds is to build and repair America's roads, bridges, transit and rail systems, schools, ports and inland waterways, and other infrastructure, while stimulating the U.S. economy and job growth. Van Kampen Unit Trusts provide investors with convenient access to a diversified portfolio of taxable municipal bonds with a low minimum investment, consistent monthly income, daily liquidity and transparency.




Investment objective The trust seeks to provide a high level of current income and to preserve capital. The trust invests in a portfolio of long-term taxable municipal bonds, primarily consisting of "Build America Bonds". As of the date of deposit, the trust will invest at least 80% of its assets in Build America Bonds, and may include other taxable municipal bonds for purposes of diversification.

1Estimated current return (ECR) is based on the estimated annual income as a percentage of the current price of the units. Estimated long-term return (ELTR) is calculated using a formula which (1) takes into consideration and determines and factors in the relative weightings of the market values, yields (which takes into account the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts) and estimated retirement of all the bonds in the trust and (2) takes into account the expenses and sales charge associated with each trust unit. There can be no assurance that either the estimated current return or ELTR will be realized in the future and an investor's units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
2The ELTR life represents the estimated life of the bonds in a Trust's portfolio determined for the purposes of calculating Estimated Long-Term Return.
3Estimated Annual Income Per Unit is as of close the most recent business day and is based on the estimated cash flows per unit. This amount will vary with changes in expenses, interest rates and the maturity, call or sale of bonds.
4Estimated Daily Rate of Accrual represents the annual interest from the securities within the portfolio divided by the number of days on which interest is calculated annually.
5Represents the principal amount of the underlying bonds per unit. Bonds may be sold to meet redemptions, to pay expenses, and in other limited circumstances. The sale of bonds will affect the principal amount of bonds included in the trust and as a result the principal amount of bonds per unit. There can be no assurance that a unitholder will receive this par value per unit in the future.


For Fixed-Income trusts, "S.F." indicates a sinking fund is established with respect to an issue of bonds.The trust portfolio is provided for informational purposes only and should not be deemed as a recommendation to buy or sell the individual securities shown above.



 Important Information About Benchmarks





About risk



There is no assurance that a unit investment trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust.An investment in the trust should be made with an understanding of the risks associated therewith, such as the inability of the issuer or an insurer to pay the principal of or interest on a bond when due, volatile interest rates, early call provisions and changes to the tax status of the bonds. As interest rates rise, bond prices fall.Investments in this trust may be subject to interest rate risk. If interest rates rise, the value of the bonds in a trust may decline and if interest rates decline the value of the bonds may increase. Also, the longer the period to maturity, the greater the sensitivity to interest rate changes tends to be.In particular, should a Build America Bond's issuer fail to continue to meet the applicable requirements imposed on the bonds as provided by the American Recovery & Reinvestment Act of 2009, it is possible that such issuer may not receive federal cash subsidy payments, impairing the issuer's ability to make scheduled interest payments.The trust may concentrate in bonds of a particular type of issuer. This makes the trust less diversified and subject to a greater risk than a more diversified portfolio.

1The S&P and Moody's ratings apply to the bonds held by the trust, and not the trust itself.   A Standard & Poor's credit rating is a current opinion of the creditworthiness of an obligor with respect to a specific debt obligation. This opinion of creditworthiness may take into consideration the creditworthiness of guarantors, insurers or other forms of credit enhancement on the obligation.  Moody's municipal ratings are opinions of the investment quality of the issues and issues in the US municipal and tax-exempt markets. As such, these ratings incorporate Moody's assessment of the default probability and loss severity of these issuers and issues.


1Estimated current return (ECR) is based on the estimated annual income as a percentage of the current price of the units. Estimated long-term return (ELTR) is calculated using a formula which (1) takes into consideration and determines and factors in the relative weightings of the market values, yields (which takes into account the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts) and estimated retirement of all the bonds in the trust and (2) takes into account the expenses and sales charge associated with each trust unit. There can be no assurance that either the estimated current return or ELTR will be realized in the future and an investor's units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
2The ELTR life represents the estimated life of the bonds in a Trust's portfolio determined for the purposes of calculating Estimated Long-Term Return.
3Estimated Annual Income Per Unit is as of close the most recent business day and is based on the estimated cash flows per unit. This amount will vary with changes in expenses, interest rates and the maturity, call or sale of bonds.
4Estimated Daily Rate of Accrual represents the annual interest from the securities within the portfolio divided by the number of days on which interest is calculated annually.
5Represents the principal amount of the underlying bonds per unit. Bonds may be sold to meet redemptions, to pay expenses, and in other limited circumstances. The sale of bonds will affect the principal amount of bonds included in the trust and as a result the principal amount of bonds per unit. There can be no assurance that a unitholder will receive this par value per unit in the future.

About risk



There is no assurance that a unit investment trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust.An investment in the trust should be made with an understanding of the risks associated therewith, such as the inability of the issuer or an insurer to pay the principal of or interest on a bond when due, volatile interest rates, early call provisions and changes to the tax status of the bonds. As interest rates rise, bond prices fall.Investments in this trust may be subject to interest rate risk. If interest rates rise, the value of the bonds in a trust may decline and if interest rates decline the value of the bonds may increase. Also, the longer the period to maturity, the greater the sensitivity to interest rate changes tends to be.In particular, should a Build America Bond's issuer fail to continue to meet the applicable requirements imposed on the bonds as provided by the American Recovery & Reinvestment Act of 2009, it is possible that such issuer may not receive federal cash subsidy payments, impairing the issuer's ability to make scheduled interest payments.The trust may concentrate in bonds of a particular type of issuer. This makes the trust less diversified and subject to a greater risk than a more diversified portfolio.

For individual series that have terminated, performance data quoted is from the deposit date through the termination date.Performance data quoted represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate and units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
Returns are cumulative total returns (not annualized) unless labeled as average annual total returns. All returns reflect trust expenses as incurred and assume reinvestment of income and principal distributions, except for trusts that do not offer the option of reinvesting distributions into additional trust units. Please see the related trust prospectus for additional information. Returns do not reflect taxes.
A trust's performance, especially for short time periods, should not be the sole factor in making your investment decision. Please keep in mind that high, double-digit returns are highly unusual and cannot be sustained. Investors should also be aware that these returns were primarily achieved during favorable market conditions.
Returns With Sales Charge reflect the maximum sales charge that would be payable by an investor upon sale or redemption of units at the end of the applicable period(s). The sales charge includes any initial or deferred sales charges other than creation and development fee. These returns do not reflect any creation and development fee prior to collection (generally the close of the initial offering period). Any creation and development fee is reflected in the returns as of the time of payment. by a trust. These returns reflect any contingent deferred sales charges only if the charges would be payable upon a unit sale or redemption at or prior to the end of the applicable performance period(s). Certain trusts are no longer offered for sale to the public and, as a result, do not publish an offer price or have a sales charge. In these cases, returns will not reflect a sales charge if a trust was not actually offered for sale to the public on the first day of the applicable period because units of the trust could not have been purchased by an investor at that time. These returns will show 'N/A' for With Sales Charge data
Returns Without Sales Charge do not reflect any sales charge and do not reflect any creation and development fee prior to collection (generally the close of the initial offering period). Any creation and development fee is reflected in the returns as of the time of payment by a trust.

There can be no assurance that either the estimated current return or ELTR will be realized in the future and an investor's units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
2The ELTR life represents the estimated life of the bonds in a Trust's portfolio determined for the purposes of calculating Estimated Long-Term Return.
3Estimated Annual Income Per Unit is as of close the most recent business day and is based on the estimated cash flows per unit. This amount will vary with changes in expenses, interest rates and the maturity, call or sale of bonds.
4Estimated Daily Rate of Accrual represents the annual interest from the securities within the portfolio divided by the number of days on which interest is calculated annually.
5Represents the principal amount of the underlying bonds per unit. Bonds may be sold to meet redemptions, to pay expenses, and in other limited circumstances. The sale of bonds will affect the principal amount of bonds included in the trust and as a result the principal amount of bonds per unit. There can be no assurance that a unitholder will receive this par value per unit in the future.


 Important Information About Benchmarks





About risk



There is no assurance that a unit investment trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust.An investment in the trust should be made with an understanding of the risks associated therewith, such as the inability of the issuer or an insurer to pay the principal of or interest on a bond when due, volatile interest rates, early call provisions and changes to the tax status of the bonds. As interest rates rise, bond prices fall.Investments in this trust may be subject to interest rate risk. If interest rates rise, the value of the bonds in a trust may decline and if interest rates decline the value of the bonds may increase. Also, the longer the period to maturity, the greater the sensitivity to interest rate changes tends to be.In particular, should a Build America Bond's issuer fail to continue to meet the applicable requirements imposed on the bonds as provided by the American Recovery & Reinvestment Act of 2009, it is possible that such issuer may not receive federal cash subsidy payments, impairing the issuer's ability to make scheduled interest payments.The trust may concentrate in bonds of a particular type of issuer. This makes the trust less diversified and subject to a greater risk than a more diversified portfolio.
