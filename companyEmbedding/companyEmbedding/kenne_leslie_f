Forward-Looking Statements


      This press release contains statements that the Company believes to be 
      “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private 
      Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements other than 
      statements of historical fact, including, without limitation, statements 
      regarding the Company’s future financial position, business strategy, 
      targets, projected sales, costs, earnings, capital expenditures, debt 
      levels and cash flows, and plans and objectives of management for future 
      operations, are forward-looking statements. When used in this press 
      release, words such as “may,” “will,” “expect,” “intend,” “estimate,” 
      “anticipate,” “believe,” “should,” “project” or “plan” or the negative 
      thereof or variations thereon or similar terminology are generally 
      intended to identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking 
      statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to 
      risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors, some of which are 
      beyond the Company’s control, which could cause actual results to differ 
      materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking 
      statements. These factors include the impact on revenues and margins of 
      the projected decrease in M-ATV production rates; the cyclical nature of 
      the Company’s access equipment, commercial and fire & emergency markets, 
      especially during periods of global economic weakness and tight credit 
      markets; the Company’s ability to produce vehicles under the FMTV 
      contract at targeted margins; the duration of the ongoing global 
      economic weakness, which could lead to additional impairment charges 
      related to many of the Company’s intangible assets and/or a slower 
      recovery in the Company’s cyclical businesses than equity market 
      expectations; the expected level and timing of U.S. Department of 
      Defense (DoD) procurement of products and services and funding thereof; 
      risks related to reductions in government expenditures in light of U.S. 
      defense budget pressures and an uncertain DoD tactical wheeled vehicle 
      strategy; the potential for the U.S. government to competitively bid the 
      Company’s Army and Marine Corps contracts; the consequences of financial 
      leverage associated with the JLG acquisition, which could limit the 
      Company’s ability to pursue various opportunities; the potential for 
      commodity and other raw material costs to rise sharply, particularly in 
      a future economic recovery; risks related to the collectability of 
      receivables, particularly for those businesses with exposure to 
      construction markets; the cost of any warranty campaigns related to the 
      Company’s products; risks related to costs and charges as a result of 
      facilities consolidation and alignment; risks related to production 
      delays arising from supplier quality or production issues; risks 
      associated with international operations and sales, including foreign 
      currency fluctuations and compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices 
      Act; risks related to work stoppages and other labor matters; the 
      potential for disruptions or cost overruns in the Company’s global 
      enterprise system implementation; the potential for increased costs 
      relating to compliance with changes in laws and regulations; and risks 
      related to disruptions in the Company’s distribution networks. 
      Additional information concerning these and other factors is contained 
      in the Company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Early life and education[edit]
In 1970, Kenne graduated from Auburn University with a degree in aerospace engineering and had participated in Auburn's ROTC program, and in 1971, she entered the Air Force. She served as a flight line maintenance officer in operations, and attended the U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School in 1974.[3]
She would later attain a master of science in procurement management from Webster University.[4]
Early career[edit]
After graduating from the Test Pilot School, she served as a test and evaluation project manager, and in test and evaluation supervisory positions.
Kenne has served first as a division chief, and during a second tour, as a deputy director in the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition. She has directed three major programs—the Low Altitude Navigation and Targeting Infrared System for Night, the F-16 and the F-35.
She also has served as Vice Commander of Aeronautical Systems Center, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, and the Sacramento Air Logistics Center, McClellan Air Force Base, Calif. Prior to assuming her current position, Kenne commanded the Electronic Systems Center, Hanscom Air Force Base, Massachusetts.[3]
Later career[edit]
Kenne was Deputy Chief of Staff for Warfighting Integration, Headquarters United States Air Force, Washington, D.C. She was responsible to the United States Secretary of the Air Force and the Chief of staff for forming and executing policy and strategy to integrate command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities to enable more effective employment of air and space power in support of national objectives.
General Kenne also provided guidance and direction to four field operating agencies: the Air Force Command and Control & Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Center; the Air Force Communications Agency; the Air Force Spectrum Management Office; and the Air Force Agency for Modeling and Simulation. She retired from the United States Air Force on September 1, 2003.[3]
In February 2008, she joined SRI International's board of directors.[4]

Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)

The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
