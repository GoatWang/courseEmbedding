FORUMS AND PUBLIC COMMENTSThere may be opportunities for public comment on the Sites, including blogs, testimonials, and other forums (the “Forums”).  The Forums offer an opportunity for communication and information sharing among a variety of participants. AmSurg hopes the Forums provide visitors with a wealth of information from fellow participants and public commentators. However, please take a moment to read these guidelines for participation in the Forums.  These guidelines apply both to content and hyperlinks to external sites posted by Forum contributors.(a) When participating in the Forums, please share your thoughts politely and constructively. While AmSurg encourages discussion of challenging topics, we want to make sure that they take place in a climate of mutual respect. User generated content that is abusive, vulgar, racist, slanderous, harassing, misleading, irrelevant, or otherwise objectionable, or any comment that calls for unlawful or illegal behavior or might result in harm to others is strictly prohibited.(b) User comments do not represent the professional advice or opinions of AmSurg or its personnel. The results of any actions you take based on the comments available in the Forums are your responsibility alone. You are solely responsible and liable for all activities conducted by you in connection with the Forums and for the content of your comments.(c) Users are solely responsible for ensuring that they do not act in any manner which constitutes, or forms a part of a course of conduct amounting to, a violation of any state, federal or other applicable competition law.  If you violate the terms of this Agreement, you may have your access to the Forums suspended and may permanently be banned from using such Forums.  In the event that any user has concerns that posted information is objectionable, the user is encouraged to contact Amsurg at communications@amsurg.com.  Amsurg may remove the comment if removal is necessary.(d) You are not allowed to upload, post or transmit any message, data, code or software that would violate the proprietary rights of AmSurg or others, including unauthorized copyrighted text, images or programs, trade secrets or other confidential proprietary information, or use any trademarks or service marks in an infringing fashion.(e) You are not allowed to post, upload or transmit photos or video of any third party without their express permission.  By uploading, transmitting or posting any photo or video on a Site or Forums, you warrant that you have express permission from all persons appearing in the media.(f) You are not allowed to upload, post or transmit any materials, data or media that includes your personal health information (“PHI”) or the PHI of any third party.(g)(h) You are not allowed to upload, post or transmit any advertisements or solicitations of business, chain letters or pyramid schemes, or to upload, post, or transmit the same posting more than once.AmSurg has no obligation to monitor any Forums on the Sites. However, AmSurg reserves the right to review, modify, distribute, remove or delete any public comment at any time. AmSurg also reserves the right at all times to disclose any information as AmSurg deems necessary to satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, or to edit, refuse to post or to remove any information or materials, in whole or in part, in AmSurg’s sole discretion.By uploading, transmitting or posting any content, you grant AmSurg a perpetual, non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to use, copy, print, display, reproduce, modify, edit, publish, post, transmit, and distribute the content in its entirety or in part for any purpose.

TERMINATION OF SITE/MODIFICATIONS TO SITEAmSurg reserves the right to modify or terminate your access to the Sites (or portions of the Sites) at any time, temporarily or permanently, with or without notice to you.  Sections 1, 3, 4, 5, this Section 6 and 9-20 of these Terms shall survive any termination of these Terms.

You acknowledge and agree that AmSurg will not be liable to you or any third party in the event that AmSurg exercises its right to modify or terminate access to the Sites or portions of the Sites.7.

OTHER SITES, CONTENT, PRODUCTS AND SERVICESAs a convenience to you, the Sites may provide links to websites and access to content, products and services of third parties, including without limitation, AmSurg’s affiliates and strategic partners and other entities with which our connection consists of only a hyperlink (“Linked Sites”).  All Linked Sites are provided only because they may be of interest to Site users.  Information and views contained in Linked Sites are not adopted by AmSurg.You should refer to the separate terms of use, privacy policies, and other rules posted on Linked Sites before you use them.  AmSurg does not author, edit or monitor these Linked Sites, and is not responsible or liable for (a) the availability of or content provided on such Linked Sites, nor does inclusion of any link imply endorsement of the Linked Sites by AmSurg, or vice versa; (b) third party content accessible through such Linked Sites; (c) any loss or damage whatsoever you may incur from dealing with any Linked Site; or (d) your dealings with any third parties found on or through the Sites.

TYPOGRAPHICAL ERRORSOur goal is to provide complete, accurate, up-to-date information on our Sites. Unfortunately, it is not possible to ensure that any website is completely free of human or technological errors. The Sites may contain typographical mistakes, inaccuracies, or omissions, and some information may not be complete or current.  AmSurg therefore reserves the right to correct any errors, inaccuracies or omissions and to change or update information at any time without prior notice.11.   NO INVESTMENT ADVICE; FORWARD LOOKING INFORMATIONNothing on the Sites constitutes investment advice. Any stock prices provided on the Sites are not official market quotations and are not to be considered a substitute for obtaining pricing information from official sources.The Sites may contain information that includes or is based upon forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, specifically the Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements give expectations or forecasts of future events. You can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts.
