We’re a natural gas storage & international transportation company based in Texas.








Storage


US Pipelines


Mexico Pipelines











                                        Our facility will be the first underground storage in the country of Mexico.  This facility will allow the ability to balance peak loads by consumers, the ability to play price arbitrage on natural gas, and the ability for Mexico to create a Mexico Natural Gas Hub for gas pricing and stability. This facility is a depleted natural gas reservoir with the ability to store 786 BCF of natural gas.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.      Key Stock Data    P/E Ratio (TTM) N/A     EPS (TTM)  $0.00      Market Cap $449.78 M     Shares Outstanding 310.19 M     Public Float 117.44 M     Yield MRGE has not issued dividends in more than 1 year.     Latest Dividend N/A     Ex-Dividend Date N/A       ?    Shares Sold Short The total number of shares of a security that have been sold short and not yet repurchased. Change from Last Percentage change in short interest from the previous report to the most recent report. Exchanges report short interest twice a month. Percent of Float Total short positions relative to the number of shares available to trade.      Short Interest ()   N/A      ?    Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades. Our calculations are based on comprehensive, delayed quotes.      Stock Money Flow   N/A              Advertisement         Competitors MRGE   Data not available.

SAN ANTONIO, Jan. 30, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Mirage Energy Corporation, (OTCBB: MRGE) is proud to announce the appointment of David J. Cibrian to its Board of Directors as of January 21, 2017. Mr. Cibrian is the Managing Director with Brevet Capital, a New York City -based hedge fund (www.brevetcapital.com).  Throughout his career, David has served as a lawyer, accountant, corporate executive and investment banker.  He was formerly a CPA with Ernest & Young, Los Angeles and was a practicing international and corporate attorney for 25 years.  Mr. Cibrian was also President of an energy efficiency technology company.








In addition to his work with Brevet, Mr. Cibrian has been on the Board of Onko Solutions, LLC, a medical device start-up company located in Austin, Texas, and has served as a Senior Advisor to Civitas Capital Group – Dallas, Texas.  He has appeared on Fox Business Network and has been quoted in international business and legal media including The Wall Street Journal, Investor's Business Daily, Newsweek and Mexico's El Financiero.  Mr. Cibrian is a former member of the Texas Finance Commission and the Texas Credit Union Commission having been appointed by then Texas Governor Rick Perry.
Mirage Energy Corporation also announces the acquisition of 4Ward Resources, Inc., which was completed on January 24, 2017.  By acquiring 4Ward Resources, Inc., Mirage Energy Corporation enters the natural gas pipeline and natural gas storage business.  The company intends to develop an integrated pipeline and natural gas storage facility in Mexico and the United States.
The company and its wholly owned subsidiaries are in the process of applying for and obtaining the necessary permits in Mexico and the United States.
This infrastructure consists of the following components:
MEXICO PIPELINES:
PROPOSED PROGRESO PIPELINE: This system includes 27 miles of 36" diameter pipe operated by WPF MEXICO PIPELINES, S. de R.L. de C.V.  This pipeline has the capacity to move 500 million cubic feet per day to compressor stations or Mexico end-user markets.
PROPOSED ARGUELLES PIPELINE:  This system consists of 84 miles of 36" diameter pipeline operated by WPF MEXICO PIPELINES, S. de R.L. de C.V.  This pipeline also has the capacity to move 500 million cubic feet per day to compressor stations or Mexico end-user markets.
MEXICO UNDERGROUND NATURAL GAS STORAGE:
PROPOSED NATURAL GAS STORAGE: This facility is to be the first underground storage facility in the country of Mexico. This storage will allow the country of Mexico to balance peak loads by consumers, as well as the ability to play price arbitrage on natural gas.  Additionally, Mexico will be able create a Natural Gas Hub for pricing rather than having to buy natural gas on spot market.  This facility is a depleted natural gas reservoir with the ability to store 786 BCF (Billion Cubic Feet) of natural gas. When fully developed, this storage will give the country a secure natural gas supply for one year in the event all gas supplies were shut off for any reason.  
This storage facility will have 70,000 BHP of compression with 14 compressors for injection of gas into the reservoir.  CENOTE ENERGY, S. de R.L. de C.V., will own and operate this facility.  
INTERNATIONAL PIPELINE CROSSINGS:
PROPOSED PROGRESO CROSSING:  This crossing includes the Presidential Permit for boring underneath the Rio Grand River.  It will be permitted as a 40" boring with 36" pipe running underneath the river.  WPF TRANSMISSION, INC. will own the pipe on the U.S. side of the river.  WPF MEXICO PIPELINES, S. de R.L. de C.V., will own the pipe on the Mexico side of the river. 
PROPOSED ARGUELLES CROSSING:  This crossing includes a second Presidential Permit for boring underneath the Rio Grand River.  It will also be permitted as a 40" boring with 36" pipe running underneath the river.  WPF TRANSMISSION, INC. will own the pipe on the U.S. side of the river.  WPF MEXICO PIPELINES, S. de R.L. de C.V., will own the pipe on the Mexico side of the river. 
UNITED STATES PIPELINES:
PROPOSED CONCHO: This system includes 95 miles 36" diameter pipeline with the capacity of transporting 500MMCFPD. It will be owned and operated by WPF TRANSMISSION, INC.

Common questions

What's the difference between a C corporation and an S corporation?
The IRS allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a "C corporation" or an "S corporation." Income from C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporation.S corporations have only one level of taxation. The shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation, but an S corporation does not pay taxes on its net income. While the S corporation is popular among small business owners, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility.


How does a corporation protect my personal assets?
If a business operates as a corporation, the business owners, called shareholders, are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation. That's because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners. If a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity, then anyone seeking to collect a debt from, or enforce a claim against, a corporation, would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves. They would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation.


Why do many people choose to form their corporation in Delaware?
Delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations. However, the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public. Delaware's laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders, and Delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes. These benefits don't mean much to smaller corporations. Keep in mind that if a corporation forms in Delaware and does business in another state, the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork, and pay any taxes and/or fees required to do business in that state. Given those factors, many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business.


What is an EIN?
An employer identification number (EIN), also known as a federal tax identification number, is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes. It's like a Social Security number, but for a business. In general, most businesses need an EIN. The only reason a business would not get an EIN is if it has only one owner, elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes, and does not want to open a separate business bank account. In this case, the owner would use their Social Security number as the business identifier. However, there are disadvantages to this approach, namely the risk of liability.


How are LLCs taxed?
Unlike a corporation, LLCs have some flexibility in how they're taxed. Depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects, the LLC can be taxed as either a corporation, partnership or as part of the owner's personal tax return (called a "disregarded entity"). By default, an LLC with two or more members are taxed as a partnership, unless they file an IRS Form 8832 to elect to be treated as a corporation. If the LLC has only one owner, it will be taxed as a sole proprietor, unless the owner files Form 8832. It's not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed. You have up to 12 months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision.


What is a registered agent?
A registered agent (sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent) is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business. States require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity. While you can be your own registered agent, there are disadvantages. You have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record. If you miss a filing deadline, you risk being fined or shut down. Our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents, sort through junk mail and keep your information private.


Is a corporation right for me?
It depends on many factors. Get help deciding by answering a few questions here.

Common questions

What's the difference between a C corporation and an S corporation?
The IRS allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a "C corporation" or an "S corporation." Income from C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporation.S corporations have only one level of taxation. The shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation, but an S corporation does not pay taxes on its net income. While the S corporation is popular among small business owners, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility.


How does a corporation protect my personal assets?
If a business operates as a corporation, the business owners, called shareholders, are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation. That's because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners. If a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity, then anyone seeking to collect a debt from, or enforce a claim against, a corporation, would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves. They would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation.


Why do many people choose to form their corporation in Delaware?
Delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations. However, the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public. Delaware's laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders, and Delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes. These benefits don't mean much to smaller corporations. Keep in mind that if a corporation forms in Delaware and does business in another state, the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork, and pay any taxes and/or fees required to do business in that state. Given those factors, many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business.


What is an EIN?
An employer identification number (EIN), also known as a federal tax identification number, is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes. It's like a Social Security number, but for a business. In general, most businesses need an EIN. The only reason a business would not get an EIN is if it has only one owner, elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes, and does not want to open a separate business bank account. In this case, the owner would use their Social Security number as the business identifier. However, there are disadvantages to this approach, namely the risk of liability.


How are LLCs taxed?
Unlike a corporation, LLCs have some flexibility in how they're taxed. Depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects, the LLC can be taxed as either a corporation, partnership or as part of the owner's personal tax return (called a "disregarded entity"). By default, an LLC with two or more members are taxed as a partnership, unless they file an IRS Form 8832 to elect to be treated as a corporation. If the LLC has only one owner, it will be taxed as a sole proprietor, unless the owner files Form 8832. It's not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed. You have up to 12 months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision.


What is a registered agent?
A registered agent (sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent) is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business. States require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity. While you can be your own registered agent, there are disadvantages. You have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record. If you miss a filing deadline, you risk being fined or shut down. Our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents, sort through junk mail and keep your information private.


Is a corporation right for me?
It depends on many factors. Get help deciding by answering a few questions here.
