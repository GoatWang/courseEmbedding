Indus Capital Partners, LLC (with its affiliates, “Indus”) is an employee-owned international alternative investment management firm, offering long/short and long-only equity strategies investing primarily in the Asia Pacific region including Japan, and in emerging markets.
 
The firm was founded in 2000 by former Soros Fund Management partners who had worked together since 1995 and possess on average over 20 years’ investment experience in the Asia Pacific region.  In the aggregate, Indus manages approximately US$5.9 billion (as of April 1, 2017) for a diverse client base of over 300 investors, including foundations and university endowments, corporate and public pensions, high net worth individuals, family offices, sovereign wealth funds, and financial institutions. Indus is headquartered in New York, with offices in London, Hong Kong, Tokyo, San Francisco and Stamford. The firm currently has over 90 employees, over a third of whom are investment and trading professionals.
 
Indus aims to deliver high risk-adjusted annual returns throughout the investment cycle, capturing most of the upside in strong markets and preserving capital in difficult markets. Indus believes that stock picking based on rigorous fundamental analysis helps to generate positive returns over time. The investment team applies intensive analysis and research to exploit the inherent inefficiency of the markets in which it operates. Indus seeks to identify mispriced investment opportunities, and select uncorrelated and liquid investments that are chosen for their potential to generate alpha. Portfolio construction strategies endeavor to dampen the impact of market volatility. Risk management is an integral part of the firm’s investment philosophy, and involves both systems and culture.
 
Indus is registered as an investment adviser with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the U.S. and the Central Bank of Ireland - Financial Institutions and Funds Authorization. Overseas affiliates are regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority in the U.K., the Securities and Futures Commission in Hong Kong, the Central Bank of Ireland - Financial Institutions and Funds Authorization, and the Financial Services Agency in Japan.

Introduction
The Indian Healthcare industry is on a growth path with all areas of Healthcare including Pharmaceuticals, Medical Devices, Diagnostics, Biotech, Hospitals, Healthcare Delivery and Insurance playing a key role in the development of this sector. 


          We expect strong growth for the industry over the next several years, with some segments growing north of 15% annually.

          Welcome to Somerset Indus Capital Partners - a firm specialising in growth equity based investments in privately held, well-managed Indian healthcare companies seeking capital to scale-up profitable, proven business models.

About Us

Somerset Indus Capital Partners seeks to make private equity and equity-related investments primarily in growth-oriented healthcare companies in India. Somerset is led by Avinash Kenkare on the offshore fund side, a private equity professional with eighteen years of successful investing experience in over fifteen transactions, and duly assisted by Mayur Sirdesai on domestic fund side, a healthcare professional with over twenty years of experience in the Indian Pharma/ Healthcare Industry with both private equity, operational and consulting services related experience.
The Fund expects to make controlling or influential minority investments in Indian healthcare companies, in connection with various transaction structures including leveraged buyouts, build-ups and growth financings. The expectation is that Avinash will use his successful private equity investment experience and healthcare systems knowledge together with the able assistance of Mayur's in depth India specific healthcare experience and knowledge base to make investments in Indian healthcare companies that can deploy the capital successfully to grow their business and increase profitability. Somerset's investment professionals have committed a significant amount of personal capital to the Fund.

Investment Focus
The Indian healthcare industry is on a growth path with all areas of healthcare including Pharmaceuticals, Medical Devices, Diagnostics, Biotech, Hospitals, Healthcare Delivery, Animal Health and Insurance playing a key role in the development of this sector.
Pharma forms the traditional bastion of this sector but the other areas are fast emerging with the advent of hospitals and other healthcare delivery platforms in all tiers of the market. With increasing affluence, access to healthcare is becoming increasingly important and large investments are being made to improve the access and expand the market either through market penetration, creation of new market segments or optimising existing market segments.
 Various sub sectors of Health care are developing in India Indian Healthcare Market Viewpoint (View presentation) 



↓ Next section 




Our Approach
Historically, for Indian PE investments, the average deal size has been below $15 million , but with the advent of global private equity funds, the average deal size has been increasing, and increasingly, capital is seen chasing larger deals.

The Fund's strategy is to target investments in the $5 million range where the need for capital remains significant, and where capital can be deployed most productively.
Although, buy-outs may gain favor in the longer term, India will continue to be a growth market, and the Fund will concentrate on growth equity investments in its sectors of focus.
As the PE market matures, and access to capital ceases to be a significant issue, Indian companies will value PE investors for their sector knowledge, operating expertise and ability to provide access to global markets.
Somerset Indus focuses on the healthcare sector where its investment professionals have extensive knowledge, relationships with domestic players, and access to and experience dealing with global participants that can bring new technologies and provide access to new markets. The fund engages with its portfolio companies extensively in areas of portfolio expansion, talent acquisition and strategy and operational aspects.
