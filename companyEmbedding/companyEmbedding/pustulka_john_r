Job Details
               With nearly 2,000 employees in the communities where we operate, National Fuel is a leader in practicing the highest standards of responsibility in all aspects of its business. We are committed to providing safe and reliable natural gas delivery, excellent customer service, responsible environmental stewardship and productive community involvement. As an integral part of the communities that we serve, National Fuel recognizes the importance of charitable giving. Since 2005, National Fuel, its employees and Foundation have given more than $9 million to nearly 800 charitable organizations throughout the U.S. In 2004, the National Fuel Gas Company Foundation formed to better establish the Company's commitment to the community. As such, we strive to fund innovative programs, initiatives and, on rare occasions, special events, that fall within the pillars of National Fuel's community giving policies, and promise to advance strong, vibrant and stable communities. These pillars, or focus areas, include: Veteran services, education, community vitality/economic impact and the underserved/economically disadvantaged. In 2005, the Employee Charitable Giving Program formed to better align the Company's charitable support with the wishes of our employees. This program is similar to a matching gift program. Employees may choose to designate funds towards 501(c)(3) non-profit organizations and the Foundation will match those funds up to an annual dollar limit. Since the start of the program, employees and the Foundation have contributed more than $7 million. Our Company, its Foundation and employees are proud of our record of generosity through both charitable contributions and volunteer activities in all of the places where we do business. We are proud of the fact that our giving continues to increase. In 2014, employees pledges increased from the previous year, and more than half of the Company's employees elected to participate in the program, pledging more than half a million dollars. Outside of the Employee Charitable Giving Program, the Foundation and National Fuel Gas Company has given more than $3 million to local 501(c)(3) non-profit organizations since 2005. The National Fuel Gas Company Foundation is a 501(c)(3) private foundation funded entirely by the shareholders of National Fuel Gas Company.

January 25, 2016 06:30 AM Eastern Standard Time



WILLIAMSVILLE, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Today, National Fuel Gas Company (“National Fuel” or the “Company”) 
      (NYSE:NFG) announced the following executive management changes.
    


Matthew D. Cabell, President of Seneca Resources Corporation 
      (“Seneca”), the Exploration and Production segment of the Company, and 
      Senior Vice President of National Fuel Gas Company, has indicated his 
      intention to retire, effective May 1, 2016.
    

      “Matt has guided Seneca through some remarkable changes since he joined 
      the Company in December of 2006,” said Ronald J. Tanski, President and 
      Chief Executive Officer of National Fuel Gas Company. “Under Matt’s 
      leadership, Seneca has quadrupled reserves and more than tripled 
      production. He built a top quartile operating team and transformed 
      Seneca into a shale gas leader. I thank Matt for his considerable 
      contributions to the Company and wish him and his family well.”
    

      Cabell joined National Fuel in 2006 as President of Seneca, after 26 
      years of experience with some of the largest companies in the energy 
      industry. Cabell was named Senior Vice President of National Fuel Gas 
      Company in June 2010.
    

John P. McGinnis, currently Seneca’s Chief Operating Officer, 
      will succeed Cabell as President of Seneca. McGinnis joined Seneca in 
      2007 as Senior Vice President, and has helped lead Seneca in its 
      development of the Marcellus Shale. Prior to joining Seneca, he was 
      General Manager of Exploration at Dominion Resources and, before that, 
      Vice President of Exploration for Nuevo Energy. McGinnis holds a 
      Bachelor of Science in geology and a master’s degree in geophysics from 
      Purdue University, and a doctorate in marine geology and geophysics from 
      Columbia University. He is a member of the American Association of 
      Petroleum Geologists and is on the Board of the Western States Petroleum 
      Association.
    

      “I am leaving Seneca in good hands,” remarked Cabell. “John has played a 
      big role in our success, and is supported by an experienced and capable 
      Seneca management team dedicated to executing our long-term plans.”
    

      The following executive management changes will be effective Feb. 1, 
      2016.
    

John R. Pustulka, currently President of National Fuel Gas Supply 
      Corporation, has been named Chief Operating Officer of National Fuel Gas 
      Company.
    

      “Over the next few years, the continued growth of our Company will be 
      focused in our gathering pipeline, interstate pipeline, and upstream 
      exploration and production segments. In view of the level of development 
      activity and spending among these areas, it is important to have a 
      coordinated and focused oversight for those areas,” said Tanski. 
      “Throughout John’s extensive career he has been involved in all aspects 
      of the ongoing development and expansion of the Company’s gathering and 
      interstate pipeline and storage systems. This in-depth knowledge and 
      operational experience with our Appalachian assets make John the ideal 
      person to help coordinate our long-term development plans.”
    

      Pustulka joined the Company in 1974 and has been an officer of National 
      Fuel Gas Supply Corporation since 1990. He has been responsible for the 
      Company’s pipeline and storage projects and operations for many years. 
      He earned a Bachelor of Science in civil engineering from the State 
      University of New York at Buffalo and a Master of Business 
      Administration from Canisius College. Pustulka serves on the Executive 
      Committee and is an Executive Board member of the Interstate Natural Gas 
      Association of America Foundation Inc., a member and past Chairman of 
      the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America’s Pipeline Safety 
      Committee and a board member of the Greater Niagara Frontier 
      Council Boy Scouts of America.
    

David P. Bauer, who will continue to serve as Treasurer and 
      Principal Financial Officer of National Fuel Gas Company, has been named 
      President of National Fuel Gas Supply Corporation.
    

      In making this appointment, Tanski said, “Dave has been instrumental in 
      carrying out the Company’s financial strategy for many years and has 
      played a key role in maintaining our financial strength and stability. 
      His ongoing interface with the financial community will be of critical 
      value as National Fuel Gas Supply Corporation continues along its path 
      of substantial, appropriately-paced infrastructure investment and build 
      out for the future."
    

      Bauer joined National Fuel in 2001 after 10 years at 
      PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP and its predecessor. He earned a Bachelor of 
      Science in accounting at Boston College. Bauer is a board member of the 
      YMCA Buffalo Niagara, Audit Committee Chairman of the D’Youville College 
      Board, a Finance Committee member of the Canisius High School Board and 
      an Investment Committee member of the Diocese of Buffalo.
    

Carl M. Carlotti, currently Senior Vice President of National 
      Fuel Gas Distribution Corporation, the Utility segment of National Fuel 
      Gas Company, has been named President of the Utility, succeeding Anna 
      Marie Cellino who will retire effective Feb. 1, 2016.
    

      “Carl has managed virtually every functional area of the Utility during 
      his 30-plus years with the company,” said Tanski. “Carl will continue 
      our history of strong customer service and commitment to the safe, 
      reliable delivery of low-cost, environmentally advantageous natural gas 
      to our utility customers.”
    

      Carlotti joined the Company in 1985 and has been Senior Vice President 
      of the Utility since December 2007 and head of the Utility’s 
      Pennsylvania Division since 1993. Carlotti holds a Bachelor of Arts in 
      political science from Gannon University and a law degree from the 
      University of Dayton School of Law. Currently, he serves as a board 
      member for the Energy Association of Pennsylvania, the Pennsylvania 
      Chamber of Business and Industry, and the Erie Regional Chamber and 
      Growth Partnership.
    

      “One of the underpinnings of National Fuel’s ongoing success has been 
      the depth, breadth, and collective knowledge of our talented leadership 
      team and workforce. With these executive level changes, and the ongoing 
      hard work and dedication of our more than 2,000 employees, we are well 
      positioned to continue executing on our development strategy to the 
      long-term benefit of shareholders, customers and other stakeholders,” 
      Tanski concluded.
    

      National Fuel is an integrated energy company with more than $6 billion 
      in assets invested in the following five operating segments: Exploration 
      and Production, Pipeline and Storage, Gathering, Utility, and Energy 
      Marketing. Additional information about National Fuel is available at www.nationalfuelgas.com.

      are important factors that could cause actual results to differ 
      materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements: 
      factors affecting the Company’s ability to successfully identify, drill 
      for and produce economically viable natural gas and oil reserves, 
      including among others geology, lease availability, title disputes, 
      weather conditions, shortages, delays or unavailability of equipment and 
      services required in drilling operations, insufficient gathering, 
      processing and transportation capacity, the need to obtain governmental 
      approvals and permits, and compliance with environmental laws and 
      regulations; impairments under the SEC’s full cost ceiling test for 
      natural gas and oil reserves; changes in the price of natural gas or 
      oil; changes in laws, regulations or judicial interpretations to which 
      the Company is subject, including those involving derivatives, taxes, 
      safety, employment, climate change, other environmental matters, real 
      property, and exploration and production activities such as hydraulic 
      fracturing; governmental/regulatory actions, initiatives and 
      proceedings, including those involving rate cases (which address, among 
      other things, target rates of return, rate design and retained natural 
      gas), environmental/safety requirements, affiliate relationships, 
      industry structure, and franchise renewal; changes in price 
      differentials between similar quantities of natural gas or oil sold at 
      different geographic locations, and the effect of such changes on 
      commodity production, revenues and demand for pipeline transportation 
      capacity to or from such locations; other changes in price differentials 
      between similar quantities of natural gas or oil having different 
      quality, heating value, hydrocarbon mix or delivery date; financial and 
      economic conditions, including the availability of credit, and 
      occurrences affecting the Company’s ability to obtain financing on 
      acceptable terms for working capital, capital expenditures and other 
      investments, including any downgrades in the Company’s credit ratings 
      and changes in interest rates and other capital market conditions; the 
      cost and effects of legal and administrative claims against the Company 
      or activist shareholder campaigns to effect changes at the Company; 
      uncertainty of oil and gas reserve estimates; significant differences 
      between the Company’s projected and actual production levels for natural 
      gas or oil; delays or changes in costs or plans with respect to Company 
      projects or related projects of other companies, including difficulties 
      or delays in obtaining necessary governmental approvals, permits or 
      orders or in obtaining the cooperation of interconnecting facility 
      operators; changes in demographic patterns and weather conditions; 
      changes in the availability, price or accounting treatment of derivative 
      financial instruments; changes in economic conditions, including global, 
      national or regional recessions, and their effect on the demand for, and 
      customers’ ability to pay for, the Company’s products and services; the 
      creditworthiness or performance of the Company’s key suppliers, 
      customers and counterparties; economic disruptions or uninsured losses 
      resulting from major accidents, fires, severe weather, natural 
      disasters, terrorist activities, acts of war, cyber attacks or pest 
      infestation; or significant differences between the Company’s projected 
      and actual capital expenditures and operating expenses. The Company 
      disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements to 
      reflect events or circumstances after the date thereof.

WILLIAMSVILLE, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Today, National Fuel Gas Company (“National Fuel” or the “Company”) 
      (NYSE:NFG) announced the following executive management changes.
    


Matthew D. Cabell, President of Seneca Resources Corporation 
      (“Seneca”), the Exploration and Production segment of the Company, and 
      Senior Vice President of National Fuel Gas Company, has indicated his 
      intention to retire, effective May 1, 2016.
    

      “Matt has guided Seneca through some remarkable changes since he joined 
      the Company in December of 2006,” said Ronald J. Tanski, President and 
      Chief Executive Officer of National Fuel Gas Company. “Under Matt’s 
      leadership, Seneca has quadrupled reserves and more than tripled 
      production. He built a top quartile operating team and transformed 
      Seneca into a shale gas leader. I thank Matt for his considerable 
      contributions to the Company and wish him and his family well.”
    

      Cabell joined National Fuel in 2006 as President of Seneca, after 26 
      years of experience with some of the largest companies in the energy 
      industry. Cabell was named Senior Vice President of National Fuel Gas 
      Company in June 2010.
    

John P. McGinnis, currently Seneca’s Chief Operating Officer, 
      will succeed Cabell as President of Seneca. McGinnis joined Seneca in 
      2007 as Senior Vice President, and has helped lead Seneca in its 
      development of the Marcellus Shale. Prior to joining Seneca, he was 
      General Manager of Exploration at Dominion Resources and, before that, 
      Vice President of Exploration for Nuevo Energy. McGinnis holds a 
      Bachelor of Science in geology and a master’s degree in geophysics from 
      Purdue University, and a doctorate in marine geology and geophysics from 
      Columbia University. He is a member of the American Association of 
      Petroleum Geologists and is on the Board of the Western States Petroleum 
      Association.
    

      “I am leaving Seneca in good hands,” remarked Cabell. “John has played a 
      big role in our success, and is supported by an experienced and capable 
      Seneca management team dedicated to executing our long-term plans.”
    

      The following executive management changes will be effective Feb. 1, 
      2016.
    

John R. Pustulka, currently President of National Fuel Gas Supply 
      Corporation, has been named Chief Operating Officer of National Fuel Gas 
      Company.
    

      “Over the next few years, the continued growth of our Company will be 
      focused in our gathering pipeline, interstate pipeline, and upstream 
      exploration and production segments. In view of the level of development 
      activity and spending among these areas, it is important to have a 
      coordinated and focused oversight for those areas,” said Tanski. 
      “Throughout John’s extensive career he has been involved in all aspects 
      of the ongoing development and expansion of the Company’s gathering and 
      interstate pipeline and storage systems. This in-depth knowledge and 
      operational experience with our Appalachian assets make John the ideal 
      person to help coordinate our long-term development plans.”
    

      Pustulka joined the Company in 1974 and has been an officer of National 
      Fuel Gas Supply Corporation since 1990. He has been responsible for the 
      Company’s pipeline and storage projects and operations for many years. 
      He earned a Bachelor of Science in civil engineering from the State 
      University of New York at Buffalo and a Master of Business 
      Administration from Canisius College. Pustulka serves on the Executive 
      Committee and is an Executive Board member of the Interstate Natural Gas 
      Association of America Foundation Inc., a member and past Chairman of 
      the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America’s Pipeline Safety 
      Committee and a board member of the Greater Niagara Frontier 
      Council Boy Scouts of America.
    

David P. Bauer, who will continue to serve as Treasurer and 
      Principal Financial Officer of National Fuel Gas Company, has been named 
      President of National Fuel Gas Supply Corporation.
    

      In making this appointment, Tanski said, “Dave has been instrumental in 
      carrying out the Company’s financial strategy for many years and has 
      played a key role in maintaining our financial strength and stability. 
      His ongoing interface with the financial community will be of critical 
      value as National Fuel Gas Supply Corporation continues along its path 
      of substantial, appropriately-paced infrastructure investment and build 
      out for the future."
    

      Bauer joined National Fuel in 2001 after 10 years at 
      PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP and its predecessor. He earned a Bachelor of 
      Science in accounting at Boston College. Bauer is a board member of the 
      YMCA Buffalo Niagara, Audit Committee Chairman of the D’Youville College 
      Board, a Finance Committee member of the Canisius High School Board and 
      an Investment Committee member of the Diocese of Buffalo.
    

Carl M. Carlotti, currently Senior Vice President of National 
      Fuel Gas Distribution Corporation, the Utility segment of National Fuel 
      Gas Company, has been named President of the Utility, succeeding Anna 
      Marie Cellino who will retire effective Feb. 1, 2016.
    

      “Carl has managed virtually every functional area of the Utility during 
      his 30-plus years with the company,” said Tanski. “Carl will continue 
      our history of strong customer service and commitment to the safe, 
      reliable delivery of low-cost, environmentally advantageous natural gas 
      to our utility customers.”
    

      Carlotti joined the Company in 1985 and has been Senior Vice President 
      of the Utility since December 2007 and head of the Utility’s 
      Pennsylvania Division since 1993. Carlotti holds a Bachelor of Arts in 
      political science from Gannon University and a law degree from the 
      University of Dayton School of Law. Currently, he serves as a board 
      member for the Energy Association of Pennsylvania, the Pennsylvania 
      Chamber of Business and Industry, and the Erie Regional Chamber and 
      Growth Partnership.
    

      “One of the underpinnings of National Fuel’s ongoing success has been 
      the depth, breadth, and collective knowledge of our talented leadership 
      team and workforce. With these executive level changes, and the ongoing 
      hard work and dedication of our more than 2,000 employees, we are well 
      positioned to continue executing on our development strategy to the 
      long-term benefit of shareholders, customers and other stakeholders,” 
      Tanski concluded.
