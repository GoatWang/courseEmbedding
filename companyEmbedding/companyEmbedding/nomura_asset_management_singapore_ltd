Korea Equity Fund, Inc.
IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING THE KOREA EQUITY FUND, INC. - PLEASE REFER to Press Release
Korea Equity Fund, Inc. (“KEF” or the “Fund”) is a non-diversified, closed-end management investment company listed on the New York Stock Exchange. KEF seeks long-term capital appreciation through investments primarily in equity securities of Korean companies. Under normal circumstances, the Fund will invest at least 80% of its total assets in such securities.
Nomura Asset Management U.S.A. Inc. ("NAM-USA") has served as the Fund’s Manager since the Fund’s inception in 1993. Nomura Asset Management Co., Ltd. has served as the Fund’s Investment Adviser since the Fund’s inception. Nomura Asset Management Hong Kong Limited and Nomura Asset Management Singapore Limited act as Investment Sub-Advisers to the Fund. The Manager, Investment Adviser, and Sub-Advisers are subsidiaries of Nomura Holdings, Inc. and affiliates of Nomura Securities Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan.

Portfolio Managers
Lead Portfolio Manager: Shigeto Kasahara, CFA, CMA
Portfolio Manager: Justin Jeongho Park

Disclosures
Nomura Asset Management U.S.A. Inc. ("NAM-USA") is the investment manager of  the Korea Equity Fund, Inc. (“KEF”). KEF is a closed-end management investment company registered pursuant to the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. Nomura Asset Management Co., Ltd. ("NAM") acts as investment adviser to KEF. NAM-USA is a wholly owned subsidiary of NAM. Nomura Asset Management Singapore Limited and Nomura Asset Management Hong Kong Limited act as sub-advisers to KEF.
Closed-end fund shares are traded on the secondary market through one of the stock exchanges. Like any other stock, market price will fluctuate with the market. Shares of closed-end funds frequently trade at a discount, which is a market price that is below their net asset value ("NAV"). Upon sale, your shares may have a market price that is above or below NAV.
Past performance is not indicative of future results.  There is a risk of loss. The information contained on this website is not a prospectus. Additionally, the information contained herein is not an offer to buy or sell any security, is not legal or tax advice, and is for informational purposes only.
The Fund may participate in new issuances of securities ("New Issues"), and a portion of the Fund's returns consequently may be attributable to its investment in New Issues. The market value of New Issues may fluctuate considerably due to factors such as the absence of a prior public market, unseasoned trading, and the limited availability for trading and limited information about the issuer. When a composite's asset base is small, New Issues may have a magnified impact on the Fund's performance. As a fund's assets grow, it is probable that the effect of the composite's investment in New Issues on its total returns may not be as significant, which could reduce the Fund's performance. There is no guarantee that the availability or economic attractiveness of New issues will be consistent from year to year.
Foreign Investment Risk: Foreign investments involve special risks including economic, political and currency fluctuation risks, which may be greater in emerging markets. International markets may be less liquid and can be more volatile than U.S. markets or Canadian markets. Small and mid-cap stocks are subject to greater volatility and may be less liquid than stocks of larger, more established companies. Healthcare companies may be significantly affected by government regulations and government approvals of products and services, legislation or regulatory changes. Technology stocks may be more volatile than the overall stock market.
Forward Looking Statements
Certain information discussed herein may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the U.S. federal securities laws. Although Nomura Asset Management believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, it can give no assurance that its expectations will be achieved. Forward-looking information is subject to certain risks, trends and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected.
Nomura Asset Management Co., Ltd. and its investment advisory subsidiaries are referred to collectively as Nomura Asset Management or the NAM Companies. Nomura Asset Management provides asset management services in jurisdictions around the world. The services of a particular NAM Company may not be available to investors in certain jurisdictions.

A smart product management hub for retailthat streamlines digital content and data sharing






 





















Our mission
 
We have made it our mission to provide brands and retailers simple and affordable tools that tackle many challenges in digital product management and distribution by:













Solving the practical challenge of organizing, sourcing, and sharing product content.









Giving brands and retailers access to a whole new level of detailed ecommerce data and analytics
















Take control of your products with Plytix
 









Our Story
 
The idea for Plytix evolved from our time at Google, when we were working with some of the biggest companies in the e-commerce space. At the time, technology allowed tracking user behaviour on individual websites, but we wanted to give brands and retailers access to a whole new level of detailed data, bringing them a better understanding of their products through 3rd party product analytics. 
 
Since then Plytix has evolved into an end-to-end product management eco-system where brands and retailers can organize, analyze, and share product content and performance in a user-friendly and efficient way without breaking the bank. 
 




























Our Team
 
We're a diverse, international team passionate about creating extraordinary client experiences and serious about revolutionizing e-commerce. We are growing rapidly and we're always on the look out for smart, driven people to join our team. 
 
Get a closer look on  LinkedIn and Instagram.
