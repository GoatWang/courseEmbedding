History[edit]




Moody National Bank's headquarters in downtown Galveston, Texas.






City National Bank Building, now the Galveston County Historical Museum, in downtown Galveston, Texas


In 1907, Galveston businessman William Lewis Moody, Jr. founded the City National Bank in the Trust Building in downtown Galveston. The new bank quickly grew and by 1920 a new building was constructed a block away on Market Street.
During its early years the City National Bank merged with the Galveston National Bank and continued to steadily grow in size and assets. In 1953 the board of directors decided to honor the bank's founder by changing the name to Moody National Bank. A year later Mr. Moody died and his daughter, Mary Moody Northen assumed control of the bank and ANICO.[8]
By 1962 the bank had outgrown its neo-classical headquarters on Market Street, and a new seven-story building was constructed a block away. The old building, after sitting vacant for several years, was donated in 1972 by Ms. Northen to Galveston County for use as a historical museum dedicated to the memory of her father.[9]
With the legalization of branch banking in Texas in 1988, Moody National Bank merged with sister bank, South Shore National Bank in League City, Texas. South Shore National Bank had been established by the Moody Family to provide financial services to the South Shore Harbor subdivision, which was being developed by their family controlled insurance company, the American National Insurance Company.[10]
By the 2000s MNB began to spread out from its traditional base of Galveston County opening offices in Brazoria, Fort Bend, Harris and Travis counties.[11][12][13]
Banking center locations[edit]
Moody National Bank operates 25 financial centers across Central and Southeast Texas in the following counties:

Brazoria County (6)
Fort Bend County (2)
Galveston County (10)
Harris County (5)
Travis County (1)[13]

Moody National Bank (MNB) is a nationally chartered bank, founded in 1907, that is based in Galveston, Texas.
With assets of nearly $1 billion, Moody Bank is one of oldest and largest privately owned Texas-based banks. Its trust department, established in 1927, administers over $26 billion in assets, and is the largest domiciled in the state of Texas.[2][3] The company offers a full range of commercial and consumer banking products, as well as trust and investment banking services to customers throughout Southeast Texas and Central Texas, including the Greater Houston area.[1][3]
The bank is unique in that through its trust department, it has de facto control of the American National Insurance Company (ANICO), one of the largest life and property/casualty companies in the U.S. The bank's trust department administers the Moody Foundation and the Libbie Shearn Moody Trust, which together own the majority of ANICO's shares.[4][5][6]
Moody National Bank is a wholly owned subsidiary of Moody Bancshares, Inc., a privately owned financial holding company, also based in Galveston.[6] Moody Bancshares also maintains a controlling interest in Galveston-based Hometown Bank N.A.[7]

History[edit]




Moody National Bank's headquarters in downtown Galveston, Texas.






City National Bank Building, now the Galveston County Historical Museum, in downtown Galveston, Texas


In 1907, Galveston businessman William Lewis Moody, Jr. founded the City National Bank in the Trust Building in downtown Galveston. The new bank quickly grew and by 1920 a new building was constructed a block away on Market Street.
During its early years the City National Bank merged with the Galveston National Bank and continued to steadily grow in size and assets. In 1953 the board of directors decided to honor the bank's founder by changing the name to Moody National Bank. A year later Mr. Moody died and his daughter, Mary Moody Northen assumed control of the bank and ANICO.[8]
By 1962 the bank had outgrown its neo-classical headquarters on Market Street, and a new seven-story building was constructed a block away. The old building, after sitting vacant for several years, was donated in 1972 by Ms. Northen to Galveston County for use as a historical museum dedicated to the memory of her father.[9]
With the legalization of branch banking in Texas in 1988, Moody National Bank merged with sister bank, South Shore National Bank in League City, Texas. South Shore National Bank had been established by the Moody Family to provide financial services to the South Shore Harbor subdivision, which was being developed by their family controlled insurance company, the American National Insurance Company.[10]
By the 2000s MNB began to spread out from its traditional base of Galveston County opening offices in Brazoria, Fort Bend, Harris and Travis counties.[11][12][13]
Banking center locations[edit]
Moody National Bank operates 25 financial centers across Central and Southeast Texas in the following counties:

Brazoria County (6)
Fort Bend County (2)
Galveston County (10)
Harris County (5)
Travis County (1)[13]

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Time (NYSE:TIME) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 4 Hold Ratings, 1 Buy RatingConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.20)Consensus Price Target: $15.20 (7.80% upside)

Moody National Bank (MNB) is a nationally chartered bank, founded in 1907, that is based in Galveston, Texas.
With assets of nearly $1 billion, Moody Bank is one of oldest and largest privately owned Texas-based banks. Its trust department, established in 1927, administers over $26 billion in assets, and is the largest domiciled in the state of Texas.[2][3] The company offers a full range of commercial and consumer banking products, as well as trust and investment banking services to customers throughout Southeast Texas and Central Texas, including the Greater Houston area.[1][3]
The bank is unique in that through its trust department, it has de facto control of the American National Insurance Company (ANICO), one of the largest life and property/casualty companies in the U.S. The bank's trust department administers the Moody Foundation and the Libbie Shearn Moody Trust, which together own the majority of ANICO's shares.[4][5][6]
Moody National Bank is a wholly owned subsidiary of Moody Bancshares, Inc., a privately owned financial holding company, also based in Galveston.[6] Moody Bancshares also maintains a controlling interest in Galveston-based Hometown Bank N.A.[7]

History[edit]




Moody National Bank's headquarters in downtown Galveston, Texas.






City National Bank Building, now the Galveston County Historical Museum, in downtown Galveston, Texas


In 1907, Galveston businessman William Lewis Moody, Jr. founded the City National Bank in the Trust Building in downtown Galveston. The new bank quickly grew and by 1920 a new building was constructed a block away on Market Street.
During its early years the City National Bank merged with the Galveston National Bank and continued to steadily grow in size and assets. In 1953 the board of directors decided to honor the bank's founder by changing the name to Moody National Bank. A year later Mr. Moody died and his daughter, Mary Moody Northen assumed control of the bank and ANICO.[8]
By 1962 the bank had outgrown its neo-classical headquarters on Market Street, and a new seven-story building was constructed a block away. The old building, after sitting vacant for several years, was donated in 1972 by Ms. Northen to Galveston County for use as a historical museum dedicated to the memory of her father.[9]
With the legalization of branch banking in Texas in 1988, Moody National Bank merged with sister bank, South Shore National Bank in League City, Texas. South Shore National Bank had been established by the Moody Family to provide financial services to the South Shore Harbor subdivision, which was being developed by their family controlled insurance company, the American National Insurance Company.[10]
By the 2000s MNB began to spread out from its traditional base of Galveston County opening offices in Brazoria, Fort Bend, Harris and Travis counties.[11][12][13]
Banking center locations[edit]
Moody National Bank operates 25 financial centers across Central and Southeast Texas in the following counties:

Brazoria County (6)
Fort Bend County (2)
Galveston County (10)
Harris County (5)
Travis County (1)[13]

Moody National Bank (MNB) is a nationally chartered bank, founded in 1907, that is based in Galveston, Texas.
With assets of nearly $1 billion, Moody Bank is one of oldest and largest privately owned Texas-based banks. Its trust department, established in 1927, administers over $26 billion in assets, and is the largest domiciled in the state of Texas.[2][3] The company offers a full range of commercial and consumer banking products, as well as trust and investment banking services to customers throughout Southeast Texas and Central Texas, including the Greater Houston area.[1][3]
The bank is unique in that through its trust department, it has de facto control of the American National Insurance Company (ANICO), one of the largest life and property/casualty companies in the U.S. The bank's trust department administers the Moody Foundation and the Libbie Shearn Moody Trust, which together own the majority of ANICO's shares.[4][5][6]
Moody National Bank is a wholly owned subsidiary of Moody Bancshares, Inc., a privately owned financial holding company, also based in Galveston.[6] Moody Bancshares also maintains a controlling interest in Galveston-based Hometown Bank N.A.[7]

History[edit]




Moody National Bank's headquarters in downtown Galveston, Texas.






City National Bank Building, now the Galveston County Historical Museum, in downtown Galveston, Texas


In 1907, Galveston businessman William Lewis Moody, Jr. founded the City National Bank in the Trust Building in downtown Galveston. The new bank quickly grew and by 1920 a new building was constructed a block away on Market Street.
During its early years the City National Bank merged with the Galveston National Bank and continued to steadily grow in size and assets. In 1953 the board of directors decided to honor the bank's founder by changing the name to Moody National Bank. A year later Mr. Moody died and his daughter, Mary Moody Northen assumed control of the bank and ANICO.[8]
By 1962 the bank had outgrown its neo-classical headquarters on Market Street, and a new seven-story building was constructed a block away. The old building, after sitting vacant for several years, was donated in 1972 by Ms. Northen to Galveston County for use as a historical museum dedicated to the memory of her father.[9]
With the legalization of branch banking in Texas in 1988, Moody National Bank merged with sister bank, South Shore National Bank in League City, Texas. South Shore National Bank had been established by the Moody Family to provide financial services to the South Shore Harbor subdivision, which was being developed by their family controlled insurance company, the American National Insurance Company.[10]
By the 2000s MNB began to spread out from its traditional base of Galveston County opening offices in Brazoria, Fort Bend, Harris and Travis counties.[11][12][13]
Banking center locations[edit]
Moody National Bank operates 25 financial centers across Central and Southeast Texas in the following counties:

Brazoria County (6)
Fort Bend County (2)
Galveston County (10)
Harris County (5)
Travis County (1)[13]

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
