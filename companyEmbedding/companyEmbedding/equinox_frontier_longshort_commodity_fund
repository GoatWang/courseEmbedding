There is a substantial risk of loss in managed futures, and there can be no guarantee that any managed futures program or the Equinox Frontier Funds will meet their intended objective; accordingly, an investment in the Equinox Frontier Funds may not be suitable for everyone. The Funds are highly speculative and their success depends upon the ability of Equinox Fund Management, LLC to allocate assets to multiple strategies and commodity trading advisors (“CTAs”). The Funds also rely on each of the CTAs chosen in meeting the investment objectives. An investment in the Funds involve a high degree of risk due to substantial price volatility in domestic and foreign markets for financial instruments, currencies, energy, metals, and commodities and the uncertainty as to the ability of the CTAs to profit in the markets traded.
Futures, forward, and options trading are speculative, volatile, and highly leveraged; select markets and instruments may be subject to liquidity restrictions from time to time.
An investor could lose a substantial portion, or even all, of his or her investment.
An investor’s annual tax liability may exceed cash distributions.
There is no secondary markets for the units and the transfer of units is restricted. If you redeem all or portion of your class 1 units before the end of 12 months following your purchase, you will be charged a redemption fee of up to 2% of the purchase prices of the units being redeemed.
The Funds face the risk of non-performance by the counterparties to the OTC contracts.
The Equinox Frontier Funds are not mutual funds and are not subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.
Investors should carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Funds. This and other important information about the Funds are in the relevant Prospectuses which can be obtained by calling 1.877.837.0600 The prospectus should be read carefully before investing.

Equinox Announces Consolidation Under the "Equinox Funds" Brand, Along With Launch of New Website and Alternative Investment Education Program




















December 09, 2013 09:00 ET

 | Source: Equinox Funds





PRINCETON, N.J., Dec. 9, 2013 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Equinox Financial Group, LLC ("Equinox"), a leading provider of alternative investments, is pleased to announce the consolidation of multiple brand names under one corporate brand mark, "Equinox Funds", along with the launch of a new website platform and alternative investment education program, effective December 9th, 2013. The new program reflects Equinox Funds' goal of "Building Better Alternatives" and providing exceptional customer service and sales support for investors.

	As part of the initiative, all of Equinox's business affiliates, including, Equinox Fund Management, LLC, Equinox Group Distributors, LLC, Equinox Financial Solutions, LLC and Equinox Institutional Asset Management, LP, will fall under the Equinox Funds brand name umbrella. Product names for certain mutual fund and commodity pool investments offered through Equinox Funds will also change, incorporating the Equinox brand as follows:

	-- MutualHedge Frontier Legends Fund will change to Equinox MutualHedge Futures Strategy Fund

	-- The Frontier Fund family name will change to Equinox Frontier Funds 

	-- The three open funds offered through Equinox Frontier Funds will also change as follows:


		Frontier Masters Series will change to Equinox Frontier Masters Fund


		Frontier Diversified Series will change to Equinox Frontier Diversified Fund


		Frontier Long/Short* Commodity Series will change to Equinox Frontier Long/Short Commodity Fund


	Seeking to provide investors with a positive online experience, the new program offers access to industry-leading alternative investment information and education through three new web sites. In addition to the main EquinoxFunds.com web site featuring product information and thought leadership, Equinox Funds will sponsor a separate CTAperformance.com web site showcasing in-depth information on managed futures trading strategies. An investment education portal for advisors and investors named OnAlternatives.com is also scheduled to launch in January 2014. 

	"Our goal with this exciting initiative is to lend coherence to the entire sales, marketing and communications process at Equinox Funds, and ultimately provide financial advisors, institutions and investors with best-in-class client service and alternative investment education," stated Robert J. Enck, President and Chief Executive Officer of Equinox Funds. "We are delighted with the outcome of the initiative thus far," continued Mr. Enck, "and we look forward to continuing to provide investors with the necessary tools and information they need to become better informed about Equinox Funds and the potential benefits of investing in alternative strategies." 

	Equinox Funds has been an innovator in alternative investment product development and distribution since its founding in 2003. In December 2009, Equinox launched the Equinox MutualHedge Futures Strategy Fund ("MutualHedge") (ticker: MHFAX), the first actively managed mutual fund with exposure to Commodity Trading Advisor programs. Equinox also sponsors the Equinox EquityHedge US Strategy Fund, the Equinox Alternative Strategy Platform, a menu of single commodity trading advisor programs offered in a mutual fund format, and Equinox Frontier Funds, a public managed futures family of funds with daily liquidity.

*Long/Short – a strategy that seeks to minimize exposure to the market in general, and profit from a change in the difference, or spread in price, between two assets.  

Investors should carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses of the Funds. These and other important information about the Funds are contained in the applicable Prospectus, which can be obtained by calling 1-888-643-3431. The Prospectus should be read carefully before investing.

Ad campaign costs accrued before receiving a credit, as well as costs accrued after all credits are used, will be charged to the payment method associated with the Bing Ads account. If customer payment fails, the coupon amount will not be applied.  Ads will continue to run and accrue costs after any promotional credit has been used up. Any portion of the credit not used within ninety (90) days of credit redemption will expire and can't be carried over even if the Bing Ads Customer switches their payment method. Offer valid only to residents of the United States. In order for the offer to be valid, a form of payment must be entered into your account prior to redemption of the promotional code and prior to your account going live to take advantage of the credit. This offer may not be combined with any other offer, promotional code coupon or discount, separated, redeemed for cash, transferred, sold, or bartered. Microsoft, in its sole discretion, can close your account for any suspected coupon abuse. Refund of the $25 is not permitted.  See Bing Ads Terms and Conditions for more details at sign-up. Other terms and conditions may apply.  Microsoft reserves the right to cancel, change, or suspend this offer at any time without notice.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

There is a substantial risk of loss in managed futures, and there can be no guarantee that any managed futures program or the Equinox Frontier Funds will meet their intended objective; accordingly, an investment in the Equinox Frontier Funds may not be suitable for everyone. The Funds are highly speculative and their success depends upon the ability of Equinox Fund Management, LLC to allocate assets to multiple strategies and commodity trading advisors (“CTAs”). The Funds also rely on each of the CTAs chosen in meeting the investment objectives. An investment in the Funds involve a high degree of risk due to substantial price volatility in domestic and foreign markets for financial instruments, currencies, energy, metals, and commodities and the uncertainty as to the ability of the CTAs to profit in the markets traded.
Futures, forward, and options trading are speculative, volatile, and highly leveraged; select markets and instruments may be subject to liquidity restrictions from time to time.
An investor could lose a substantial portion, or even all, of his or her investment.
An investor’s annual tax liability may exceed cash distributions.
There is no secondary markets for the units and the transfer of units is restricted. If you redeem all or portion of your class 1 units before the end of 12 months following your purchase, you will be charged a redemption fee of up to 2% of the purchase prices of the units being redeemed.
The Funds face the risk of non-performance by the counterparties to the OTC contracts.
The Equinox Frontier Funds are not mutual funds and are not subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.
Investors should carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Funds. This and other important information about the Funds are in the relevant Prospectuses which can be obtained by calling 1.877.837.0600 The prospectus should be read carefully before investing.

The Multi-Strategy Program (MSP) is an approximate 50/50 combination of the Spread Trading Program (STP) and the Long-Short Commodity Program (LSCP). STP seeks non-correlated alpha through the spread and relative value trading of exchange-listed futures and options that are primarily commodity contracts. Quantitative research and significant discretion are used in trade selection and execution. The LSCP is a short to medium-term systematic program with a discretionary overlay that trades outright positions on 13 exchange-listed commodity futures contracts. The program uses multiple trend models on both outright and calendar spread data and analyzes historical spread levels to generate daily trade signals. The MSP is designed to generate returns that have a low to negative correlation to most CTA and commodity programs.

Portfolio holdings are as of the date stated, are subject to change, and should not be considered investment advice. The portfolio holdings do not include investments of the Equinox Frontier Funds (the “Trust”) cash management pool and the related allocation to the Quest Fixed Income Tracker-based Hedge Program (“QFIT”). QFIT is designed to produce investment returns that have a positive correlation to medium-term interest rates in the United States.  Equinox Fund Management, LLC is allocating to QFIT in order to hedge its cash management investments in U.S. Treasuries.  Such allocation is intended to mitigate duration risk and preserve capital in the Trust’s cash management pool, rather than generate capital appreciation as with the Trust’s other investments in CTA trading programs. The Trust’s total allocation to QFIT was $135 million, as of 3/31/2016.  Such allocation is shared pro-rata by each Fund of the Trust.

Equinox Investment Philosophy and Process
At Equinox Funds, we believe that alternative and traditional investment portfolios built around rigorous diversification and dynamic risk management can add long-term value to an investment strategy. With this philosophy in mind, the Equinox portfolio management team employs the following six-step investment process:




 SCREEN
After determining a Fund or Program’s goals and objectives, the Portfolio Team screens the manager universe for suitable candidates.


 ANALYZE
During this stage, the Portfolio Team seeks to rigorously evaluate historical performance and portfolio attributes as they relate to performance, volatility and strategy discipline.


 SELECT
The next step involves performing exhaustive due diligence on organization, personnel, investment process and operations.


 CONSTRUCT
At this stage of the process the anticipated portfolio is stressed using simulation tools for optimal return, risk, correlation and drawdown metrics.


 MANAGE
Once the initial candidates are identified, the Portfolio Team continually rebuilds the universe of managers and retests the portfolio dynamics.


 REBALANCE
Continuous monitoring of existing managers’ trading and performance seeks to detect style drift or other potential issues and rebalancing occurs as necessary.


Throughout the process, our goal is to provide investors with high-quality alternative investment portfolios that — when added to an asset allocation strategy — can potentially reduce risk and enhance returns over time.

Commodity Trading Advisors (CTAs) provide advice and services related to trading and investment strategies utilizing futures contracts and options on futures contracts on a wide variety of physical goods such as agricultural products, forest products, metals, and energy, plus derivative contracts on financial instruments such as indices, bonds, and currencies. Each CTA is characterized by its respective trading strategy and the markets it trades. CTAs are regulated by the United States federal government through registration with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and membership in the National Futures Association (NFA)†.

View Performance




The investment philosophy of H2O is based on the conviction that value diversification is the most stable and robustsource of alpha over time. All-out diversification not only across assets, but also by investment horizon and manager expertise, gives us the ability to make better decisions and to produce more consistent risk adjusted performance. To generate alpha, H2O AM follows a top-down qualitative investment process and monitors the risk associated to calibrate the highly diversified strategies. No single position in itself has any meaning outside this overall risk/return context. A view is fed by a set of factors from seven fund managers and established as a risk-on, risk-off or diversifying strategy at a given horizon. The qualitative views are then translated into quantitative forecasts taking into account past volatilities and correlations and using Black & Litterman methodology as the key instrument enabling the conversion of views into positions. H2O AM fund managers take directional, relative value and specific/thematic positions in fixed income, currency and equity markets (no credit, no commodity exposure). The exposures are first decided in respect of each asset class: G4 govies, USD and equity markets. Relative value strategies are then constructed independently from the directional positions: they are "exposure-neutral". Finally, specific or thematic calls may be implemented separately. All the above strategies are invested using preferably derivatives. The Funds Under Management corresponds to the assets of the strategy.

The Multi-Strategy Program (MSP) is an approximate 50/50 combination of the Spread Trading Program (STP) and the Long-Short Commodity Program (LSCP). STP seeks non-correlated alpha through the spread and relative value trading of exchange-listed futures and options that are primarily commodity contracts. Quantitative research and significant discretion are used in trade selection and execution. The LSCP is a short to medium-term systematic program with a discretionary overlay that trades outright positions on 13 exchange-listed commodity futures contracts. The program uses multiple trend models on both outright and calendar spread data and analyzes historical spread levels to generate daily trade signals. The MSP is designed to generate returns that have a low to negative correlation to most CTA and commodity programs.

Portfolio holdings are as of the date stated, are subject to change, and should not be considered investment advice. The portfolio holdings do not include investments of the Equinox Frontier Funds (the “Trust”) cash management pool and the related allocation to the Quest Fixed Income Tracker-based Hedge Program (“QFIT”). QFIT is designed to produce investment returns that have a positive correlation to medium-term interest rates in the United States.  Equinox Fund Management, LLC is allocating to QFIT in order to hedge its cash management investments in U.S. Treasuries.  Such allocation is intended to mitigate duration risk and preserve capital in the Trust’s cash management pool, rather than generate capital appreciation as with the Trust’s other investments in CTA trading programs. The Trust’s total allocation to QFIT was $135 million, as of 3/31/2016.  Such allocation is shared pro-rata by each Fund of the Trust.

An investor could lose a substantial portion, or even all, of his or her investment.

Equinox Investment Philosophy and Process
At Equinox Funds, we believe that alternative and traditional investment portfolios built around rigorous diversification and dynamic risk management can add long-term value to an investment strategy. With this philosophy in mind, the Equinox portfolio management team employs the following six-step investment process:




 SCREEN
After determining a Fund or Program’s goals and objectives, the Portfolio Team screens the manager universe for suitable candidates.


 ANALYZE
During this stage, the Portfolio Team seeks to rigorously evaluate historical performance and portfolio attributes as they relate to performance, volatility and strategy discipline.


 SELECT
The next step involves performing exhaustive due diligence on organization, personnel, investment process and operations.


 CONSTRUCT
At this stage of the process the anticipated portfolio is stressed using simulation tools for optimal return, risk, correlation and drawdown metrics.


 MANAGE
Once the initial candidates are identified, the Portfolio Team continually rebuilds the universe of managers and retests the portfolio dynamics.


 REBALANCE
Continuous monitoring of existing managers’ trading and performance seeks to detect style drift or other potential issues and rebalancing occurs as necessary.


Throughout the process, our goal is to provide investors with high-quality alternative investment portfolios that — when added to an asset allocation strategy — can potentially reduce risk and enhance returns over time.

There are substantial risks and potential conflicts of interest associated with managed futures programs. The success of an investment in such a program is dependent upon the ability of a commodity trading advisor (“CTA”) to identify profitable investment opportunities and successfully trade. The identification of attractive trading opportunities is difficult, requires skill, and involves a significant degree of uncertainty. The high degree of leverage often obtainable in futures trading can work against you as well as for you, and can lead to large losses. Returns generated from a CTA’s trading, if any, may not adequately compensate you for the business and financial risks you assume. You can lose all or a substantial amount of your investment. Managed futures accounts may be subject to substantial charges for management and advisory fees. It may be necessary for accounts that are subject to these charges to make substantial trading profits in order to avoid depletion or exhaustion of their assets. CTAs may trade highly illiquid markets, or on foreign markets, and may not be able to close or offset positions immediately upon request. You may have market exposure even after the CTA has a request for closure or liquidation.
