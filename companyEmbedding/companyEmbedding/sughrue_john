John T. Sughrue
Chief Executive OfficerFounder/Director/Shareholder
John T. Sughrue established Brook Partners, Inc. in 1994 to capitalize on real estate investment opportunities in the Southwest. Since that time, Brook Partners has evolved into a full-service  development, investment and advisory firm recognized as a leader in the real estate industry, that has a major influence in Dallas. Since its inception, Brook Partners and its principals have been involved in development projects exceeding $1 billion. Mr. Sughrue created the Fashion Industry Gallery (FIG), the contemporary high-end wholesale fashion boutique which inspired hundreds of fashion lines to relocate to the Arts District of Downtown Dallas. His partnering with the iconic Texas Chef Stephan Pyles, in his eponymous 10,000-square-foot restaurant established five-star dining in the Arts District. In addition, Brook Partners developed the nationally recognized art-house, Magnolia Theatre, which was the engine that accelerated leasing at the West Village of Dallas, now considered one of the most successful lifestyle centers in the country. Brook Partners produces the Dallas Art Fair, a best-of-breed national art fair hosted at FIG now celebrating its ninth year.  They also developed Museum Tower, a 42-story luxury condominium high-rise in the Dallas Arts District. The project has changed the city skyline and helped create a new center for living in Downtown Dallas.  As an advisor to an offshore investor, Mr. Sughrue also contributed to the development of Heron Tower, a five-star office building designed by Kuhn Pedersen Fox Associates and the tallest tower ever constructed in the City of London upon its completion in 2011.
Initially, Mr. Sughrue established Brook Partners to continue the acquisition and repositioning of distressed assets for his own account. Assets acquired from the RTC, “bad banks” or “bridge banks”, insurance companies and other distressed sellers included commercial land, office, industrial (including Brownfields), residential, data centers and theatres and commercial mortgage notes. Each asset was acquired with the strategy to create value through either, or a combination of, aggressive management of operations, budget conscious redevelopment, concise target marketing and communications, and improved financial capabilities of the sponsors. Over time, Brook Partners’ expertise was sought by domestic and international investors and institutions leading to advisory assignments involving a multitude of property types both domestically and internationally.
Prior to Brook Partners, Mr. Sughrue served as director of development for SCI Real Estate Development, an Italian investment and development firm affiliated with Pirelli Realty of Milan, Italy, and ROEV of Rome, Italy. In 1991, Mr. Sughrue directed SCI's acquisition of seven office buildings approximating two million square feet from North Carolina National Bank (“NCNB”; the precursor to Bank of America). SCI became NCNB’s  largest landlord  in Texas  and later  was awarded  a management contract from the Bank for an additional two million square feet of Bank office space located in third party buildings in Downtown Dallas.  Prior to joining SCI, Mr. Sughrue worked in New York for the Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Real Estate Investment Banking Group and for Chemical Bank's Real Estate Lending Group, where he was involved with in excess of $1 billion of real estate debt and equity financings.
Raised in Boston, Mr. Sughrue received his B.A. in Economics in 1982 from Harvard College and an M.B.A. from The Amos Tuck School of Dartmouth College in 1988. Mr. Sughrue was a founder of Magnolia Pictures, an Austin-based exhibition and distribution film company that opened the Magnolia Theatre in Dallas in 2002. He is also a director and executive Producer of Insignia Films, a New York-based documentary film company heralded for its productions of "The West," a $12 million project for PBS on the history of the American West, and “Amato-A Love Affair with Opera,” a cinema verite piece nominated for the prestigious Directors Guild 2001 Best Documentary Award. Mr. Sughrue was a 2002 recipient of the Neiman Marcus Renaissance Award, for significant contributions to the revitalization of Downtown Dallas. Among numerous civic endeavors, he is a founder and director of Veritex Community Bank, a Dallas-based community bank founded in 2010 and rapidly expanding through acquisitions and loan growth. He is a guest speaker at New York University's Graduate Real Estate Development Program.  He is currently a director of the Dallas Contemporary.  He was honorary chair of the 2012 Art + Advocacy Auction benefitting the Dallas Children's Advocacy Center (DCAC).  The mission of the DCAC is to improve the lives of abused children in Dallas County and provide national leadership on child abuse issues.  He was a past chairman of America Scores Dallas, an after-school program that promotes literacy among inner-city elementary school children in the Dallas Independent School District.

		Let’s Make Dallas Even Better

How John Sughrue is Helping Reinvent Dallas
The Brook Partners director didn’t plan on hanging around long when he moved here 20 years ago. But the real estate opportunities proved too compelling.

John Sughrue was on top of the world. it was 2001, and a deal he had going at 1807 Ross Avenue was looking like it was going to pay off—big time. Redeveloped as a telco property, the 300,000-square-foot asset was 70 percent leased to two fast-growing companies and was being hotly pursued by investors. 
“We had a $100 million offer for a building we had $30 million in,” says Sughrue, founder and director of Brook Partners. “I was thinking, ‘This is my day!’ But within two weeks, that buyer’s stock cracked in half, and the deal was off. Six months later, both of our tenants had filed for bankruptcy—and we were left with an empty building.”
The property sat vacant for months. Sughrue was still licking his wounds when a group of fashion designers approached Brook Partners about opening a showroom in the space. It was a far cry from the high-tech haven he had envisioned, but when Sughrue learned the group was willing to pay $24 per square foot in rent, his interest was piqued. He and Lyle Burgin, director of development at Brook Partners, set about getting to know the fashion business.
They studied top galleries in Los Angeles and New York and soon got excited about the idea. The lenders weren’t so sure—until they learned Tommy Bahama would be among the designers participating. “In the fashion world, [the brand] is considered low-brow,” Sughrue says. “But they were credit, and the lenders could understand it.” 
Fashion Institute Gallery, or f.i.g., opened in 2003 and has since expanded four times. With the showroom utilized only about five weeks a year for fashion markets, Brook Partners began looking at other event opportunities. The wide-open, finished space in the center of the Arts District soon got bookings for everything from bar mitzvahs to Super Bowl parties. 
Today the events operation on its own is a multimillion-dollar operation. (1807 Ross also hosts the Dallas Art Fair, a labor of love Sughrue launched with esteemed art consultant Chris Byrne in 2009.)
As f.i.g. began to flourish, 1807 Ross also began attracting more traditional office tenants, including Amegy Bank, landscape firm Mesa USA, and Beck. Sughrue tapped Mesa to develop a park off the building’s west side, which honors Beck’s late founder, Henry C. Beck Jr. 
During an event at Beck Park, Dallas caterer Wendy Krispin looked up and asked Sughrue what he was going to do with the property’s street-level space. As it happened, one of her restaurant friends was looking for a spot in the Arts District. “Can you rip off the front of the building?” she asked.
The chef was Stephan Pyles. 
“Like the fashion business, we had no intention of getting into the restaurant business,” says Sughrue. “I also have no thought in my mind of getting into the Broadway business; but if Andrew Lloyd Webber shows up, I’m going to think about it.” 
The lenders were convinced to do the deal—after the acclaimed chef cooked dinner for them—and Stephan Pyles, the restaurant, opened in 2005. The once-empty 1807 Ross was now 90 percent occupied, and in a perfect position to sell. Ray Hunt, whose Hunt Oil home base sits just north of the building, snapped it up, giving him control of the block from Woodall to Ross.  
Sughrue formed an enterprise to take ownership of the fashion gallery. Between f.i.g. and his Brook Partners office, he leased a total of 70,000 square feet, going from the building’s landlord to its largest tenant.
The project ended up generating about a 12 percent return—and exemplifies the creative dealmaking and urban renewal efforts for which Sughrue has become known.
“This building has been a wild ride, but it’s pretty indicative of our capabilities, our interests, our passions, and our conviction in downtown Dallas,” Sughrue says. “I sometimes joke that we probably could have made a lot more money building strip centers in Flower Mound, but that’s not how we’re wired.”
From Boston to DallasSughrue grew up in Braintree, Mass., “pretty much the Boston version of Mayberry R.F.D.,” he says. He attended Harvard University (thanks to solid grades and a generous financial aid package), then, like many of his peers, headed to Wall Street. He worked in real estate lending for Chemical Bank, then in Merrill Lynch’s capital markets group.
In 1990, one of his banking clients, a wealthy Italian family, asked him to move to Dallas. The North Texas real estate market was depressed at the time, and there were bargains to be had. Operating as SCI Real Estate Development, the firm made a flurry of acquisitions, then reached its limit. But Sughrue kept seeing deals. 
He got approval to begin investing on his own behalf and soon was able to launch his own firm, partnering with Robert Petrucello. (Sughrue bought Petrucello out of the business a number of years ago, although the friends remain partners in various deals.)
Burgin joined Brook Partners in 2001. He had served as architect for several of the company’s projects in the West End. But it was The Magnolia that in 2001 lured Burgin away from Corgan, where he’d worked for 20 years. At the time, he was overseeing a team of 50 architects; he missed having more hands-on design involvement and also wanted to tap into his entrepreneurial nature. 
“The opportunity presented itself to partner with Mark Cuban and roll out a new movie theater chain,” Burgin says. The plan was to do about 24 theaters and marry it to Magnolia Pictures, an independent film company led by Eamonn Bowles and Bill Banowsky, who had approached Sughrue about getting involved. The team built four theaters before Cuban bought Landmark Theatres—and things changed.
“He was our shareholder and became our biggest competitor,” Sughrue says. “Mark thought it would be a good idea if the two companies merged and all of the gadfly investors, Lyle and me included, go away. He handled it very well; I applaud him. He didn’t overpay—but he didn’t take advantage of the situation either.”
Tower PlayThe real show-stopper among Brook Partners’ projects is Museum Tower, a 42-story, glass-encased, $200 million condominium project under construction in the Arts District. Designed by Los Angeles architect Scott Johnson, it will include between 100 and 112 luxury units, ranging in size from 1,600 square feet to more than 9,000 square feet. 
Brook Partners and co-developer Turtle Creek Holdings, led by Dan Boeckman and Greg Greene, began working on the project nearly 15 years ago.  It’s slated for completion in 2012—not quite the timetable the developers originally had in mind.
“We thought we knew it all and that we’d have a building up in five years; Mr. Nasher told us it would be at least 10,” says Sughrue, referring to the late Raymond Nasher, whose renowned Nasher Sculpture Center sits immediately west of the condo tower. 
When pre-development work began, Nasher made his opinions known about the project. “He didn’t pull any punches; he damn sure didn’t want anything mediocre on the site,” Sughrue says.
And that was in line with the developers’ goals. “From the moment we got involved we knew we controlled an important site,” Sughrue says. “The original partners are all Dallasites. We wanted to make sure that what was built was not just a commercial success, but a civic success as well.”
Construction of Museum Tower finally kicked off in mid-2010. To move the project forward, the developers gave up their equity stake. The $200 million tower is 100 percent owned by the Dallas Police & Fire Pension System. 
Sughrue says it’s surreal to see the project take shape, after so many years of looking at renderings. Model units will be available at the end of 2011, and sales are under way.
To date, Brook Partners has been involved in $1 billion in developments and $2 billion in investments; it also oversees a $4.5 billion advisory assignment. Late last year, former Crescent executive Paul Smith joined the firm to lead the advisory group, and Gary Sherman, who once served as a lender’s representative for 1807 Ross, was tapped to manage principal investments and Brook Partners’ New York office.
“I don’t think I ever intended to stay [in Dallas], but the longer I did, the more I realized I enjoyed contributing to city-building,” Sughrue says. “We have been remarkably fortunate to play a part, along with so many others, in recreating a city’s center.That Dallas has so transformed itself over the last 20 years is a tribute to the talent and commitment and passion of Dallasites. Twenty years from now, Dallas is going to be a bustling urban center—and the gold coast will be the Arts District.”

We scheduled a meeting with Dallas immigration lawyer Mr. Martin Valko of Chavez & Valko, and asked him what he thought about our case.In April 2008 we received our L- 1A Visa (L2 for the family) to establish a new office of our German Software Company in the US. Unfortunately we were not able to leave Germany before October 2008. In December 2008 we asked our prior attorney to apply for the extension of the Visa. He filed the application for the extension of the L1-A Visa in April 2009 (5 months later). Instead of answering the INS request for evidence (RFE), he tried to change the Visa application from L1-A into a L1-B. The US immigration denied the petition because we were not able to change the status for a filed petition. To do so, we would have had to file a new one. However, not worst enough, he told us not to leave the US and to stay during he was filing a petition for a B1 Visa to gain additional time to prepare a new L1-A application.Mr. Martin Valko took on our case. He told us that it will be difficult but he would try to rescue the case, thoroughly explained the case to us after his analysis of the immigration laws and regulations, and promised us to do the best. After he had all our paperwork, he and his legal team needed only a few days to prepare the new L1-A petition (L-2 for the family). We used the premium processing service of the USCIS, and we had our approval after less than one week!!!  We then scheduled a visa appointment at the US Consulate in Berlin, Germany the following week, and our new L-1A and L-2 visas have been granted for a full one year!When searching for a good immigration attorney, you will find thousands of attorneys and all of them promise to be the best and to do the best work. After all this experience we can tell, that there are only a few really good immigration attorney out there and it is hard to find them. We found one of them and are proud of this work, and we can't thank him enough. Mr. Martin Valko knows what he is talking about! He has a lot of experience in immigration law and his rates are absolutely fair. For all of those people in need of an immigration attorney, we recommend the law firm of Chavez & Valko in Dallas, TX."- Provox Systems, Dallas, TXChavez & Valko, LLPweetabixtourist ratedThis is crazy!I don't doub...This is crazy!I don't doubt that the other attorneys are good, I'm sure they are but I'm gonna talk about Gary Frost. Gary Frost is amazing. I called the law firm in tears and he made me see that I was over stressing about something that was not even a problem at all.My abusive ex boyfriend (who is like totally trashy and lame) filed a k-1 petition and talked me into signing it during the time that I was on zoloft and xanax (due to the stress in the relationship), which I did (love makes people act stupid)Later on, when I realized he cheated on me, I cancelled it.My main concern was knowing that this would cause trouble later on (like for example when I go to the states on vacation because me and my family have been going there since I was like two). I was stressed and I appreciate his kind words (which meant so much to me) as well as his legal advice. He broke with all the stereotypes of the mean and cold attorneys. Now in spanish!!!No se que tal sean los otros abogados pero yo voy a hablar de Gary Frost. Llame a las oficinas asi como que llorando y me hizo ver que estaba asi como que preocupandome por algo que nada que ver!!El naco de mi ex novio dio de alta una peticion k-1, y me convencio de iniciar todo el rollo. Y cuando me di cuenta que el muy loser me engaño pues obvio que la quise cancelar, osea nadie va andar con alguien que lo trate mal (y encima hablaba mal de los mexicanos a veces solo por ser el norteamericano, osea, que le pasaba?)Mi preocupacion principal era saber que estoy me pudiera afectar en un futuro, y el me hizo saber que no tenia porque preocuparme, de una manera bastante amigable. Aprecio mucho su asesoria legal, pero aun mas sus palabras de aliento cuando yo estaba toda nerviosa y desesperada y necesitaba escuchar que todo iba a estar bien.Chavez & Valko, LLPTerry H. ratedWe did it! My wife is coming to America! No words can ever convey my heartfelt thanks to Chavez and Valko’s ~ Martin Valko and Eduardo Amaro. My heart is full of joy as I write the following…The law firm of Chavez and Valko was referred to me by an acquaintance and I met with Martin Valko immediately upon returning from my wedding in Zhengzhou China and I liked him very much.  The road to a successful migration can be a perilous one. Never dreaming our case would require almost five years and three Visa Interviews to complete. The US Department of State made several errors that no one could have foreseen. The US Consulate in Guangzhou sent our case back (2) times and Chavez and Valko reaffirmed it and then finally on the third try the Consulate Visa Officers realized ours was a bona fide marriage. I know this placed additional burden and countless man-hours on Chavez and Valko. I was concerned when our first Visa interview was not successful in March 2010 and I was concerned the Law Firm would drop us as clients. I met with Mr. Valko and he put all my worries to rest. They are true to their word and a Law Firm of the highest honor. Mr. Valko and Mr. Amaro our paralegal never once wavered and I can’t imagine anyone, anywhere, at anytime fighting any harder for our case all these years. They paid the closest of attention to slightest of details. When we gave up they kept fighting for us. Chavez and Valko’s Law Firm has grown in size since over the last five years but those assigned to our case in the beginning…remained on our case until the very end. May God bless the Law Firm of Chavez and Valko and their staff members. !!Chavez & Valko, LLPfelipenvanessa.rosas ratedWe would like to thank Mr. Val...We would like to thank Mr. Valko and his paralegal, Jessica for their help and hard work. My husband is from Mexico and has been here since he was eight years old. Originally, we contacted Mr. Valko's office to help my husband get a visa. In the meantime, the new Deferred Action came out and Mr. Valko suggested that we go this route since it appeared that my husband met the criteria. Immigration received my husband's application for Deferred Action in September 2012, he went to his biometrics appointment in mid-October 2012, received an approval notification in mid-November 2012 and three days letter received his work permit in the mail. Now, he has his Social Security card and driver license. No more worries that my husband will go to work one day and not return home because he was picked up by immigration. Again, we are so thankful and appreciative for the great work Mr. Valko and Jessica have done for us. They always return your call or email very quickly and you don't always get that kind of service from attorney's offices. Mr. Valko exuded confidence in our case and his expertise and that in turn eased our minds a great deal. We felt like we were treated as human beings by people who cared about our situation. There is still more to do and we will stay with Mr. Valko because we can trust him. If he can help you, then he will. If he cannot help you, he will be honest and tell you so. If you have any immigration issues, this is the office to go to. We have recommended Mr. Valko to other family, our friends and strangers that we have heard are in need of immigration assistance. Vanessa & Felipe RosasChavez & Valko, LLPRafael P. ratedHi my name is Rafael Pantoja im originally from Mexico but im a resident allien who was raise in the state of California.This past January I was detained by Imigration at the Dallas airport when I did my connecting Flight From mexico to Dallas and Then to Sacramento California.Do to some 2 arrest in the past For Drug posesion which I did clear out years ago they still detained me and I was sent to Johnson County Jail in Clearburn texas till i saw a Judge, My Family find Out about CHAVEZ & VALKO FIRM in the internet or by some relative, and hired then to help me with my case. they started the processes so quick and the day MR.GARY FROST came to me I could Felt He was going to help Me, I also felt these Law Firm also cares not just about money but they do care for you and your family, Mr Gary Frost Never promise me noting ,But He did promise he was gonna do his BEST...

THANK YOU SOO MUCH GARY FROST AND CHAVEZ & VALKO GOD BLESS YOU GUYSChavez & Valko, LLPthatman ratedAfter almost 10 years in the US immigration process I finally received my US permanent residency (Green Card) in August 2013. This is life changing in so many areas. I work in a mid-management position for a Fortune 500 company in the Dallas/Fort Worth metroplex area and sometime in the mid-2000s, my company migrated its immigration legal representatives from a very expensive Washington DC area firm to the much more affordable firm of Chavez & Valko in the DFW area. While there were a few parties involved in my process, the champions have been Martin Valko and his team of Paralegals (including the ever available Shannon) at Chavez & Valko. As anyone who may have gone through the US immigration system can attest, the suspense and uncertainties in the process can be a teeth grinding experience. Throughout my dual intent H1B & PERM process Martin and his team kept me updated, performed timely execution of the series of USCIS document filing and notifications, State Department visa applications, provided me and my family reassurance during USCIS delays, and pretty much held my hands through it all. I am very grateful for their hard work, proactive professionalism, dedication to my personal process, and uncompromising commitment to deliver. I am already gladly recommending the firm of Chavez & Valko to family, friends and anyone else who may have any form of immigration issues whether they are being handled through their corporate/employer sponsorship or personally. Eric D Fein & Assocchristopherindallas ratedEric Fein is in a class all to...Eric Fein is in a class all to himself.  When you need the toughest attorney willing to do whatever it takes to win your case, you need Eric Fein.  Eric specializes in Business, Corporation, Insurance, Intellectual Property among other areas.  However, what Eric Fein most specializes in is winning.  He's like a pit bull, once he gets a hold of the other side he doesn't let go.  Eric has represented me in a number of cases and has always delivered a positive outcome, even when the odds were stacked against.  I have seen Eric take on the largest of insurance companies that have unlimited resources and were willing to do anything to deny a claim, even though it was a valid claim.  When Eric was done they didn't know what hit them.  He did circles around them and showed them that the law was not on their side, and neither was he.  In the end, it wound up costing the insurance company a whole lot more than if they would have just paid the claim in the first place. And this type of outcome is typical with Eric Fein.  Eric is not a low cost attorney and he typically charges by the hour, but the end value he delivers is well worth it.  When you  absolutely need to win and want the toughest guy in town willing to do whatever it takes to win, Eric Fein is your guy.  If you are an insurance company and Eric Fein is the opposing counsel in a claim, you are screwed and better pay now because the outcome will not be in your favor.  On a scale of 1-10 Eric Fein gets an 11. Chavez & Valko, LLPswarans ratedI’m a Sr.Netweaver administrator at a Fortune 500 company which manufactures and distributes steel.  My company retains Chavez & Valko immigration law firm and their corporate immigration team initially assisted my company with the transfer of my H-1B and H-4 petitions from my previous employer. After I was “ported” the company filed a new labor PERM application in a faster category and the I-140 petition was then filed to recapture my earlier priority date from my old petition which was successful.  Our cases were not very simple as the I-485 green card applications for me and my wife were accepted first without our kids.  During this time Martin Valko and his paralegals worked relentlessly on my cases, communicated with USCIS, and even conferenced me into a call to make sure that all of the cases were consolidated. What sets this team apart from other attorneys I worked with in the past is that they were always accessible and provided me with regular updates and answered my calls or emails sometimes within minutes.  After the priority dates became current this year we received a call from Martin that our green cards are being produced and that was the best news for me and my family as we have been in this immigration process for many years. I would recommend Chavez & Valko to my family and friends without hesitation and not only in employment cases but also for deportation and family immigration needs. Their team is the best.Swaran S. with family.Chavez & Valko, LLPhrmgr13 ratedI am a Human Resource Manager at a Fortune 500 company with over 100 locations in 12 countries.  We have been working with Martin Valko and his employment-based immigration team at Chavez & Valko for almost 5 years and our experience has been great.   Martin’s team handles all of our immigration and employer compliance needs, and to date has successfully completed over 150 matters. The cases include H-1B, L-1A, L-1B and TN petitions, the respective visa applications at consulates, PERMs, I-140 petitions, green card applications as well as applications for employment and travel authorizations.  They are very professional, prompt to answer our calls and emails (even during holidays and weekends), and they navigate through the maze of complex laws with absolute ease. For example, with longer green card wait times, they skillfully prepared new labor certifications and petition in the faster category so that several of our employees received their green cards faster.  The major advantage of working with Martin’s team over large national immigration law firms we used in the past is that Martin’s team is quick, efficient, and reliable and the end result is a great value to the company. I can call Martin or any other team member for a quick chat without having to schedule the meeting in advance, and I don’t receive an itemized invoice for such a call which is very important to us in this economy. Law Office of Rob Wiley, P.C.christopherindallas ratedRob Wiley is without a doubt the best employment attorney around.  I was Rob's 1st client in 2000 when he 1st started his practice.  Rob's experience, professionalism, ethics and commitment to his clients combined with his drive to win places him at the top of his game.  Rob is also very honest upfront.  Rob will carefully examine your case and give you real advice about the possible outcome before he signs on. Rather than just take your money and see what happens later, Rob will be up front and honest.  If he thinks you don't have a good case, he will tell you that upfront.  The same goes for a great case or a 50/50. Rob is also a great trial attorney.  If you have a case that ends up in trial, this is the guy you want out in front representing you.  His experience, understanding of the law combined with his personality give him a unique ability to properly convey your side  and interests in court, even when up against the toughest corporate attorneys, and win your case.  Unfortunately, employee rights in Texas are minimal, at best, and the laws are written to favor the employer.  You need an attorney that best understands this and can deliver the best possible outcome for you, not the employer.  Rob Wiley is board certified in Texas for employment law and and he is without a doubt the best in his field. On a scale of 1-10, Rob gets an 11. Did You Know?Types of AttorneysThe legal profession is vast, with each attorney having his or her specialties. Here are some of the most common attorneys individuals seek out when they require legal aid:Criminal Lawyer
A criminal defense lawyer is probably the attorney the average person imagines. Criminal attorneys are the men and women who defend individuals accused of a crime. The lawyer may work pro bono - for the public good - so the accused is certain to have representation, even if he or she cannot afford an attorney.Criminal lawyers are experts in the criminal justice system. They help their clients decide how to plead when first charged by the police and guide them through trial procedures. Defense lawyers must use every bit of their knowledge and resources to get their clients the fairest results from criminal proceedings.Business Lawyer
If you are a small business owner or the head of a larger corporation, you may come into contact with a business lawyer. Many big companies keep a legal staff on payroll to deal with the daily operations of running and maintaining a large enterprise. Business lawyers may have more specific specialties like copyright law, product liability and mergers and acquisitions.Business attorneys may focus their practices on certain industries. There are entertainment lawyers to guide artists through royalties and media contracts, while hospitals employ malpractice attorneys to protect doctors from aggressive litigation.Employment Lawyer
When you work for a company, you may find yourself in need of an employment lawyer - especially if the relationship between you and your employer sours. An employment attorney prevents people from losing their jobs due to unfair reasons. Workers' compensation lawyers help maintain safe employment conditions and ensure workers receive fair compensation after workplace injury or discrimination.Finance Lawyer
A personal finance attorney can protect and manage your investments and securities. You may use a finance lawyer to help you prepare your taxes, but you might be better off working with an accountant. A tax attorney is more commonly contacted after a business or individual runs into trouble with the IRS or state regulators.Real Estate Lawyer
Your family may keep a lawyer on retainer to guide you through the major expenses that come up in life. When buying a home, you could work with a real estate lawyer to make sure you get the best deal and won't get taken advantage of by tricky mortgage agreements or unfair landlords. An estate attorney can help you plan for the worst by creating a will and preparing your finances for after your death.Bankruptcy Lawyer
A bankruptcy lawyer is essential to help you resolve your financial difficulties when they start to spin out of control. Certain attorneys help create strategies to bring you out of debt and speak to your creditors. A lawyer can advise you on which type of bankruptcy you should file for.Civil Lawyer
If you are suing someone or being sued, you need a civil lawyer. Civil attorneys - and criminal lawyers - are the legal representatives who argue on your behalf in a courtroom setting. Civil lawyers may represent you on matters of business, finance or a wide variety of other specialized needs.One of the most common types of civil attorneys is a personal injury lawyer. When you're hurt by an outside party and you would like to hold them legally responsible, a personal injury attorney conducts litigation and negotiates settlements to compensate for your pain and suffering. Sometimes many wronged people will join together with a single civil lawyer or law office to form a class action lawsuit.Family/Divorce Lawyer
Most people will turn to a lawyer during a divorce to navigate the emotionally charged legal proceedings. A divorce attorney can assist in determining grounds for separation, division of property and custody of children.Family attorneys deal with much more personal matters. If you're getting married, a family lawyer can help you prepare a prenuptial agreement or other family planning paperwork such as adoption or inheritance documents.Questions One Should Ask a Lawyer Before Hiring ThemTo ensure you find a competent attorney who won't abuse your trust or drain your finances, you have to make the proper inquiries. There are several questions you should ask, but the majority will fall under three general topics:Training and Experience Questions
One of the best ways to determine quality is to examine an attorney's history. When you first step into a lawyer's office, you should check for the appropriate certifications and diplomas. You have to ask how long he or she has practiced law and request information that demonstrates the practice's success. Look for precise details such as percentage of cases settled out of court.Once you inquire about the broad details of their legal career, you should ask questions about their experience that pertains to your specific issue. You should ask how many similar cases they have handled and if they have special skills or training that applies specifically to your needs. Lawyers can't mention clients by name, but you should ask for basic details about identical past cases.Financial Questions
You need to ask about every possible fee that will come up when working with an attorney. You should request a list of all costs in advance so you won't be surprised by additional expenses like overhead. Also determine exactly when you will start being billed. You want to inspect paperwork carefully. If the attorney charges you for his or her experience, you need to make sure he or she will perform tasks personally and not hand it off to an assistant.Find out if the attorney has a flat fee or charges by the hour. Many civil lawyers work on contingency. Whatever the payment plan, make inquiries about how the lawyer plans to provide service for your money and what you can do if you start to feel unsatisfied with his or her performance.Lawyer/Client Relationship Questions
When you hire a lawyer, you're agreeing to work with someone over a certain period of time. You need to ask questions about how the attorney will communicate with you and what responsibilities you hold in the relationship. The attorney should let you know the best channel for quick communication and you need to inform him or her when you want updates.You should also ask questions to get to know the attorney as an individual in order to ensure this is a person you can trust. Ask about their legal philosophy and how he or she views the lawyer/client relationship. Great questions to start off with are ones that will make your life easier, such as how to keep fees down or what daily disruptions you should expect from a long legal battle. The more forthcoming the lawyer appears to be with individual needs, the better.Top Reasons to Hire a LawyerYou may keep a lawyer on retainer or you could turn to an attorney during specific situations. Here are some common reasons people begin seeking legal representation or advice:You Know Your Limitations
If you sign documents and you come across a word you don't recognize, you need assistance. You may need a third party to help you navigate important employment or real estate paperwork. It's essential you fully understand the terms of any legally binding documentation or activity you become a part of. If you are not an expert in a given field, you'll want to hire an attorney who is.A lawyer may find legal implications or opportunities you might miss. If you find yourself in a civil or criminal matter, a proper attorney ensures you don't receive a harsh punishment for a small mistake.You're Facing an Important Event/Decision
When making decisions critical to your financial stability or personal life, you may want a lawyer with expertise in your situation to make sure you do everything you can to arrive at the proper resolution. This is especially true when you become involved in a criminal case and your freedom is on the line.It's not just a matter of legal knowledge; lawyer's have access to numerous resources you do not. They have staff ready to work around the clock and experts in a variety of fields to give your important issues the attention they deserve.You Can't Be Impartial
During times when personal matters intersect with legal proceedings, you may need to have an advocate to prevent your emotions from getting in the way of level-headed thinking. For example, divorce lawyers can mediate a heated argument and help both partners get on with their lives.Emotional investment could be subtle. You may want to have a lawyer look over an investment opportunity that looks too good to be true or investigate the merits of a possible civil suit when you feel wronged.You're Out of Options
Many people turn to lawyers when they are in trouble. If you've been accused of a crime or are in a terrible financial situation, you can find an attorney who will work with what you have available to assist you as you deal with your problems.Personal injury lawyers find solutions for people who can no longer work under their own power and bankruptcy attorneys prevent people from giving in to debt. If you find yourself in a situation where you can't find a solution, a lawyer may be able to offer the counsel you need.How to Choose a LawyerWhen it comes time to choose a lawyer, you should start by searching close to home. While you probably don't want the conflict of interest that comes from being represented by a family member, friends and loved ones can recommend lawyers who served them well in the past. If you do have attorneys you are familiar with, ask who they believe would be best for you.After going through personal references - especially from individuals who had similar needs - you should broaden your search through public information resources. You can call your area's attorney referral service or check legal organizations like Martindale-Hubbell. There are other resources available online. You should check websites for client reviews and other third-party forms of approval.When you build a list of possible candidates, perform a background check on each one. See if you can find information on their history and success record. Once you find a possible lawyer, you should call to arrange a consultation so you can ask your important questions in person.By performing the necessary research and taking every available precaution, you can narrow your search to the attorney most suited to your needs.
