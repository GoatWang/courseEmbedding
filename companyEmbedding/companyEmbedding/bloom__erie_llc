Red Bloom Black Tea








              
                 
                  $ 2.35 
                
              
            






Black tea from the Hunan region of China. The name refers to this tea's inner attribute. If it doesn't look to be blooming now, wait till you add water. Then each cluster magically unfolds, revealing a red flower hidden within, and infusing a cup with its robust scent and flavor. It is among the rare group of display teas, meant to delight your eyes as well as taste buds. Makes a very fitting finish to a special meal and a wonderful gift idea!
Price is for one bloom.

Ali Shan_Oolong Tea



              
                 
                  $ 8.25 
                
              
            




Oolong tea from Taiwan.  Formosa, meaning "beautiful" was what the Portuguese explorers called this island.  The oolong tea grown here continues to be called as such.  The exquisite bouquet of Formosa Oolong tea is regarded to the finest in the world.  Complex floral notes echo on your palate as you enjoy this product of Taiwan's Ali mountain.  Light bodied and softly sweet with an underlying complexity, this oolong will surely come to haunt.  Perfect for multiple infusions.  Steep @ 195° for 2-3 minutes.
Price per ounce.

Jasmine Bloom White Tea








              
                 
                  $ 2.35 
                
              
            






Perfumed white tea from the Fujian region of China. The name refers to this tea's inner attribute. If it doesn't look to be blooming now, wait until you add water. Then each cluster magically unfolds, revealing delicate Jasmine flowers within, while infusing a cup with its uniquely sweet scent and flavor. It is among the rare group of display teas, meant to delight your eyes as well as taste buds. Makes a perfect complement to your favorite dessert.  Steep at 180° for 5-7 minutes.
Price is per bloom.
