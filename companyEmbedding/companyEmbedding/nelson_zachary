Career prior to NetSuite[edit]
Nelson held a variety of executive positions in the high-tech industry, spanning marketing, sales, product development and business strategy with leading companies such as Oracle Corporation, Sun Microsystems, and McAfee/Network Associates.
Early in his career, Nelson was responsible for creating the "Powered by Motorola" ingredient brand for the Motorola 68000 microprocessor while he was working at Cunningham Communication.[1]
At Sun, Nelson drove the marketing and branding of the first version of the Solaris operating system, and led the product and corporate marketing effort at the company's SunSoft Division. He was then Vice President, World Wide Marketing at Oracle Corp., where he was responsible for global marketing strategy and implementation. Nelson, at 31 years old, was the youngest VP of Marketing in Oracle's history.
While at McAfee, Nelson helped lead the company's expansion into the network management arena with the $1.4 billion acquisition of Network General. Later, as CEO of NAI subsidiary, myCIO, he created the world's first business-to-business security application services provider.

Under Nelson, NetSuite released global business management software suite NetSuite OneWorld in 2008 and the B2C and B2B ecommerce platform NetSuite SuiteCommerce in 2012.[6]
Nelson also spearheaded NetSuite’s acquisition of commerce marketing software company Bronto in 2015[7] social HR player TribeHR in 2014 and of OrderMotion, Retail Anywhere and Venda in 2013.
In 2016, NetSuite reached a $1 billion run rate.[8] NetSuite was acquired by Oracle for $9.3 billion on November 7, 2016, making it the third largest software company acquisition by enterprise value in the industry.[9]
Influence and honors[edit]
Nelson has won multiple awards and received many accolades in his career including being named to CRN’s 25 Most Influential of 2014 list, which highlights individuals who made the largest impact on the technology industry in the year.[10] Nelson was also named to 2013 Business Insider’s 50 Most Powerful People in Enterprise Tech list,[11] and to Fortune magazine’s 2012 Businessperson of the Year list.[12] Under Nelson’s leadership, NetSuite was named to Forbes Most Innovative Growth Companies 2014 list [13] and to Forbes America’s 100 Most Trustworthy Companies 2013.[14]
Additional background[edit]
He is an investor in Curbed.com, a popular real estate blog network with sites in New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles[15] that was acquired by Vox Media,[16] an investor in Medstory, later acquired by Microsoft,[17] and an investor in Immunet, later acquired by Sourcefire.[18] Nelson is also an investor in Tosca Cafe, a San Francisco restaurant.
