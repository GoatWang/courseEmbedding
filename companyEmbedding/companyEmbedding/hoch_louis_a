Good afternoon and welcome to the Payment Data Systems' Q1 2017 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note this event is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the conference over to Allyson Pooley with Financial Profiles. Please go ahead.
Allyson Pooley
Thank you, Austin. And thank you and welcome to the Payment Data Systems' first quarter 2017 financial results conference call. The earnings release, which Payment Data issued just before this call is available on the Investor Relations website at paymentdata.com/invest under news.
On the call today are Louis Hoch, President and CEO; Tom Jewell, Chief Financial Officer; and Houston Frost, Senior Vice-President of Prepaid Card Services. Management will provide prepared remarks and then we'll open the call up for your questions.

Please refer to the Company's SEC filings on the Investor Relations website for additional information.
And with that, I would now like to turn the call over to Louis.
Louis Hoch
Thank you, Allyson, and welcome everyone. It's been a short time since we've held our last earning's call at the end of March. So our update today will be brief.
During the first quarter, we continued our focus on accelerating sales and marketing campaigns for our key revenue generating initiatives. Although, revenue declined year-over-year, revenues remain stable on a sequential basis, and we were encouraged by the increases in our prepaid revenues as a result of our standout product enhancements as well as solid momentum in our PIN-less debit services which we introduced late last year.
Our operating expenses were down on an absolute basis when compared to a year ago. We continue to generate cash flow from operations and our balance sheet remains strong with a cash position of 3.6 million and no debt as of March 31st. Above all, we remain diligently focused on our sales and marketing campaigns for our key revenue generating initiatives and today I'm pleased to share some updates.

In our payment's network, we were encouraged by the growth of transactions and dollars processed from our new PIN-less debit service offering, and our anticipating future growth through the adoption of this product by more of our existing clients. It's the higher margin product for us than our ACH offering and we believe clients will move from traditionally ACH to PIN-less due to its real time capability.
ACH processing continues to be our core business and we have a strong sales pipeline and we continue to expand our ACH capabilities by bringing on more sponsoring banks to provide our customers with increased flexibility and risk mitigation services.
Now I'd like to turn over the call to Houston Frost to give us update on our prepaid business. Houston?
Houston Frost
Thanks Louis. In prepaid, we continue to focus our sales, marketing and product development efforts on three core solutions. Corporate gift, incentive or promotional cards, turnkey prepaid card program management and processing services, and our direct to consumer product Akimbo. The prepaid card division's revenues increased by 60% in Q1 2017 as compared to Q4 of 2016, primarily as a result of our digital card platform that we launched at Money 20/20 last fall. 
As previously discussed this new platform powers a new way to issue and deliver prepaid cards and we've employed the technology across all of our corporate and consumer card solutions and services. Corporations can deliver promotional rewards cards electronically and consumers can use this card for purchases immediately both in-store and online. In addition, our consumer customers can receive a digital Akimbo card in real time now through the Akimbo app that allows them to engage with the product before a plastic card arrives in the mail. Specifically we've seen more than 160,000 digital cards created since the beginning of this year; while this growth has been largely driven by a single client it demonstrates the viability and scalability of the platform; and we look to leverage this successful role out to increase sales of digital gift, incentive and promotional cards. 
We have three new WhiteLabel prepaid programs set to launch in Q2 2017 and our sales pipeline for prepaid card program management processing services is larger than ever. We expect to launch at least six additional WhiteLabel or co-branded card programs this year and these programs should account for a significant portion of the prepaid card division's revenue in 2017.
As an update on the last earnings call, the new Akimbo card website, web and mobile apps are now live. The updates represent the most significant product enhancements and branding updates since Akimbo's acquisition in December of 2014. In addition we begun to ramp up our marketing efforts for this flagship consumer product. In our first few weeks we've seen the enrollment rate for the Akimbo card doubled and we plan to increase our efforts in June. We fully expect these ongoing marketing efforts will revive the consistent month-over-month growth Akimbo experienced prior to the acquisition.
I'll turn it back over to Louis now for additional updates on the company.
Louis Hoch
In corporate news; in March we announced our intent to acquire Singular Payments, a Fintech payments provider for merchants in healthcare and other niche markets nationwide. We believe this is an important acquisition and is well aligned to our growth strategy and will dramatically broaden our revenue streams. We're in the final stages of due diligence and remain hopeful that we will be able to close the transaction in the near future. Last week we announced addition of a new Board member. Mr. Brad Rollins has agreed to join our Board of Directors and will serve on a nomination, compensation and audit committees. He's the Chief Executive Officer of Dahill Office Technology and his relationship should help position our company to gain new revenue opportunities. The addition of Mr. Rollins to our Board brings our company back in due compliance with NASDAQ corporate governance rules as he joins as an independent member. Welcome to our team Brad.

We filed our proxy statement on April 27th and will hold our 2017 Annual Meeting of Shareholders on Tuesday, June 6 10:00 AM, Central Time at the Hilton Garden Inn, San Antonio Airport. We look forward to seeing many of shareholders at that meeting.
Now I'll turn the call over to Tom for our financial review.
Tom Jewell
Thank you, Louis and good afternoon. I will provide a brief review of our financial results before we turn the call over for questions.
As we have discussed last quarter, we continue to have a strong balance sheet with 3.6 million in cash. We don’t have any debt and have a clean capital structure. For the first three months of 2017, we generated net cash from operations of $238,583. For the first quarter of 2017, our revenues were 2.8 million down 13% from the first quarter of last year. This was a result of a decrease in the volume of ACH processing, credit card and return transactions process as well as some customer attrition.
The revenue decline was somewhat offset by increase in our PIN-less debit cards which launched last October as Louis mentioned. Gross margin dollars came in at $942,799 or 33.5% of revenues. This compared to 1.1 million and 33% of revenues in the first quarter of last year. We are very pleased to see flat gross margin as a percentage of revenue.
Our first quarter operating loss was $321,938 compared to an operating loss of $46,413 in the first quarter of last year, and this difference reflects higher SG&A as a percentage of revenue.
On an adjusted EBITDA basis, we were positive $114,527 compared to $465,499 in the first quarter of last year. Net loss for the quarter was $286,583 or $0.03 per basic and diluted share, compared to a net loss of 32,002 or 0 per basic and diluted share for the first quarter of last year.
In closing, we remain a healthy company, debt free and generating positive cash flow. We are well positioned for future growth.
Operator, we will open the call for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instruction] Our first question comes from Ron Nisser, a private investor. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst
Sir, I've followed Michael Long in Houston 1998, and in my opinion, your company -- the company looks stronger than it ever has in the past, that being said, I have a couple of quick questions here that I am sure you can answer. First of all, you made mention to another Board of Director being nominated and PYDS and the symbol SSID non-compliance or displayed at online brokerage firms, how long will symbol SSID remain?
Louis Hoch
Well, I am not sure what SSID refers to, but I assume that it means because we were short a Board of Director and temporarily our of NASDAQ compliance.
Unidentified Analyst
That’s correct and I would like to see it disappear soon as possible, that’s the reason I brought it up.
Louis Hoch
We have made NASDAQ aware that we've added an independent Board of Director and I'm sure that they'll act on that very quickly.
Unidentified Analyst
Okay, if they don’t I'll it to my brokerage house attention. The electronic bill payment processing and handling, it needs all the third party help and security it can get, can, will, must Payment Data Systems phone number 877-PDS-PAYS adopt digital voice recognition that helps verify accounts and guards against hack attacks and ransom worms?
Louis Hoch
I'm not sure how voice has do with hacking, but I can assure you all of our systems are very secure, they exceed industry standards, all of our data is encrypted; and I don't know what else we can do besides remain diligent and focused on security and keeping everybody's credit card numbers and bank accounts secure.
Unidentified Analyst
I know you're doing all that you can, and I know that the payment industry is going through a sea change and there's talk -- of course not talk but there's going to be a revisions or should be, sometime in the foreseeable future of rules and regulations that govern paying with plastic, paying with the plastic industry. Also, I'd like to see you work with encrypted email transaction confirmations that once money is transferred for me to be in between and through the automatic clearing house customers, when they get an email it's encrypted so they can be through some of these ransom worms and hack attacks. That being said, I'll hang up now, I've no other questions, keep up the good work, and I believe you're on track and I wish everybody the best.

Louis Hoch
Thank you.
Operator
[Operator Instructions] At this time I'm showing no further questions. I would like to turn the floor back to Louis Hoch for any closing remarks.
Louis Hoch
Thank you everybody for participating in today's call. That'll conclude our call for Q1.
Operator
The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

While some people like to take on this project themselves, many choose to hire professionals to ensure the task is completed correctly.Types of Interior PaintMatte PaintMatte paint doesn't have a shiny quality when it dries, which many homeowners prefer for their interior walls. This is the most popular style of paint for homes. It covers up irregularities in the wall well but is also easily blemished.Matte Enamel PaintMatte enamel paint has all the positive qualities of matte paint but will last longer and isn't scuffed as easily.Gloss PaintGloss paint will dry with a shine to it and is the second-most popular choice for interior wall paint. The shiny quality highlights imperfections in a surface, so people tend to stay away from it when painting wood.Semi-Gloss PaintSemi-gloss is also shiny but less so than gloss paint. It's more commonly used on trim than on walls.Satin PaintSatin falls somewhere between gloss and matte in terms of shininess. It will highlight imperfections well, like gloss, but is easy to clean.Eggshell PaintEggshell is also between gloss and matte on the shininess scale, but it won't highlight imperfections quite as much as satin, semi-gloss, or gloss.Types of Exterior PaintExterior paints have similar choices for finishes as interior paints, but the pros and cons can be different for outdoor use.Gloss PaintThough gloss paint will make imperfections easily seen, it will also hold up to the elements the best. This paint is best suited for areas of a home or building that are frequently used, like door frames.Semi-Gloss PaintSemi-gloss paint is similarly long-lasting but isn't as shiny as gloss.Satin PaintSatin paint is commonly used for siding but will display irregularities underneath if the siding isn't in good shape.Flat PaintFlat paint is the best choice if painting over siding that has many dents, scrapes, or other imperfections.Oil-Based PaintIf you're repainting a home that has been previously painted with oil-based paint, your best bet is to stick with this option. Water-based paint layered over old oil-based paint will peel easily.Water-Based PaintWater-based paint, or latex paint, dries quickly and cleans up easily, making it the preferred paint for a home's exterior. It will also expand when warm and contract when cool, which means it will hold up in all types of weather.Hiring a PainterWhen embarking on a project as big as painting your home, it's important to know ahead of time what kind of quality you can expect from the painters you hire. Don't settle for the first one you find or the cheapest option. Instead, do your homework to be sure that you hire a trustworthy professional who knows how to paint a house well.The first thing you'll do when hiring a painter is request quotes from three or four in your area. If you reach out to too many, you'll wind up wasting time narrowing down your list; too few and you may not end up with the best quality or right price.The typical price range for an interior paint job is between $400 and $4,120, with the average falling around $1,670, depending on the scope of the project and paint requests. It will typically cost around $380 to $790 to paint a typical 10-by​-12 foot room.The cost to paint a home's exterior is a little higher: between $730 and $5,600, with an average of $2,624. The typical home of between 500 and 1,500 square feet will generally cost between $1,000 and $3,000, but this will change depending on the number of stories and home location.If a quote seems high, ask the contractor what is increasing the price point. Perhaps it's something that can be negotiated, or maybe this business is just overpricing their services. On the other hand, be skeptical of any price points that seem unfathomably low. There could be a reason their prices are below the industry norm - perhaps their quality standards are uncommonly low, too.Once you have quotes, conduct an over-the-phone interview with your prospects. Some important questions to ask your painter include:1. Do you have insurance?It's never a good idea to hire a contractor whose business isn't properly insured. Ask both about comprehensive business liability insurance and workers' compensation, and don't be hesitant to ask for proof. If you are unsure of the validity of the insurance, you can also call the insurance company to double-check that it is an active policy.2. Do you have a warranty?Not offering a warranty is a red flag, and you may want to be cautious about hiring a company that doesn't provide one. If they have a warranty, ask how long it lasts, and what it covers. Additionally, you'll want to get the warranty in writing should you need to refer to it later.3. Who, specifically, will be in my house, and can I trust them?You always have a right to know who will be entering your home. If the person you are speaking with says he or she will not be personally supervising the project, ask who will be, what their role is, and how long they've been with the company.Also, don't be afraid to ask if the painters are trustworthy people. Unfortunately, there are plenty of cases where a painter has stolen items from a home or caused damage to the house or injury to the homeowner. Subcontractors may not be as skilled as employees, and the contractor you're hiring may not have much experience working with them, making them more of a risk. Additionally, ask if the painters are employees or subcontractors, and what the screening or hiring process is like. If the company conducts background checks, that's a good sign. 4. What kind of training do your employees receive?If the contractor makes a point to train new hires on safety techniques as well as quality standards on the job, you're probably in good hands.5. What kind of paint will you use?The quality of the paint will affect how good the walls look when the project is completed. If your contractor says they plan on using a paint you don't like, feel free to request an alternative.6. How long have you been in business, and do you have references?A well-established company will have more experience and likely more references for you to reach out to than a new company that's just getting off the ground. Be sure to ask for references so you can speak to former customers about their experience working with the painter. When speaking to these people, ask about:Whether they had issues with the crewIf the painters were messy or neatHow the paint has held up since the project was completed7. How much wall prep is included in the price?For a long-lasting paint job, a clean wall is crucial. Ask how they plan to clean your walls, if at all, before getting started. A high-quality company will thoroughly prepare a wall so that the paint will lay smoothly and last a long time.8. Are you active in the community and are you involved in any trade organizations?Community involvement shows the company:Is established and well-knownCares about its customersIs confident in their workAdditionally, being active in trade organizations indicates it is likely up to date on the latest industry best practices and that the company is dedicated to its trade. Also, a Better Bureau Business membership demonstrates the company is stable, confident, and willing to let potential customers check them out before hiring them.Trade Organizations for PaintersIf the company you hire is involved in a trade organization, it shows they take pride in their work, and are dedicated to providing quality service. Some top trade organizations painters might be a part of include:Painting and Decorating Contractors of AmericaPDCA connects painters and home decorators through local chapters and councils. The organization also provides webinars, educational videos, and podcasts so members can stay up to date on the latest best practices and news.American Coatings AssociationThe ACA doesn't focus on best practices so much as it does on best products. The nonprofit is dedicated to research and development of high-quality paint products as well as sustainability issues.Finishing Contractors AssociationThe FCA has members that are painters as well as professionals who focus on flooring, drywall, and other elements to home construction and renovation.Better Business BureauThe BBB isn't a painter-specific group but rather an organization that is dedicated to ensuring that consumers can access information about anyone they do business with. The BBB also rates companies based on a Standards of Trust scale, which goes from A+ to F. A company doesn't have to be a member to get a grade, and it's a good idea to check to see how your contractor is scored as well as its membership status.
