FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:
 Sally Samuel, Senior Counsel, or Joyce M. Pickholz, Branch Chief, Office of Insurance Products, Division of Investment Management, at (202) 551-6795. 
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
 The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee from the SEC's Public Reference Branch, 100 F Street, NE., Washington, DC 20549 (tel. (202) 551-8090).
Applicants' Representations 
1. The Trust is registered with the Commission as an open-end management investment company and is organized as a Delaware statutory trust. Wilshire, a California corporation, is registered with the Commission as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, and serves as the investment adviser to the Trust. The Trust currently consists of, and offers shares of beneficial interest (“shares”) representing interests in, fourteen separate investment portfolios (each, a “Portfolio,” and collectively, the “Portfolios”). The Trust or any Future Trusts may offer one or more additional investment portfolios in the future (also referred to as “Portfolios”). 
2. Shares of the Portfolios will be offered to separate accounts of affiliated and unaffiliated insurance companies (each, a “Participating Insurance Company”) as investment vehicles to fund Variable Contracts. These separate accounts will be registered as investment companies under the 1940 Act or will be exempt from such registration (individually, a “Separate Account” and collectively, the “Separate Accounts”). Shares of the Portfolios may also be offered to Qualified Plans, Wilshire Entities and General Accounts. 
3. The Participating Insurance Companies at the time of their investment in the Trusts either have established or will establish their own Separate Accounts and have designed or will design their own Variable Contracts. Each Participating Insurance Company has or will have the legal obligation of satisfying all applicable requirements under both State and Federal law. Each Participating Insurance Company, on behalf of its Separate Accounts, has entered or will enter into an agreement with the Trusts concerning such Participating Insurance Company's participation in the Portfolios. The role of the Trusts under this agreement, insofar as the Federal securities laws are applicable, will consist of, among other things, offering shares of the Portfolios to the participating Separate Accounts and complying with any conditions that the Commission may impose upon granting the order requested herein. 
Applicants' Legal Analysis 
1. In connection with the funding of scheduled premium variable life insurance contracts issued through a separate account registered as a unit investment trust (“UIT”) under the 1940 Act, Rule 6e-2(b)(15) provides partial exemptions from Sections 9(a), 13(a), 15(a) and 15(b) of the 1940 Act. Section 9(a)(2) of the 1940 Act makes it unlawful for any company to serve as an investment adviser or principal underwriter of any UIT, if an affiliated person of that company is subject to a disqualification enumerated in Sections 9(a)(1) or (2) of the 1940 Act. Sections 13(a), 15(a) and 15(b) of the 1940 Act have been deemed by the Commission to require “pass-through” voting with respect to an underlying investment company's shares. Rule 6e-2(b)(15) provides that these exemptions apply only where all of the assets of the UIT are shares of management investment companies “which offer their shares exclusively to variable life insurance separate accounts of the life insurer or of any affiliated life insurance company.” Therefore, the relief granted by Rule 6e-2(b)(15) is not available with respect to a scheduled premium life insurance separate account that owns shares of an underlying fund that also offers its shares to a variable annuity separate account or flexible premium variable life insurance separate account of the same company or any other affiliated insurance company. The use of a common management investment company as the underlying investment vehicle for both variable annuity and variable life insurance separate accounts of the same life insurance company or of any affiliated life insurance company is referred to herein as “mixed funding.” 
2. The relief granted by Rule 6e-2(b)(15) also is not available with respect to a scheduled premium variable life insurance separate account that owns shares of an underlying fund that also offers its shares to separate accounts funding Variable Contracts of one or more unaffiliated life insurance companies. The use of a common management investment company as the underlying investment vehicle for variable annuity and/or variable life insurance separate accounts of unaffiliated life insurance companies is referred to herein as “shared funding.” 
3. The relief under Rule 6e-2(b)(15) is available only where shares are offered exclusively to variable life insurance separate accounts of a life insurer or any affiliated life insurance company, additional exemptive relief is necessary if the shares of the Portfolios are also to be sold to Qualified Plans or other eligible holders of shares, as described above. Applicants note that if shares of the Portfolios are sold only to Qualified Plans, exemptive relief under Rule 6e-2 would not be necessary. The relief provided for under this section does not relate to Qualified Plans or to a registered investment company's ability to sell its shares to Qualified Plans. The use of a common management investment company as the underlying investment vehicle for variable annuity and variable life separate accounts of affiliated and unaffiliated insurance companies, and for Qualified Plans, is referred to herein as “extended mixed and shared funding.” 
4. In connection with flexible premium variable life insurance contracts issued through a separate account registered under the 1940 Act as a UIT, Rule 6e-3(T)(b)(15) provides partial exemptions from Sections 9(a), 13(a), 15(a) and 15(b) of the 1940 Act. The exemptions granted by Rule 6e-3(T)(b)(15) are available only where all the assets of the separate account consist of the shares of one or more registered management investment companies that offer to sell their shares “exclusively to separate accounts of the life insurer, or of any affiliated life insurance companies, offering either scheduled contracts or flexible contracts, or both; or which also offer their shares to variable annuity separate accounts of the life insurer or of an affiliated life insurance company or Start Printed Page 8211which offer their shares to any such life insurance company in consideration solely for advances made by the life insurer in connection with the operation of the separate account.” Therefore, Rule 6e-3(T)(b)(15) permits mixed funding but does not permit shared funding. 
5. The relief under Rule 6e-3(T) is available only where shares are offered exclusively to variable life insurance separate accounts of a life insurer or any affiliated life insurance company, and additional exemptive relief is necessary if the shares of the Portfolios are also to be sold to Qualified Plans or other eligible holders of shares as described above. Applicants note that if shares of the Portfolios were sold only to Qualified Plans, exemptive relief under Rule 6e-3(T)(b)(15) would not be necessary. The relief provided for under this section does not relate to Qualified Plans or to a registered investment company's ability to sell its shares to Qualified Plans. 
6. Applicants maintain, as discussed below, that there is no policy reason for the sale of the Portfolios' shares to Qualified Plans, to Wilshire Entities, or General Accounts to result in a prohibition against, or otherwise limit, a Participating Insurance Company from relying on the relief provided by Rules 6e-2(b)(15) and 6e-3(T)(b)(15). However, because the relief under Rules 6e-2(b)(15) and 6e-3(T)(b)(15) is available only when shares are offered exclusively to separate accounts, additional exemptive relief may be necessary if the shares of the Portfolios are also to be sold to Qualified Plans, Wilshire Entities, or General Accounts. Applicants therefore request relief in order to have the Participating Insurance Companies enjoy the benefits of the relief granted in Rules 6e-2(b)(15) and 6e-3(T)(b)(15). Applicants note that if the Portfolios' shares were to be sold only to Qualified Plans, Wilshire Entities, or General Accounts and/or separate accounts funding variable annuity contracts, exemptive relief under Rule 6e-2 and Rule 6e-3(T) would be unnecessary. The relief provided for under Rules 6e-2(b)(15) and 6e-3(T)(b)(15) does not relate to Qualified Plans, Wilshire Entities, or General Accounts, or to a registered investment company's ability to sell its shares to such purchasers. 
7. Section 9(a)(3) of the 1940 Act provides that it is unlawful for any company to serve as investment adviser or principal underwriter of any registered open-end investment company if an affiliated person of that company is subject to a disqualification enumerated in Sections 9(a)(1) or (2). Rules 6e-2(b)(15)(i) and (ii) and Rules 6e-3(T)(b)(15)(i) and (ii) under the 1940 Act provide exemptions from Section 9(a) under certain circumstances, subject to the limitations discussed above on mixed and shared funding. These exemptions limit the application of the eligibility restrictions to affiliated individuals or companies that directly participate in management of the underlying management company. 
8. The partial relief granted in Rules 6e-2(b)(15) and 6e-3(T)(b)(15) under the 1940 Act from the requirements of Section 9 of the 1940 Act recognizes that it is not necessary for the protection of investors or the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act to apply the provisions of Section 9(a) to individuals in a large insurance company complex, most of whom will have no involvement in matters pertaining to investment companies in that organization. The Participating Insurance Companies and Qualified Plans are not expected to play any role in the management of the Trusts. Those individuals who participate in the management of the Trusts will remain the same regardless of which Separate Accounts or Qualified Plans invest in the Trusts. Applying the monitoring requirements of Section 9(a) of the 1940 Act because of investment by separate accounts of other insurers or Qualified Plans would be unjustified and would not serve any regulatory purpose. 
9. Rules 6e-2(b)(15)(iii) and 6e-3(T)(b)(15)(iii) under the 1940 Act provide exemptions from the pass-through voting requirement with respect to several significant matters, assuming the limitations on mixed and shared funding are observed. Rules 6e-2(b)(15)(iii)(A) and 6e-3(T)(b)(15)(iii)(A)(1) provide that the insurance company may disregard the voting instructions of its contract owners with respect to the investments of an underlying fund, or any contract between such a fund and its investment adviser, when required to do so by an insurance regulatory authority (subject to the provisions of paragraphs (b)(5)(i) and (b)(7)(ii)(A) of Rules 6e-2 and 6e-3(T), respectively, under the 1940 Act). Rules 6e-2(b)(15)(iii)(B) and 6e-3(T)(b)(15)(iii)(A)(2) provide that the insurance company may disregard the voting instructions of its contract owners if the contract owners initiate any change in an underlying fund's investment policies, principal underwriter, or any investment adviser (provided that disregarding such voting instructions is reasonable and subject to the other provisions of paragraphs (b)(5)(ii), (b)(7)(ii)(B), and (b)(7)(ii)(C), respectively, of Rules 6e-2 and 6e-3(T) under the 1940 Act). 
10. Rule 6e-2 under the 1940 Act recognizes that a variable life insurance contract, as an insurance contract, has important elements unique to insurance contracts and is subject to extensive State regulation of insurance. In adopting Rule 6e-2(b)(15)(iii), the Commission expressly recognized that State insurance regulators have authority, pursuant to State insurance laws or regulations, to disapprove or require changes in investment policies, investment advisers, or principal underwriters. The Commission also expressly recognized that State insurance regulators have authority to require an insurer to draw from its general account to cover costs imposed upon the insurer by a change approved by contract owners over the insurer's objection. The Commission, therefore, deemed such exemptions necessary to assure the life insurer's solvency and performance of its contractual obligations by enabling an insurance regulatory authority or the life insurer to act when certain proposals reasonably could be expected to increase the risks undertaken by the life insurer. In this respect, flexible premium variable life insurance contracts are identical to scheduled premium variable life insurance contracts. Therefore, the corresponding provisions of Rule 6e-3(T) under the 1940 Act undoubtedly were adopted in recognition of the same factors. 
11. The sale of Portfolio shares to Qualified Plans, Wilshire Entities, and General Accounts will not have any impact on the relief requested herein. With respect to the Qualified Plans, which are not registered as investment companies under the 1940 Act, there is no requirement to pass through voting rights to Qualified Plan participants. Indeed, to the contrary, applicable law expressly reserves voting rights associated with Qualified Plan assets to certain specified persons. Under Section 403(a) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”), shares of a portfolio of a fund sold to a Qualified Plan must be held by the trustees of the Qualified Plan. Section 403(a) also provides that the trustee(s) must have exclusive authority and discretion to manage and control the Qualified Plan with two exceptions: (i) When the Qualified Plan expressly provides that the trustee(s) are subject to the direction of a named fiduciary who is not a trustee, in which case the trustees are subject to proper directions made in accordance with the terms of the Qualified Plan and not contrary to Start Printed Page 8212ERISA, and (ii) when the authority to manage, acquire, or dispose of assets of the Qualified Plan is delegated to one or more investment managers pursuant to Section 402(c)(3) of ERISA. Unless one of the above two exceptions stated in Section 403(a) applies, Qualified Plan trustees have the exclusive authority and responsibility for voting proxies. 
12. Where a named fiduciary to a Qualified Plan appoints an investment manager, the investment manager has the responsibility to vote the shares held unless the right to vote such shares is reserved to the trustees or the named fiduciary. The Qualified Plans may have their trustee(s) or other fiduciaries exercise voting rights attributable to investment securities held by the Qualified Plans in their discretion. Some of the Qualified Plans, however, may provide for the trustee(s), an investment adviser (or advisers), or another named fiduciary to exercise voting rights in accordance with instructions from participants. Similarly, Wilshire Entities and General Accounts are not subject to any pass-through voting requirements. Accordingly, unlike the case with insurance company separate accounts, the issue of resolution of material irreconcilable conflicts with respect to voting is not present with Qualified Plans, Wilshire Entities, or General Accounts. 
13. Where a Qualified Plan does not provide participants with the right to give voting instructions, the trustee or named fiduciary has responsibility to vote the shares held by the Qualified Plan. In this circumstance, the trustee has a fiduciary duty to vote the shares in the best interest of the Qualified Plan participants. Accordingly, even if Wilshire or an affiliate of Wilshire were to serve in the capacity of trustee or named fiduciary with voting responsibilities, Wilshire or its affiliate would have a fiduciary duty to vote those shares in the best interest of the Qualified Plan participants. 
14. In addition, even if a Qualified Plan were to hold a controlling interest in a Portfolio, Applicants do not believe that such control would disadvantage other investors in such Portfolio to any greater extent than is the case when any institutional shareholder holds a majority of the voting securities of any open-end management investment company. In this regard, Applicants submit that investment in a Portfolio by a Qualified Plan will not create any of the voting complications occasioned by mixed funding or shared funding. Unlike mixed funding or shared funding, Qualified Plan investor voting rights cannot be frustrated by veto rights of insurers or State regulators. 
15. Where a Qualified Plan provides participants with the right to give voting instructions, Applicants see no reason to believe that participants in Qualified Plans generally or those in a particular Qualified Plan, either as a single group or in combination with participants in other Qualified Plans, would vote in a manner that would disadvantage Variable Contract holders. The purchase of shares of Portfolios by Qualified Plans that provide voting rights does not present any complications not otherwise occasioned by mixed or shared funding. 
16. Shared funding by unaffiliated insurance companies does not present any issues that do not already exist where a single insurance company is licensed to do business in several or all States. A particular State insurance regulatory body could require action that is inconsistent with the requirements of other States in which the insurance company offers its policies. The fact that different insurers may be domiciled in different States does not create a significantly different or enlarged problem. 
17. Shared funding by unaffiliated insurers, in this respect, is no different than the use of the same investment company as the funding vehicle for affiliated insurers, which Rules 6e-2(b)(15) and 6e-3(T)(b)(15) under the 1940 Act permit. Affiliated insurers may be domiciled in different States and be subject to differing State law requirements. Affiliation does not reduce the potential, if any exists, for differences in State regulatory requirements. In any event, the conditions set forth below are designed to safeguard against, and provide procedures for resolving, any adverse effects that differences among State regulatory requirements may produce. If a particular State insurance regulator's decision conflicts with the majority of other State regulators, then the affected insurer will be required to withdraw its Separate Account's investment in the affected Trust. This requirement will be provided for in agreements that will be entered into by Participating Insurance Companies with respect to their participation in the relevant Portfolio. 
18. Rules 6e-2(b)(15) and 6e-3(T)(b)(15) under the 1940 Act give the insurance company the right to disregard the voting instructions of the contract owners in certain circumstances. Affiliation does not eliminate the potential, if any exists, for divergent judgments as to the advisability or legality of a change in investment policies, principal underwriter, or investment adviser initiated by contract owners. The potential for disagreement is limited by the requirements in Rules 6e-2 and 6e-3(T) under the 1940 Act that the insurance company's disregard of voting instructions be reasonable and based on specific good-faith determinations. 
19. A Participating Insurance Company's disregard of voting instructions, nevertheless, could conflict with the majority of contract owners' voting instructions. The Participating Insurance Company's action possibly could be different than the determination of all or some of the other insurers (including affiliated insurers) that the voting instructions of contract owners should prevail, and either could preclude a majority vote approving the change or could represent a minority view. If the Participating Insurance Company's judgment represents a minority position or would preclude a majority vote, then the Participating Insurance Company's may be required, at the affected Trust's election, to withdraw its Separate Account's investment in such Portfolio. No charge or penalty will be imposed as a result of such withdrawal. This requirement will be provided for in the agreements entered into with respect to participation by the Participating Insurance Companies in each Portfolio.
20. Each Portfolio will be managed to attempt to achieve the investment objective or objectives of such Portfolio, and not to favor or disfavor any particular Participating Insurance Company or type of insurance product. There is no reason to believe that different features of various types of contracts, including the “minimum death benefit” guarantee under certain variable life insurance contracts, will lead to different investment policies for different types of Variable Contracts. To the extent that the degree of risk may differ as between variable annuity contracts and variable life insurance policies, the different insurance charges imposed, in effect, adjust any such differences and equalize the insurers' exposure in either case. 
21. Applicants do not believe that the sale of the shares of the Portfolios to Qualified Plans will increase the potential for material irreconcilable conflicts of interest between or among different types of investors. In particular, Applicants see very little potential for such conflicts beyond those which would otherwise exist between variable annuity and variable life insurance contract owners. Moreover, in considering the appropriateness of the requested relief, Applicants have analyzed the following issues to assure themselves that there Start Printed Page 8213were either no conflicts of interest or that there existed the ability by the affected parties to resolve the issues without harm to the contract owners in the Separate Accounts or to the participants under the Qualified Plans. 
22. Applicants considered whether there are any issues raised under the Internal Revnue Code of l986, as amended, (the “Code”), the regulations issued by the Treasury Department (the “Regulations”), or the revenue rulings issued by the Internal Revenue Service (the “Revenue Rulings”), if Qualified Plans, variable annuity separate accounts, and variable life insurance separate accounts all invest in the same underlying fund. Section 817(h) of the Code imposes certain diversification standards on the underlying assets of Variable Contracts held in an underlying mutual fund. The Code provides that a Variable Contract shall not be treated as an annuity contract or life insurance, as applicable, for any period (and any subsequent period) for which the investments are not, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Treasury Department, adequately diversified. 
23. Regulations issued under Section 817(h) provide that, in order to meet the statutory diversification requirements, all of the beneficial interests in the investment company must be held by the segregated asset accounts of one or more insurance companies. However, the Regulations contain certain exceptions to this requirement, one of which allows shares in an underlying mutual fund to be held by the trustees of a qualified pension or retirement plan without adversely affecting the ability of such shares also to be held by separate accounts of insurance companies in connection with their Variable Contracts. Thus, the Regulations specifically permit “qualified pension or retirement plans” and separate accounts to invest in the same underlying fund. For this reason, Applicants have concluded that neither the Code, nor Regulations, nor Revenue Rulings thereunder, present any inherent conflicts of interest if the Qualified Plans and Separate Accounts all invest in the same Portfolio. 
24. Applicants note that while there are differences in the manner in which distributions from Variable Contracts and Qualified Plans are taxed, these differences will have no impact on the Trusts. When distributions are to be made, and a Separate Account or Qualified Plan is unable to net purchase payments to make the distributions, the Separate Account and Qualified Plan will redeem shares of the relevant Portfolio at their respective net asset value in conformity with Rule 22c-1 under the 1940 Act (without the imposition of any sales charge) to provide proceeds to meet distribution needs. A Participating Insurance Company then will make distributions in accordance with the terms of its Variable Contract, and a Qualified Plan then will make distributions in accordance with the terms of the Qualified Plan. 
25. In connection with any meeting of shareholders, the soliciting Trust will inform each shareholder, including each Separate Account, Qualified Plan, Wilshire Entities, and General Account, of information necessary for the meeting, including their respective share of ownership in the relevant Portfolio. Each Participating Insurance Company then will solicit voting instructions in accordance with Rules 6e-2 and 6e-3(T), as applicable, and its agreement with the Trusts concerning participation in the relevant Portfolio. Shares of a Portfolio that are held by Wilshire Entities and any General Account will be voted in the same proportion as all Variable Contract owners having voting rights with respect to that Portfolio. However, Wilshire Entities and any General Account will vote their shares in such other manner as the Commission may require. Shares held by Qualified Plans will be voted in accordance with applicable law. The voting rights provided to Qualified Plans with respect to shares of a Portfolio would be no different from the voting rights that are provided to Qualified Plans with respect to shares of funds sold to the general public. Furthermore, if a material irreconcilable conflict arises because of a Qualified Plan's decision to disregard Qualified Plan participant voting instructions, if applicable, and that decision represents a minority position or would preclude a majority vote, the Qualified Plan may be required, at the election of the affected Trust, to withdraw its investment in such Portfolio, and no charge or penalty will be imposed as a result of such withdrawal. 
26. Applicants reviewed whether a “senior security,” as such term is defined under Section 18(g) of the 1940 Act, is created with respect to any Variable Contract owner as opposed to a participant under a Qualified Plan, Wilshire Entities, or a General Account. Applicants concluded that the ability of the Trusts to sell shares of their Portfolios directly to Qualified Plans, Wilshire Entities, or a General Account does not create a senior security. “Senior security” is defined under Section 18(g) of the 1940 Act to include “any stock of a class having priority over any other class as to distribution of assets or payment of dividends.” As noted above, regardless of the rights and benefits of participants under Qualified Plans, or contract owners under Variable Contracts, the Qualified Plans, Wilshire Entities, General Accounts and the Separate Accounts only have rights with respect to their respective shares of the Portfolio. They only can redeem such shares at net asset value. No shareholder of a Portfolio has any preference over any other shareholder with respect to distribution of assets or payment of dividends. 
Applicants' Conditions 
Applicants and the Wilshire Entities agree that the order granting the requested relief shall be subject to the following conditions which shall apply to the Trust as well as any Future Trust that relies on the order: 
1. A majority of the Board of Trustees (the “Board”) of the Trust will consist of persons who are not “interested persons” of the Trust, as defined by Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act, and the rules thereunder, and as modified by any applicable orders of the Commission, except that if this condition is not met by reason of the death, disqualification, or bona fide resignation of any trustee or trustees, then the operation of this condition will be suspended: (a) For a period of 90 days if the vacancy or vacancies may be filled by the Board; (b) for a period of 150 days if a vote of shareholders is required to fill the vacancy or vacancies; or (c) for such longer period as the Commission may prescribe by order upon application or by future rule. 
2. The Board will monitor the Trust for the existence of any material irreconcilable conflict between the interests of the contract owners of all Separate Accounts and participants of all Qualified Plans investing in such Trust, and determine what action, if any, should be taken in response to such conflicts. A material irreconcilable conflict may arise for a variety of reasons, including: (a) An action by any State insurance regulatory authority; (b) a change in applicable Federal or State insurance tax, or securities laws or regulations, or a public ruling, private letter ruling, no-action or interpretative letter, or any similar action by insurance, tax, or securities regulatory authorities; (c) an administrative or judicial decision in any relevant proceeding; (d) the manner in which the investments of such Trust are being managed; (e) a difference in voting instructions given by variable annuity contract owners, variable life insurance Start Printed Page 8214contract owners, and trustees of the Qualified Plans; (f) a decision by a Participating Insurance Company to disregard the voting instructions of contract owners; or (g) if applicable, a decision by a Qualified Plan to disregard the voting instructions of Qualified Plan participants. 
3. Participating Insurance Companies (on their own behalf, as well as by virtue of any investment of general account assets in a Portfolio), Wilshire Entities, and any Qualified Plan that executes a participation agreement upon becoming an owner of 10 percent or more of the assets of any Portfolio (collectively, “Participants”) will report any potential or existing conflicts to the Board. Participants will be responsible for assisting the Board in carrying out the Board's responsibilities under these conditions by providing the Board with all information reasonably necessary for the Board to consider any issues raised. This responsibility includes, but is not limited to, an obligation by each Participating Insurance Company to inform the Board whenever contract owner voting instructions are disregarded, and, if pass-through voting is applicable, an obligation by each Qualified Plan to inform the Board whenever it has determined to disregard Qualified Plan participant voting instructions. The responsibility to report such information and conflicts, and to assist the Board, will be a contractual obligation of all Participating Insurance Companies under their participation agreements with the Trust, and these responsibilities will be carried out with a view only to the interests of the contract owners. The responsibility to report such information and conflicts, and to assist the Board, also will be contractual obligations of all Qualified Plans with participation agreements, and such agreements will provide that these responsibilities will be carried out with a view only to the interests of Qualified Plan participants. 
4. If it is determined by a majority of the Board, or a majority of the disinterested trustees of the Board, that a material irreconcilable conflict exists, then the relevant Participant will, at its expense and to the extent reasonably practicable (as determined by a majority of the disinterested trustees), take whatever steps are necessary to remedy or eliminate the material irreconcilable conflict, up to and including: (a) Withdrawing the assets allocable to some or all of the Separate Accounts from the relevant Portfolio and reinvesting such assets in a different investment vehicle including another Portfolio, or in the case of Participating Insurance Company Participants submitting the question as to whether such segregation should be implemented to a vote of all affected contract owners and, as appropriate, segregating the assets of any appropriate group (i.e., annuity contract owners or life insurance contract owners of one or more Participating Insurance Companies) that votes in favor of such segregation, or offering to the affected contract owners the option of making such a change; (b) establishing a new registered management investment company or managed separate account; and (c) withdrawing the assets allocable to some or all of the Qualified Plans from the affected Portfolio or Participating Insurance Company and reinvesting those assets in a different investment medium. If a material irreconcilable conflict arises because of a decision by a Participating Insurance Company to disregard contract owner voting instructions, and that decision represents a minority position or would preclude a majority vote, then the insurer may be required, at the election of the Trust, to withdraw such insurer's Separate Account's investment in the Trust, and no charge or penalty will be imposed as a result of such withdrawal. If a material irreconcilable conflict arises because of a Qualified Plan's decision to disregard Qualified Plan participant voting instructions, if applicable, and that decision represents a minority position or would preclude a majority vote, the Qualified Plan may be required, at the election of the Trust, to withdraw its investment in the Trust, and no charge or penalty will be imposed as a result of such withdrawal. The responsibility to take remedial action in the event of a Board determination of a material irreconcilable conflict and to bear the cost of such remedial action will be a contractual obligation of all Participants under their agreements governing participation in the Trust, and these responsibilities will be carried out with a view only to the interests of contract owners and Qualified Plan participants. 
For purposes of this Condition 4, a majority of the disinterested members of the Board will determine whether or not any proposed action adequately remedies any material irreconcilable conflict, but, in no event will the Trust or Wilshire, as relevant, be required to establish a new funding vehicle for any Variable Contract. No Participating Insurance Company will be required by this Condition 4 to establish a new funding vehicle for any Variable Contract if any offer to do so has been declined by vote of a majority of the contract owners materially and adversely affected by the material irreconcilable conflict. Further, no Qualified Plan will be required by this Condition 4 to establish a new funding vehicle for the Qualified Plan if: (a) A majority of the Qualified Plan participants materially and adversely affected by the irreconcilable material conflict vote to decline such offer, or (b) pursuant to documents governing the Qualified Plan, the Qualified Plan makes such decision without a Qualified Plan participant vote. 
5. The Board's determination of the existence of a material irreconcilable conflict and its implications will be made known in writing promptly to all Participants. 
6. As to Variable Contracts issued by Separate Accounts registered under the 1940 Act, Participating Insurance Companies will provide pass-through voting privileges to all Variable Contract owners as required by the 1940 Act as interpreted by the Commission. However, as to Variable Contracts issued by unregistered Separate Accounts, pass-through voting privileges will be extended to contract owners to the extent granted by the issuing insurance company. Accordingly, such Participants, where applicable, will vote shares of the applicable Portfolio held in their Separate Accounts in a manner consistent with voting instructions timely received from Variable Contract owners. Participating Insurance Companies will be responsible for assuring that each Separate Account investing in a Portfolio calculates voting privileges in a manner consistent with other Participants. 
The obligation to calculate voting privileges as provided in this Application will be a contractual obligation of all Participating Insurance Companies under their agreement with the Trusts governing participation in a Portfolio. Each Participating Insurance Company will vote shares for which it has not received timely voting instructions, as well as shares it owns through its General Account or otherwise attributed to it, in the same proportion as it votes those shares for which it has received voting instructions. Each Qualified Plan will vote as required by applicable law and governing Qualified Plan documents. 
7. As long as the 1940 Act requires pass-through voting privileges to be provided to variable contract owners, Wilshire Entities and any General Account will vote their respective shares of any Portfolio in the same proportion of all variable contract owners having voting rights with respect to that Portfolio; provided; Start Printed Page 8215however, that any Wilshire Entity or any insurance company General Account shall vote its shares in such other manner as may be required by the Commission or its staff. 
8. The Trust will comply with all provisions of the 1940 Act requiring voting by shareholders, which for these purposes, shall be the persons having a voting interest in the shares of the respective Portfolio, and, in particular, the Trust will either provide for annual meetings (except to the extent that the Commission may interpret Section 16 of the 1940 Act not to require such meetings) or comply with Section 16(c) of the 1940 Act (although the Trust is not one of the funds of the type described in the Section 16(c) of the 1940 Act), as well as with Section 16(a) of the 1940 Act and, if and when applicable, Section 16(b) of the 1940 Act. Further, the Trust will act in accordance with the Commission's interpretation of the requirements of Section 16(a) with respect to periodic elections of trustees and with whatever rules the Commission may promulgate with respect thereto. 
9. The Trust will notify all Participants that Separate Account prospectus disclosure or Qualified Plan prospectuses or other Qualified Plan disclosure documents regarding potential risks of mixed and shared funding may be appropriate. The Trust will disclose in its prospectus that (a) Shares of the Trust may be offered to Separate Accounts of both variable annuity and variable life insurance contracts and, if applicable, to Qualified Plans; (b) due to differences in tax treatment and other considerations, the interests of various contract owners participating in the Trust and the interests of Qualified Plans investing in the Trust, if applicable, may conflict; and (c) the Trust's Board will monitor events in order to identify the existence of any material irreconcilable conflicts and to determine what action, if any, should be taken in response to any such conflict. 
10. If and to the extent that Rule 6e-2 and Rule 6e-3(T) under the 1940 Act are amended, or proposed Rule 6e-3 under the 1940 Act is adopted, to provide exemptive relief from any provision of the 1940 Act, or the rules promulgated thereunder, with respect to mixed or shared funding, on terms and conditions materially different from any exemptions granted in the order requested in this Application, then the Trust and/or Participating Insurance Companies, as appropriate, shall take such steps as may be necessary to comply with Rules 6e-2 and 6e-3(T), or Rule 6e-3, as such rules are applicable. 
11. The Participants, at least annually, will submit to the Board such reports, materials, or data as a Board reasonably may request so that the trustees of the Board may fully carry out the obligations imposed upon the Board by the conditions contained in this application. Such reports, materials, and data will be submitted more frequently if deemed appropriate by the Board. The obligations of the Participants to provide these reports, materials, and data to the Board, when it so reasonably requests, will be a contractual obligation of all Participants under their agreements governing participation in the Portfolios. 
12. All reports of potential or existing conflicts received by the Board, and all Board action with regard to determining the existence of a conflict, notifying Participants of a conflict, and determining whether any proposed action adequately remedies a conflict, will be properly recorded in the minutes of the Board or other appropriate records, and such minutes or other records shall be made available to the Commission upon request. 
13. The Trust will not accept a purchase order from a Qualified Plan if such purchase would make the Qualified Plan shareholder an owner of 10 percent or more of the assets of such Portfolio unless such Qualified Plan executes an agreement with the Trust governing participation in such Portfolio that includes the conditions set forth herein to the extent applicable. A Qualified Plan or Qualified Plan participant will execute an application containing an acknowledgment of this condition at the time of its initial purchase of shares of any Portfolio. 
14. A Portfolio will make its shares available under a Variable Contract and/or Qualified Plan at or about the same time as it accepts any seed capital from any Wilshire Entity or any General Account of a Participating Insurance Company. 
Conclusions 
Applicants submit, based on the grounds summarized above, that the exemptions requested are necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act.

SUMMARY 
Wilshire Associates Incorporated (“Wilshire”) serves as the investment adviser to the Wilshire Variable Insurance Trust (the “Trust”). The Trust is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”) and is made up of a series of portfolios. The Equity Fund, Balanced Fund, Income Fund, Short-Term Investment Fund, Small Cap Growth Fund, International Equity Fund and Socially Responsible Fund (each a “Fund” and collectively, the “Funds”) are offered in this prospectus. The Trust’s 2010 Aggressive Fund, 2010 Moderate Fund, 2010 Conservative Fund, 2015 Moderate Fund, 2025 Moderate Fund, 2035 Moderate Fund and 2045 Moderate Fund (the “Target Maturity Funds”) are offered through a separate prospectus. In its oversight of the investment program of the Funds, Wilshire may manage the Funds directly or select investment managers as subadvisers to manage each Fund’s assets. If Wilshire selects subadvisers, Wilshire will determine the allocation of each Fund’s assets among those selected subadvisers. Wilshire selects subadvisers based upon a due diligence process that focuses on, but is not limited to, a subadviser’s philosophy and process, people and organization, resources and performance. Wilshire has discretion to select, retain and discharge the subadvisers with approval from the Trust’s Board of Trustees. Wilshire may take these actions with respect to subadvisers at any time without shareholder approval. 
Equity Fund 
Investment Objective: The Equity Fund seeks long-term capital growth. As a secondary objective, the Equity Fund seeks conservation of principal and production of income. 
Main Investment Strategies: The Equity Fund invests, under normal circumstances, at least 80% of its net assets (plus the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes) in equity securities. The Equity Fund ordinarily invests in common stocks of domestic companies. These companies vary in size and operating history, they may or may not be listed on a stock exchange and they may be in any industry. On average, the Equity Fund will have a value-bias, generally exhibiting an average price to earnings ratio lower than, and an average dividend yield higher than, that of the market as measured by the S&P 500 Index. The Equity Fund may also invest in preferred stocks. Additionally, up to 10% of the Equity Fund’s assets may be invested in U.S. dollar-denominated securities of foreign issuers, including common stock, preferred stock, convertible securities and American Depository Receipts. Included within the definition of “domestic companies” are companies that are not incorporated in the U.S. but have one or more of the following attributes: principal place of business in the U.S.; substantial portion of income derived from activities in the U.S.; equity securities traded on a major U.S. stock exchange or included in a recognized index of U.S. stocks; or financial statements that comply with U.S. accounting standards. Thus, securities of such issuers are not subject to the 10% limitation on securities of foreign issuers. 
Currently, Wilshire has retained AllianceBernstein, L.P. (“AllianceBernstein”), New York Life Investment Management (“NYLIM”) and Pzena Investment Management, LLC (“Pzena”) to manage the Equity Fund. The basic investment philosophy of each subadviser is described below. 
Two teams are primarily responsible for overseeing AllianceBernstein’s portion of the Equity Fund; the U.S. Large Cap Growth Portfolio Oversight Group and the U.S. Value Investment Policy Group. AllianceBernstein’s U.S. Large Cap Growth is a concentrated portfolio of 50 to 70 stocks that seeks to generate its premium through superior research-driven security selection. AllianceBernstein’s portfolio

management team strives to invest in companies whose growth potential appears likely to outpace market expectations, usually due to a combination of unique product or service offering, high barriers to entry and management’s ability to execute corporate strategy. AllianceBernstein’s U.S. Diversified Value seeks to capture misvaluations in the large-capitalization U.S. equity market through an investment process combining rigorous fundamental research with quantitative analysis and disciplined risk control. AllianceBernstein’s U.S. Diversified Value invests in approximately 150 companies, overweighting those that are trading at significant discounts to their long-term earnings power, as determined by AllianceBernstein’s analysts. U.S. Diversified Value portfolios can be managed to closely track either the S&P 500 or Russell 1000 Value Index over full market cycles. 
NYLIM seeks to identify companies that are considered to have a high probability of outperforming the S&P 500 Index. The underlying process for selecting securities is based on a quantitative process that ranks stocks based on such fundamental factors as valuation and earnings, as well as on technical behavioral factors. On occasion, trading strategies that seek to realize returns over shorter periods may be employed. The core strategy utilized by the portfolio manager includes both growth and value styles. A bottom-up approach, which assesses the individual strengths of stocks, is used to enhance returns. NYLIM’s portion of the Equity Fund’s portfolio is constructed with an optimizer seeking to maximize return given a targeted tracking error and specific constraints. 
Upon completion of the analysis and review, the portfolio management team enters trades in the portfolio management system, creating an electronic trading blotter. The blotter is immediately available, electronically, to the trader who is then responsible for placing the orders with various brokers. The objective is to create a portfolio of securities with the most attractive return forecasts while minimizing risk relative to the benchmark. The current risk controls applied to the portfolio are a maximum target tracking error of 2% annualized, sector constraints of +/-2.5%, and security-specific bounds of +/-1.25% relative to the benchmark. 
NYLIM typically engages in price-sensitive strategic trading, taking care to build or liquidate positions based on the specific trading characteristics of each security. The portfolio management team works closely with trading to monitor the status of outstanding trades. 
Pzena manages its allocated portion of the Equity Fund’s portfolio using a classic value investment philosophy. Pzena defines value stocks as those stocks whose prices are low relative to their long-term normal earning power. Pzena’s security selection process involves an initial ranking of the 500 largest U.S. listed companies, from the least expensive to the most expensive, based upon a ratio of each company’s price-to-normalized earnings. Research priority is given to the least expensive stocks, those exhibiting a group or sector theme, and those offering portfolio diversification benefits. Companies undergo rigorous qualitative research by Pzena’s analysts to determine whether the causes of the under-valuation are likely to be temporary or permanent. Third party analysis and data sources are used for about 10% to 20% of this research. Onsite due diligence is also an important step in Pzena’s security selection determination. This step occurs at the end of the research process, which enables Pzena to engage in a dialogue with company management from the perspective of well-informed, critical thinkers. As a result of Pzena’s security selection process, the portion of the Equity Fund’s portfolio allocated to Pzena will typically be highly concentrated with a strong value emphasis. 
Under normal circumstances, the Equity Fund intends to be fully invested. Pending investment, to meet anticipated redemption requests, or as a temporary defensive measure if a subadviser determines that

market conditions warrant, the Equity Fund may also invest, without limitation, in high quality U.S. dollar-denominated money market instruments. The reason for implementing a temporary defensive position is to avoid market losses. However, if market conditions improve, this strategy may result in reducing the potential gains from market upswings, thus reducing the Equity Fund’s ability to achieve its investment objective. 
Main Risks of Investing: Because the Equity Fund invests most of its assets in common stocks, one of the primary risks is that the value of the stocks it holds might decrease in response to the activities of the company that issued the stock, or general economic and market conditions. More information about the risks of investing in the Equity Fund is located in the sections entitled “More About Risks” on page 23 and “Types of Investments and Associated Risks” on page 26. There can be no assurance that the Equity Fund will meet its investment objectives. The Equity Fund’s investment returns will vary, and you could lose money by investing in the Equity Fund. 
Balanced Fund 
Investment Objective: The Balanced Fund seeks to realize a high long-term total rate of return consistent with prudent investment risks. Total rate of return consists of current income, which includes dividends, interest, discount accruals and capital appreciation. 
Main Investment Strategies: The Balanced Fund operates under a fund of funds structure. The Balanced Fund invests substantially all of its assets in the Equity Fund and Income Fund. In addition, the Balanced Fund may also invest in certain individual securities, including money market instruments and U.S. government securities. 
The “Main Investment Strategies” sections for the Equity Fund and Income Fund include descriptions of the types of stocks and bonds in which those Funds are permitted to invest. 
Wilshire allocates the Balanced Fund’s assets between shares of the Equity Fund and Income Fund. This allocation is intended to reduce the volatility of investment returns and provide the potential for higher long-term total returns than investing solely in the Equity Fund or Income Fund, respectively. As a matter of investment policy, 50% to 75% of the Balanced Fund’s total assets will be invested in the Equity Fund and 25% to 50% of the value of its assets will be invested in the Income Fund. Under normal circumstances, the Balance Fund’s target asset mix is 60% to the Equity Fund and 40% to the Income Fund. The Balanced Fund’s mix of assets is regularly adjusted between the Equity Fund and the Income Fund to maintain policy targets. Major changes in the investment mix may occur several times within a year or over several years, depending upon market and economic conditions. In general, however, Wilshire does not anticipate making frequent changes in asset allocation and will not attempt to time the market. 
Under normal circumstances, the Balanced Fund intends to be fully invested. Pending investment, to meet anticipated redemption requests, or as a temporary defensive measure, if Wilshire determines that market conditions warrant, the Balanced Fund may also invest, without limitation, in high quality U.S. dollar-denominated money market instruments. The reason for implementing a temporary defensive position is to avoid market losses. However, if market conditions improve, this strategy may result in reducing the potential gains from market upswings, thus reducing the Balanced Fund’s ability to achieve its investment objective.

An investor in the Balanced Fund should understand that alternatively he or she could allocate investments directly to the Equity Fund and Income Fund. By investing indirectly in both the Equity Fund and the Income Fund through the Balanced Fund, an investor bears not only his or her proportionate share of certain expenses of the Balanced Fund (such as operating costs), but also, indirectly, similar expenses of the Equity Fund and the Income Fund. However, shareholders of the Balanced Fund will not be subject to duplicative advisory or distribution (12b-1) fees as a result of the fund of funds arrangement, as discussed under “Management” on page 30. 
Main Risks of Investing: By investing in the Balanced Fund, an investor assumes the same types of risks, either directly or indirectly, as investing in both the Equity Fund and Income Fund. Such risks are described under the “Main Risks of Investing” section for both the Equity Fund and the Income Fund. More information about the risks of investing in the Balanced Fund is located in the sections entitled “More About Risks” on page 23 and “Types of Investments and Associated Risks” on page 26. There can be no assurance that the Balanced Fund will meet its investment objective. The Balanced Fund’s investment returns will vary, and you could lose money by investing in the Balanced Fund. 
Income Fund 
Investment Objective: The Income Fund seeks to achieve a long-term total rate of return in excess of the U.S. bond market over a full market cycle. 
Main Investment Strategies: The Income Fund invests, under normal circumstances, at least 80% of its net assets (plus the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes) in fixed income securities. These securities are primarily U.S. investment grade fixed income securities, including government and corporate securities, agency mortgage pass-through securities and asset-backed securities. 
The Income Fund invests at least 75% of its total assets in: 
 



 
•
 

investment grade, publicly offered debt securities, including mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities (within the four highest ratings as determined by Moody’s Investors Service (“Moody’s”), Standard & Poor’s (“S&P”) or an equivalent rating at the time of purchase) 
 



 
•
 

securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government or its agencies 
 



 
•
 

high quality commercial paper (within the two highest grades as determined by both Moody’s and S&P or an equivalent rating), repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements, time deposits with maturities less than seven days and cash or cash equivalents 
 



 
•
 

high grade U.S. dollar-denominated debt obligations of foreign governments, foreign corporations, foreign branches of U.S. banks and foreign banks (limited to the four highest ratings as determined by Moody’s, S&P or an equivalent rating at the time of purchase and to 15% of the Income Fund’s total assets) 
 



 
•
 

highest quality non-U.S. dollar-denominated debt obligations of foreign issuers (limited to the four highest ratings as determined by Moody’s, S&P or an equivalent rating at the time of purchase) which are fully hedged back into U.S. dollars and do not exceed 15% of the Income Fund’s total assets 
Generally, the average duration of the U.S. portion of the Income Fund will range within 25% of the Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond Index’s (the “Lehman Index”) duration. There are no maximum 
 
6 


 
maturity limits on individual securities. For defensive purposes, the duration and maturity of the Income Fund may be shortened. The Income Fund will maintain a high grade average quality for the portfolio (third highest rating as determined by Moody’s, S&P or an equivalent rating). 
Up to 25% of the Income Fund’s total assets may be invested in securities not described above, including preferred stock, convertible securities, securities carrying warrants to purchase equity securities, U.S. dollar-denominated debt obligations of U.S. and non-U.S. issuers rated below A (by Moody’s, S&P or an equivalent rating) and non-U.S. debt obligations rated below the highest quality (as determined by Moody’s, S&P or an equivalent rating) and derivatives. 
Currently, Wilshire has retained Western Asset Management Company (“Western Asset”), and its affiliate, Western Asset Management Company Limited (“WAML”) to manage the Income Fund. The basic investment philosophy of each subadviser is described below. 
Western Asset’s core plus strategy seeks to provide investment results that exceed the performance of the Lehman Index. The Lehman Index is a widely recognized measure of the aggregate U.S. bond market. This strategy seeks to maximize total return by investing primarily in U.S. dollar-denominated fixed income securities and other debt instruments of domestic and foreign entities, including corporate bonds, securities issued or guaranteed as to principal and interest by the U.S. government and its agencies and instrumentalities, mortgage-related securities and money market instruments. 
Western Asset will determine the relative portion of the Income Fund’s assets allocated to foreign securities. These foreign assets will be invested at the discretion of WAML. WAML will select the foreign country and currency composition based on its evaluation of relative interest rates, inflation rates, exchange rates, monetary and fiscal policies, trade and current account balances and any other specific factors WAML believes to be relevant. 
Under normal circumstances, the Income Fund intends to be fully invested. Pending investment, to meet anticipated redemption requests, or as a temporary defensive measure, if a subadviser determines that market conditions warrant, the Income Fund may also invest, without limitation, in high quality, U.S. dollar-denominated money market instruments. The reason for implementing a temporary defensive position is to avoid market losses. However, if market conditions improve, this strategy may result in reducing the potential gains from a rising market, thus reducing the Income Fund’s ability to achieve its investment objective. 
Main Risks of Investing: The primary risk of investing in the Income Fund is interest rate risk. Changes in interest rates may cause changes in the Income Fund’s yield, net asset value and total return. These changes can have a more dramatic impact on investments with longer maturities. The Income Fund is also subject to credit risk. The Income Fund’s net asset value and total return may be adversely affected by the inability of the issuers of the Income Fund’s securities to make payment at maturity. More information about the risks of investing in the Income Fund is located in the sections entitled “More About Risks” on page 23 and “Types of Investments and Associated Risks” on page 26. There can be no assurance that the Income Fund will meet its investment objective. The Income Fund’s investment returns will vary, and you could lose money by investing in the Income Fund. 
Short-Term Investment Fund 
Investment Objective: The Short-Term Investment Fund seeks to realize maximum current income to the extent consistent with liquidity. Preservation of principal is a secondary objective. The Short-Term 
 
7 


 
Investment Fund is not a money market fund and does not maintain a stable net asset value per share. 
Main Investment Strategies: The Short-Term Investment Fund primarily invests in the following types of short-term debt instruments with maturities generally not exceeding one year: 
 



 
•
 

U.S. Treasury Bills and other obligations of, or guaranteed by, the U.S. government or its agencies 
 



 
•
 

commercial paper (within the two highest ratings as determined by Moody’s or S&P or an equivalent rating) 
 



 
•
 

U.S. dollar-denominated debt obligations of foreign governments, foreign corporations, foreign branches of U.S. banks and foreign banks (limited to the three highest ratings as determined by Moody’s or S&P or an equivalent rating and to 10% of the Short-Term Investment Fund’s total assets) 
 



 
•
 

publicly traded bonds, debentures and notes (with a rating within the four highest ratings as determined by Moody’s or S&P or an equivalent rating) 
 



 
•
 

repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements 
 



 
•
 

cash or cash equivalents 
Currently, Wilshire has retained Western Asset to manage the Short-Term Investment Fund. The basic investment philosophy of Western Asset is described below. 
In seeking to achieve the Short-Term Investment Fund’s investment objectives, Western Asset uses a multi-stage process. In the first stage, Western Asset analyzes general economic and market factors, such as interest rate forecasts and anticipated interest rate spreads among various sectors of money market instruments, and sets broad strategies for the Short-Term Investment Fund. In the second stage, Western Asset evaluates individual securities. Western Asset uses proprietary quantitative and qualitative techniques to create and maintain a list of issuers whose securities are approved for purchase. In the third stage, Western Asset determines the structure and composition of the portfolio. In doing so, Western Asset seeks to minimize exposure to credit risk and market risk. The Short-Term Investment Fund attempts to maximize return to take advantage of changing money market conditions and trends. The Short-Term Investment Fund also trades to take advantage of disparities in yield relationships between money market instruments. 
Under normal circumstances, the Short-Term Investment Fund intends to be fully invested. Pending investment, to meet anticipated redemption requests, or as a temporary defensive measure, if Western Asset determines that market conditions warrant, the Short-Term Investment Fund may also invest, without limitation, in high quality, U.S. dollar-denominated money market instruments. The reason for implementing a temporary defensive position is to avoid market losses. However, if market conditions improve, this strategy may result in reducing the potential gains from a rising market, thus reducing the Short-Term Investment Fund’s ability to achieve its investment objectives. 
Main Risks of Investing: The primary risk of investing in the Short-Term Investment Fund is interest rate risk. Changes in interest rates may cause changes in the Short-Term Investment Fund’s yield, net asset value and total return. The Short-Term Investment Fund is also subject to credit risk. More information about the risks of investing in the Short-Term Investment Fund is located in the sections

entitled “More About Risks” on page 23 and “Types of Investments and Associated Risks” on page 26. There can be no assurance that the Short-Term Investment Fund will meet its investment objectives. The Short-Term Investment Fund’s investment returns will vary and you could lose money by investing in the Short-Term Investment Fund. 
Small Cap Growth Fund 
Investment Objective: The Small Cap Growth Fund seeks long-term capital appreciation. 
Main Investment Strategies: The Small Cap Growth Fund invests, under normal circumstances, at least 80% of its net assets (plus the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes) in securities of small cap companies. The Small Cap Growth Fund ordinarily invests in small cap equity securities (less than $2.5 billion at the time of investment) which the subadvisers believe have earnings growth potential. A security would be considered by the subadvisers to have favorable and above-average earnings growth prospects if its growth rate estimates exceed the average for the Small Cap Growth Fund’s benchmark, the Russell 2000 Growth Index. The Russell 2000 Growth Index is composed of those securities in the Russell 2000 Index with a greater-than-average growth orientation. Securities in this index generally have higher price-to-book and price-to-earnings ratios than those in the Russell 2000 Value Index. 
Currently, Wilshire has retained BNY Asset Management (“BNY Mellon”) and Copper Rock Capital Partners, LLC (“Copper Rock”) to manage the Small Cap Growth Fund. The basic investment philosophy of each subadviser is described below. 
BNY Mellon invests in common stocks, warrants or rights that are chosen by giving primary consideration to creating and maintaining a portfolio which is intended to replicate as closely as practicable the performance of the Russell 2000 Growth Index. 
Copper Rock believes that a fundamental growth approach with a strong sell discipline provides the best opportunity to outperform in all market conditions. Copper Rock’s investment team seeks to identify emerging leaders across industries, investing in potential future market leaders at an early point in their growth cycle and before widespread investor interest drives valuations upward. The Copper Rock investment approach utilizes bottom-up fundamental research to identify fundamentally sound companies with strong management, superior earnings growth prospects and attractive relative valuations. 
Under normal circumstances, the Small Cap Growth Fund intends to be fully invested. Pending investment, to meet anticipated redemption requests, or as a temporary defensive measure, if a subadviser determines that market conditions warrant, the Small Cap Growth Fund may also invest, without limitation, in high quality, U.S. dollar-denominated money market instruments. The reason for implementing a temporary defensive position is to avoid market losses. However, if market conditions improve, this strategy may result in reducing the potential gains from a rising market, thus reducing the Small Cap Growth Fund’s ability to achieve its investment objective. 
Main Risks of Investing: Since the Small Cap Growth Fund invests most of its assets in common stocks, the primary risk is that the value of the stocks it holds might decrease in response to the activities of the company that issued the stock or general economic and market conditions. Investments in securities of companies with small market capitalizations generally involve greater risk than investments in large, more established companies. This is because small companies may be in an earlier stage of 
 
9 


 
development, may be dependent on a small number of products or services, may lack substantial capital reserves and/or do not have proven track records. Small companies may be adversely affected more than large companies by poor economic or market conditions. In addition, small companies may be traded in low volumes, which can increase volatility and liquidity risks. More information about the risks of investing in the Small Cap Growth Fund is located in the sections entitled “More About Risks” on page 23 and “Types of Investments and Associated Risks” on page 26. There can be no assurance that the Small Cap Growth Fund will meet its investment objective. The Small Cap Growth Fund’s investment returns will vary, and you could lose money by investing in the Small Cap Growth Fund. 
International Equity Fund 
Investment Objective: The International Equity Fund seeks long-term growth of capital primarily through diversified holdings of marketable foreign equity investments. 
Main Investment Strategies: The International Equity Fund invests, under normal circumstances, at least 80% of its net assets (plus the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes) in equity securities. The International Equity Fund invests in companies, wherever organized, which do business primarily outside the United States. The International Equity Fund intends to diversify investments among several countries and to have represented in its holdings business activities in not less than three different countries. The International Equity Fund invests primarily in equity securities of established companies that the subadvisers believe have favorable characteristics and that are listed on foreign exchanges. The International Equity Fund may also invest in fixed-income securities of foreign governments and companies. 
Currently, Wilshire has retained PanAgora Asset Management, Inc. (“PanAgora”) and Thomas White International, Ltd. (“Thomas White”) to manage the International Equity Fund. The basic investment philosophy of each subadviser is described below. 
PanAgora’s passive international equity strategy seeks to reproduce the total return of the MSCI EAFE Index. PanAgora uses a global risk model and optimization software for the management of passive MSCI EAFE portfolios. This risk model seeks to explain the correlation of security returns based upon factors which impact most securities. The risk model includes factors such as sector exposure, currency exposure, dividend yield, capitalization (size), sensitivity to interest rate changes, the impact of oil price changes and other factors. The optimization process seeks to match the sensitivity of PanAgora’s portion of the International Equity Fund’s portfolio to these factors to the sensitivity of the benchmark (MSCI EAFE) to these factors. The optimization process also allows PanAgora to manage its portion of the International Equity Fund portfolio’s expected tracking error while taking into consideration the size of the portfolio, expected cash flows, trading costs and custody charges. PanAgora’s portfolio managers monitor their portion of the International Equity Fund’s portfolio daily and rebalance it as often as necessary to ensure the desired level of tracking error. 
Based on its research, Thomas White seeks to buy equity securities of companies at a market price that is under valued. This strategy is intended to produce a portfolio with lower price-to-earnings and price-to-book ratios than other mutual funds. Such portfolio characteristics are typical of what are commonly referred to as “value” funds. 
 
10 


 
Companies considered attractive typically will have one or more of the following characteristics: 
 



 
•
 

The market price of their equity securities is undervalued relative to earnings power, break-up value and inherent profitability. 
 



 
•
 

The companies are, or may soon be, exhibiting improved financial characteristics represented by rising cash flow, return on equity, operating margins and book value. 
 



 
•
 

The price of their equities may have recently underperformed the general market due to a low level of investor expectations regarding the earnings outlook. 
 



 
•
 

The companies should have the strength to operate successfully through adverse business conditions. 
This approach seeks out equities where current investor enthusiasm is low. Positions are normally sold when the investment community’s perceptions improve and the securities approach a market price that Thomas White believes to be fair value. 
Thomas White adheres to a long-term investment approach, and it does not attempt to predict short-term changes in the general market. Under normal market conditions, Thomas White intends to invest in companies for holding periods greater than one year so the frequency of its purchases and sales generally should be below many comparable mutual funds. Lower portfolio turnover helps to reduce trading costs and shareholders’ taxes. 
A high exposure to the equity market is normally maintained unless Thomas White is unable to find undervalued securities that meet its criteria. Using this investment management style, Thomas White seeks strong long-term performance, below average return volatility and portfolio resilience in difficult market environments. 
The International Equity Fund has no present intention of altering its general policy of being primarily invested in foreign securities under normal conditions. However, in the event of exceptional conditions abroad, the International Equity Fund may temporarily invest all or a portion of its assets in Canadian or U.S. government obligations or currencies, or securities of companies incorporated in and having their principal activities in Canada or the United States. The reason for implementing a temporary defensive position is to avoid market losses. However, if market conditions improve, this strategy may result in reducing the potential gains from a rising market, thus reducing the International Equity Fund’s ability to achieve its investment objective. 
For hedging purposes, the International Equity Fund may purchase forward foreign currency exchange contracts, foreign currency options and futures contracts and foreign currencies in the form of bank deposits. The International Equity Fund may also purchase other foreign money market instruments, including, but not limited to, bankers’ acceptances, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, short-term government and corporate obligations and repurchase agreements. 
Main Risks of Investing: Because the International Equity Fund invests most of its assets in common stocks, the primary risk is that the value of the stocks it holds might decrease in response to the activities of those companies or market and economic conditions. Foreign investments often involve additional risks including political instability, differences in financial reporting standards and less stringent regulation of securities markets. These risks are magnified in less-established, emerging markets. Because the securities held by the International Equity Fund usually will be denominated in currencies other than 
 
11 


 
the U.S. dollar, changes in foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect the value of the International Equity Fund’s investments. In addition, the International Equity Fund may invest in the securities of small companies, which may be more volatile and less liquid than securities of large companies. More information about the risks of investing in the International Equity Fund is located in the sections entitled “More About Risks” on page 23 and “Types of Investments and Associated Risks” on page 26. There can be no assurance that the International Equity Fund will meet its investment objective. The International Equity Fund’s investment returns will vary, and you could lose money by investing in the International Equity Fund. 
Socially Responsible Fund 
Investment Objective: The Socially Responsible Fund seeks long-term growth of capital, current income and growth of income. 
Main Investment Strategies: The Socially Responsible Fund pursues its objective through a diversified portfolio composed primarily of marketable equity securities (including common stocks, preferred stocks and debt securities convertible into common stocks of seasoned U.S.-traded companies). The Socially Responsible Fund seeks to achieve its objective by investing in issuers that meet certain socially responsible criteria. Investments in equity securities are limited to issuers which, in the subadviser’s judgment, meet the following criteria: 
 



 
•
 

do not produce tobacco products; 
 



 
•
 

do not produce alcoholic beverages; 
 



 
•
 

do not own and/or operate casinos or manufacture gaming devices; 
 



 
•
 

do not produce pornographic materials; 
 



 
•
 

do not produce nuclear weapons or guidance and/or delivery systems specifically for nuclear weapons; 
 



 
•
 

by popular standards, maintain non-discriminatory employment practices throughout a company’s facilities; and 
 



 
•
 

by popular standards, maintain environmental policies, practices and procedures that are currently acceptable, or that are exhibiting improvement. 
Currently, Wilshire has retained AllianceBernstein to manage the Socially Responsible Fund. The basic investment philosophy of AllianceBernstein is described below. 
AllianceBernstein uses traditional methods of stock selection — research and analysis — to identify undervalued stocks that meet the socially responsible screening criteria. AllianceBernstein will review the Socially Responsible Fund’s investment universe quarterly for purposes of adding or eliminating stocks that meet or fail to meet the socially responsible screening criteria. All stocks purchased by the Socially Responsible Fund will meet such criteria at the time of purchase. Stocks held by the Socially Responsible Fund may be divested prior to reaching fair value, as determined by AllianceBernstein, if during the quarterly review of the Socially Responsible Fund’s investment universe, AllianceBernstein determines that a stock no longer meets the socially responsible screening criteria. The portfolio will consist 
 
12 


 
primarily of stocks with market capitalizations greater than $1 billion. In addition, AllianceBernstein employs quantitative valuation tools to identify attractive stocks and the most opportune time to purchase them. 
In addition, from time to time, for temporary defensive purposes, when AllianceBernstein determines such a position is advisable in light of economic or market conditions, the Socially Responsible Fund may invest a portion of its assets in cash and cash equivalents. Pending investment, to meet anticipated redemption requests, or as a temporary defensive measure if AllianceBernstein determines that market conditions warrant, the Socially Responsible Fund may also invest, without limitation, in high quality, U.S. dollar-denominated money market instruments. The reason for implementing a temporary defensive position is to avoid market losses. However, if market conditions improve, this strategy may result in reducing the potential gains from a rising market, thus reducing the Socially Responsible Fund’s ability to achieve its investment objective. 
Main Risks of Investing: The Socially Responsible Fund only invests in companies that meet its criteria for socially responsible investing. Because of this restriction, the investments that AllianceBernstein may choose from may be more limited than those of a Fund that is not restricted to investing in companies that meet social criteria. As a result, AllianceBernstein may pass up opportunities to buy certain securities when it is otherwise advantageous to so do or may sell certain securities when it is otherwise disadvantageous to do so. In addition, investing in socially responsible companies may result in the Socially Responsible Fund investing more or less in a specific sector of the economy relative to its benchmark. Since the Socially Responsible Fund invests most of its assets in common stocks, one of the primary risks is that the value of the stocks it holds might decrease in response to the activities of the company that issued the stock or general economic and market conditions. More information about the risks of investing in the Socially Responsible Fund is located in the sections entitled “More About Risks” on page 23 and “Types of Investments and Associated Risks” on page 26. There can be no assurance that the Socially Responsible Fund will meet its investment objective. The Socially Responsible Fund’s investment returns will vary, and you could lose money by investing in the Socially Responsible Fund.

FUND PERFORMANCE HISTORY 
The information below provides an illustration of how each Fund’s performance has varied over time. The bar charts and tables provide some indication of the risks of investing in a Fund by showing the changes in a Fund’s investment performance from year to year during the periods indicated and by showing how the average annual total returns for the periods indicated compare with a broad-based securities market index(es). The total return figures do not reflect expenses that apply to the separate account or related annuity contracts. The inclusion of these charges would reduce the total return figures for all periods shown. A Fund’s past investment performance does not necessarily indicate how it will perform in the future.

Fees And Expenses. This section describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy and hold shares of a Fund. Fund shares are no-load investments, so you will not pay any sales loads, redemption fees or exchange fees. However, you will indirectly pay annual Fund operating expenses, which vary from year to year. In addition, the separate account and annuity contracts involve other charges and expenses not described below, which may include sales charges, redemption fees or exchange fees. The Funds’ expenses would be higher if these other charges and expenses associated with the separate account or annuity contracts were included in the expense tables below.

The Balanced Fund’s shareholders indirectly bear, pro rata, the expenses of both the Equity Fund and the Income Fund. These indirect expenses are based on actual expense ratios for both the Equity Fund and the Income Fund. Expense ratios of both the Equity Fund and the Income Fund are located in the tables above. The Equity Fund and the Income Funds’ fees and expenses are not reflected in the Balanced Fund’s expense ratio as shown in the Financial Highlights table of this prospectus.

For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2007, Wilshire voluntarily waived investment management fees and reimbursed the Short-Term Investment Fund for all fees, except custodian and Trustees’ expenses. Wilshire voluntarily waived 0.23% and 0.20% of its management fees for the Small Cap Growth Fund and International Equity Fund, respectively. Such fee waivers were made in connection with corresponding fee reductions negotiated with each Fund’s subadvisers. After these waivers, actual net annual operating expenses for the Short-Term Investment Fund, Small Cap Growth Fund and International Equity Fund for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2007 were 0.10%, 1.53% and 2.07%, respectively. Wilshire’s voluntary fee waiver is expected to continue until December 31, 2008 and may be terminated at any time.

Example 
This example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in a Fund with the cost of investing in other mutual funds. The example assumes that you invest $10,000 in a Fund, redeem all of your shares at the end of the periods shown, earn a 5% return each year and incur the same operating expenses as shown above. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:

MORE ABOUT RISKS 
The Funds have principal investment strategies that come with inherent risks. The following is a list of the principal risks associated with those strategies. Because the Balanced Fund invests in the shares of both the Equity Fund and the Income Fund, the Balanced Fund will be subject to the risks of both the Equity Fund and the Income Fund. The following table summarizes the types of risks described below that each Fund may experience:

Currency Risk. Non-U.S. dollar-denominated securities are subject to fluctuations in the exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies which may negatively affect an investment. Adverse changes in exchange rates may erode or reverse any gains produced by foreign currency denominated investments, and may widen any losses. 
Derivatives Risk. When a Fund uses derivatives (securities whose value is based upon the value of another security or an index) to hedge positions in the portfolio, any loss generated by the derivative security should be substantially offset by gains on the hedged investment and vice versa. While hedging can reduce or eliminate losses, it can also reduce or eliminate gains. To the extent that a derivative is not used as a hedge (i.e., for speculation), a Fund is directly exposed to the potential gains and losses of that derivative. Gains and losses from non-hedging derivative positions may be substantially greater than the derivative’s original cost. 
 
23 


 
Credit Risk. For debt securities, credit risk is the possibility that an issuer or counterparty to a contract will fail to make timely payments of interest or principal to a Fund. The credit risk of a Fund depends on the credit quality of its underlying securities. In general, for debt securities, the lower the credit quality of a Fund’s securities, the higher a Fund’s risk, all other factors such as maturity being equal. 
Interest Rate Risk. For debt securities, interest rate risk is the possibility that the price will fall because of changing interest rates. In general, debt securities’ prices rise or fall inversely to changes in interest rates. If interest rates rise, bond prices generally fall; if interest rates fall, bond prices generally rise. In addition, for a given change in interest rates, longer-maturity bonds fluctuate more in price (gaining or losing more in value) than shorter-maturity bonds. 
Investment Style Risk. During certain market conditions, a Fund with a more specific investment style (such as value or growth) may perform less well than a Fund that allows greater flexibility in the investment of assets. 
Liquidity Risk. A Fund may invest in certain securities that may be difficult or impossible to sell at a certain time and at a price that a Fund finds to be favorable. A Fund may have to accept an unfavorable price, sell other securities instead or forego an investment opportunity, any of which could have a negative effect on portfolio management or investment performance. 
Market Risk. For equity securities, stock market movements will affect a Fund’s share price on a daily basis. Declines in value are possible because of declines in the stock market in general or because of a decline in the specific securities held by a Fund. There is also the possibility that the price of the security will fall because the market perceives that there is or will be a deterioration in the fundamental value of the issuer or poor earnings performance by the issuer. Market risk may affect a single company, industry, sector or the market as a whole. For debt securities, the market value of a security may move up and down, sometimes rapidly and unpredictably. Market risk may affect a single issuer, an industry, a sector or the bond market as a whole. 
Portfolio Strategy Risk. The investment performance of a Fund is in part dependent upon either Wilshire’s or a subadviser’s skill in making appropriate investments. To the extent that a Fund’s investments differ from the portfolio represented by the benchmark, there exists the potential for volatility of the return of a Fund relative to its index. As the industry and sector composition of the market or index changes over time, the implementation of a Fund’s strategy can lead to substantial differences in the sector or industry allocation of a Fund relative to the market or index. 
Prepayment Risk. Mortgage-backed securities are subject to the risk of unanticipated prepayments of principal with respect to mortgages in the security’s underlying pool of assets. While principal prepayments are passed through to the holders of the securities, prepayments also reduce the future payments on such securities and may reduce their value. Mortgage-backed securities are subject to the risk that an unexpected rise in interest rates will extend the life of a mortgage-backed security beyond the expected prepayment time, typically reducing the security’s value. Mortgage-backed securities are subject to the risk that an unexpected decline in interest rates will contract the life of a mortgage-backed security, thereby affecting its prepayment schedule, which may affect the value of the security. 
Reinvestment Risk. During periods of falling interest rates, a debt security with a high stated interest rate may be prepaid (or “called”) prior to its expected maturity date. If, during periods of falling interest rates, a debt security with a high stated interest rate is called, the unanticipated proceeds would likely be 
 
24 


 
invested at lower interest rates, and a Fund’s income or yield may decline. Call provisions, which may lead to reinvestment risk, are most common for intermediate- and long-term municipal, corporate and mortgage-backed securities. To the extent securities subject to call were acquired at a premium, the potential for appreciation in the event of a decline in interest rates may be limited and may even result in losses. 
Turnover Risk. A Fund that trades aggressively will experience high portfolio turnover and relatively high brokerage and other transaction costs. Such transaction costs may lower a Fund’s effective investment return. 
Valuation Risk. A Fund may invest in securities that are difficult to value and may inadvertently value certain of its securities at a higher price than the market will bear.

TYPES OF INVESTMENTS AND ASSOCIATED RISKS 
Shareholders of each of the Equity Fund, Income Fund, Small Cap Growth Fund and International Equity Fund will be provided with at least 60 days prior notice of any change in the 80% investment policy of each of these Funds. 
The following provides additional information on various types of instruments in which the Funds may invest and their associated risks. Because the Balanced Fund invests in shares of both the Equity Fund and the Income Fund, the Balanced Fund indirectly invests in the same investments as listed for both the Equity Fund and the Income Fund. For a more detailed description of the various types of instruments in which the Funds may invest and their associated risks, please see the section entitled “Description of Securities and Risks” in the Statement of Additional Information (“SAI”). 
ADRS, EDRS and GDRS. The Small Cap Growth Fund, International Equity Fund and Socially Responsible Fund may each invest in both sponsored and unsponsored American Depository Receipts (“ADRs”), European Depository Receipts (“EDRs”), Global Depository Receipts (“GDRs”) and other similar global instruments. The Equity Fund may invest in ADRs. ADRs typically are issued by an American bank or trust company and evidence ownership of underlying securities issued by a foreign corporation. EDRs, which are sometimes referred to as Continental Depository Receipts, are receipts issued in Europe, typically by foreign banks and trust companies, that evidence ownership of either foreign or domestic underlying securities. GDRs are depository receipts structured like global debt issues to facilitate trading on an international basis. Unsponsored ADR, EDR and GDR programs are organized independently and without the cooperation of the issuer of the underlying securities. As a result, available information concerning the issuer may not be as current as for sponsored ADRs, EDRs and GDRs, and the prices of unsponsored ADRs, EDRs and GDRs may be more volatile than if such instruments were sponsored by the issuer. Investments in ADRs, EDRs and GDRs present additional investment considerations, as described below under “Foreign Securities.” 
Foreign Securities. The Equity Fund, International Equity Fund, Small Cap Growth Fund, Socially Responsible Fund, Income Fund and Short-Term Investment Fund may invest in foreign securities. Investing outside the United States involves economic and political considerations not typically applicable to U.S. markets. These considerations, which may favorably or unfavorably affect a Fund’s investment performance, include, but are not limited to, changes in exchange rates and exchange rate controls (which may include suspension of the ability to transfer currency from a given country), costs incurred in conversions between currencies, nonnegotiable brokerage commissions, different accounting standards, lower trading volume and greater market volatility, the difficulty of enforcing obligations in other countries, less securities regulation, different tax provisions (including withholding on interest and dividends paid to a Fund), war, expropriation, political and social instability and diplomatic developments. Further, the settlement period of securities transactions in foreign markets may be longer than in domestic markets. These considerations generally are heightened in developing countries. For example, the possibility of political upheaval and the dependence on foreign economic assistance may be greater in these countries than in developed countries. Wilshire and the subadvisers seek to mitigate the risks associated with these considerations through diversification and active professional management. For a more detailed description of foreign securities, see the SAI of the Trust. 
Forward Foreign and Currency Exchange Contracts. The International Equity Fund may invest in foreign currencies. The Income Fund may enter into forward foreign currency exchange contracts 
 
26 


 
(“forward contracts”) up to 15% of the value of its total net assets, for hedging purposes only. A forward contract involves an obligation to purchase or sell a specific currency for an agreed price at a future date, which may be any fixed number of days from the date of the contract. The agreed price may be fixed or within a specified range of prices. The Income Fund also may enter into foreign currency futures contracts and foreign currency options up to 15% of the value of total net assets, for hedging purposes only. Foreign currency futures contracts are standardized contracts traded on commodities exchanges that involve an obligation to purchase or sell a predetermined amount of currency at a predetermined date at a specified price. For a more detailed description of foreign currencies, see the SAI of the Trust. 
High-Yield (High-Risk) Securities. The Income Fund may invest in fixed income or convertible securities rated lower than “Baa” by Moody’s or “BBB” by S&P, or unrated securities of comparable quality, which are commonly referred to as “junk bonds” or “high-yield/high-risk” securities. These securities are considered speculative and generally involve a higher risk of loss of principal and income than higher-rated, investment grade securities. The value of these securities generally fluctuates more than those of higher-rated securities. The value of high-yield, high-risk securities may also be influenced by the bond market’s perception of an issuer’s credit quality or its outlook for economic growth. As with any other asset in a Fund’s portfolio, any reduction in the value of such securities would be reflected in the net asset value of a Fund. In addition, a Fund that invests in lower-quality securities may incur additional expenses to the extent it is required to seek recovery upon a default in the payment of principal and interest on its holdings. As a result of the associated risks, successful investments in high-yield (high-risk) securities will be more dependent on Wilshire’s and the subadvisers’ credit analysis than generally would be the case with investments in investment grade securities. Lower-quality securities tend to be less liquid than higher-quality debt securities because the market for them is not as broad or active. The lack of a liquid secondary market may have an adverse effect on market price and a Fund’s ability to sell particular securities. For a description of ratings, and a more detailed description of high-yield (high-risk) securities, see the SAI of the Trust. 
Illiquid Securities. The Income Fund may invest up to 10% of its net assets in securities that are illiquid. Variable and floating rate instruments that cannot be disposed of within seven days and repurchase agreements and time deposits that do not provide for payment within seven days after notice, without taking a reduced price, are subject to these limits. Each of the Small Cap Growth Fund, International Equity Fund and Socially Responsible Fund may invest up to 15% of its net assets in illiquid securities, including repurchase agreements maturing in more than seven days. Each of the Balanced Fund and Income Fund may invest up to 10% of its net assets in illiquid securities and may not invest in “restricted securities” except for Rule 144A securities. The Small Cap Growth Fund, International Equity Fund, Socially Responsible Fund and Income Fund may purchase securities which are not registered under the Securities Act of 1933 (the “1933 Act”) but which can be sold to “qualified institutional buyers” in accordance with Rule 144A under the 1933 Act if they are determined to be liquid. Any such security will be considered liquid so long as it is determined by a subadviser that an adequate trading market exists for that security. This investment practice could have the effect of increasing the level of illiquidity in a Fund during any period that qualified institutional buyers become uninterested in purchasing these restricted securities. As a matter of operating policy, each Fund will invest only in Rule 144A securities that are deemed to be liquid, and will limit its investment in Rule 144A securities to 20% of its net assets. The Equity Fund and Short-Term Investment Fund may not invest in illiquid or restricted securities or securities not fully marketable. 
 
27 


 
Mortgage- and Asset-Backed Securities. The Income Fund may invest in mortgage- and asset-backed securities which represent shares in a pool of mortgages or other debt. These securities are generally pass-through securities, which means that principal and interest payments on the underlying securities (less servicing fees) are passed through to shareholders on a pro rata basis. These securities involve prepayment risk, which is the risk that the underlying mortgages or other debt may be refinanced or paid off before they mature, particularly during periods of declining interest rates. In that case, a subadviser may need to reinvest the proceeds from the securities at a lower interest rate. This could lower a Fund’s return and result in losses to a Fund if some securities were acquired at a premium. Potential market gains on a security subject to prepayment risk may be more limited than potential market gains on a comparable security that is not subject to prepayment risk. The Income Fund may also invest in collateralized mortgage obligations (“CMOs”). In a CMO, a series of bonds or certificates is issued in multiple classes, which have varying levels of risks. For a more detailed description of mortgage- and asset-backed securities, see the SAI of the Trust. 
Adjustable Rate Mortgage Securities. The Income Fund may invest in adjustable rate mortgage securities. Adjustable rate mortgage securities are pass-through mortgage securities collateralized by mortgages with adjustable rather than fixed rates. For a more detailed description of adjustable rate mortgage securities, see the SAI of the Trust. 
Options and Futures Contracts. The Income Fund, Small Cap Growth Fund, International Equity Fund and Socially Responsible Fund may invest in options and futures. The Equity Fund may invest in futures. Options are the right, but not the obligation to buy or sell a specified amount of securities or other assets on or before a fixed date. Futures contracts are contracts that obligate the buyer to receive and the seller to deliver an instrument or money at a specified price on a specified date. The Small Cap Growth Fund, International Equity Fund and Socially Responsible Fund may write covered call options, buy put options, buy call options and write secured put options for the purpose of hedging or earning additional income, which may be deemed speculative or, with respect to the International Equity Fund, cross-hedging. The Small Cap Growth Fund, International Equity Fund and Socially Responsible Fund may also invest in financial futures contracts and options on futures contracts to commit funds awaiting investment in securities or maintain cash liquidity or for other risk management purposes. For a more detailed description of options and futures contracts and their associated risks, see the SAI of the Trust. 
Securities Lending. The Equity Fund, Income Fund, Small Cap Growth Fund, International Equity Fund and Socially Responsible Fund each may lend its investment securities in an amount of up to 33 1/3% of its total assets to approved institutional borrowers who need to borrow securities in order to complete certain transactions. Any loss in the market price of securities loaned by a Fund that occurs during the term of the loan would be borne by a Fund and would affect a Fund’s investment performance. Also, there may be delays in recovery of securities loaned or even a loss of rights in the collateral should the borrower of the securities fail financially while the loan is outstanding. However, loans will be made only to borrowers selected by a Fund’s delegate after a review of relevant facts and circumstances, including the creditworthiness of the borrower. The Trust’s Board of Trustees will make arrangements to vote or consent with respect to a material event affecting portfolio securities on loan. The Balanced Fund and Short-Term Investment Fund may not make loans to other persons, except by the purchase of obligations in which a Fund is authorized to invest. 
When-Issued Purchases and Forward Commitments. The Equity Fund, Small Cap Growth Fund, International Equity Fund, Socially Responsible Fund and Income Fund each may purchase securities on 
 
28 


 
a “when-issued” basis and may purchase or sell securities on a “forward commitment” basis. These transactions involve a commitment by a Fund to purchase or sell particular securities with payment and delivery taking place at a future date (perhaps one or two months later), and permit a Fund to lock in as price or yield on a security it owns or intends to purchase, regardless of future changes in interest rates. When-issued and forward commitment transactions involve the risk, however, that the price or yield obtained in a transaction may be less favorable than the price or yield available in the market when the securities delivery takes place. The Funds do not intend to engage in when-issued purchases and forward commitments for speculative purposes but only in furtherance of their investment objectives. For a more detailed description of when-issued purchases and forward commitments, see the SAI of the Trust.

MANAGEMENT 
The overall responsibility for the supervision of the affairs of the Funds rests with the Board of Trustees. As described below, the Board of Trustees has approved contracts with others to provide certain services to the Funds. 
Investment Adviser. Since March 1, 1999, the Trust has employed Wilshire to manage the investment and reinvestment of the assets of the Equity Fund, Balanced Fund, Income Fund, Short-Term Investment Fund, Small Cap Growth Fund, International Equity Fund and Socially Responsible Fund and to continuously review, supervise and administer the Funds’ investment programs under an Investment Advisory Agreement dated March 1, 1999, as amended from time to time. Wilshire’s principal office is located at 1299 Ocean Avenue, Santa Monica, California 90401-1085. 
Wilshire’s duties under the Investment Advisory Agreement include providing a continuous investment program for each Fund or recommending to the Board of Trustees one or more unaffiliated subadvisers to provide a continuous investment program for each Fund or a portion of such Fund’s assets designated from time to time by Wilshire, including investment, research and management with respect to all securities and investments and cash equivalents for a Fund or a designated portion of such Fund’s assets. Wilshire also reviews, monitors and reports to the Board of Trustees regarding the investment performance and investment procedures of each subadviser and assists and consults with each subadviser in connection with a Fund’s continuous investment program. In addition, Wilshire maintains books and records with respect to its services under the Investment Advisory Agreement and furnishes the Board of Trustees with such periodic and special reports as the Board of Trustees may request. 
Wilshire selects subadvisers based on a continuing quantitative and qualitative evaluation of their skills and proven abilities in managing assets pursuant to a particular investment style. Short-term performance is not by itself a significant factor in selecting or terminating subadvisers, and therefore Wilshire does not anticipate frequent changes in the subadvisers. Criteria for employment of subadvisers includes, but is not limited to, a subadviser’s philosophy and process, people and organization, resources and performance. Subadvisers may have different investment styles and security selection disciplines. 
Wilshire monitors the investment performance of each subadviser of the Funds and, to the extent it deems appropriate to achieve the Funds’ investment objectives, reallocates assets among individual subadvisers or recommends the employment or termination of particular subadvisers. 
Pursuant to an exemptive order from the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), Wilshire, without shareholder approval, as normally would be required under the 1940 Act, may replace, add or remove subadvisers and enter into sub-advisory agreements with these subadvisers upon approval of the Board of Trustees. Within 90 days of the hiring of any new subadviser or the implementation of any proposed material change to a sub-advisory agreement, shareholders will be furnished with an information statement that contains all information that would be included in a proxy statement regarding the new subadviser or sub-advisory agreement, except as modified by exemptive relief. Moreover, Wilshire will not enter into a sub-advisory agreement with any subadviser that is an “affiliated person,” as defined in the 1940 Act, of the Trust or Wilshire, other than by reason of serving as a subadviser to one or more of the Funds, without shareholder approval. In addition, whenever a subadviser is hired or fired, Wilshire will provide the Board of Trustees with information showing the expected impact on Wilshire’s profitability and will report such impact quarterly. 
 
30 


 
Each subadviser’s fees will be paid by Wilshire out of the advisory fees that Wilshire receives from each of the Funds. For a Fund with multiple subadvisers, the fees paid to a subadviser will depend upon the fee rate negotiated with Wilshire and upon the percentage of the Fund’s assets allocated to that subadviser by Wilshire, which may vary from time to time. Thus, the basis for fees paid to any such subadviser will not be constant, and the relative amounts of fees paid to the various subadvisers of a Fund will fluctuate. These internal fluctuations, however, will not affect the total advisory fees paid by a Fund, which will remain fixed based on the terms described above. Wilshire may, however, determine in its discretion to waive a portion of its fee if internal fluctuations in the fee to be paid to the subadvisers results in excess profit to Wilshire. Because Wilshire will pay each subadviser’s fees out of its own fees from the Funds, there will not be any “duplication” of advisory fees paid by the Funds. 
Shareholders should recognize, however, that in engaging new subadvisers and entering into sub-advisory agreements, Wilshire will negotiate fees with those subadvisers and, because these fees are paid by Wilshire and not directly by each Fund, any fee reduction negotiated by Wilshire may inure to Wilshire’s benefit and any increase may inure to its detriment. However, Wilshire has agreed to waive its fee to the extent any fee reduction is negotiated with a subadviser for the Small Cap Growth Fund and International Equity Fund. In addition, Wilshire has agreed to waive its fee and reimburse the Short-Term Investment Fund for all expenses except for custodian and trustees’ fees through December 31, 2008. The fees paid to Wilshire by the Funds and the fees paid to the subadvisers by Wilshire are considered by the Board of Trustees in approving the Funds’ advisory and sub-advisory arrangements. Any change in the advisory fees paid by a Fund to Wilshire would require shareholder approval. 
Information regarding the Board of Trustees’ approval of the Investment Advisory Agreement and Investment Sub-Advisory Agreements of the Equity Fund, Balanced Fund, Income Fund, Short-Term Investment Fund, Small Cap Growth Fund, International Equity Fund and Socially Responsible Fund is included in the Annual Report to Shareholders dated December 31, 2007. 
For the services provided and the expenses assumed pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement, Wilshire receives a fee based on each Fund’s average daily net assets, computed daily and payable monthly, at the following annual rates:

The Balanced Fund operates under a “fund of funds” structure, primarily investing in shares of both the Equity Fund and Income Fund. Under the “fund of funds” arrangement, Wilshire receives directly from the Balanced Fund a fee based on the average daily net assets of the Balanced Fund that are not invested in either the Equity Fund or Income Fund. 
Through consulting and other arrangements similar to the Funds’ “manager of managers” approach, Wilshire has also provided the same types of services to registered investment companies as provided under the Investment Advisory Agreement. 
 
31 


 
The Subadvisers. Each subadviser serves pursuant to a subadvisory agreement with Wilshire. Wilshire uses a “manager of managers” approach for the Funds by which Wilshire allocates each Fund’s assets among one or more “specialist” subadvisers. The assets of the Equity Fund are managed by AllianceBernstein, NYLIM and Pzena. The assets of the Income Fund are managed by Western Asset and WAML. WAML will manage the Income Fund’s assets allocated by Western Asset to foreign securities. Western Asset also serves as the subadviser for the Short-Term Investment Fund. BNY Mellon and Copper Rock serve as the subadvisers for the Small Cap Growth Fund. PanAgora and Thomas White serve as the subadvisers for the International Equity Fund. AllianceBernstein serves as the subadviser for the Socially Responsible Fund. Substantially all of the Balanced Fund’s assets are allocated to both the Equity Fund and Income Fund. See information on both the Equity Fund and Income Fund for the relevant subadvisers of the Balanced Fund. 
For Funds with multiple subadvisers, Wilshire has discretion over the percentage of assets allocated to each subadviser, and to the extent Wilshire deems appropriate to achieve a Fund’s investment objective, may reallocate the percentage of a Fund’s assets overseen by each subadviser at any time.

The SAI provides additional information about each Fund’s portfolio managers, including their compensation, other accounts they manage and their ownership of securities in the Fund they manage. 
Portfolio Holdings. A description of the policies and procedures with respect to the disclosure of the Funds’ portfolio securities is available in the SAI.

DISTRIBUTION PLAN 
The Funds have adopted a plan under Rule 12b-1 of the 1940 Act that provides for a fee of 0.25% of each Fund’s average net assets payable to PFPC Distributors, Inc. (the “Distributor”) to compensate the Distributor for distribution and other services provided to shareholders. 
Because 12b-1 fees are paid out of a Fund’s assets on an ongoing basis, they will, over time, increase the cost of investment and may cost more than other types of sales charges. 
PURCHASES AND REDEMPTIONS 
Shares of each Fund are currently sold only to insurance company separate accounts. Previously, shares of the Equity Fund were available to the public. While Equity Fund shares may no longer be purchased by the general public, existing public shareholders may acquire additional shares through the automatic reinvestment of dividends and distributions. Shareholder subscriptions and redemptions are effected at the price based on the next calculation of net asset value per share after receipt of a request by the insurance company. 
Each Fund sells and redeems its shares at net asset value per share, without a sales or redemption charge. The net asset value of each Fund’s shares is determined on each day the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) is open for trading at the close of regular trading on the NYSE (normally 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time). No valuations are made for any day that the NYSE is closed. The computation is made by dividing the net assets by the number of outstanding shares. Net assets are equal to the total assets of a Fund less its liabilities. 
A security listed or traded on a domestic exchange is valued at its last sales price on the exchange where it is principally traded. In the absence of a current quotation, the security is valued at the mean between the last bid and asked prices on the exchange. Securities traded on National Association of Securities Dealers Automatic Quotation (“Nasdaq”) System are valued at the Nasdaq official closing price. If there is no Nasdaq official closing price available, the most recent bid quotation is used. Securities traded over-the-counter (other than on Nasdaq) are valued at the last current sale price. Equity securities primarily traded on a foreign exchange or market are valued daily at the price, which is an estimate of the fair value price, as provided by an independent pricing service. Debt securities that have a remaining maturity of 60 days or less are valued at cost, plus or minus any amortized discount or premium. When market quotations are not readily available, securities are valued according to procedures established by the Board of Trustees or are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by the Pricing Committee, whose members include at least one representative of the Adviser who is an officer of the Trust and at least one portfolio management professional of the subadviser responsible for managing the portion of the Fund whose securities require a fair valuation determination, or the Trust’s Valuation Committee. Securities whose value does not reflect fair value because a significant valuation event has occurred may be valued at fair value by the Pricing Committee or the Valuation Committee. The value of fair valued securities may be different from the last sale price (or the mean between the last bid and asked prices), and there is no guarantee that a fair valued security will be sold at the price at which a security is valued. Investments in both the Equity Fund and Income Fund by the Balanced Fund are valued at their net asset value as reported by both the Equity Fund and Income Fund.

Except in extraordinary circumstances and as permissible under the 1940 Act, redemption proceeds are paid on or before the third business day following the date the request for redemption is received. 
Redemption of Equity Fund Shares by Existing Public Shareholders — The Equity Fund will redeem shares from public shareholders at the net asset value per share next determined after receipt of a redemption request. If stock certificates have been issued, the signature of each party must be medallion guaranteed. If certificates are lost, the shareholder will need to submit an Affidavit of Loss form and a Lost Instrument Bond will be required. Documents may be obtained by calling the transfer agent at 1-888-200-6796. The cost for this bond must be paid by the shareholder. For redemption and re-registration requests of $50,000 and greater, the signature of each party must be medallion guaranteed. For redemption and re-registration requests of any amount being sent to a payee or address other than that of record, the signature of each party must be medallion guaranteed. 
If no certificates have been issued to the shareholder, redemption may be accomplished by signing a written request. The request should be sent to the Wilshire Variable Insurance Trust, P.O. Box 9807, Providence, Rhode Island 02940, and should identify the account by number and the name(s) in which the account is registered. The request must be signed exactly as the account is registered. On a jointly held account, all owners must sign. Provided the request is received in good form, payment for shares redeemed will be made by a Fund within three business days of the receipt. 
Systematic Cash Withdrawal Plan — When an Equity Fund public shareholder has accumulated $5,000 or more of Equity Fund shares in his or her account, shares may be withdrawn automatically through the Systematic Cash Withdrawal Plan (the “Plan”). A shareholder may receive checks monthly, quarterly, semi-annually or annually in any amount requested, but not less than $25. In determining eligibility for the Plan, the value of a public shareholder’s account is determined at the net asset value on the date the Plan request is received in good order. Payments under the Plan will be made either on the 1st or 15th of the month, as selected by the shareholder. A sufficient number of shares will be redeemed from the shareholder’s account at the net asset value on the specified date to provide funds for payments under the Plan, thus reducing the shareholder’s account value. Depending on the amount and frequency of withdrawals, payments under the Plan may exhaust the shareholder’s account. There is no redemption charge with respect to the shares redeemed from the shareholder’s account. A Plan may be terminated upon written request. Shares issued in certificate form are not eligible for participation in the Plan. 
Customer Identification Program — Record owners of the Funds are the insurance companies that offer the Funds as choices for holders of certain variable annuity contracts. The Funds have a verification process for new insurance company accounts to help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities. Federal law requires all financial institutions, including the Funds, to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who opens an account. When an insurance company opens an account, the Funds will ask for its name, address, and other information that will allow the Funds to identify the company. This information will be verified to ensure the identity of all persons opening an account. 
For certain insurance companies, the Funds might request additional information (for instance, the Funds would ask for documents such as the insurance company’s articles of incorporation) to help verify the insurance company’s identity. 
The Funds will not complete the purchase of any Fund shares for an account until all required and requested identification information has been provided and the application has been submitted in proper 
 
39 


 
order. Once the application is determined to be in proper order, Fund purchase(s) will be effected at the net asset value per share next calculated. 
The Funds may reject a new account application if the insurance company does not provide any required or requested identifying information or for other reasons. 
The Funds may refuse, cancel or rescind any purchase order; freeze any account (meaning the insurance company will not be able to purchase Fund shares in a shareholder’s account); suspend account services; and/or involuntarily redeem the account if the Funds think that the account is being used for fraudulent or illegal purposes by the insurance company or by the variable annuity contract owner; one or more of these actions will be taken when, at the sole discretion of the Funds, they are deemed to be in a Fund’s best interest or when a Fund is requested or compelled to do so by governmental authority or by applicable law. 
The Funds may close and liquidate an account if they are unable to verify provided information, or for other reasons; if the Funds decide to close the account, the Funds’ shares will be redeemed at the net asset value per share next calculated after the Funds determine to close the account; the insurance company/you may be subject to gain or loss on the redemption of the fund shares and the insurance company/you may incur tax liability. 
Short-Term and Excessive Trading — The Trust and its Funds are designed for long-term investors. The Funds do not accommodate short-term or excessive trading and ask the insurance companies that offer the Funds for cooperation in discouraging such trading activity through their variable annuity contracts. Such trading may present risks to other shareholders in a Fund, including disruption of portfolio investment strategies, with potential resulting harm to investment performance, and increased trading costs or Fund expenses. Thus, such trading may negatively impact a Fund’s net asset value and result in dilution to long-term shareholders. 
In an effort to protect long-term shareholders, the Board of Trustees has adopted policies and procedures which seek to deter short-term and excessive trading. Shares of the Funds are only held as the underlying investment for variable annuity contracts issued by insurance companies, and, as a result, the participating insurance companies, rather than the underlying contract owners, are the shareholders of the Funds. 
The Trust is limited in its ability to enforce the Trust’s market timing trading policy because each insurance company has the relationship with, and is responsible for maintaining the account records of, the individual variable annuity contract owners. In addition, there may be legal and technical limitations on the ability of an insurance company to impose trading restrictions and to apply the Trust’s market timing trading policy to their variable annuity contract owners. As a result, should it occur, there is no assurance that the Trust will be completely successful in its effort to detect or minimize market timing activity. 
DIVIDENDS, DISTRIBUTIONS AND FEDERAL TAXES 
Each Fund distributes substantially all of its net investment income and net capital gains to shareholders each year. All dividends or distributions paid on Fund shares held by a separate account, net of separate account contract charges, are automatically reinvested in shares of the respective Fund at the net asset value determined on the dividend payment date. 
 
40 


 
Under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, the life insurance company issuing your variable contract is taxed as a life insurance company and the operations of its separate accounts are taxed as part of its total operations. Under current interpretations of existing federal income tax law, investment income and capital gains of separate accounts are not subject to federal income tax to the extent applied to increase the value of variable annuity contracts. Tax consequences to variable annuity contract holders are described in your variable annuity contract prospectus issued by the applicable insurance company separate account. 
Public shareholders of the Equity Fund may elect to receive cash dividends and will be notified of the amount and type of distribution. If a shareholder elects to receive a cash dividend and the dividend check is returned by the postal service, attempts will be made to locate the shareholder. If the attempts to locate are unsuccessful, the shareholder’s dividend option will be changed to reinvestment. Dividends will be taxable to the shareholder whether paid in cash or reinvested in additional shares. When new shares are added to an Equity Fund public shareholder’s account through the reinvestment of dividends or when distributions occur, a confirmation statement is sent to the public shareholder showing the number of shares that were credited to the account, the net asset value per share and the total number of shares in the account. 
A dividend or capital gain distribution will reduce the per share net asset value by the amount of the dividend or distribution. Shortly after the end of each year, Equity Fund shareholders will be informed of the amount of and the federal income tax treatment of all distributions made during the year. If not otherwise subject to tax on their income, public shareholders will not be required to pay tax on amounts distributed to them. Shareholders must determine for themselves the applicability of state and local taxes to dividends and distributions received on Equity Fund shares. 
By law, a Fund must withhold 28% of your distributions and proceeds paid to you if you do not provide your correct taxpayer identification number, or certify that such number is correct, or if the IRS instructs a Fund to do so. The tax discussion set forth above is included for general information only. Investors and prospective investors should consult their own tax advisers concerning the federal, state, local or foreign tax consequences of an investment in a Fund. 
Additional information on these and other tax matters relating to the Funds and their shareholders is included in the section entitled “Tax Matters” in the SAI.

FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS 
The financial highlights tables are intended to help you understand each Fund’s financial performance for the past five fiscal years. Certain information reflects financial results for a single Fund share. The total returns in the table represent the rate that an investor would have earned (or lost) on an investment in a Fund (assuming reinvestment of all dividends and distributions). The information for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. Their report for 2007, along with each Fund’s financial statements, is included in the 2007 annual report, which is available upon request. Another accounting firm audited the information for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003.

WILSHIRE VARIABLE INSURANCE TRUST  INFORMATION STATEMENT  TO CONTRACT OWNERS OF THE  EQUITY FUND  SMALL CAP GROWTH FUND
 INTERNATIONAL EQUITY FUND  This
document is an Information Statement and is being furnished to stockholders of the Equity Fund, Small Cap Growth Fund and the International Equity Fund (each a �Fund� and collectively the �Funds�), each a series of Wilshire
Variable Insurance Trust (the �Trust�), in lieu of a proxy statement pursuant to the terms of an exemptive order issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the �SEC�). Wilshire Associates Incorporated
(�Wilshire�) serves as the investment adviser for the Trust. The exemptive order permits Wilshire and the Board of Trustees of the Trust (the �Board�) to employ additional subadvisers, terminate subadvisers, and modify
subadvisory agreements without prior approval of the Trust�s contract owners.  Under the SEC order, if Wilshire and the Board retain a new subadviser
or materially change an existing subadvisory agreement between Wilshire and a subadviser, Wilshire is required to provide an Information Statement to contract owners of the affected portfolios of the Trust explaining any changes and disclosing the
aggregate fees paid to the subadvisers as a result of those changes. The Board reviews the subadvisory agreements annually.  This Information Statement is
being mailed on or about September�28, 2006 to the contract owners of the Funds of record as of September�15, 2006 (the �Record Date�). The Funds will bear the expenses incurred in connection with preparing this Information
Statement. As of the Record Date, ____________ shares of the Equity Fund were issued and outstanding, ____________ shares of the Small Cap Growth Fund were issued and outstanding and ____________ shares of the International Equity Fund were issued

AND YOU ARE REQUESTED  NOT TO SEND US A PROXY.  �

Appointment of New Subadvisers to the Equity Fund  On February�24, 2006, the Board appointed New York Life Investment Management LLC (�NYLIM�) and Pzena Investment Management, LLC (�Pzena�) as new subadvisers to the Equity Fund, effective
August�14, 2006. NYLIM and Pzena replaced Mellon Equity Associates, LLP and Wellington Management Company, LLP, previous subadvisers to the Equity Fund. The Board also approved changing the portfolio management team at AllianceBernstein from
the value team to the core growth team with a resulting change of fees. Wilshire continues to oversee all of the subadvisers to all of the series of the Trust.  No officers or Trustees of the Trust are officers, employees, directors, general partners or shareholders of NYLIM, Pzena or AllianceBernstein (the �Subadvisers�). In addition, since January�1, 2006, the beginning of the
Trust�s last fiscal year, no Trustee of the Trust has had, directly or indirectly, a material interest, material transaction or material proposed transaction to which NYLIM, Pzena or AllianceBernstein, or any of their parents or subsidiaries or
any subsidiaries of a parent of any such entities was or is to be a party.  At its February�24, 2006 meeting, in connection with its review of
Wilshire�s proposed subadvisory agreements with NYLIM, Pzena and AllianceBerstein (the �Agreements�), the Board evaluated information provided by Wilshire and NLIM, Pzena and AllianceBernstein in accordance with Section�15(c) of
the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the �1940 Act�). In reviewing the Agreements, the Board considered (i)�the nature, extent and quality of services to be provided under each Agreement. The Board considered the
reputation, qualifications and background of the Subadvisers, investment approach of the Subadvisers and the experience and skills of investment personnel responsible for the day-to-day management of the Equity Fund.  Based upon all relevant factors, the Board concluded that each Subadviser�s investment performance for a product similar to the Equity Fund met or exceeded
acceptable levels of investment performance as compared to a relevant market benchmark and, therefore, was satisfactory.  The Board also considered the
proposed subadvisory fees to be paid by Wilshire to each Subadviser. The Board evaluated the competitiveness of the subadvisory fees based upon data supplied by AllianceBernstein and NYLIM about the fees charged to other clients. The Board noted the
favorable treatment to be afforded the Equity Fund in applying the breakpoints in Pzena�s fee schedule. The Board also considered that the subadvisory fee rates were negotiated at arm�s length between Wilshire and each Subadviser and that
Wilshire will compensate each Subadviser from its own advisory fees.  Based upon all of the above, the Board determined
that the proposed subadvisory fees of each Subadviser were reasonable.  In addition, the Board noted that the revenues to the Subadvisers will be limited
due to the current asset level of the Equity Fund. Accordingly, the Board concluded that they need not review estimated levels of profits to the Subadvisers in order to conclude, as they did, that profitability to the Subadvisers was not
unreasonable.  �
2 


The Board considered whether there will be economies of scale with respect to the subadvisory services provided to the
Equity Fund and whether the subadvisory fees reflect such economies of scale through breakpoints in fees. The Board also considered whether the estimated effective subadvisory fee rate for each Subadviser under the each Agreement is reasonable in
relation to the asset size of the Equity Fund. The Board concluded that the fee schedule for each Subadviser reflects an appropriate recognition of any economies of scale.  The Board also considered the character and amount of other incidental benefits to be received by each Subadviser. The Board considered each Subadviser�s soft dollar practices and, if applicable, use of
affiliated brokerage. The Board concluded that, taking into account the benefits arising from these practices, the fees to be charged under the Agreement were reasonable.  Based upon all of the information considered and the conclusions reached, the Board as a whole, and the Trustees who are not �interested persons� of the Trust as defined in the 1940 Act (the
�Independent Trustees�) separately, determined that the fees under each Agreement were fair and reasonable for the services to be provided and that the approval of each Agreement is in the best interests of the Fund and its shareholders.
In deciding to approve the Agreement, the Board did not identify a single factor as controlling, but concluded that each of the various factors referred to above favored approval.  NYLIM  NYLIM, located at 51 Madison Avenue, New York, NY 10010 had approximately $220 billion in assets under
management as of June�30, 2006. Day to day management of NYLIM�s portion of the Equity Fund is the responsibility of portfolio managers Harvey Fram, Migene Kim and Mona Patni.  Harvey Fram, CFA, Managing Director of NYLIM, is responsible for the management of quantitative equity portfolios. Prior to joining NYLIM in 2000, Mr.�Fram was a portfolio manager and research strategist at
Monitor Capital Advisors LLC (a former subsidiary of NYLIM). Prior to joining Monitor Capital Advisors LLC, he was a quantitative equity research analyst at ITG, a leading technology based equity brokerage firm. Prior to that, he was a portfolio
manager for international equity derivatives at the Palladin Group, a hedge fund. Mr.�Fram has an MBA from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania.  Migene Kim is Portfolio Manager for the core equity team of NYLIM. Prior to joining NYLIM, she spent seven years as a quantitative research analyst at INVESCO�s Structured Products Group. She started her career
as an analyst at the Market Risk Management Group of Chase Manhattan Bank in 1993. Ms.�Kim earned her MBA in Financial Engineering from the MIT Sloan School of Management and is a summa cum laude graduate in Mathematics from the University of
Pennsylvania where she was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. She is also a CFA charterholder.  Mona Patni is a Portfolio Manager for the core equity team of
NYLIM. Prior to joining NYLIM, she was a principal consultant in the Financial Services division at PricewaterhouseCoopers, 
 �
3 



LLP. Ms.�Patni earned her MBA from NYU Stern School of Business and her undergraduate degree in Computer Science Engineering from the University of
Bombay.  NYLIM seeks to identify companies that are considered to have a high probability of outperforming the Standard�& Poor�s 500 Index.
The underlying process for selecting securities is based on a quantitative process that ranks stocks based on such fundamental factors as valuation and earnings, as well as on technical behavioral factors. These stocks are ranked on a monthly basis
utilizing this multi-factor model. On occasion, trading strategies that seek to realize returns over shorter periods may be employed. The core strategy utilized by the portfolio manager includes both growth and value styles. A bottom-up approach,
which assesses the individual strengths of stocks, is used to enhance returns. The portfolio is constructed with an optimizer seeking to maximize return given a targeted tracking error and specific constraints.  Upon completion of the analysis and review, the portfolio manager enters trades in the portfolio management system, creating an electronic trading blotter. The blotter
is immediately available, electronically, to the trader who is then responsible for placing the orders with various brokers. The objective is to create a portfolio of securities with the most attractive return forecasts while minimizing risk
relative to the benchmark. The current risk controls applied to the portfolio are a maximum target tracking error of 2% annualized, sector constraints of +/-2.5%, and security-specific bounds of +/-1.25% relative to the benchmark.
 NYLIM typically engages in price-sensitive strategic trading, taking care to build or liquidate positions based on the specific trading characteristics of
each security. The portfolio management team works closely with trading to monitor the status of outstanding trades.  Pzena  Pzena is located at 120 West 45th Street, New York, New York 10036 and had $21.2 billion in assets under management as of June�30, 2006.  Richard S. Pzena, John P. Goetz, and Antonio DeSpirito are responsible for the day-to-day management of the Equity Fund. Richard S. Pzena, Managing Principal, Chief
Executive Officer, Co-Chief Investment Officer and Founder of Pzena has been with Pzena since 1995. John P. Goetz, Managing Principal and Co-Chief Investment Officer, has been with Pzena since 1996. Antonio DeSpirito, III, Principal and Portfolio
Manager, has been with Pzena since 1996.  Pzena manages its allocated portion of the Equity Fund�s portfolio using a classic value investment
philosophy. Pzena defines value stocks as those stocks whose prices are low relative to their longer-term normal earnings power. Pzena�s securities selection process involves an initial ranking of the 500 largest U.S. listed companies, from the
least expensive to the most expensive, based upon a ratio of each company�s price-to-normalized earnings. Research priority is given to the least expensive stocks, those exhibiting a group or sector theme, and those offering portfolio
diversification benefits. Companies undergo rigorous qualitative research by Pzena�s analysts to determine whether the causes of the under-valuation are likely to be temporary or permanent. Third party analysis and data sources are used for
about 10% to 20% of this research. Onsite due diligence is also an important step in Pzena�s securities selection determination. This step occurs at the end of the research process, which enables Pzena to 
 �
4 



engage in a dialogue with company management from the perspective of well-informed critical thinkers. As a result of Pzena�s security selection process,
the portion of the Equity Fund�s portfolio allocated to Pzena will typically be highly concentrated with a strong value emphasis.  AllianceBernstein  AllianceBernstein, 1345 Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY 10105 is a leading global investment management firm
supervising client accounts with assets as of March�31, 2006, totaling approximately $617 billion. AllianceBernstein, an investment adviser registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, provides investment management

largest mutual fund sponsors, with a diverse family of globally distributed mutual fund portfolios.  Five managers are

Mr.�Reilly has a BA from the University of Illinois at Urbana, where he was an Evans Scholar, and a MBA from Northwestern University.

joining the firm, he was with JP Morgan for 15 years, where he was a managing director and held a variety 
 �
5 



of roles in the US and abroad, most recently as head of equities in Japan. Mr.�Wallace has a BA from Princeton University.  AllianceBernstein seeks to generate a premium through research-driven stock selection. The investment team primarily uses analysts� research and ratings to buy 45
to 60 companies likely to outpace consensus earnings growth, usually due to excellent management and a long-term competitive advantage, at attractive valuations. AllianceBernstein�s US Large Cap Growth strategy is managed by a team of portfolio
managers. The team is comprised of 12 portfolio managers, and is supported by 24 research analysts and 10 traders. The team of portfolio managers makes investment strategy, portfolio construction, security selection, and risk management decisions.
The industry and sector-oriented company analysts produce original research and rate each of the companies in their primary research universe. The research staff and portfolio management teams interact daily and meet formally on a weekly basis to
articulate a consensus view on stock valuation and selection.  Appointment of New Subadvisers to the Small Cap Growth and International Equity Funds
 On May�2, 2006, the Board appointed BNY Asset Management (�BNY�) and Copper Rock Capital Partners, LLC (�Copper Rock�) as new
subadvisers to the Small Cap Growth Fund, effective June�28, 2006. On May�2, 2006, the Board also appointed PanAgora Asset Management, Inc. (�PanAgora�) as a new subadviser to the International Equity Fund, effective
June�29, 2006. BNY and Copper Rock replaced BlackRock Financial Management, Inc. and Mazama Capital Management, Inc., the previous subadvisers to the Small Cap Growth Fund. PanAgora replaced New Star Institutional Managers Limited, one of the
previous subadvisers to the International Equity Fund. On June�30, 2006, the core equity team of The Boston Company Asset Management, LLC (�Boston Company�) began managing Boston Company�s portion of the International Equity Fund
in place of the international value team.  No officers or Trustees of the Trust are officers, employees, directors, general partners or shareholders of
BNY, Copper Rock, PanAgora or Boston Company (the �Subadvisers�). In addition, since January�1, 2006, the beginning of the Trust�s last fiscal year, no Trustee of the Trust has had, directly or indirectly, a material interest,
material transaction or material proposed transaction to which BNY, Copper Rock, PanAgora or Boston Company or any of their parents or subsidiaries or any subsidiaries of a parent of any such entities was or is to be a party.  At its May�2, 2006 meeting, in connection with its review of Wilshire�s proposed subadvisory agreements with BNY, Copper Rock, PanAgora and the amended
subadvisory agreement with Boston Company (the �Agreements�), the Board evaluated information provided by Wilshire and BNY, Copper Rock, PanAgora and Boston Company in accordance with Section�15(c) of the 1940 Act. In reviewing the
Agreements, the Board considered: (i)�the nature, extent and quality of services to be provided; (ii)�where applicable, the investment performance of the Subadvisers for a product similar to the Funds; (iii)�the financial condition of
the Subadviser; (iv)�the extent to which economies of scale would be realized as a Fund grows; (v)�whether fee levels reflect any possible economies of scale for the benefit of Fund shareholders; (vi)�where applicable, comparisons of
services rendered and amounts paid to other registered investment companies and any comparable advisory clients; and (vii)�benefits to be realized by the Subadvisers from 
 �
6 



their relationships with the Funds. The Independent Trustees also received a memorandum from counsel describing their duties in connection with contract
approvals, and they were assisted in their review by independent legal counsel.  As to each Agreement, the Board considered the nature, extent and quality
of services to be provided under each Agreement. The Board considered the reputation, qualifications and background of the Subadviser, investment approach of the Subadvisers, and the experience and skills of investment personnel responsible for the
day-to-day management of each Fund. The Board also considered each Subadviser�s compliance program. In addition, the Board considered Wilshire�s recommendation that each Subadvisory Agreement be approved.  Based upon all relevant factors, the Board concluded that Copper Rock�s investment performance for a product similar to the Small Cap Growth Fund met or exceeded
acceptable levels of investment performance as compared to a relevant market benchmark and, therefore, a satisfactory level of services was anticipated. The Board noted PanAgora�s representation that it does not currently manage a product using
the same investment strategy as will be employed for the International Equity Fund but concluded that based upon PanAgora�s investment performance for other international equity products, a satisfactory level of services was anticipated. The
Board noted that BNY�s investment performance for a product similar to the Small Cap Growth Fund was too new to judge, but based upon review of the organization and personnel, concluded that a satisfactory level of services was anticipated.
 The Board considered the proposed subadvisory fees of each Subadviser. Where applicable, the Board evaluated the competitiveness of the subadvisory fees
based upon data supplied by each Subadviser about the fees charged to other clients. The Board also considered that the subadvisory fee rates were negotiated at arm�s length between Wilshire and each Subadviser and that Wilshire will compensate
each Subadviser from its fees.  For the Small Cap Growth Fund, where the Subadvisers had other clients that were being managed using the same investment
style, the Board noted that although BNY and Copper Rock may charge higher fees to Wilshire than are charged to their other clients, the Board concluded that the fees charged to Wilshire were generally competitive.  Based upon all of the above, the Board determined that the proposed subadvisory fees of each Subadviser were reasonable.  The Board noted that Wilshire will compensate each Subadviser from its own advisory fees and that the fees were negotiated at arm�s length between Wilshire and each
Subadviser. In addition, the Board noted that the revenues to the various Subadvisers will be limited due to the size of the Funds. Based upon this information, profitability to the Subadvisers was determined to be not unreasonable.  The Board considered whether there will be economies of scale with respect to the subadvisory services to be provided to each Fund and whether the subadvisory fees
reflect such economies of scale through breakpoints in fees. The Board also considered whether the estimated effective subadvisory fee rate for each Subadviser under each Agreement is reasonable in relation to the asset size of the Fund. The Board
concluded that the fee schedule for each Subadviser reflects an appropriate recognition of any economies of scale.  �

The Board also considered the character and amount of other incidental benefits received by each Subadviser. The Board
considered each Subadviser�s soft dollar practices, where applicable. The Board concluded that, taking into account the benefits arising from these practices, the fees to be charged under each Subadvisory Agreement were reasonable. 
Based upon all of the information considered and the conclusions reached, the Board determined that the terms of each Subadvisory Agreement are fair and reasonable
and that the approval of each Subadvisory Agreement is in the best interests of each Fund.  BNY  BNY, a New York corporation, is located at 1633 Broadway, 13th Floor, New York, NY 10019. BNY had approximately $113 million in assets under management as of March�31, 2006.  Kurt Zyla,

charges. The portfolio managers monitor optimized portfolios daily and rebalance them as often as necessary to ensure the desired level of tracking error.  Boston Company  The Boston Company, One Boston Place, Boston, Massachusetts 02108, is a registered investment adviser founded in 1970. The

Peter S. Carpenter, CFA serves as assistant portfolio manager for the Boston Company�s Global Equity and
International Core Equity strategies. He is also responsible for conducting research covering the industrial and consumer discretionary sectors in the International Core, Growth and Small Cap strategies. Mr.�Carpenter earned his MBA from Boston
University and his BA from Middlebury College. Peter is a Chartered Financial Analyst charter holder.  In selecting stocks, Boston Company attempts to
capture the delay between a company�s improving business momentum and market recognition. Identifying earnings acceleration is an important part of Boston Company�s buy discipline. To achieve this, Boston Company�s proprietary model
focuses on earnings growth and in particular the trend in current earnings and changes in expectations. Valuation is also reviewed across several dimensions (including price to earnings, price to cash flow, and price to book value). The universe
constituents are then ranked within region, country, and economic sector. From this quantitative modeling process Boston Company�s analysts then review those securities where Boston Company believes the potential for superior return exists at
an acceptable risk level. Analysts confirm these positive characteristics and make the decision to add the security to the portfolio.  Aggregate Fees
 Wilshire�s annual advisory fee for the Equity Fund is 0.70% of the Equity Fund�s average daily net assets. For the fiscal year ended
December�31, 2005, the Trust paid Wilshire $2,372,358 in advisory fees for the Equity Fund. Wilshire�s annual advisory fee for the Small Cap Growth Fund is 1.15% of the Small Cap Growth Fund�s average daily net assets. For the fiscal
year ended December�31, 2005, the Trust paid Wilshire $599,041 in advisory fees for the Small Cap Growth Fund. Wilshire�s annual advisory fee for the International Equity Fund is 1.00% of the International Equity Fund�s average daily
net assets. For the fiscal year ended December�31, 2005, the Trust paid Wilshire $363,013 in advisory fees for the International Equity Fund.  For the
fiscal year ended December�31, 2005, the aggregate subadvisory fees paid by Wilshire to all subadvisers with respect to the Equity Fund, Small Cap Growth Fund and International Equity Fund were $1,100,125, $429,889 and $258,247, respectively.
These aggregate fees represent 0.21%, 0.83% and 0.65%, respectively, of the average net assets of the Equity Fund, Small Cap Growth Fund and International Equity Fund.  All subadvisory fees are paid by Wilshire and not the Funds. The fees paid by Wilshire to each subadviser depend on the fee rates negotiated by Wilshire and on the percentage of each Fund�s assets allocated to
the subadviser by Wilshire. Because Wilshire pays each subadviser�s fees out of its own fees received from the Funds, there is no �duplication� of advisory fees paid.  �
