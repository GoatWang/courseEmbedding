TER is working to ensure all Texas children have access to high performing public schools that will prepare them to think critically in order to succeed in their career and life. The mission of TER is to advance policies to transform Texas public schools for every Texas child - regardless of race, ethnicity or zip code.

These factors are similar to those you might use to determine which business to select from a local Yellow Pages directory, including proximity to where you are searching, expertise in the specific services or products you need, and comprehensive business information to help evaluate a business's suitability for you. “Preferred” listings, or those with featured website buttons, indicate YP advertisers who directly provide information about their businesses to help consumers make more informed buying decisions. YP advertisers receive higher placement in the default ordering of search results and may appear in sponsored listings on the top, side, or bottom of the search results page.Sort:DefaultDefaultDistanceRatingName (A - Z)Sponsored LinksAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection1. Touchstone, W Earl700 Louisiana StHouston, TX 77002(713) 225-7344AttorneysAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection2. Bush Earl L1934 W Gray StHouston, TX 77019(713) 520-8554AttorneysGeneral Practice AttorneysAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection3. Spielman Earl S & Associates99 Detering StHouston, TX 77007(713) 981-4200AttorneysGeneral Practice AttorneysWebsiteAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection4. Covington Earl G909 Birdsall StHouston, TX 77007(713) 868-9099Tax AttorneysAttorneysAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection5. Cass Earl B2401 Fountain View Dr Ste 622Houston, TX 77057(713) 944-4445AttorneysAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection6. Cass Earl B2310 Fountain View DrHouston, TX 77057(713) 944-4445AttorneysFamily Law AttorneysAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection7. Covington, Earl G16945 Northchase DrHouston, TX 77060(281) 876-6000AttorneysAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection8. Earl Walker Zachry2022 Island Oak StHouston, TX 77062(281) 488-7835AttorneysAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection9. Earl S Spielman & Assoc16006 Los Altos DrHouston, TX 77083(713) 981-4200AttorneysAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection10. Gauntt, Earl, & Binney LLP1400 Woodloch Forest Dr Ste 575Spring, TX 77380(281) 367-6555AttorneysGeneral Practice AttorneysWebsiteServicesBusinesses in related categories to DentistsAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collectionPREFERRED11. Don Smith and Associates, Attorneys At LawBaytown, TX 77521(281) 427-0448Sex Offense AttorneysWebsiteSchedule a ConsultationMore InfoFrom Business: We are criminal defense lawyers representing people arrested and charged with crimes.

Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement.

What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.
