Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

(NYSE:PBF) today reported fourth quarter 2016 income from operations of $139.8 million as compared to a loss from operations of $178.4 million for fourth quarter of 2015. Excluding special items, fourth quarter 2016 loss from operations was $60.7 million as compared to income from operations of $167.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2015. Special items in the fourth quarter 2016 results include a net, non-cash, after-tax gain of $122.2 million, or $1.17 per share, lower-of-cost-or-market ("LCM") inventory adjustment and an after-tax benefit of $9.8 million, or $0.09 per share, related to a change in the tax receivable liability agreement. Additionally, included in our results was a net after-tax charge totaling approximately $7.2 million, or $0.07 per share, related to an inventory layer decrement. The company reported fourth quarter 2016 net income of $71.8 million, and net income attributable to PBF Energy Inc. of $54.6 million or $0.54 per share. This compares to net loss of $121.5 million, and net loss attributable to PBF Energy Inc. of $119.5 million or $1.24 per share for the fourth quarter 2015. Adjusted fully-converted net loss for the fourth quarter 2016, excluding special items, was $74.9 million, or $0.71 per share on a fully-exchanged, fully-diluted basis, as described below, compared to adjusted fully-converted net income of $71.0 million, or $0.70 per share, for the fourth quarter 2015. Net income attributable to PBF Energy Inc. for the year-ended December 31, 2016 was $170.8 million, or $1.74 per share as compared to net income of $146.4 million, or $1.65 per share, for the year-ended December 31, 2015.

Excluding special items, loss from operations was $22.5 million for the year-ended December 31, 2016 as compared to income from operations of $787.3 million for the year-ended December 31, 2015. Adjusted fully-converted net loss for the year 2016, excluding special items, was $145.7 million, or $1.41 per share on a fully-exchanged, fully-diluted basis, as compared to adjusted fully-converted net income of $402.1 million, or $4.27 per share, for the fourth quarter 2015.  PBF Energy's financial results reflect the consolidation of PBF Logistics LP (NYSE: PBFX), a master limited partnership of which PBF indirectly owns the general partner and approximately 44.2% of the limited partner interests as of December 31, 2016.“Our fourth quarter and full-year 2016 results reflect the numerous market and regulatory headwinds faced by the independent refiners and we, as a company, did not operate our assets to the fullest of their potential,” said Tom Nimbley, PBF Energy's Chairman and CEO, “Looking ahead, with the proceeds from our recent equity raise, we are pleased to be starting the year with a strong and flexible balance sheet. We are committed to the continued integration of both Torrance and Chalmette, and further optimizing our entire system in 2017.”PBF Logistics will proceed with two organic growth projects comprised of the construction of a 625,000 barrel tank at PBF Energy's Chalmette refinery and development of a natural gas pipeline to supply PBF Energy's Paulsboro refinery.  PBF Logistics expects to spend approximately $82.1 million dollars to complete both projects at an attractive return.  Both projects will be funded by PBF Logistics and supported by long-term agreements with minimum volume commitments from PBF Energy. PBF Energy Inc. Declares DividendThe company announced today that it will pay a quarterly dividend of $0.30 per share of Class A common stock on March 13, 2017, to holders of record as of February 27, 2017.1

HARP Loan















Advertorial






 (877) 792-9388







Toggle nav


What is the HARP Program?
When you have little equity in your home, or owe as much or more on your mortgage than your home is worth, it can be difficult to find a lender willing to help you refinance.
                            But for borrowers who have remained current on their mortgages, and have loans owned by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, there is hope. It’s called Home Affordable Refinance Program (HARP).
                        
Introduced in March 2009, HARP enables borrowers with little or no equity to refinance into more affordable mortgages without new or additional mortgage insurance.
                            HARP targets borrowers with loan-to-value (LTV) ratios equal to or greater than 80 percent and who have limited delinquencies over the 12 months prior to refinancing.







Significant changes have been made to HARP since the program was first introduced. For example, in 2011 the LTV ceiling was removed, property appraisal requirements were waived in certain circumstances, certain risk fees for borrowers
                            selecting shorter amortization terms were eliminated, and certain representations and warranties were waived. In 2013, the eligibility date was changed from the date the loan was acquired by Fannie Mae                            or Freddie Mac to the date on the note, increasing the pool of eligible borrowers.
                        
Through HARP, you can get a lower interest rate (which means less out-of-pocket costs each month), get a shorter loan term, or change from an adjustable to fixed-rate
                            mortgage. There’s no minimum credit score needed, either.
                        
And now that HARP guidelines are simpler, even people who were formerly turned down may now be eligible for HARP refinancing.
                        
Find out if you qualify for HARP!




How can HARP help me?
If you are current on your mortgage; have a mortgage that is owned by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, and owe as much or more than your home is currently worth, you may be eligible for HARP refinancing. That can mean significant savings
                            by: 

Lowering your monthly payment
Reducing your interest rate
Securing a fixed-rate mortgage that won’t change over time
Building equity faster—shorter term options may be available
Lower closing costs because an appraisal is not usually required
Check your HARP eligibility‎!





HARP program includes:


No underwater limits
Borrowers will now be able to refinance regardless of how far their homes have fallen in value. Previous loan-to-value limits were set at 125 percent.
                                


No appraisals or underwriting
Most homeowners will not have to get an appraisal or have their loan underwritten, making their refinance process smoother and faster.


Modified fees
Certain risk-based fees for borrowers who refinance into shorter-term loans have been reduced.


Less paperwork
Lenders now need less paperwork for income verification, and have the option of qualifying a borrower by documenting that the borrower has at least 12 months
                                    of mortgage payments in reserve.


Program Deadline
The end date to get a HARP refinance is September 30, 2017.


Check if you qualify for HARP before it's gone!






Might you be eligible?
See if you meet these basic eligibility requirements:

You are current on your mortgage, with no 30-day+ late payments in the last six months and no more than one in the past 12 months
Your home is your primary residence, a 1-unit second home or a 1- to 4-unit investment property.
Your loan is owned by Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae. You can use the Loan Look-up Tools below if you are unsure.
Your loan was originated on or before May 31, 2009.
Your current loan-to-value (LTV) ratio must be greater than 80%.
Verify your HARP eligibility now‎!











Gather your financial information
Make sure you have your basic financial and loan information on hand when you call your mortgage company. You’ll need:

Your mortgage statements, including information on a second mortgage (if applicable).
Your income details (paystub or income tax return).






Connect with us
The licensed lending officer will also explain all the steps–from getting started, to locking in your low rate, to closing your loan quickly. Because we are a direct lender, if you have any questions during the loan process,
                                you will have one direct number enabling you to get quick answers straight from the source.
 (877) 792-9388

Finish Application Process
If we determines that you do qualify for HARP, we will guide you through the application, approval and closing process.

There's an advantage in working with a financial advisor who knows you – and your financial goals. That's what makes Edward Jones different from other investment firms. Supporting the relationship between you and your financial advisor shapes nearly every aspect of our business.
You may have seen one of our 12,000 offices in your community. That's because we believe you deserve more than a 1-800 number when it comes to your financial future.
What you may not know is that we're a Fortune 500 company with thousands of associates and sophisticated technology supporting your local financial advisor.
The Edward Jones approach in determining your goals, and developing tailored financial strategies, has been helping nearly 7 million clients for more than 90 years.
In fact, we like to think we became one of the largest financial services firms in the country by not acting that way. If you're ready to work with a different kind of investment firm—one that cares as much about why you're investing as what you invest in— you're ready to work with Edward Jones.

How we can help
We get it. Investing can be complicated. Ask all the questions you want, and we will answer them in plain English. Your financial advisor is your long-term financial partner. These are important goals and you need an advocate – someone who listens and really understands what's important to you. We believe that's the best way to develop a personalized financial strategy.

Focus On You

Focus On You




Every investment firm has principles. And they usually sound exactly the same. We believe Edward Jones is different in almost every way. Our principles were deliberately created with you in mind. We don't just talk about personal service. We're built to deliver it.
Your dedicated financial advisor – It's your financial future, so an 800-number or Internet search for financial advice doesn't cut it. You have a relationship with an Edward Jones financial advisor, who spends time to learn why you're investing and then develops a personalized strategy. No cookie-cutter plans here.
In your neighborhood – With more than 15,000 financial advisors, you shouldn't have to go far to find an Edward Jones office in your community. That means you can actually meet with a financial advisor to discuss what's important to you.
Tailored for individual investors - All of our resources – including investment research, online account access, easy-to-understand statements, sophisticated software and detailed reports – are developed with you in mind.
Experienced support team - Backing up this personal service is a Fortune 500 company with thousands of people and advanced technology. Your financial advisor uses these resources to develop the best strategy for you.
We spend the time and have the knowledge to help you sort through complicated financial questions. Most financial services firms claim to focus on you and your needs, but can they really do it? We believe Edward Jones is uniquely positioned from the ground up to provide the attention, respect and service you deserve.

Prepare for Your First Appointment 
Learn more



Prepare for Your First Appointment 




We're honored that you're considering working with us to help achieve your financial goals. Here are three ways you can prepare our first meeting.


Think about why you're investing
Understanding the "why" will help you be better prepared to discuss your goals and strategies to help reach them. What's important to you and your family? What do you want to achieve?


Gather your statements
If you've worked with a financial advisor before, it's helpful to know about your current investments and your experience to date. If you're new to the investing world, we promise to talk with you, not at you. Our goal is to empower you with the knowledge you'll need to pursue your goals.


Bring your questions
We want to make sure to answer any investment questions you may have, as well as how we can best work together. What do you expect? How often do you want to touch base?

Invested in the Community






We are invested in our community
We value the communities where we work, so we're committed to giving back. You'll find our associates serving clients in our offices, but you'll also find us investing our time and talents to support local organizations and great causes. Many Financial Advisors are on Chambers of Commerce and serve as board members and event coordinators for local organizations, and our associates volunteer, donate and support a variety of charitable organizations.







Tour De Ted
Each year, branch and Home Office associates take to the road to raise funds for cancer research for the firm's annual Tour de Ted. In memory of Ted Jones, former managing partner who died from cancer, the first Tour de Ted showcased the firm's community-oriented culture while paying tribute to the history of Edward Jones. Volunteers rode the path of the original "wire" that connected Pueblo, Colo., to St. Louis, Mo., which created our branch network.







Emergency Assistance
Sixteen Financial Advisors in Texas decided to set aside one day out of their busy schedules to give back to their community. They volunteered at the Montgomery County Emergency Assistance facility by painting offices and hallways, and sorting and tagging clothes.







School Supply Drive
Eight local Edward Jones Financial Advisors teamed up on behalf of school children, clearly demonstrating their commitment to family values. Their school supply drive brought in hundreds of classroom necessities, from notebooks and markers to tissues and cleaning wipes.







Habitat for Humanity
When investors wanted to save for a new home, Edward Jones was there to help. Associates from Ontario, Canada, helped a local family reach its goal of home ownership in another way when they came together for the Habitat for Humanity build in Amherstburg, Ont., the first such home built in this community.







Pedal the Cause
We're proud of our associates who joined the fight against cancer as Edward Jones Pedal the Cause riders. More than 200 bike riders from across the U.S. took to the streets (and the Katy Trail) to help fundraise for cancer research.







Walk to End Alzheimer's®
At Edward Jones, we live and work in the communities we serve. We want to make a difference in people’s lives, both in and out of the office. Alzheimer’s disease has a significant impact on individuals, family, friends and community. That’s why we’ve chosen to partner with the Alzheimer’s Association as the National Presenting Sponsor of the Walk to End Alzheimer’s®. We invite you to join us in the fight to end this terrible disease.
