                    	About Us
                    











                                        The KEEPS Corporation creates solutions which provide industry-exclusive daily actionable data designed to save management time and improve profits for automotive retail service operations.
                                    







Key Employee Evaluation & Planning Systems
                                    




                                    	The company was founded by Vernon "Ray" Branch over 20 years ago and has become the automotive industry's premier provider of retail automotive service department analytics, repair order analysis, and advanced service management support.
                                    
                                   
                                    	The KEEPS Corporation combines unique data, advanced technology, and consulting support to ensure that our unique turn-key processes are implemented and executed.  KEEPS Corporation solutions are found in 7 of the USA's top 10 Dealer Groups along with over 400 of other dealerships throughout the US and Canada spanning in 43 US states and provinces.  The KEEPS Corporation holds offices in Raleigh, North Carolina and Las Vegas, Nevada.
                                    











                                        	RAY BRANCH
                                        

	                                       Founder
                                        



Ray Branch is widely respected for creating many of the automotive industries most critical KPI's and best management practices used by top operators in the retail automotive industry today.

Ray started his career as a Technician, Shop Forman, and Service Advisor.  He spent time at a highline manufacturer and top 3rd party provider.  Nearly three decades ago Mr. Branch created a comprehensive analysis system.  He realized the need to provide a consistent and detailed analysis to better identify opportunities, manage process improvement, and help guide his employees across the 27 service departments he oversaw.  
                                  








                                        	THE SILVER GROUP
                                        

                                        Partner
                                        



The company Patriarch, Les Silver founded Newgen Results Corporation, MPI, and Service Repair Solutions.  Dating back to the early 1980's, Mr. Silver has pioneered almost every aspect of automotive service technology.

Two of his sons started in the industry a decade ago while working for SRS (parent company to MPI, AutoPoint, Identifix, & IATN).  Through various sales, product development and managerial roles they learned the lasting belief is that technology must serve to improve processes and generate tangible results.  Leigh Silver has a background in economics and financial accounting.  Darcy Silver has a background in hospitality.    






                                	Management by Measurement


                                	The KEEPS Corporation is able to help managers better evaluate and improve employee performance;
"When we deal in generalities, we rarely succeed; but when we deal in specifics, we rarely fail. 
Where performance is measured and continuously reported, the rate of improvement 
and success DRAMATICALLY increases.

Culture
A great company starts with a great culture.


Consumers always come first.


We operate as an "upside-down pyramid": customers first, those who directly engage with customers second, management last.
We respect individual privacy and aim to give consumers greater control of their web experiences.
We embrace community, with users in control.


We maximize value to our partners.


We love brands, products and services!
We partner with brands to help them succeed on the web.
But user experience trumps money every time.


We operate with the highest integrity.


We are straight shooters and demand integrity in principle and practice.
We don't tolerate politics.
We admit and confront our mistakes ... and learn from them.


We are adaptive, flexible and nimble.


We race towards opportunity.  We spin on a dime.
We move at Internet speed — ahead of the crowd.
Jobs can change at any time.


We are adoptive, embracing good ideas from all sources.


We embrace diversity in perspective, viewpoint, thinking and actions.
All ideas are welcome and appreciated.


We encourage teamwork, risk-taking, creativity, and speed-to-market


Teamwork makes better products, but can slow things down.
So, we encourage single ownership, creativity, risk and speed.


We value input (& push-back), not consensus.


We value everyone's opinions but recognize the power of crisp and quick decisions.
Decision-owners must solicit input, welcome push-back, and ultimately make the call and execute.


We are strategically focused.


Our work is market focused.
We build and evolve world-class products.
Our offerings will be powerful, relevant, scalable and low friction.


We only want to work with the best people, those who are prepared to work harder than the competition.


We are positive in our outlook and behavior.
We will compensate better.
We will have more fun.
We will sprint a marathon and win our races.
We will succeed together.


We exist to build long-term value for our investors.


Everyone who works here is an owner.

Hilary Kramer’s pick for the contest is Newell Brands Inc (NYSE:NWL).We’re now halfway into the year, which means it’s time to check in on Newell Brands Inc (NYSE:NWL), my pick for InvestorPlace’s Best Stock of 2017 contest.Best Stocks (NWL Stock): Best Stocks for 2017: Newell Brands Inc (NWL) Stock Keeps Trimming the FatMoreThis stock has come a long way, and I think the best is yet to come. A big part of the attraction here is the way NWL stock keeps shuffling its brand portfolio, holding onto everything from Yankee Candle to Sharpie markers and Paper Mate pens while stepping out of underperforming categories like power tools and winter sporting apparel.For all practical purposes, if a product is relevant to modern life, this company is probably the second-largest player in that global space. Otherwise, management is happy to cash out and try again elsewhere.NWL Stock Still GrowingThat narrative has translated into a pretty smooth ride for the stock. While it took the shares a few weeks to really get moving, they’ve been on a solid run ever since. The dividends certainly haven’t hurt NWL stock’s story, adding up at a rate of first 19 cents and now 23 cents every three months. Downside also looks mighty secure at this point, liberating the chart to reach for bigger and bigger upside as we approach the traditionally volatile third quarter.  The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for the Rest of 2017  NWL stock has already left the broader market in the dust. At the peak a few weeks ago, the stock was up 24% versus the S&P 500, which has scored a respectable 10% year to date. And with easily 70% of our gain here coming in the last three months, the ramp seems to be accelerating.Wall Street itself is convinced that this company can run another 6%-7% before it needs to catch its breath. With consensus around earnings this year setting the bar another 2% higher in just the last six weeks, the fundamental outlook should be hot enough to fan the fire to at least that level.That rising heat in the fundamentals really seems to have started feeding on itself once last quarter’s numbers gave Wall Street even better-than-expected performance on May 8. Back then, NWL stock could command at best a 16X current multiple to reflect what looked at the time like anemic 5% annualized growth. Now the forward growth rate is tracking at roughly double that level even though the multiples have only inflated to 23X what management promises we’ll see at the end of the fiscal year.Factor in a 21% richer dividend and the stock is actually cheaper than it was six months ago.All that said, management could work harder to guide Wall Street to believe that this year’s growth will continue into 2018 and beyond, but that’s really a matter of the brand shuffle favoring the opportunities that emerge over the next 18 months. As it is, the process of shedding underperforming assets may be close to a climax now. The last deal here — unloading the skiwear business — realized a price of 1.37X annual sales on that unit. The whole company put together is barely trading at 1.7X sales, so there’s not a lot of fat left in the product line worth trimming.Beyond this point, management must be thinking hard about buying back its own shares as a way to keep the numbers dancing — I doubt Wall Street would look unfavorably at that prospect.Hilary Kramer is the editor of GameChangers, Breakout Stocks, High Octane Trader, Absolute Capital Return and Value Authority.
