      Fitch Affirms UBS Commercial Trust 2012-C1
    





February 25, 2015 04:31 PM Eastern Standard Time



CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has affirmed 11 classes of UBS Commercial Trust 2012-C1 
      (UBS 2012-C1) commercial mortgage pass-through certificates. A detailed 
      list of rating actions follows at the end of this release.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      The affirmations of UBS 2012-C1 are based on the stable performance of 
      the underlying collateral pool. As of the February remittance, three 
      loans (1.3%) are in special servicing, with one additional loan in 
      process of transferring (0.5%). Fitch has designated these four loans 
      (1.8%) as Fitch Loans of Concern.
    

      As of the February 2015 distribution date, the pool's aggregate 
      principal balance has been paid down by 3.7% to $1.28 billion from $1.33 
      billion at issuance. Per the servicer reporting, one loan (0.3% of the 
      pool) is defeased.
    

      The largest loan of the pool (9.4%) is secured by the Dream Hotel 
      Downtown Net Lease Property, which consists of the fee and leasehold 
      interest in a 25,300-sf block parcel as well as the 12-story, 315-room 
      luxury boutique hotel which resides on the parcel and which is subject 
      to two net leases. The property is located in the Chelsea neighborhood 
      of the Meatpacking District of NYC, was built in 1966 and renovated in 
      2011. The two co-terminus master leases have 99 years remaining. Monthly 
      lease payments under the two net leases provide the sole source of cash 
      flow for the payment of debt service on the subject loan. In the first 
      quarter of 2014, the loan was assumed by an affiliate of the Chatwal 
      family, also an affiliate of the hotel operator. As a condition of the 
      assumption, a collateral reserve was established providing for one year 
      of interest-only debt service reserve. As of year-end 2012, the net 
      operating income (NOI) from hotel operations provided for 1.82x coverage 
      on the ground lease payments; however, the coverage ratio declined to 
      1.39x as of year-end 2013 and 1.36x as of year-end 2014 according to 
      hotel operating statements. In the event of a default under the net 
      lease payments, the sponsor may take possession of hotel operations.
    

      The second largest loan (7.1%) is secured by the Civic Opera House, a 
      44-story, 916,258-sf historically landmarked office building located in 
      the Chicago CBD. At issuance the property was 74.8% occupied. The loan 
      has been on the servicer watchlist due to occupancy being adversely 
      affected by a multi-year road construction project in front of the 
      property. The most recent servicer reporting is updated through June 30, 
      2014, with the property reporting occupancy at 88% and a debt service 
      coverage ratio (DSCR) of 1.18x. Fitch expects the year-end 2014 
      financial reporting to reflect a further increase in the (DSCR) as the 
      property achieves stabilization. The tenant roster at the property is 
      diverse with no significant rollover.
    

      Given the recent transfer of the four specially-serviced loans (1.8%), 
      limited information is available about the collateral and performance 
      concerns. Three of the loans (1.3%) are a portfolio of three Holiday Inn 
      Express limited-service hotels located in Cicero, Warners, & East 
      Syracuse, NY. Per the year-end 2013 servicer reporting, all had stable 
      occupancy and cash flow in line with issuance. The fourth loan (0.5%) is 
      an office building with ground-level retail located in the River North 
      neighborhood of the Chicago CBD. No financial information has been 
      reported on this loan since issuance. Fitch will continue to monitor 
      these loans.
    

      RATINGS SENSITIVITIES
    

      All classes maintain Stable Outlooks, due to the overall stable 
      performance of the pool. Additional information on rating sensitivity is 
      available in the report UBS Commercial Mortgage Trust 2012 - C1' (April 
      19, 2012), available at www.fitchratings.com.
    

      Fitch affirms the following classes:
    

      --$23.1 million class A-1 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$105.7 million class A-2 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$657.2 million class A-3 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$96 million class A-AB at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$113.1 million class A-S at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$66.5 million class B at 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$49.9 million class C at 'Asf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$74.9 million class D at 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$26.6 million class E at 'BBsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$23.3 million class F at 'Bsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$995 million interest-only class X-A at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      Fitch does not rate the interest-only class X-B or the $44.9 million 
      class G certificates.
    

      A comparison of the transaction's Representations, Warranties, and 
      Enforcement (RW&E) mechanisms to those of typical RW&Es for the asset 
      class is available in the following report:
    

      --'UBS Commercial Mortgage Trust 2012-C1 -- Appendix' (January 2014).

      transactions is available in the Dec. 10, 2014 report, 'U.S. Fixed-Rate 
      Multiborrower CMBS Surveillance and Re-REMIC Criteria', which is

RATINGS RATIONALE




The ratings on six P&I classes were affirmed because the transaction's 
key metrics, including Moody's loan-to-value (LTV) 
ratio, Moody's stressed debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) and the 
transaction's Herfindahl Index (Herf), are within acceptable 
ranges.




The ratings on three P&I classes were upgraded primarily due to a 
significant increase in defeasance which increased to 26% of the 
current pool balance from 0.3% at the last review, 
as well as an increase in overall pool performance.




The ratings on the IO classes, Classes X-A and X-B, 
were affirmed based on the credit performance (or the weighted average 
rating factor or WARF) of the referenced classes.




Moody's rating action reflects a base expected loss of 2.1% 
of the current balance, compared to 2.7% at Moody's 
last review. Moody's base expected loss plus realized losses is 
now 1.9% of the original pooled balance, compared 
to 2.6% at the last review. Moody's provides 
a current list of base expected losses for conduit and fusion CMBS transactions 
on moodys.com at http://www.moodys.com/viewresearchdoc.aspx?docid=PBS_SF215255.




FACTORS THAT WOULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE OF THE RATING:




The performance expectations for a given variable indicate Moody's forward-looking 
view of the likely range of performance over the medium term. Performance 
that falls outside the given range can indicate that the collateral's 
credit quality is stronger or weaker than Moody's had previously expected.




Factors that could lead to an upgrade of the ratings include a significant 
amount of loan paydowns or amortization, an increase in the pool's 
share of defeasance or an improvement in pool performance.




Factors that could lead to a downgrade of the ratings include a decline 
in the performance of the pool, loan concentration, an increase 
in realized and expected losses from specially serviced and troubled loans 
or interest shortfalls.




METHODOLOGY UNDERLYING THE RATING ACTION




The principal methodology used in these ratings was "Approach to Rating 
US and Canadian Conduit/Fusion CMBS" published in December 2014. 
Please see the Ratings Methodologies page on www.moodys.com 
for a copy of this methodology.




DESCRIPTION OF MODELS USED




Moody's review used the excel-based CMBS Conduit Model, 
which it uses for both conduit and fusion transactions. Credit 
enhancement levels for conduit loans are driven by property type, 
Moody's actual and stressed DSCR, and Moody's property 
quality grade (which reflects the capitalization rate Moody's uses 
to estimate Moody's value). Moody's fuses the conduit 
results with the results of its analysis of investment grade structured 
credit assessed loans and any conduit loan that represents 10% 
or greater of the current pool balance. 




Moody's uses a variation of Herf to measure the diversity of loan 
sizes, where a higher number represents greater diversity. 
Loan concentration has an important bearing on potential rating volatility, 
including the risk of multiple notch downgrades under adverse circumstances. 
The credit neutral Herf score is 40. The pool has a Herf of 20, 
compared to a Herf of 25 at the last review.




DEAL PERFORMANCE




As of the March 11, 2016 distribution date, the transaction's 
aggregate certificate balance has decreased by 8% to $1.22 
billion from $1.33 billion at securitization. The 
certificates are collateralized by 70 mortgage loans ranging in size from 
less than 1% to 9.8% of the pool, with the 
top ten loans constituting 43% of the pool. Seven loans, 
constituting 26% of the pool, have defeased and are secured 
by US government securities.




Twelve loans, constituting 11% of the pool, are on 
the master servicer's watchlist. The watchlist includes loans 
that meet certain portfolio review guidelines established as part of the 
CRE Finance Council (CREFC) monthly reporting package. As part 
of Moody's ongoing monitoring of a transaction, the agency 
reviews the watchlist to assess which loans have material issues that 
could affect performance.




The pool has not experienced any realized losses to date. One loan, 
the Southport and Sheffield loan (for $6.1 million -- 
0.5% of the pool), is currently in special servicing. 
The loan is secured by two mixed use, retail/office buildings totaling 
29,894 SF and located in the Lakeview neighborhood of Chicago, 
Illoinis. The loan was transferred to special servicing in December 
2015 due to ongoing litigation involving the borrower. The loan 
remains current on its debt service payments.




Moody's has assumed a high default probability for four poorly performing 
loans, constituting 1.8% of the pool, and has 
estimated an aggregate loss of $4.0 million (14% 
expected loss on average) from the specially serviced and troubled loans.




Moody's received full year 2014 operating results for 86% of the 
pool. Moody's weighted average conduit LTV is 92%, 
compared to 94% at last review. Moody's conduit component 
excludes loans with structured credit assessments, defeased and 
CTL loans, and specially serviced and troubled loans. Moody's 
net cash flow (NCF) reflects a weighted average 


haircut of 9% to most recently available net operating income (NOI). 
Moody's value reflects a weighted average capitalization rate of 
9.1%.




Moody's actual and stressed conduit DSCRs are 1.42X and 1.10X, 
respectively, compared to 1.42 and 1.09X at the last 
review. Moody's actual DSCR is based on Moody's NCF 
and the loan's actual debt service. Moody's stressed 
DSCR is based on Moody's NCF and a 9.25% stress rate 
the agency applied to the loan balance.




The top three conduit loans represent 22.5% of the pool 
balance. The largest loan is the Dream Hotel Downtown Net Lease 
Loan ($120 million -- 9.8% of the pool), 
which is secured by the borrower's fee simple interest in a parcel of 
land located at 17th Street and 9th Avenue in Chelsea, Manhattan. 
The borrower leased its interest in the collateral to Northquay Properties, 
LLC (Hotel Tenant) and Northglen Properties LLC (Banquet/Conference Space 
Tenant) under two separate Net Leases. The Net Leases are structured 
with step ups in lease payments. Moody's LTV and stressed DSCR 
are 100% and 0.64X, respectively, consistent 
with the last three reviews.




The second largest loan is the Poughkeepsie Galleria Loan ($82 
million -- 6.7% of the pool), which is secured 
by a 691,000 square foot (SF) portion of the 1.2 million 
SF regional mall located in Poughkeepsie, New York (approximately 
70 miles north of New York City). Mall anchors include JCPenney, 
Regal Cinemas, and Dick's Sporting Goods as part of the collateral. 
Anchors not part of the collateral include Macy's, Best Buy, 
Target and Sears. As of December 2015 the property was 95% 
leased. The $82 million loan represents a pari passu portion 
of a total $148 million first mortgage loan. The collateral 
is also encumbered by $21 million of mezzanine debt. Moody's 
LTV and stressed DSCR are 93% and 1.07X, respectively, 
compared to 95% and 1.05X at the last review.




The third largest loan is the Hartfield 21 Loan ($73 million -- 
6.0% of the pool), which is secured by the leasehold 
interest in a class-A mixed use multi-family/office/retail 
development located in center city Hartford, Connecticut. 
As of September 2015, the property had a combined occupancy of 86%. 
Moody's LTV and stressed DSCR are 96% and 1.00X, 
respectively, compared to 101% and 0.95X at the last 
review.




REGULATORY DISCLOSURES




For further specification of Moody's key rating assumptions and sensitivity 
analysis, see the sections Methodology Assumptions and Sensitivity 
to Assumptions of the disclosure form.




The analysis includes an assessment of collateral characteristics and 
performance to determine the expected collateral loss or a range of expected 
collateral losses or cash flows to the rated instruments. As a 
second step, Moody's estimates expected collateral losses or cash 
flows using a quantitative tool that takes into account credit enhancement, 
loss allocation and other structural features, to derive the expected 
loss for each rated instrument.




Moody's did not use any stress scenario simulations in its analysis. 





For ratings issued on a program, series or category/class of debt, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to each rating of a subsequently issued bond or note of the same series 
or category/class of debt or pursuant to a program for which the ratings 
are derived exclusively from existing ratings in accordance with Moody's 
rating practices. For ratings issued on a support provider, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to the credit rating action on the support provider and in relation to 
each particular credit rating action for securities that derive their 
credit ratings from the support provider's credit rating. 
For provisional ratings, this announcement provides certain regulatory 
disclosures in relation to the provisional rating assigned, and 
in relation to a definitive rating that may be assigned subsequent to 
the final issuance of the debt, in each case where the transaction 
structure and terms have not changed prior to the assignment of the definitive 
rating in a manner that would have affected the rating. For further 
information please see the ratings tab on the issuer/entity page for the 
respective issuer on www.moodys.com.




For any affected securities or rated entities receiving direct credit 
support from the primary entity(ies) of this credit rating action, 
and whose ratings may change as a result of this credit rating action, 
the associated regulatory disclosures will be those of the guarantor entity. 
Exceptions to this approach exist for the following disclosures, 
if applicable to jurisdiction: Ancillary Services, Disclosure 
to rated entity, Disclosure from rated entity.




Regulatory disclosures contained in this press release apply to the credit 
rating and, if applicable, the related rating outlook or rating 
review.


Please see www.moodys.com for any updates on changes to 
the lead rating analyst and to the Moody's legal entity that has issued 
the rating.

MCO and MIS also maintain policies and procedures to address the independence of MIS’s ratings and rating processes. Information regarding certain affiliations that may exist between directors of MCO and rated entities, and between entities who hold ratings from MIS and have also publicly reported to the SEC an ownership interest in MCO of more than 5%, is posted annually at www.moodys.com under the heading “Investor Relations — Corporate Governance — Director and Shareholder Affiliation Policy.” Additional terms for Australia only: Any publication into Australia of this document is pursuant to the Australian Financial Services License of MOODY’S affiliate, Moody’s Investors Service Pty Limited ABN 61 003 399 657AFSL 336969 and/or Moody’s Analytics Australia Pty Ltd ABN 94 105 136 972 AFSL 383569 (as applicable).

MOODY’S credit rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a debt obligation of the issuer, not on the equity securities of the issuer or any form of security that is available to retail investors.

Moody’s SF Japan K.K. (“MSFJ”) is a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of MJKK. MSFJ is not a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (“NRSRO”). Therefore, credit ratings assigned by MSFJ are Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings. Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings are assigned by an entity that is not a NRSRO and, consequently, the rated obligation will not qualify for certain types of treatment under U.S. laws. MJKK and MSFJ are credit rating agencies registered with the Japan Financial Services Agency and their registration numbers are FSA Commissioner (Ratings) No. 2 and 3 respectively. MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) hereby disclose that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from JPY200,000 to approximately JPY350,000,000.

Approximately $1.10 Billion of Structured Securities Affected


New York, January 26, 2017 -- Moody's Investors Service has affirmed the ratings on ten classes 
in UBS Commercial Mortgage Trust 2012-C1, Commercial Mortgage 
Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2012-C1 as follows:




Cl. A-3, Affirmed Aaa (sf); previously on Mar 
17, 2016 Affirmed Aaa (sf)

Cl. X-B, Affirmed Ba3 (sf); previously on Mar 
17, 2016 Affirmed Ba3 (sf)




RATINGS RATIONALE




The ratings on the P&I classes were affirmed because the transaction's 
key metrics, including Moody's loan-to-value (LTV) 
ratio, Moody's stressed debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) and the 
transaction's Herfindahl Index (Herf), are within acceptable 
ranges.




The ratings on the IO classes, Classes X-A and X-B, 
were affirmed based on the credit performance (or the weighted average 
rating factor or WARF) of the referenced classes.




Moody's rating action reflects a base expected loss of 2.7% 
of the current balance, compared to 2.1% at Moody's 
last review. Moody's base expected loss plus realized losses is 
now 2.3% of the original pooled balance, compared 
to 1.9% at the last review. Moody's provides 
a current list of base expected losses for conduit and fusion CMBS transactions 
on moodys.com at http://www.moodys.com/viewresearchdoc.aspx?docid=PBS_SF215255.




FACTORS THAT WOULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGS:




The performance expectations for a given variable indicate Moody's forward-looking 
view of the likely range of performance over the medium term. Performance 
that falls outside the given range can indicate that the collateral's 
credit quality is stronger or weaker than Moody's had previously expected.




Factors that could lead to an upgrade of the ratings include a significant 
amount of loan paydowns or amortization, an increase in the pool's 
share of defeasance or an improvement in pool performance.




Factors that could lead to a downgrade of the ratings include a decline 
in the performance of the pool, loan concentration, an increase 
in realized and expected losses from specially serviced and troubled loans 
or interest shortfalls.




METHODOLOGY UNDERLYING THE RATING ACTION




The methodologies used in these ratings were "Approach to Rating US and 
Canadian Conduit/Fusion CMBS" published in December 2014, and "Moody's 
Approach to Rating Large Loan and Single Asset/Single Borrower CMBS" 
published in October 2015. Please see the Rating Methodologies 
page on www.moodys.com for a copy of these methodologies.




DESCRIPTION OF MODELS USED




Moody's review used the excel-based CMBS Conduit Model, 
which it uses for both conduit and fusion transactions. Credit 
enhancement levels for conduit loans are driven by property type, 
Moody's actual and stressed DSCR, and Moody's property 
quality grade (which reflects the capitalization rate Moody's uses 
to estimate Moody's value). Moody's fuses the conduit 
results with the results of its analysis of investment grade structured 
credit assessed loans and any conduit loan that represents 10% 
or greater of the current pool balance.




Moody's uses a variation of Herf to measure the diversity of loan 
sizes, where a higher number represents greater diversity. 
Loan concentration has an important bearing on potential rating volatility, 
including the risk of multiple notch downgrades under adverse circumstances. 
The credit neutral Herf score is 40. The pool has a Herf of 19, 
compared to a Herf of 20 at Moody's last review.




When the Herf falls below 20, Moody's uses the excel-based 
Large Loan Model and then reconciles and weights the results from the 
conduit and large loan models in formulating a rating recommendation. 
The large loan model derives credit enhancement levels based on an aggregation 
of adjusted loan-level proceeds derived from Moody's loan-level 
LTV ratios. Major adjustments to determining proceeds include leverage, 
loan structure and property type. Moody's also further adjusts 
these aggregated proceeds for any pooling benefits associated with loan 
level diversity and other concentrations and correlations.




DEAL PERFORMANCE




As of the January 12, 2017 distribution date, the transaction's 
aggregate certificate balance has decreased by 14% to $1.14 
billion from $1.33 billion at securitization. The 
certificates are collateralized by 68 mortgage loans ranging in size from 
less than 1% to 10.5% of the pool, with the 
top ten loans constituting 46% of the pool. Eight loans, 
constituting 23% of the pool, have defeased and are secured 
by US government securities.




Eight loans, constituting 14% of the pool, are on the 
master servicer's watchlist. The watchlist includes loans 
that meet certain portfolio review guidelines established as part of the 
CRE Finance Council (CREFC) monthly reporting package. As part 
of Moody's ongoing monitoring of a transaction, the agency 
reviews the watchlist to assess which loans have material issues that 
could affect performance.




One loan, constituting less than 1% of the pool, is 
currently in special servicing. The specially serviced loan is 
the Southport and Sheffield Loan ($6.1 million -- 0.5% 
of the pool), which is secured by two mixed-use retail/office 
buildings totaling 29,894 square feet (SF) and located in the Lakeview 
neighborhood of Chicago, Illinois. The loan was transferred 
to special servicing in December 2015 due to ongoing litigation. 
Foreclosure complaints were filed in August 2016.




Moody's has assumed a high default probability for two poorly performing 
loans, constituting less than 1% of the pool, and has 
estimated an aggregate loss of $1.6 million (a 15% 
expected loss based on a 50% probability default) from these troubled 
loans.




Moody's received full year 2015 operating results for 90% of the 
pool and partial year 2016 operating results for 88% of the pool. 
Moody's weighted average conduit LTV is 92%, the same 
as at Moody's last review. Moody's conduit component 
excludes loans with structured credit assessments, defeased and 
CTL loans, and specially serviced and troubled loans. Moody's 
net cash flow (NCF) reflects a weighted average haircut of 8% to 
the most recently available net operating income (NOI). Moody's 
value reflects a weighted average capitalization rate of 9%.




Moody's actual and stressed conduit DSCRs are 1.41X and 1.10X, 
respectively, compared to 1.42X and 1.10X at the last 
review. Moody's actual DSCR is based on Moody's NCF 
and the loan's actual debt service. Moody's stressed 
DSCR is based on Moody's NCF and a 9.25% stress rate 
the agency applied to the loan balance.




The top three conduit loans represent 24% of the pool balance. 
The largest loan is the Dream Hotel Downtown Net Lease Loan ($120 
million -- 10.5% of the pool), which is secured 
by the borrower's fee simple interest in a parcel of land located at 17th 
Street and 9th Avenue in Chelsea, Manhattan. The borrower 
leased its interest in the collateral to Northquay Properties, LLC 
(Hotel Tenant) and Northglen Properties LLC (Banquet/Conference Space 
Tenant) under two separate Net Leases. The Net Leases are structured 
with step ups in lease payments. Moody's LTV and stressed DSCR 
are 99% and 0.64X, respectively, the same as 
at the last review.




The second largest loan is the Poughkeepsie Galleria Loan ($80.7 
million -- 7.1% of the pool), which is secured 
by a 691,000 SF portion of a 1.2 million SF regional mall 
located in Poughkeepsie, New York (approximately 70 miles north 
of New York City). Mall anchors include JCPenney, Regal Cinemas 
and Dick's Sporting Goods as part of the collateral. Anchors not 
part of the collateral include Macy's, Best Buy, Target and 
Sears. As of September 2016, the total mall was 96% 
leased, compared to 95% leased as of December 2015. 
The $82 million loan represents a pari passu portion of a total 
$147 million first mortgage loan. The collateral is also 
encumbered by $21 million of mezzanine debt. Moody's LTV 
and stressed DSCR are 93% and 1.07X, respectively, 
the same as at the last review.




The third largest loan is the Hartford 21 Loan ($72.2 million 
-- 6.3% of the pool), which is secured by the 
leasehold interest in a Class A mixed use multi-family/office/retail 
development located in center city Hartford, Connecticut. 
As of September 2016, the properties had a combined occupancy of 
87%, compared to a combined occupancy of 86% as of 
September 2015. Moody's LTV and stressed DSCR are 94% and 
1.01X, respectively, compared to 96% and 1.00X 
at the last review.




REGULATORY DISCLOSURES




For further specification of Moody's key rating assumptions and sensitivity 
analysis, see the sections Methodology Assumptions and Sensitivity 
to Assumptions of the disclosure form.




The analysis includes an assessment of collateral characteristics and 
performance to determine the expected collateral loss or a range of expected 
collateral losses or cash flows to the rated instruments. As a 
second step, Moody's estimates expected collateral losses or cash 
flows using a quantitative tool that takes into account credit enhancement, 
loss allocation and other structural features, to derive the expected 
loss for each rated instrument.




Moody's did not use any stress scenario simulations in its analysis.

Information regarding certain affiliations that may exist between directors of MCO and rated entities, and between entities who hold ratings from MIS and have also publicly reported to the SEC an ownership interest in MCO of more than 5%, is posted annually at www.moodys.com under the heading “Investor Relations — Corporate Governance — Director and Shareholder Affiliation Policy.” Additional terms for Australia only: Any publication into Australia of this document is pursuant to the Australian Financial Services License of MOODY’S affiliate, Moody’s Investors Service Pty Limited ABN 61 003 399 657AFSL 336969 and/or Moody’s Analytics Australia Pty Ltd ABN 94 105 136 972 AFSL 383569 (as applicable). This document is intended to be provided only to “wholesale clients” within the meaning of section 761G of the Corporations Act 2001. By continuing to access this document from within Australia, you represent to MOODY’S that you are, or are accessing the document as a representative of, a “wholesale client” and that neither you nor the entity you represent will directly or indirectly disseminate this document or its contents to “retail clients” within the meaning of section 761G of the Corporations Act 2001. MOODY’S credit rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a debt obligation of the issuer, not on the equity securities of the issuer or any form of security that is available to retail investors. It would be reckless and inappropriate for retail investors to use MOODY’S credit ratings or publications when making an investment decision. If in doubt you should contact your financial or other professional adviser. Additional terms for Japan only: Moody's Japan K.K. (“MJKK”) is a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of Moody's Group Japan G.K., which is wholly-owned by Moody’s Overseas Holdings Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of MCO. Moody’s SF Japan K.K. (“MSFJ”) is a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of MJKK. MSFJ is not a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (“NRSRO”). Therefore, credit ratings assigned by MSFJ are Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings. Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings are assigned by an entity that is not a NRSRO and, consequently, the rated obligation will not qualify for certain types of treatment under U.S. laws. MJKK and MSFJ are credit rating agencies registered with the Japan Financial Services Agency and their registration numbers are FSA Commissioner (Ratings) No. 2 and 3 respectively. MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) hereby disclose that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from JPY200,000 to approximately JPY350,000,000. MJKK and MSFJ also maintain policies and procedures to address Japanese regulatory requirements.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

                    Global Credit Research - 09 Jun 2017
                









New York, June 09, 2017 -- Moody's Investors Service ("Moody's") has upgraded the 
ratings on eight interest-only (IO) classes from seven US and Canadian 
commercial mortgage-backed securitizations (CMBS) deals, 
downgraded the ratings on 243 IO classes from 236 CMBS deals and withdrawn 
51 interest-only classes from 51 CMBS deals issued by multiple 
issuers. As further described below, the rating actions result 
from the adoption of an updated approach to the rating of structured finance 
interest-only (IO) securities.

RATINGS RATIONALE




Please click on this link http://www.moodys.com/viewresearchdoc.aspx?docid=PBS_SF453781 
for the List of Affected Credit Ratings. This list is an integral 
part of this Press Release and provides, for each of the credit 
ratings covered, Moody's disclosures on the following items:




-Principal Methodologies 




The upgrades of eight CMBS IO classes and the downgrades of 243 CMBS IO 
classes follow the publication of "Moody's Approach to Rating 
Structured Finance Interest-Only (IO) Securities" published 
on 8 June 2017 (the "updated IO Methodology") and reflect 
the rating impact of our updated approach incorporating performance information 
as of the May 2017 remittance dates.




The updated methodology modifies Moody's approach to rating IO securities 
referencing multiple bonds and single or multiple collateral pools with 
realized losses. References made to the exclusion of certain IO 
securities in the previous methodology were removed. In addition, 
a description was added to explain when an IO bond is viewed as having 
effectively matured and results in the withdrawal of the rating.




The updated methodology explains that Moody's will limit the rating 
of an IO security to no more than five notches above the rating of the 
lowest credit quality reference bond or the rating that would be assigned 
based on an assessment of the default probability of the reference pool(s), 
as applicable, and clarifies that the collateral pool's default 
probability typically will be treated as equivalent to Ca(sf) if a loss 
is expected on the pool. The methodology also explains how Moody's 
10-year Idealised Cumulative Loss Rates table will be used to determine 
the rating of IOs referencing multiple bonds and IOs backed by single 
or multiple pools, as well as how the table is used when the loss 
falls between two rating categories.




This press release is not intended to provide a summary of the methodology. 
For a full explanation of the methodology, please consult the updated 
report, now available on www.moodys.com and accessible 
at: https://www.moodys.com/research/Moodys-updates-its-approach-for-rating-structured-finance-interest-only--PR_367970




Ratings on 51 of the interest-only classes from 51 deals were withdrawn 
due to the excess spread due on the IO bond being reduced to zero and 
are treated as having effectively matured.




The upgrades of eight CMBS IO classes were due to the modification of 
Moody's approach to rating IO securities referencing multiple bonds (including 
WAC IOs) to the weighted average of the current credit quality of all 
referenced bonds based on current balances (grossed up for realized losses), 
subject to the constraint of no more than five notches above the lowest 
credit quality referenced bond.




The downgrades on 243 CMBS IO classes were due to (i) the rating limit 
of an IO security to no more than five notches above the lowest credit 
quality referenced bond, (ii) the use of Moody's 10-year 
Idealised Cumulative Loss Rates table to determine the rating of IOs referencing 
multiple bonds and the mapping to the next lower category when the loss 
falls between two rating categories and (iii) principal paydowns of higher 
quality reference classes as of the May 2017 remittance statements.




FACTORS THAT WOULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGS:




An IO class may be subject to ratings upgrades if there is an improvement 
in the credit quality of its referenced classes, subject to the 
limits and provisions of the updated IO methodology.




An IO class may be subject to ratings downgrades if there is (i) a decline 
in the credit quality of the reference classes and/or (ii) paydowns of 
higher quality reference classes, subject to the limits and provisions 
of the updated IO methodology.




REGULATORY DISCLOSURES




For further specification of Moody's key rating assumptions and sensitivity 
analysis, see the sections Methodology Assumptions and Sensitivity 
to Assumptions of the disclosure form.




The analysis includes an assessment of collateral characteristics and 
performance to determine the expected collateral loss or a range of expected 
collateral losses or cash flows to the rated instruments. As a 
second step, Moody's estimates expected collateral losses or cash 
flows using a quantitative tool that takes into account credit enhancement, 
loss allocation and other structural features, to derive the expected 
loss for each rated instrument.




Moody's did not use any stress scenario simulations in its analysis.




For ratings issued on a program, series or category/class of debt, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to each rating of a subsequently issued bond or note of the same series 
or category/class of debt or pursuant to a program for which the ratings 
are derived exclusively from existing ratings in accordance with Moody's 
rating practices. For ratings issued on a support provider, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to the credit rating action on the support provider and in relation to 
each particular credit rating action for securities that derive their 
credit ratings from the support provider's credit rating. 
For provisional ratings, this announcement provides certain regulatory 
disclosures in relation to the provisional rating assigned, and 
in relation to a definitive rating that may be assigned subsequent to 
the final issuance of the debt, in each case where the transaction 
structure and terms have not changed prior to the assignment of the definitive 
rating in a manner that would have affected the rating. For further 
information please see the ratings tab on the issuer/entity page for the 
respective issuer on www.moodys.com.




For any affected securities or rated entities receiving direct credit 
support from the primary entity(ies) of this credit rating action, 
and whose ratings may change as a result of this credit rating action, 
the associated regulatory disclosures will be those of the guarantor entity. 
Exceptions to this approach exist for the following disclosures, 
if applicable to jurisdiction: Ancillary Services, Disclosure 
to rated entity, Disclosure from rated entity.




Regulatory disclosures contained in this press release apply to the credit 
rating and, if applicable, the related rating outlook or rating 
review.




The below contact information is provided for information purposes only. 
Please see the ratings tab of the issuer page at www.moodys.com, 
for each of the ratings covered, Moody's disclosures on the 
lead rating analyst and the Moody's legal entity that has issued

the lead rating analyst and to the Moody's legal entity that has issued 
the rating.

Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of Moody’s Corporation (“MCO”), hereby discloses that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from $1,500 to approximately $2,500,000. MCO and MIS also maintain policies and procedures to address the independence of MIS’s ratings and rating processes. Information regarding certain affiliations that may exist between directors of MCO and rated entities, and between entities who hold ratings from MIS and have also publicly reported to the SEC an ownership interest in MCO of more than 5%, is posted annually at www.moodys.com under the heading “Investor Relations — Corporate Governance — Director and Shareholder Affiliation Policy.” Additional terms for Australia only: Any publication into Australia of this document is pursuant to the Australian Financial Services License of MOODY’S affiliate, Moody’s Investors Service Pty Limited ABN 61 003 399 657AFSL 336969 and/or Moody’s Analytics Australia Pty Ltd ABN 94 105 136 972 AFSL 383569 (as applicable).

MOODY’S credit rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a debt obligation of the issuer, not on the equity securities of the issuer or any form of security that is available to retail investors. It would be reckless and inappropriate for retail investors to use MOODY’S credit ratings or publications when making an investment decision. If in doubt you should contact your financial or other professional adviser. Additional terms for Japan only: Moody's Japan K.K. (“MJKK”) is a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of Moody's Group Japan G.K., which is wholly-owned by Moody’s Overseas Holdings Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of MCO. Moody’s SF Japan K.K. (“MSFJ”) is a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of MJKK. MSFJ is not a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (“NRSRO”). Therefore, credit ratings assigned by MSFJ are Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings. Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings are assigned by an entity that is not a NRSRO and, consequently, the rated obligation will not qualify for certain types of treatment under U.S. laws. MJKK and MSFJ are credit rating agencies registered with the Japan Financial Services Agency and their registration numbers are FSA Commissioner (Ratings) No. 2 and 3 respectively. MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) hereby disclose that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from JPY200,000 to approximately JPY350,000,000. MJKK and MSFJ also maintain policies and procedures to address Japanese regulatory requirements.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

Announcement: Moody's: UBSC 2011-C1 and UBSC 2012-C1 Ratings Unaffected by the Proposed 1700 Market Street A-1 and A-2 Notes Loan Defeasance






                    Global Credit Research - 17 Dec 2015
                









New York, December 17, 2015 -- Moody's Investors Service (Moody's) was informed that 1700 Market Street 
Associates L.P, the Borrower for the 1700 Market Street mortgage 
loan, has elected to defease the loan with US Government Securities. 
The proposed defeasance will become effective upon satisfaction of the 
conditions precedent set forth in the governing documents.




Moody's has reviewed the proposed defeasance transaction. Moody's 
has determined that the proposed defeasance of the A-1 note in 
UBSC 2011-C1 and the A-2 note in UBSC 2012-C1 will 
not, in and of itself, and at this time, result in a 
downgrade or withdrawal of the current ratings to any class of certificates 
rated by Moody's for UBS-Citigroup Commercial Mortgage Trust, 
Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2011-C1 
and UBS Commercial Mortgage Trust 2012-C1, Commercial Mortgage 
Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2012-C1.




Moody's opinion only addresses the credit impact associated with the proposed 
defeasance. Moody's is not expressing any opinion as to whether 
this change has, or could have, other noncredit related effects 
that may have a detrimental impact on the interests of note holders and/or 
counterparties.




Moody's will continue to monitor these ratings. Any change in the 
ratings will be publicly disseminated by Moody's through appropriate media.






This publication does not announce a credit rating action. For 
any credit ratings referenced in this publication, please see the 
ratings tab on the issuer/entity page on www.moodys.com 
for the most updated credit rating action information and rating history.

To the extent permitted by law, MOODY’S and its directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, licensors and suppliers disclaim liability for any direct or compensatory losses or damages caused to any person or entity, including but not limited to by any negligence (but excluding fraud, willful misconduct or any other type of liability that, for the avoidance of doubt, by law cannot be excluded) on the part of, or any contingency within or beyond the control of, MOODY’S or any of its directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, licensors or suppliers, arising from or in connection with the information contained herein or the use of or inability to use any such information. NO WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO THE ACCURACY, TIMELINESS, COMPLETENESS, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE OF ANY SUCH RATING OR OTHER OPINION OR INFORMATION IS GIVEN OR MADE BY MOODY’S IN ANY FORM OR MANNER WHATSOEVER. Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of Moody’s Corporation (“MCO”), hereby discloses that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from $1,500 to approximately $2,500,000. MCO and MIS also maintain policies and procedures to address the independence of MIS’s ratings and rating processes. Information regarding certain affiliations that may exist between directors of MCO and rated entities, and between entities who hold ratings from MIS and have also publicly reported to the SEC an ownership interest in MCO of more than 5%, is posted annually at www.moodys.com under the heading “Investor Relations — Corporate Governance — Director and Shareholder Affiliation Policy.” Additional terms for Australia only: Any publication into Australia of this document is pursuant to the Australian Financial Services License of MOODY’S affiliate, Moody’s Investors Service Pty Limited ABN 61 003 399 657AFSL 336969 and/or Moody’s Analytics Australia Pty Ltd ABN 94 105 136 972 AFSL 383569 (as applicable). This document is intended to be provided only to “wholesale clients” within the meaning of section 761G of the Corporations Act 2001. By continuing to access this document from within Australia, you represent to MOODY’S that you are, or are accessing the document as a representative of, a “wholesale client” and that neither you nor the entity you represent will directly or indirectly disseminate this document or its contents to “retail clients” within the meaning of section 761G of the Corporations Act 2001. MOODY’S credit rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a debt obligation of the issuer, not on the equity securities of the issuer or any form of security that is available to retail investors. It would be reckless and inappropriate for retail investors to use MOODY’S credit ratings or publications when making an investment decision. If in doubt you should contact your financial or other professional adviser. Additional terms for Japan only: Moody's Japan K.K. (“MJKK”) is a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of Moody's Group Japan G.K., which is wholly-owned by Moody’s Overseas Holdings Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of MCO. Moody’s SF Japan K.K. (“MSFJ”) is a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of MJKK. MSFJ is not a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (“NRSRO”). Therefore, credit ratings assigned by MSFJ are Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings. Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings are assigned by an entity that is not a NRSRO and, consequently, the rated obligation will not qualify for certain types of treatment under U.S. laws. MJKK and MSFJ are credit rating agencies registered with the Japan Financial Services Agency and their registration numbers are FSA Commissioner (Ratings) No. 2 and 3 respectively. MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) hereby disclose that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from JPY200,000 to approximately JPY350,000,000. MJKK and MSFJ also maintain policies and procedures to address Japanese regulatory requirements.
