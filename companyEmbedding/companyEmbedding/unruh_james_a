I suffered, like many of us do, from Opiate addiction. I struggled with prescription pain killers for over 3 years...finally hit rock bottom. My wife actually set the initial appointment up, and I arrived at Acacia on new years eve. Since that day, my life has changed. They immediately put me into therapy and gave me suboxone. From that day, I never looked back. I can NOT put into words the gratitude my family and I have for the wonderful group of doctors and therapists that have went above and beyond to ensure I was not alone during my recovery. I would never recommend any other place for help with addiction. We all know you have to really want to be sober, and if that sounds like you then Acacia will save your life. I rate them AAA+American Behavioral ClinicsSusie S. ratedExcellent care, but patients should not be shouted for: practitioners should come to the waiting room.There should not be 8-9 minute waits for one's phone call to be answered.There should be Saturday hours, skipping a weekday, to accommodate those patients with multiple jobs, disabilities requiring others to drive them, and a less harried day for all concerned, and therefore, a more productive one.Water bottles are given in shops: why not in a health facility?Care should be taken that the dosage on a bottle matches real time advice by the doctors.Overall, excellent esprit de corps, but some fine tuning would be appreciated.Why are the preponderance of patients women: because Men are driving us nuts.Samaritan Family Wellness Foundationbarbara.gould.589 ratedThis place is great.  I was de...This place is great.  I was dealing with sick and aging parents, raising 3 children, a full time job, marital stress, and a general feeling of being completely overwhelmed.  I called Samaritan for help and was so impressed with the therapist I worked with.  I am happy to say I am now  centered and enjoying life again!  The advice I received was honest, perceptive and extremely helpful.  I'd recommend this place to anyone!Cindy Milner LCSWMarcia K. ratedCode of ethics violations. misinteperts tells what problem is but doesnt help you with it.says she does all the work
