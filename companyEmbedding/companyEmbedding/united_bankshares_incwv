            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

Data Format: CSV

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

History[edit]
1980s[edit]
United Bank began as a one-office bank in Parkersburg, West Virginia in 1982.[6]
United Bankshares acquired First National Bank of Moundsville, West Virginia, and Half Dollar Trust and Savings Bank of Wheeling, West Virginia, in 1987.[7]
United Bankshares acquired Bank First in 1990.[6]
1990s[edit]
United Bankshares bought First Commercial Bank of Arlington, Virginia, in 1995, giving United Bank its first branches in Virginia.[8]
United Bankshares acquired West Virginia-based First Empire Federal Savings and Loan in 1996.[9] They also merged with Eagle Bancorp in the same year.[10]
First Patriot Bankshares of Reston, Virginia, was acquired in 1997,[11] which gave United Bank branches in Fairfax County, Loudoun County, and Prince William County, Virginia.[12] Later in 1997, United also purchased George Mason BankShares Inc. of Fairfax, Virginia for $215 million in stock.[13] This acquisition brought United's assets to over $3.5 billion.[13]
In 1998, United Bankshares acquired FedOne Bank of Wheeling, West Virginia.[14]
2000s[edit]
United Bankshares acquired Century National Bank of Washington, D.C., in 2001.[15]
Sequioa Bancshares was acquired by United Bankshares in April 2003.[16]
In 2007, United Bankshares acquired Premier Community Bankshares, and its banking subsidiaries, The Marathon Bank of Winchester, Virginia; Rockingham Heritage Bank of Harrisonburg, Virginia; and Premier Bank of West Virginia.[17]
2010s[edit]
Centra Bank of Morgantown, West Virginia, was acquired by United Bankshares in 2011.[18][19]
United Bankshares acquired Virginia Commerce Bancorp in January 2013.[20]
On November 9, 2015, United Bankshares announced that it would acquire Bank of Georgetown.[21] The acquisition made United Bank the 41st largest bank in the United States.[21] The US$269 million acquisition was completed on June 6, 2016.[22]
As of December 31, 2015, United Bankshares said it was the eighth largest bank in the Washington metropolitan area in terms of percentage of total market share.[6]
On August 28, 2016, United Bankshares announced that it had agreed to acquire Cardinal Bank for $912 million.[23] Upon completion of the acquisition, United Bank would be the largest headquartered company in West Virginia[24] and the 32nd largest banking company in the United States.[23] Cardinal Bank's shareholders retained Harwood Feffer LLP to investigate possible breaches of fiduciary duty and other violations of law by Cardinal Bank's board of directors in connection with the proposed acquisition.[25] Weislaw LLP also investigated.[26] The acquisition of Cardinal was completed in April 2017, which made United Bank the 38th largest banking company in the country based on market capitalization.[27]
In August 2016, United Bankshares' Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Richard M. Adams Sr. discussed his merger-and-acquisitions, saying, "It's all about people and paper. The bottom line is, if you are in a merger-and-acquisitions strategy and there are target markets where you want to be, find out who is involved in those banks and build relationships with them. That is the human aspect. The other thing is paper. When you make acquisitions, they take stock in your company. So the quality of your stock is very important."[2]

History[edit]
1980s[edit]
United Bank began as a one-office bank in Parkersburg, West Virginia in 1982.[6]
United Bankshares acquired First National Bank of Moundsville, West Virginia, and Half Dollar Trust and Savings Bank of Wheeling, West Virginia, in 1987.[7]
United Bankshares acquired Bank First in 1990.[6]
1990s[edit]
United Bankshares bought First Commercial Bank of Arlington, Virginia, in 1995, giving United Bank its first branches in Virginia.[8]
United Bankshares acquired West Virginia-based First Empire Federal Savings and Loan in 1996.[9] They also merged with Eagle Bancorp in the same year.[10]
First Patriot Bankshares of Reston, Virginia, was acquired in 1997,[11] which gave United Bank branches in Fairfax County, Loudoun County, and Prince William County, Virginia.[12] Later in 1997, United also purchased George Mason BankShares Inc. of Fairfax, Virginia for $215 million in stock.[13] This acquisition brought United's assets to over $3.5 billion.[13]
In 1998, United Bankshares acquired FedOne Bank of Wheeling, West Virginia.[14]
2000s[edit]
United Bankshares acquired Century National Bank of Washington, D.C., in 2001.[15]
Sequioa Bancshares was acquired by United Bankshares in April 2003.[16]
In 2007, United Bankshares acquired Premier Community Bankshares, and its banking subsidiaries, The Marathon Bank of Winchester, Virginia; Rockingham Heritage Bank of Harrisonburg, Virginia; and Premier Bank of West Virginia.[17]
2010s[edit]
Centra Bank of Morgantown, West Virginia, was acquired by United Bankshares in 2011.[18][19]
United Bankshares acquired Virginia Commerce Bancorp in January 2013.[20]
On November 9, 2015, United Bankshares announced that it would acquire Bank of Georgetown.[21] The acquisition made United Bank the 41st largest bank in the United States.[21] The US$269 million acquisition was completed on June 6, 2016.[22]
As of December 31, 2015, United Bankshares said it was the eighth largest bank in the Washington metropolitan area in terms of percentage of total market share.[6]
On August 28, 2016, United Bankshares announced that it had agreed to acquire Cardinal Bank for $912 million.[23] Upon completion of the acquisition, United Bank would be the largest headquartered company in West Virginia[24] and the 32nd largest banking company in the United States.[23] Cardinal Bank's shareholders retained Harwood Feffer LLP to investigate possible breaches of fiduciary duty and other violations of law by Cardinal Bank's board of directors in connection with the proposed acquisition.[25] Weislaw LLP also investigated.[26] The acquisition of Cardinal was completed in April 2017, which made United Bank the 38th largest banking company in the country based on market capitalization.[27]
In August 2016, United Bankshares' Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Richard M. Adams Sr. discussed his merger-and-acquisitions, saying, "It's all about people and paper. The bottom line is, if you are in a merger-and-acquisitions strategy and there are target markets where you want to be, find out who is involved in those banks and build relationships with them. That is the human aspect. The other thing is paper. When you make acquisitions, they take stock in your company. So the quality of your stock is very important."[2]

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

History[edit]
1980s[edit]
United Bank began as a one-office bank in Parkersburg, West Virginia in 1982.[6]
United Bankshares acquired First National Bank of Moundsville, West Virginia, and Half Dollar Trust and Savings Bank of Wheeling, West Virginia, in 1987.[7]
United Bankshares acquired Bank First in 1990.[6]
1990s[edit]
United Bankshares bought First Commercial Bank of Arlington, Virginia, in 1995, giving United Bank its first branches in Virginia.[8]
United Bankshares acquired West Virginia-based First Empire Federal Savings and Loan in 1996.[9] They also merged with Eagle Bancorp in the same year.[10]
First Patriot Bankshares of Reston, Virginia, was acquired in 1997,[11] which gave United Bank branches in Fairfax County, Loudoun County, and Prince William County, Virginia.[12] Later in 1997, United also purchased George Mason BankShares Inc. of Fairfax, Virginia for $215 million in stock.[13] This acquisition brought United's assets to over $3.5 billion.[13]
In 1998, United Bankshares acquired FedOne Bank of Wheeling, West Virginia.[14]
2000s[edit]
United Bankshares acquired Century National Bank of Washington, D.C., in 2001.[15]
Sequioa Bancshares was acquired by United Bankshares in April 2003.[16]
In 2007, United Bankshares acquired Premier Community Bankshares, and its banking subsidiaries, The Marathon Bank of Winchester, Virginia; Rockingham Heritage Bank of Harrisonburg, Virginia; and Premier Bank of West Virginia.[17]
2010s[edit]
Centra Bank of Morgantown, West Virginia, was acquired by United Bankshares in 2011.[18][19]
United Bankshares acquired Virginia Commerce Bancorp in January 2013.[20]
On November 9, 2015, United Bankshares announced that it would acquire Bank of Georgetown.[21] The acquisition made United Bank the 41st largest bank in the United States.[21] The US$269 million acquisition was completed on June 6, 2016.[22]
As of December 31, 2015, United Bankshares said it was the eighth largest bank in the Washington metropolitan area in terms of percentage of total market share.[6]
On August 28, 2016, United Bankshares announced that it had agreed to acquire Cardinal Bank for $912 million.[23] Upon completion of the acquisition, United Bank would be the largest headquartered company in West Virginia[24] and the 32nd largest banking company in the United States.[23] Cardinal Bank's shareholders retained Harwood Feffer LLP to investigate possible breaches of fiduciary duty and other violations of law by Cardinal Bank's board of directors in connection with the proposed acquisition.[25] Weislaw LLP also investigated.[26] The acquisition of Cardinal was completed in April 2017, which made United Bank the 38th largest banking company in the country based on market capitalization.[27]
In August 2016, United Bankshares' Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Richard M. Adams Sr. discussed his merger-and-acquisitions, saying, "It's all about people and paper. The bottom line is, if you are in a merger-and-acquisitions strategy and there are target markets where you want to be, find out who is involved in those banks and build relationships with them. That is the human aspect. The other thing is paper. When you make acquisitions, they take stock in your company. So the quality of your stock is very important."[2]
