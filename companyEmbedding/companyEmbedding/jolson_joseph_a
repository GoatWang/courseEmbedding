Good results have been obtained under conditions of short circuit, high temperature exposure, and resistive discharge. The highly porous nickel matrix has been shown to accommodate a discharge reaction product up to a current density of 4 mA/sq cm.

The addition of an additive to I2(P2VP) cathodes has been found to result in average cell currents of 120 microamps/sq cm. A pelletized cathode design has allowed the fabrication of thin prismatic and button cells which can deliver a continuous 200 microamps/sq cm at 25 C. The prismatic design has an energy density of 0.5 Wh/cu cm and a power density of 2 mW/cu cm.

Recently, the Mine Safety Appliances Company, Inc. Escort Elf personal sampling pump, which incorporates a flow measurement device and a closed-loop feedback system designed to maintain constant volumetric flow over a wide range of environmental conditions, was approved for coal mine dust sampling. The objective of this article is to show the effect that changes in altitude, sample inlet loading, and temperature have on the volumetric flow rate of this pump. The laboratory method used involved measuring flow rate with a wet test meter under different simulated altitudes using a sealed test chamber and a vacuum pump. Increases in sample inlet loading were simulated by partially obstructing the pump inlet. An environmental chamber was used to test for the effects of temperature. All laboratory tests were performed over flow rates ranging from 1.0 to 3.0 L/min. Some field data were also obtained. The test results show that the pump maintains volumetric flow rate, within ± 5 percent of set point, at altitudes up to 10,000 ft. Similar changes in volumetric flow rate were observed as sample inlet loading was increased to 20 and 30 inches of water and as temperature was varied from 4° to 40°C. Setting the flow rate of the pump was found to be particularly easy and convenient. It was concluded that the personal sampling pump which was recently approved for coal mine dust sampling maintains volumetric flow within ±5 percent over a wide range of altitudes, sample inlet loadings, and temperatures.

Good results have been obtained under conditions of short circuit, high temperature exposure, and resistive discharge. The highly porous nickel matrix has been shown to accommodate a discharge reaction product up to a current density of 4 mA/sq cm. The cells have application to medical instrumentation including cardiac pacemakers and drug infusion pumps.
