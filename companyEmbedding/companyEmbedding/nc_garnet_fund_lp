Form 10-K
A 10-K is a comprehensive summary report of a company's performance that must be submitted annually to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Typically, the 10-K contains much more detail than the annual report. It includes information such as company history, organizational structure, equity, holdings, earnings per share, subsidiaries, etc. 

The 10-K must be filed within 60 days (it used to be 90 days) after the end of the fiscal year.
Form 10-K/A
Amended Form 10-K
Form 10-Q
The SEC form 10-Q is a comprehensive report of a company's performance that must be submitted quarterly by all public companies to the Securities and Exchange Commission. In the 10-Q, firms are required to disclose relevant information regarding their financial position. The form must be submitted on time, and the information should be available to all interested parties. 

The 10-Q is due 35 days (it used to be 45 days) after each of the first three fiscal quarters. There is no filing after the fourth quarter because that is when the 10-K is filed.
Form 10-Q/A
Amended Form 10-Q
Form 3
A document that must be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) by an insider affiliated with a public company's operation or by any investor owning 10% or more of the company's outstanding shares

This document must be filed with the SEC no later than 10 days after an insider becomes affiliated with a company, and it must be filed for each company in which a person is an insider, regardless of whether or not the insider has an equity position in the company at that time.
Form 3/A
Amended Form 3
Form 4
A Form 4 is a document that must be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) whenever there is a material change in the holdings of company insiders. Insiders required to submit a Form 4 include directors and officers of the company as well as any shareholders owning 10% or more of the company's outstanding stock.

This two-page document covers any buy-and-sell orders on the open market as well as the exercise of company stock options. A Form 4 is mandatory within two business days starting from the end of the day the material transaction occurred. This filing is related to Form 3 and the Form 5, which also cover changes to the company insider holdings.
Form 4/A
Amended Form 4
Form 5
The annual statement of beneficial ownership of securities.
Form 5/A
Amended Form 5
Form 8-K
An 8-K is a report of unscheduled material events or corporate changes at a company that could be of importance to the shareholders or the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

Examples of events reported on an 8-K include acquisition, bankruptcy, resignation of directors, or a change in the fiscal year. Also known as Form 8k.
Form D
A filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) required for companies that are selling securities in reliance on a Regulation D exemption or Section 4(6) exemption provisions. 

Form D is a brief notice of a company's executive officers and stock promoters, in lieu of the regular reports required when no exemption under Regulation D exists. 

Form D must be filed no later than 15 days after the first sale of securities.

Form D is also known as the Notice of Sale of Securities and is a requirement under Regulation D, Section 4(6) and/or the Uniform Limited Offering Exemption of the Securities Exchange Act of 1933. 

This act, often referred to as the "truth in securities" law, requires that these registration forms, providing essential facts, are filed to disclose important information upon registration of a company's securities. This helps the SEC achieve the objectives of this act - requiring investors to receive significant information regarding securities offered and prohibiting fraud in the sale of the offered securities.
Form D/A
Amended Form D
Form DEF 14A
A filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that must be filed by or on behalf of a registrant when a shareholder vote is required. SEC Form DEF 14A is most commonly used in conjunction with an annual meeting proxy. The form should provide security holders with sufficient information to allow them to make an informed vote at an upcoming security holders' meeting or to authorize a proxy to vote on their behalf. It includes information about the date, time and place of the meeting of security holders; revocability of proxy; dissenter's right of appraisal; persons making the solicitation; direct or indirect interest of certain persons in matters to be acted upon; modification or exchange of securities; financial statements; voting procedures; and other details. 

All other filed by non-management definitive proxy statements - typically an annual meeting proxy.

Form DEF 14A, which is also known as "definitive proxy statement", is required under Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. This form is filed with the SEC when a definitive proxy statement is given to shareholders and helps the SEC ensure that shareholders' rights are upheld.
Form S-1
The SEC form S-1 is the initial registration form for new securities required by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for public companies. Any security that meets the criteria must have an S-1 filing before shares can be listed on a national exchange. 

Form S-1 requires companies to provide information on the planned use of capital proceeds, detail the current business model and competition, as well provide a a brief prospectus of the planned security itself, offering price methodology, and any dilution that will occur to other listed securities. The SEC also requires the disclosure of any material business dealings between the company and its directors and outside counsel. 

Form S-1 is also known as the "Registration Statement Under the Securities Exchange Act of 1933". 

Investors can view S-1 filings online to perform due diligence on new offerings prior to their issue. The form is sometimes amended as material information changes or general market conditions cause a delay in the offering. 

The Securities Exchange Act of 1933, often referred to as the "truth in securities" law, requires that these registration forms are filed to disclose important information upon registration of a company's securities. This helps the SEC achieve the objectives of this act, which is requiring investors to receive significant information regarding securities offered, and to prohibit fraud in the sale of the offered securities. 

A less rigid registration form is the S-3, which is for companies that don't have the same ongoing reporting requirements.

Gemstones - Garnet



 
SP-14-95



Garnet


  

Garnet, the January birthstone, derived its name from the Latin word granatus, meaning like a 
grain, which refers to the mode of occurrence wherein crystals resemble grains or seeds embedded 
in the matrix. Garnet is a family of minerals having similar physical and crystalline properties. 
They all have the same general chemical formula, 

, 
where A can be calcium, 
magnesium, ferrous iron, or manganese, and B can be aluminum, ferric iron, or chromium, or in 
rare instances, titanium. 


The formulas and names of common garnet species are:





  Some rare species of garnet are known that illustrate the wide range of substitution that the garnet 
crystal structure can accommodate. They include:







  There are a number of trade and variety names for garnet, most of these names are for particular 
colors of a specie. Hessonite is the variety name for a fine orange, cinnamon brown, or pinkish 
variety of grossularite, while tsavorite is the trade name for fine dark green grossularite. Melanite 
is a black titanium bearing variety of andradite and demantoid is a rich green variety.  Malaya is a 
trade name for a pyrope-spessartite that varies in color from red, through shades of orange and 
brownish orange to peach and pink. Rhodolite is a purplish red pyrope-almandite solid solution 
garnet. Fine-quality pyrope garnets from Czechoslovakia are often called Bohemian garnets. 
Almandite and almandite-pyrope solid solution garnets are the best abrasive types, but andradite, 
grossularite, and pyrope also are used. All species of garnet have been used as gemstones.

Garnet displays the greatest variety of color of any mineral, occurring in every color except blue. 
For example, grossularite can be colorless, white, gray, yellow, yellowish green, various shades of 
green, brown, pink, reddish, or black. Andradite garnet can be yellow-green, green, greenish 
brown, orangy yellow, brown, grayish black or black.  Pyrope is commonly purplish red, purplish 
red, orangy red, crimson, or dark red; and almandite is deep red, brownish red, brownish black or 
violet-red.  Spessartite garnet can be red, reddish orange, orange, yellow-brown, reddish brown, or 
blackish brown. A few garnets exhibit a color-change phenomenon. They are one color when
viewed in natural light and another color when viewed in incandescent light.


The use of garnets as a gem or gemstone can be traced to prehistoric times. However, the first 
industrial use of garnet appears to have been as coated sandpaper manufactured in the United 
States by Henry Hudson Barton (founder of Barton Mines Corp.) in 1878. Its use has grown from 
that single sample of garnet coated sandpaper, to world industrial uses of more than 110,000 tons 
per year. In 1994, United States production of industrial garnet was valued at about $14 million, 
while gem garnet production was valued at only about $233,000.


Many deposits within the United States produce fine gem-quality garnets and three deposits are 
mined for industrial garnet. A State-by-State review is presented below.

Alaska.--Garnets from deposits along the Stikine River, often called "Wrangell garnet" after the 
nearest town which is located on Wrangell Island, are famous as mineral specimens because of 
their near perfect crystalline form. The garnets have limited use as gemstones because of their deep 
red color, however some cabochons are cut from them.

Arizona.--Arizona is one of five States that has commercial production of gem garnets. Arizona's 
gem garnet is red pyrope from two locations in the extreme northern portion of Apache County on 
the Navajo Indian Reservation. One location is at Garnet Ridge which is about 8 km west of the 
town of Mexican Water, and the other location is in Buell Park on the Arizona and New Mexico 
border, about 16 km north of Fort Defiance. Faceted stones cut from materials from these locations 
average 1/2 to 1-1/2 carats in size, but stones as large as 5 carats are known from these locations. 
Additionally, fine-quality andradite specimens, some suitable for cutting, are available from an 
area near Stanley in Graham Co.

California.--Gem- and specimen-quality white to pale green grossularite garnet occurs on Indian 
Creek in Siskiyou County and along Traverse Creek near Georgetown in Eldorado County. Other 
locations for these types of grossularites are the south side of Watts Valley in Fresno County, near 
Selma in Tulare County, near Big Bar in Butte County and near El Toro in Orange County. Some 
of the finest quality spessartite garnet known come from pegmatites in San Diego County.  
Spessartites have been found on Gem Hill near Mesa Grande and in mines in the Rincon and Pala 
Districts. The most productive area with the finest quality garnets is on the western side of Hatfield 
Creek Valley near Romona. Near Indian Head Hill in San Diego County is a deposit of fine-quality 
hessonite garnet, and another deposit is near Dos Cabezas.

Colorado.--Faceting-grade spessartite garnets can be found in the gas cavities in the rhyolite flow 
on Ruby Mountain near Nathrop, Chaffee County.  Large specimen-grade garnets are available at 
the abandoned Salida Copper Mine.

Connecticut.--Garnet in mica schist near Roxbury and Roxbury Falls in Litchfield County was 
once mined, although not recently, for use in abrasive applications and for mineral specimens.  The 
andradite garnet was found as well-formed dodecahedral crystals that separate easily from the host 
schist.

Idaho.--Alluvial deposits of almandite garnet were discovered in the early 1880's near Fernwood 
in Benewah County, but commercial gem and industrial mining did not start until the early 1940's. 
The deposits are on Emerald, Carpenter, and Meadow Creeks about 6.4 km from a mica-garnet 
schist formation. The garnet-bearing gravels are about 1 m to about 1.2 m
 thick and contain 8% to 15% garnet.  These deposits are the basis of the largest industrial garnet 
mine in the nation and also produce gem garnet.  Additionally, star garnets are produced  from the 
placers of Purdue Creek in  Latah County.


Idaho's deposits also are the only ones in the world, besides India, that produces significant 
amounts of star garnets. These almandite garnets are translucent, purplish-red stones that show 
four- or six-ray stars when cabochon cut, or are transparent, deep red stones that can be faceted. 
The asterism is the result of silky rutile inclusions.


Gem-quality garnets also are produced commercially from an area of the Little North Fork and 
North Fork of the Clearwater River in Clearwater County. They range from purplish rose-red to a 
highly prized "special pink."  Gem-quality garnets occur at a number of other locations in Idaho 
and are periodically mined by hobbyists or professional collectors for the gemstone market.

Montana. -- Several alluvial deposits of almandite-pyrope garnet are located on the drainages of 
the Ruby River in Madison County. One such deposit, the Alder Gulch deposit, is in the alluvial 
fan formed where Alder Gulch joins the Ruby River Valley. The deposit contains about 40 million 
tons of old placer gold tailings that grade 4.5% almandite-pyrope garnet. The alluvium consists of 
high-energy, fluvial, well-rounded material, approximately 50% of which is +9 mm in size. The 
source of garnet along the Ruby River is highly
metamorphosed Archean rocks in the Tobacco Root and Greenhom Mountain Ranges to the east. 
The garnets are present mostly as broken fragments of crystals which were originally as much as 
several centimeters in diameter.  Some of the garnets from this industrial garnet deposit are of gem 
quality.


Bright red and orange red, to reddish-pink pyrope-almandite garnets are found associated with 
sapphires in the gravels of the Missouri River near Helena in Lewis and Clark County.

Nevada.--An alluvial deposit of almandite garnet is found along Hampton Creek Canyon in White 
Pine County about 3 km from the mouth of the canyon. No production history is available for the 
deposit. The source of the garnet is quartz-garnet-mica-staurolite schist that forms a portion of  the 
walls of the canyon.


Spessartine garnets can be found at several locations in White Pine County.  Most of the dark 
brown crystals are of interest only as specimen, but a few will cut very small clear stones.

New Hampshire.--A garnet deposit is located near North Wilmont in Merrimack County, where 
small alrnandite crystals are found in a biotite, quartz, and albite feldspar matrix. The crystals 
range up to about 19 mm in diameter but average only 6 to 10 mm in diameter.

New York.--Deposits of industrial garnet are found at two locations in New York. In the Gore 
Mountain area, industrial garnet is mined as the primary product; and near the town of Willsboro, 
byproduct of it is recovered as wollastonite mining.


The deposit near Gore Mountain is an almandite-bearing diorite of uncertain, igneous or 
metamorphic origin.  The garnet is present as imperfectly developed crystals surrounded by a rim 
of coarsely crystalline hornblende. The crystals range from about 1 millimeter to almost 1 meter in 
diameter but average about 100 millimeters in diameter. The garnet has a pronounced laminated 
structure, which enables it to naturally break into thin plates from about 2 to 6 millimeters in 
thickness. Garnet fragments maintain this platy particle shape even as they are crushed smaller and 
smaller.


These same deposits in Warren County contain good to fine quality facet-grade garnets. The 
garnet is a solid solution of pyrope-almandite-grossularite that results in a pleasant deep brownish-red 
material which often has an orange cast. Beautiful small stones can be cut, but larger stones 
are too dark to be attractive.

North Carolina.--Large deposits of almandite and rhodolite garnet of gem and abrasive quality are 
known in Clay, Jackson, Macon, Madison, and Burke Counties. Abrasive-grade garnet was 
produced from some of these deposits from 1900 to about 1926, but no production has been 
recorded recently.  The deposit of almandite garnet in Clay County is in a hornblende gneiss at 
Penland Bald on Buck Creek.


Fine red colored, gem-quality pyrope garnets have been found in the wastes from placer gold 
operations in Burke, McDowell, and Alexander Counties.  Rose-pink rhodolite garnets are 
recovered from gravels in Cowee Creek near Franklin, and Mason's Branch near Iotla, both in 
Macon County. Rhodolite can be found in situ on Mason Mountain.

Pennsylvania.--Almandite garnet crystals are found in a quartzose mica schist about 1.6 km west 
of Chelsea in Delaware County. Near the surface the schist is badly weathered and the garnets, 
which comprise as much as 75% of the rock locally but average much less, are easily recovered.  
Abrasive-grade garnet was produced from this deposit prior to 1900, but no production has been 
recorded since the turn of the century.


Small trapezohedral crystals of almandite garnet are scattered through-out a badly decomposed 
gneiss near Chester Heights, also in Delaware County. An attempt was made to mine this deposit 
years ago by means of a shaft and underground workings.

Utah.--Large specimen-grade, apple-green grossularite garnets have been found in western Beaver 
County. Two locations southeast of Mexican Hat, San Juan County produce pyrope garnets 
similar to the bright red pyropes from Arizona and New Mexico.

Virginia.--A deposit of garnet is located on a steep bluff on the northeast side of the Tyle River 
about 6.5 km south of Arrington in Nelson County.  The small, dull-red garnets are found in a 
sericitic schist. Attempts were made to mine the deposit in the past, but there is no record of 
commercial production.  


Two mines in Amelia County account
for the majority of the production of gem-quality garnet, they are the Morefield and Rutherford. 
The spessartine from these mines, primarily the Rutherford, are etched-crystal masses and fragments, 
not individual perfect crystals. The pieces range from pea size to as large as a grapefruit. In 1991, 
a single piece, dubbed the Rutherford Lady, was found that weighed more than 2,800 carats. Color 
varies from a fantastic light pure orange, almost yellow to shades of red-orange, red, and brownish-red, 
but the orange overtone always is present.  


U.S. production of gem-grade garnet will continue to increase and additional deposits will be 
brought into production in the coming years.

	Behrman Capital Acquires Majority Interest in Brooks Equipment Company, Inc. 

Investment in Fire Product Distribution Company
Third For Behrman Capital’s New $518 Million Buyout Fund
December 3, 1998
Behrman Capital, a private investment firm focusing on emerging growth companies, today announced that it has become the majority shareholder of Brooks Equipment Company, Inc. (“Brooks”), the premier wholesale distributor of industrial fire protection equipment for the first response segment of the fire protection industry.
Founded over 55 years ago in San Francisco and relocated to Charlotte, North Carolina in 1970, Brooks has a long history as a market leader in a recession-resistant industry. Via its 20 distribution centers located throughout the United States, Brooks provides inventory outsourcing services and just-in-time availability for a wide range of equipment, parts, and supplies.
This transaction, which has a total value of $70 million, marks the third equity investment for Behrman Capital II L.P. The fund closed in January 1998 with total committed capital of $518 million.
“We are very pleased with the partnership we are announcing today,” said Richard Fairclough, President of Brooks. “We look forward to working closely with Behrman Capital, which has invaluable financial and operating expertise, as we continue to focus on serving the needs of our current customers, adding new products to our distribution network and pursuing new business opportunities.”
Grant G. Behrman, a Managing Partner of Behrman Capital stated, “We are extremely pleased with this investment.
