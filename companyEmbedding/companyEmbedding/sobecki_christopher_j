NitroMed Announces the Appointment of Christopher J. Sobecki to its Board of Directors






BIOWIRE2K


May 17, 2006 04:29 PM Eastern Daylight Time



				LEXINGTON, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 17, 2006--NitroMed, Inc. (NASDAQ: NTMD) announced today that Christopher J. Sobecki has been appointed to its Board of Directors. Mr. Sobecki is currently a Managing Director of The Invus Group, LLC ("Invus"), a New York based private equity and investment management firm with ownership in NitroMed. With this appointment, NitroMed now has nine board members.  Mr. Sobecki joined Invus Group in 1989, and has served on the Board of Directors for numerous companies in which Invus has invested. He is currently a board member of Weight Watchers International, Inc., GoldenSource Corporation and Eduventures, LLC. He holds a B.S. in Industrial Engineering from Purdue University and an M.B.A. from the Harvard Business School. 

 Dr. Jerry N. Karabelas, NitroMed's Chairman and interim Chief Executive Officer, commented, "On behalf of the entire NitroMed board and management team, we welcome Chris and look forward to his contributions toward our primary objective of growing and expanding upon the BiDil franchise, with the goal of maximizing shareholder value."  About NitroMed  NitroMed, Inc. of Lexington, Massachusetts is an emerging pharmaceutical company and the maker of BiDil(R) (isosorbide dinitrate/hydralazine hydrochloride), an orally administered medicine available in the United States for the treatment of heart failure in self-identified black patients. In this population, BiDil is indicated as an adjunct to current standard therapies such as ACE inhibitors and/or beta blockers. There is little experience in patients with New York Heart Association class IV heart failure. BiDil was approved in June 2005 by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, primarily on the basis of efficacy data from the Company's landmark African American Heart Failure Trial (A-HeFT). BiDil is marketed by NitroMed through a nationwide, dedicated contract sales force.  Forward Looking Statements  Statements in this press release about future expectations, plans and prospects for the Company, including the Company's expectations regarding the market potential of its lead product, BiDil, and any new formulations of BiDil, constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including risks relating to: the Company's ability to successfully develop, obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize new formulations of BiDil; patient, physician and third-payer acceptance of BiDil as a safe and effective therapeutic; the Company's ability to maintain the necessary sales, marketing and manufacturing capabilities to commercialize BiDil; the Company's ability to obtain the substantial additional funding required to conduct manufacturing, marketing and sales of BiDil; unanticipated difficulties in maintaining regulatory approvals to market and sell BiDil; adverse side effects experienced by patients taking BiDil; the Company's ability to obtain or maintain intellectual property protection and required licenses; unanticipated operating expenses for the remainder of fiscal year 2006 and other factors discussed in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2006, which has been filed with the SEC. In addition, the forward-looking statements included in this press release represent the Company's views as of the date of this release. The Company anticipates that subsequent events and developments will cause the Company's views to change. However, while the Company may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, the Company specifically disclaims any obligation to do so. These forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing the Company's views as of any date subsequent to the date of this release.  For full prescribing information, visit: www.BiDil.com.  BiDil is a registered trademark of NitroMed, Inc.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/22/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

See what people like you are saying about BeenVerified







Natasha, Oklahoma
Nursing Student
"My daughter recently went out for soccer. I decided it would be a good idea to run another player’s father through BeenVerified. Turns out this guy had been charged with indecent exposure and was on parole."


Maryann, New Jersey
Analyst
"I used BeenVerified to check into a guy that I had met online. It turns out he had lied to me about where he lived and his family. Needless to say, thanks to BV I severed contact with him and have not heard from him since. Thank you BV!"


Bob M, New Jersey
Retired Detective
"I am retired and have a ministry helping the dying and sick. I found a son and the mother was dying of cancer. She held on waiting for her son who had not been in touch for years."


Rhonda, Missouri
Caring Mom
"I'm a single mother dating online and I use BeenVerified to help protect my family!"









More Testimonials





From the Press
Gizmodo.com
"It found my photos on Flickr, my Amazon wishlist, my public Foursquare records, Vimeo, Picassa, and Stumbleupon accounts. It grabbed approximately twelve bajillion photos of me (with many, many false positives) and even more web links."


From the Press
U.S. News & World Report
"BeenVerified easily and inexpensively provides access to public records information through its website and several mobile phone applications. No longer are large corporations the only ones who can afford background checks."


From the Press
NBC 6 Miami
"Instant information… Court documents, mortgage deeds, criminal records right in the palm of your hand."
