Our Wave™ Series washer is loaded with some hard-hitting innovations like WaveForce™ technology, which combines rapid drum movement with powerful water jets for great cleaning. It's also gentle on your utility bill with smart options like ColdWash™, which gives you warm water performance with cold water savings.Design, features and specifications subject to change without notice.

If you need help or have a question for Customer Service, please visit the Help Section.HardwareWhether you're putting on a more reliable knob on a front door that sticks a bit, putting in a remote opener on the garage door to keep from getting wet when it rains, putting in a completely new bathroom as part of a contracting job, or restocking your supply of fasteners in the toolbox to be prepared for the next big or little emergency, Amazon.com's Hardware Store has the necessities needed.  

The house and the hardware selection starts with the front door. If your house entry is ready for a refresh, you'll discover what's required in our selection of dead bolts, door levers, doorknobs, handle sets, hinges, house numbers, and knockers. If it's the car entrance that's in need, look for garage door openers, remote controls, and gate hardware. Working inside the house mean it's time to stock up on bathroom fans, bathroom shelves, catches, furniture pads and cups, hinges, knobs, latches and locks, pulls, robe hooks, and towel bars and rings, while working outside means putting up rural mailboxes and wall mount mailboxes as well as looking into weather stripping, window insulation kits, window screens, and window-dressing hardware. Paintbrushes, paint sprayers, painting prep materials, and paint, stain, and solvents come in handy both indoors and out.

Sometimes, it's not a particular project that demands specific items, but instead a desire to be ready for any job at any time. To have your hardware collection in this readied state, browse our extensive selection of anchors, bolts, brackets and braces, caulking, coat hooks, epoxies, hooks and hangers, hooks and eyes, nails, nuts, picture hangers, rivets, screws, staples, super glue, tape, utility hooks washers, and wood glue.  

The hardware you use provides a bedrock for many tasks and serves to bolster many of a home's key areas. Because of this importance, shop for products from dependable brands such 3M, Amerock, Bosch, Chamberlain, DEWALT, Gorilla, Kwikset, Levolor, Liberty Hardward, Master Lock, Milwaukee, Schlage, and Streamlight. You'll also find a wide range of deals and special offers on building materials and supplies in the Value Center. Having dependable hardware makes every task easier.
