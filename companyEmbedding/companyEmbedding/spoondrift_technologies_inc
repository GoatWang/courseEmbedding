Real-time Ocean Data, for Everyone.









Ocean Data Simplified

                  To learn more about our planet’s oceans, we need to drastically simplify and democratize the collection of ocean data. Our first product, Spotter, is our initial contribution toward that goal. The Spotter system is a low-cost, solar-powered ocean wave measurement and tracking device, fully integrated in an online Dashboard. Through it, you can receive real-time data, status updates, and configure your devices remotely. All you have to do is turn Spotter on to start collecting real-time data. It’s that simple.

Real-time Data Access

                  The Spotter Dashboard is your central access point for  real-time data and status updates. The Dashboard provides real-time tracking of your devices, ability to change settings on your Spotter remotely (2-way communication), unlimited access to all your data, and intuitive data visualization tools. You can also use our API to integrate your Spotter data stream in your own website or models. You have access to your data all the time, and from anywhere.
                













Easy to Use and Deploy

                  Spotter is designed for usability and we have integrated some cool features. The integrated user LEDs will tell you the status of the system, so you know when you are ready to deploy. You can switch Spotter on and off with a swipe of a magnet, and it is compact enough to deploy by hand from any size vessel. Spotter is powered by the sun so it never runs out of power.
