This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 
Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.
What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.

Waste Management Names James C. Fish, Jr. Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer


Executive Vice President – Finance, Recycling and Energy Services Steven C. Preston to Leave Company 
Houston — July 5, 2012 – Waste Management, Inc. (NYSE: WM) today announced that James C. Fish, Jr., currently Senior Vice President of the Eastern Group, will become Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer upon completion of financial reporting for the second quarter.  Mr. Fish will succeed Steven C. Preston, the company’s principal financial officer, following Mr. Preston’s decision to pursue chief executive officer opportunities.  Mr. Preston is expected to remain with the company through the third quarter to ensure an orderly transition.
Mr. Preston joined Waste Management last year after the company’s acquisition of Oakleaf Global Holdings, where Mr. Preston was President and Chief Executive Officer.  David Steiner, President and CEO of Waste Management, said, “Steve has been highly effective as a strategic, operational, and financial leader in our company. He has also played an integral role in many of our key initiatives.  We wish Steve much success and know that another company will be fortunate to have him as a new chief executive.  Fortunately for us, we have a proven person in Jim Fish to assume our CFO responsibilities.”
Said Preston, “It has been a privilege working with such a talented and committed leadership team. I firmly believe the company is headed in the right direction as they address the changes that are underway in the waste industry. It’s my desire, however, to return to a chief executive position, and I am pursuing that.”
Mr. Fish joined Waste Management in 2001 as Director of Financial Planning and Analysis.  Two years later, he was promoted to Vice President of Price Management managing the company’s pricing programs.  He then moved into field operations as a Vice President, first managing the Rhode Island/Southern Massachusetts market area, then managing the larger Western Pennsylvania/West Virginia market area, and finally managing the expanded Pennsylvania/West Virginia market area.  In 2011, he was promoted to Senior Vice President of the Eastern Group, which had over $3.1 billion in revenue in 2011.  Mr. Fish earned a Bachelor of Science degree in accounting from Arizona State University and a MBA in finance from the University of Chicago.  He is also a Certified Public Accountant.  Prior to joining Waste Management, Mr. Fish held finance or revenue management positions at Westex, a Yellow-Roadway subsidiary; Trans World Airlines; and America West Airlines. He began his professional career at KPMG Peat Marwick.
“Over more than a decade at Waste Management, Jim has taken on a wide variety of responsibilities and has done an exceptional job in every role,” said Steiner.  “Jim knows the company, he is a leader, and he has embraced our need to change and grow.  The combination of Jim’s valuable field and corporate experience, together with his financial expertise and focus on growth, ideally position him to manage our financial affairs as we pursue our strategies of knowing more about our customers and how best to service them; extracting more value from the materials we handle; and innovating and optimizing our business.”
Waste Management also announced that it has scheduled a shareholder-analyst conference call on Thursday, July 5, 2012 at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time to introduce Mr. Fish and to allow Mr. Preston to discuss his decision and the transition plan.

WasteAdvantage


Waste Management, Inc. (NYSE: WM) today announced that its Board of Directors has appointed James C. (Jim) Fish, Jr. to the position of President, reporting to David Steiner, the company’s Chief Executive Officer. Fish retains his existing role as Chief Financial Officer while the Company conducts a search to fill that role.
The new Chief Financial Officer will report to Fish, who will maintain his responsibility for all financial affairs for Waste Management, including treasury, audit, accounting, financial planning, tax and investor relations. He will also continue to oversee the information technology group and several of the Company’s growth areas, including strategic business development and the Company’s organic growth group.
“The Board of Directors and I have a strong and ongoing focus on succession planning, and the next logical step in that process is for Jim to be appointed President,” said David P. Steiner, Chief Executive Officer of Waste Management.
“In his 15 years with the company, Jim has been pivotal to the success of our business, and this appointment is extremely well deserved. He is a talented leader with tremendous knowledge of and expertise in all aspects of our business and has an impressive track record of delivering results and driving shareholder value. The Senior Leadership Team and I look forward to continuing our work alongside Jim in his added role as President as we execute our strategy to drive profitable growth and create value for our shareholders,” Steiner added.
“I am excited to take on this role and humbled by the confidence David and the Board of Directors have demonstrated in me,” said Fish. “Our Company’s future is bright, our business plan is solid and I look forward to continue working with our field and corporate teams to successfully execute on all aspects of that plan.”
Fish, 54, joined Waste Management in 2001. Prior to becoming CFO, he held several key positions with the Company, including Senior Vice President for the Company’s Eastern Group, Area Vice President for Pennsylvania and West Virginia, Market Area General Manager for Massachusetts and Rhode Island, Vice President of Price Management and Director of Financial Planning and Analysis.
Before joining Waste Management, Fish held finance or revenue management positions at Westex, a Yellow-Roadway subsidiary; Trans World Airlines; and America West Airlines. He began his professional career at KPMG Peat Marwick. Fish earned a Bachelor of Science in accounting from Arizona State University and an MBA in finance from the University of Chicago. He is also a Certified Public Accountant.

                                OPTIMIZING A SUPERIOR SLUDGE SYSTEM SOLUTION
            


            July 28, 2017
        



















        In the Wastewater treatment industry, removing harmful waste and rendering it safe for reuse or final disposal in landfills, composting or farm field applications is paramount. A key element in the wastewater treatment process is the Belt Press, which is used to dewater sludge and change it from a liquid to a solid.
        





Given today's demanding wastewater treatment regulatory landscape, proper handling of sludge is a very important component of the design and operation of any size of wastewater treatment plant (W.W.T.P.) municipality. The ultimate mission of any such plant is to separate solids from water, and to disinfect both to different degrees by removing organic and inorganic contaminants−which may be hazardous or toxic to humans or have detrimental effects on the environment.

        E-Crane's 700 Series, Model E4290 PD-E balance crane at Stelimet, Genk, Belgium features 29,7 meters outreach, and is mounted on a pedestal with a main pivot height of 15 meters.
        




At the end of December 2016, E-Crane commissioned a new 700 Series, Model E4290 PD-E at Stelimet, Genk, Belgium. Stelimet was looking for a crane for feeding a shear and stockpiling scrap around the shear. The ideal situation for Stelimet is to stockpile as high as possible in order to optimize the use of the storage area.  As the shear is operated by remote control, an excellent view into the shear was absolutely necessary.  Also, the liability, safety, energy consumption, and service reaction time of the supplier were important issues for Stelimet.

With initiatives that continue to push it ahead of other jurisdictions in Canada, the Province of British Columbia claimed the highest grade ever - an overall A - in EPR Canada's third scored report card on implementation of EPR programs, conducted in 2015. The report card assesses the progress each jurisdiction in Canada is making in adopting EPR policies and programs in compliance with their commitment to the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment Canada-wide Action Plan on EPR that was approved in 2009. Launched in 2014 as Multi-Material BC (MMBC), Recycle BC is responsible for packaging and printed paper recycling, servicing over 1.7 million households - about 97 percent of those in the province - through curbside, multi-family or depot collection.
