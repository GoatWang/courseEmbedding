History[edit]
Molina Healthcare was founded in 1980 by C. David Molina, an emergency room physician in Long Beach, CA.[5] He had seen an influx of patients using the emergency room for common illnesses such as a sore throat or the flu because they were being turned away by doctors who would not accept Medi-Cal. As a result of his emergency room work, Dr. Molina established his first primary care clinic with the goal of treating the lowest-income patients, regardless of their ability to pay.[6]
The company was run by Dr. Molina’s son, J. Mario Molina, MD, who was a physician. He was the president and CEO of the company. John Molina, Mario’s younger brother, was the current CFO of Molina Healthcare.[7] In May of 2017, in light of poor financial performance by the company, J. Mario and John were removed from their positions by the board, ending family control of the company.[8] The two took over the Molina’s operations after their father died in 1996 and continued to expand the company.
However there are reports that it was J Mario Molina's outspoken criticism of the current administration that motivated the firing.
“I’ve been a very vocal critic of what’s going on in Washington,” Molina told Politico. “I know the other health plan executives have been afraid to speak out. Maybe they’re smarter than I am, but I’m not going to back off.”
FierceHealthCare.com reported: "Molina Healthcare had thrived in the ACA’s individual marketplaces, but revealed in February that it lost $110 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, due at least in part to the fact that it had to pay significantly more into the risk adjustment program than it had anticipated.
However, despite those losses, Molina beat Wall Street predictions for the first quarter of 2017, the results of which were announced a day after the brothers were fired."
There has also been speculation by industry analysts about a sale of the company, which may present an additional motivation to remove members of the founder's family from leadership positions.
(Reference: http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/aca/ousted-molina-ceo-insurers-afraid-trump-administration)
C. David Molina’s daughter Martha Bernadett, MD is also a part of Molina Healthcare. Since receiving two Robert Wood Johnson Foundation awards in 2002, Dr. Bernadett has served as the Executive Vice President of Research and Innovation at Molina Healthcare. She founded the Molina Institute for Cultural Competency, Book Buddies and the Molina Foundation, a non-profit organization to promote access to education and health care to reduce disparities.[9]
Clinic Expansion[edit]
The first Molina Medical clinic was opened in Wilmington, CA in 1980. Since then, 29 clinics have opened in Northern California, Southern California, Washington, New Mexico, Florida and Utah.[10][11] Molina Medical Group (MMG) also runs state-owned clinics in Fairfax County, Virginia. The clinics were opened to provide health care to low-income families and individuals.

Labor Litigation[edit]
In April 2011, a lawsuit was filed against the company and its outsourcing firm Cognizant Technologies in California state court. Both companies are accused of discriminating against American workers who claim they were fired and replaced with H-1B workers. The companies are accused of violating numerous federal and state labor laws. In July, the U.S. District Court, Central District of California ruled that there were no federal claims, which the plaintiff’s attorney had acknowledged in his Declaration in Support of (the plaintiff’s) Motion to Remand. Molina has expressed confidence it will “win in court because specific allegations have been examined and found false.”[53]

History[edit]
Molina Healthcare was founded in 1980 by C. David Molina, an emergency room physician in Long Beach, CA.[5] He had seen an influx of patients using the emergency room for common illnesses such as a sore throat or the flu because they were being turned away by doctors who would not accept Medi-Cal. As a result of his emergency room work, Dr. Molina established his first primary care clinic with the goal of treating the lowest-income patients, regardless of their ability to pay.[6]
The company was run by Dr. Molina’s son, J. Mario Molina, MD, who was a physician. He was the president and CEO of the company. John Molina, Mario’s younger brother, was the current CFO of Molina Healthcare.[7] In May of 2017, in light of poor financial performance by the company, J. Mario and John were removed from their positions by the board, ending family control of the company.[8] The two took over the Molina’s operations after their father died in 1996 and continued to expand the company.
However there are reports that it was J Mario Molina's outspoken criticism of the current administration that motivated the firing.
“I’ve been a very vocal critic of what’s going on in Washington,” Molina told Politico. “I know the other health plan executives have been afraid to speak out. Maybe they’re smarter than I am, but I’m not going to back off.”
FierceHealthCare.com reported: "Molina Healthcare had thrived in the ACA’s individual marketplaces, but revealed in February that it lost $110 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, due at least in part to the fact that it had to pay significantly more into the risk adjustment program than it had anticipated.
However, despite those losses, Molina beat Wall Street predictions for the first quarter of 2017, the results of which were announced a day after the brothers were fired."
There has also been speculation by industry analysts about a sale of the company, which may present an additional motivation to remove members of the founder's family from leadership positions.
(Reference: http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/aca/ousted-molina-ceo-insurers-afraid-trump-administration)
C. David Molina’s daughter Martha Bernadett, MD is also a part of Molina Healthcare. Since receiving two Robert Wood Johnson Foundation awards in 2002, Dr. Bernadett has served as the Executive Vice President of Research and Innovation at Molina Healthcare. She founded the Molina Institute for Cultural Competency, Book Buddies and the Molina Foundation, a non-profit organization to promote access to education and health care to reduce disparities.[9]
Clinic Expansion[edit]
The first Molina Medical clinic was opened in Wilmington, CA in 1980. Since then, 29 clinics have opened in Northern California, Southern California, Washington, New Mexico, Florida and Utah.[10][11] Molina Medical Group (MMG) also runs state-owned clinics in Fairfax County, Virginia. The clinics were opened to provide health care to low-income families and individuals.
Becoming an HMO[edit]

History[edit]
Molina Healthcare was founded in 1980 by C. David Molina, an emergency room physician in Long Beach, CA.[5] He had seen an influx of patients using the emergency room for common illnesses such as a sore throat or the flu because they were being turned away by doctors who would not accept Medi-Cal. As a result of his emergency room work, Dr. Molina established his first primary care clinic with the goal of treating the lowest-income patients, regardless of their ability to pay.[6]
The company was run by Dr. Molina’s son, J. Mario Molina, MD, who was a physician. He was the president and CEO of the company. John Molina, Mario’s younger brother, was the current CFO of Molina Healthcare.[7] In May of 2017, in light of poor financial performance by the company, J. Mario and John were removed from their positions by the board, ending family control of the company.[8] The two took over the Molina’s operations after their father died in 1996 and continued to expand the company.
However there are reports that it was J Mario Molina's outspoken criticism of the current administration that motivated the firing.
“I’ve been a very vocal critic of what’s going on in Washington,” Molina told Politico. “I know the other health plan executives have been afraid to speak out. Maybe they’re smarter than I am, but I’m not going to back off.”
FierceHealthCare.com reported: "Molina Healthcare had thrived in the ACA’s individual marketplaces, but revealed in February that it lost $110 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, due at least in part to the fact that it had to pay significantly more into the risk adjustment program than it had anticipated.
However, despite those losses, Molina beat Wall Street predictions for the first quarter of 2017, the results of which were announced a day after the brothers were fired."
There has also been speculation by industry analysts about a sale of the company, which may present an additional motivation to remove members of the founder's family from leadership positions.

C. David Molina’s daughter Martha Bernadett, MD is also a part of Molina Healthcare. Since receiving two Robert Wood Johnson Foundation awards in 2002, Dr. Bernadett has served as the Executive Vice President of Research and Innovation at Molina Healthcare.

Labor Litigation[edit]
In April 2011, a lawsuit was filed against the company and its outsourcing firm Cognizant Technologies in California state court. Both companies are accused of discriminating against American workers who claim they were fired and replaced with H-1B workers. The companies are accused of violating numerous federal and state labor laws. In July, the U.S. District Court, Central District of California ruled that there were no federal claims, which the plaintiff’s attorney had acknowledged in his Declaration in Support of (the plaintiff’s) Motion to Remand. Molina has expressed confidence it will “win in court because specific allegations have been examined and found false.”[53]

History[edit]
Molina Healthcare was founded in 1980 by C. David Molina, an emergency room physician in Long Beach, CA.[5] He had seen an influx of patients using the emergency room for common illnesses such as a sore throat or the flu because they were being turned away by doctors who would not accept Medi-Cal. As a result of his emergency room work, Dr. Molina established his first primary care clinic with the goal of treating the lowest-income patients, regardless of their ability to pay.[6]
The company was run by Dr. Molina’s son, J. Mario Molina, MD, who was a physician. He was the president and CEO of the company. John Molina, Mario’s younger brother, was the current CFO of Molina Healthcare.[7] In May of 2017, in light of poor financial performance by the company, J. Mario and John were removed from their positions by the board, ending family control of the company.[8] The two took over the Molina’s operations after their father died in 1996 and continued to expand the company.
However there are reports that it was J Mario Molina's outspoken criticism of the current administration that motivated the firing.
“I’ve been a very vocal critic of what’s going on in Washington,” Molina told Politico. “I know the other health plan executives have been afraid to speak out. Maybe they’re smarter than I am, but I’m not going to back off.”
FierceHealthCare.com reported: "Molina Healthcare had thrived in the ACA’s individual marketplaces, but revealed in February that it lost $110 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, due at least in part to the fact that it had to pay significantly more into the risk adjustment program than it had anticipated.
However, despite those losses, Molina beat Wall Street predictions for the first quarter of 2017, the results of which were announced a day after the brothers were fired."
There has also been speculation by industry analysts about a sale of the company, which may present an additional motivation to remove members of the founder's family from leadership positions.
(Reference: http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/aca/ousted-molina-ceo-insurers-afraid-trump-administration)
C. David Molina’s daughter Martha Bernadett, MD is also a part of Molina Healthcare. Since receiving two Robert Wood Johnson Foundation awards in 2002, Dr. Bernadett has served as the Executive Vice President of Research and Innovation at Molina Healthcare. She founded the Molina Institute for Cultural Competency, Book Buddies and the Molina Foundation, a non-profit organization to promote access to education and health care to reduce disparities.[9]
Clinic Expansion[edit]
The first Molina Medical clinic was opened in Wilmington, CA in 1980. Since then, 29 clinics have opened in Northern California, Southern California, Washington, New Mexico, Florida and Utah.[10][11] Molina Medical Group (MMG) also runs state-owned clinics in Fairfax County, Virginia. The clinics were opened to provide health care to low-income families and individuals.
Becoming an HMO[edit]

How the BuildZoom Score works








Follow this contractor

















Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Texas:













Does Molina John C carry a valid contracting license?



Only certain types of specialty contractors (e.g. HVAC, electrical) need to be licensed in Texas. There are no licensing requirements when it comes to hiring for a construction or major remodeling project.
Molina John C currently holds license AE-212798 , which was Active when we last checked. 











How important is contractor licensing in Texas?



The Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation (TDLR) regulates HVAC and electrical contractors. You should verify their license status on the TDLR Website before hiring. General contractors and home builders are not licensed so you should do additional research before hiring one.











Your liability risk when hiring Molina John C



Although it isn't a regulatory requirement, you can ask your general contractor to provide evidence of workers' compensation and general liability insurance prior to hiring them. 











Financial recourse when hiring Molina John C



The Texas Department of Licensing Regulation does not require general contractors to carry a surety bond nor is there a state recovery fund.











What else should I know before hiring Molina John C



There is no financial or criminal background check performed on general contractors by the TDLR. The State's Department of Public Safety does maintain a publicly accessible database so you can run your own background check prior to hiring. 











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



The information on BuildZoom is made available as a public service and should not be considered advertising. We collect client feedback and verify contractors' permitted history with dozens of local building departments in Texas, which saves you time and helps minimize your risk when hiring. 











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



The Texas Attorney General's office recommends getting several bids before hiring a contractor. Do not automatically accept the lowest bid - an abnormally low bid may indicate the contractor made a mistake and is not including the same work quoted by their competitors. We've made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). 









About BuildZoom






BuildZoom has one simple purpose: To help you find the perfect contractor
for any job, commercial or residential.


BuildZoom is a database of every licensed contractor in the United States.
We work hard to figure out who the great contractors are, and who the bad
contractors are.

more...





BuildZoom combines license information on 3.5 million contractors with
110 million building permits, and over 80,000
reviews from property owners.If you are looking for a specific
contractor and you can’t find them on BuildZoom, it’s likely that they do
not have a license - please
contact us
and we’ll try to help!



Finding a Contractor through BuildZoom



The best way to use BuildZoom is to let us recommend contractors for
your remodeling projects.


Homeowners who

hire through BuildZoom's free bidding system
 report high rates of satisfaction, and homeowners who research
contractors online are twice as likely to be happy at the end of their
project.


If you hire a contractor through BuildZoom, that contractor is

In a surprise shake-up Tuesday, Molina Healthcare Inc. — a major player in Obamacare health insurance markets — ousted its two top executives, both sons of the firm’s founder. The company cited poor financial results.The growing, Long Beach-based health insurer has nearly 5 million customers in 12 states and Puerto Rico, most of them insured through Medicaid, the government program for the poor.In California, Molina currently insures 765,000 people and operates its own clinics around the state. The company also has Medicare programs, and more than 1 million customers who purchased a plan on one of the marketplace exchanges created by the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare.The company’s shares soared as much as 20% on Tuesday after it said that J. Mario Molina, the company’s chief executive and an outspoken critic of Republican efforts to repeal the ACA, and his brother John C. Molina, the chief financial officer, had been fired.

Analysts have long viewed Molina as a potential acquisition target of a larger insurer. Removing the brothers could make such a deal easier, analysts say.The two brothers will be replaced by Joseph White, currently the company’s chief accounting officer. White will serve as chief financial officer and interim chief executive while the board seeks a replacement for the top post.The board also named Dale Wolf, a director, as the company’s new chairman.“In light of the company’s disappointing financial performance, the board has determined to change leadership in order to drive profitability through operational improvements,” Wolf said in a statement early Tuesday.

“The board is committed to achieving operational excellence and improving the company’s financial performance on behalf of our shareholders, more than 20,000 employees and our over 4 million members,” he said.The brothers will remain on Molina’s board, the company said.On a conference call Tuesday afternoon, analysts asked Wolf why the board had removed the executives so abruptly. One analyst asked if the company had found signs of fraud or illegal activity.Wolf told them that was not the case.“The information we shared in the press release … is all there is to say,” he said.He added that there was “a sense we weren’t keeping up with our competitors.”On Tuesday, the company reported its first-quarter results, showing that its total number of insured members jumped by more than 500,000 people to 4,766,000.In the first three months of the year, the company earned $77 million in net income from $4.6 billion in revenue, for a net profit margin of 1.6%.“It’s a great franchise,” Wolf told the analysts. “We just need to improve the results.”According to financial filings, J. Mario Molina owns 2.86% of the company, while John Molina owns 2.33% of the shares. The co-trustee of two Molina family trusts is listed as owning an additional 17.4% of the company.J. Mario Molina succeeded his father, C. David Molina, as CEO in 1996.In recent months, he had been outspoken about what he believed was wrong with the Republicans’ plans to replace the ACA.On April 27, he wrote a letter to Congress saying that the company would be forced to pull out of the ACA’s exchanges if the government did not continue providing subsidies that lower a person’s out-of-pocket costs based on their income.He wrote that Molina currently covers about 9% of all Americans enrolled in the Obamacare exchanges.If the subsidies were not funded, he wrote, “we will have no choice but to send a notice of default informing the government that we are dropping our contracts for their failure to pay premiums and seek to withdraw from the marketplace immediately.”The company has tried to control costs by limiting its networks of doctors and hospitals, as well as sending members to its own clinics. Many of its customers are lower income and suffer from chronic health conditions.The company offers to transport its members on free shuttles that not only get them to their doctors’ appointments, but stop at grocery stores, churches, laundromats and check-cashing stores.The company was founded in 1980 by C. David Molina, an emergency room doctor in Long Beach. In 1994, Molina and his firm won a state contract to provide care for mothers and children in California’s Medicaid program, which is called Medi-Cal.That no-bid contract, considered then to be worth $400 million, became controversial after Molina's application listed state Sen. Diane Watson (D-Los Angeles) on its board of directors. Watson helped oversee Medi-Cal as chairwoman of the Senate Health Committee. Molina and Watson denied that she had done anything to influence the awarding the contract.The company’s stock closed at $59.75 on Tuesday, up $8.95, or 17.6%.
