Core Equity Management
KCM’s growth equity philosophy is that over time a company’s revenue and earnings per share growth are the most significant determinants of long-term stock price appreciation. We primarily seek companies that are positioned to increase market share and become a dominant factor in their industry. Qualifying companies are selected for having strong financial characteristics which are in a period of high, sustainable earnings and revenue growth. We believe that the best rewards for clients will be found over a full market cycle within these companies with the proper diversification relative to appropriate indices and benchmarks. KCM’s objective is to maximize total return while concentrating on quality securities.
Global Opportunity Portfolio
The Global Opportunity Portfolio strategy has a substantial stake in large multinational companies that pay dividends, and have a long history of increasing those dividends. A growth element is provided by some exposure to fast growing emerging markets. The portfolio also includes elements that are designed to provide protection against inflation and a weak dollar. KCM’s objective is to provide a modest and growing level of current income, modest growth, and protection from inflation and a weak dollar.  Watch the Global Opportunity Portfolio Introduction.
Balanced Account Management
KCM’s balanced investment philosophy is founded on the fact that over extended periods, the returns from equities have been greater than the returns from cash investments or bonds. Therefore, our balanced portfolios have a bias toward equities with a growth stock orientation. We believe the purpose of owning bonds, either taxable or tax exempt, in these portfolios is to contribute to total return, increase diversification, and reduce overall volatility. We call this our “anchor to windward” strategy.  KCM’s partners believe that a conservative, disciplined approach to active bond management adds value. By employing relative value analysis, we have proven that we can capture opportunities created by changing market conditions. KCM’s objective is to maximize total return while adhering to a portfolio that is balanced between quality stocks and bonds.
Fixed Income Management
KCM’s fixed income investment philosophy is based on our belief that superior risk-adjusted returns are achieved by capturing changes in relative value through active yield curve management, sector rotation, and prudent security selection. KCM’s objective is to consistently outperform comparable indices over long periods of time, producing either taxable or tax free cash flow, while adhering to quality securities.

Philosophy


At KCM, we believe in the long-term potential of the stock and bond markets to achieve financial wealth. KCM’s investment philosophy focuses on the importance of compounding long term capital growth. Our fundamental investment philosophy is supported by several proprietary software models to monitor market risk in conjunction with our partners’ cumulative years of industry experience.  While understanding that the needs of high net worth individuals can be far more complex than those of the typical retail investor, KCM sets about structuring custom portfolios that address the specific goals of each client.
Regardless of asset class, KCM’s investment process follows basic principles that feature a strong management discipline while paying special attention to fundamental valuations. In addition, each of our partners adheres to clearly defined rules for asset selection and portfolio building to ensure that clients receive products with the characteristics and long-term performance patterns that best suit their needs. This applies to Core Equity Portfolios, Balanced Accounts and Fixed Income Portfolio Products.

About KCM


KCM acts as an independent, employee owned Registered Investment Advisor under Section 203(c) of the Investment Advisors Act of 1940. We are recognized for adhering to our core competency, and offering only Domestic Large Cap Equity and Domestic Fixed Income investment management for a limited client base. Over the years we have established an exceptional reputation for sound money management for a client base of successful families, trusts, endowments and institutions.
The average market experience of each KCM executive currently exceeds 30 years. The firm requires a minimum of 10 years of business experience for those partners involved in managing investment portfolios for its clients. KCM’s investment objective is to establish the proper asset allocation for each individual account while being cognizant of every client’s tolerance to risk. To achieve these objectives, KCM’s partners employ long-term secular forecasting combined with ongoing fundamental analysis and investment management to meet client needs.



All of the KCM managers (Our Team) have over 30 years of experience successfully investing for clients. Your account will be managed by a member of our senior management team with direct communication flowing between you and the key decision maker.


Our years of investment experience provide us with a formidable foundation of market knowledge. KCM has developed a process based, highly disciplined approach to portfolio building that works. The KCM Portfolio Builder™ helps to structure our client accounts to outperform a given benchmark in both up and down markets. The core concept behind our fundamental investment methodology is the marriage and interdependence of both risk control (top-down) and classical security analysis (bottom-up) traditions.Short term runs in Small Cap Growth Stocks, or Emerging Country Debt can look enticing when reported in the headlines, however, over longer periods of time these niche investment styles generally under-perform a risk-controlled top-down approach that invests in larger US stocks and high quality domestic fixed income securities. We remain committed to our basic philosophical underpinnings and unless directed by our clients, rarely pursue investment trends that increase the risk to principal.
We put the client first. We are not motivated by commissions, parent company research, or underwriting fees. We offer truly independent research for our clients. We don’t believe in the “one-size-fits-all” approach that dominates the industry. Our formula allows and even encourages individualized and personalized portfolio management for each and every account. The combination of our competitive fee structure, low transaction costs and minimal portfolio turnover provides an environment where our clients are able to preserve their capital for long-term appreciation and growth.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
