UCONN Hoop Legends: DALE COMEY























 





































 




 




Dale Comey  


Year:
1960 - 1963 


Position:
Guard


Hometown:
Waltham, MA


 





                    Dale Comey was a Guard for the UConn Huskies from 1960 – 1963. He’s a 
      member of the UConn Basketball All Century Ballot, and as a senior, was a 
      member of the Yankee Conference Championship Team which also went to the 
      National Collegiate Athletic Association Tournament. I spoke with Dale in 
      February 2005, from his home in Florida about his career and reflections 
      of his collegiate and post-collegiate days, both on and off the court.

Dale grew up playing all sports as a youth until the summer between his 
      freshman and sophomore years of high school. Dale and his brother went to 
      what they thought was an all sports camp; basketball, baseball, swimming, 
      but it turned out they focused 99.5% of their time on basketball. It was 
      called All America Camp, and it was run by basketball guru Claire Bee, who 
      was the athletic director at the New York Military Academy. “It was a 
      wonderful place to learn how to play basketball,” Dale said. “I ended up 
      playing basketball twelve hours a day while there. When I went back to 
      Foxboro High School in Massachusetts, I pretty much decided that 
      basketball was going to be the sport I was going to play.”

As a sophomore at Foxboro, Dale played very well, was the leading scorer 
      of the team, and again during the summer went back to All American Camp. 
      New York Military Academy offered Dale a work scholarship to play 
      basketball if he transferred from Foxboro. Foxboro was a small school, and 
      Dale felt like he needed better competition so he accepted the offer. The 
      school provided a great education, and was very disciplined, which helped 
      to prepare him for college. With a work scholarship the athletes worked in 
      the dining hall as waiters for six hours a day, went to school, played 
      sports, and did their military obligations as well. Dale continued 
      attending the All America Camp at New York Military Academy facilities 
      through his sophomore year in college. 

When Dale was fourteen years old he had gone to the Boston Garden to see a 
      college basketball game double header. UConn played either Boston College 
      or Holy Cross. “It was just a wonderful run and gun shoot game which I 
      think UConn won 110 to 108, and I said, BOOM!, that’s where I want to go 
      to college because they play my brand of basketball. I was small, fast, a 
      shooter, and I wanted to play on a team that ran and shot. UConn head 
      basketball coach Hugh Greer’s specialty back then was running, and fast 
      breaking, so it seemed to fit what I wanted to do.” 

While at New York Military Academy, Dale was the “big fish.” As a senior 
      he averaged over 30 points per game. UConn had sent Nick Rodis (freshman 
      basketball coach at the time), to see Dale play but he went to the wrong 
      place, and never actually saw Dale play, and therefore UConn did not offer 
      him a scholarship. Dale had been recruited by other colleges but he knew 
      he wanted to go to UConn. He decided to go to UConn without a scholarship, 
      and earn one, which he did after his first semester as a freshman.

Dale did not encounter a big transition going from high school to college. 
      “The camp I went to during the summers was just loaded with talent. People 
      that were in college, everybody and their brother came there for a week or 
      two to coach; Adolph Rupp (former Kentucky University head coach), Red 
      Auerbach (former Boston Celtics head coach), people that were premier 
      coaches at the time in addition to people like Lou Carnesecca (former St. 
      John’s University head coach), and others like him were counselors, so the 
      skills you learned were phenomenal, and the brand of basketball there was 
      at the college level. I felt fairly well prepared by the time I got to 
      UConn.”

When Dale arrived at UConn he played on the freshman team (back then you 
      couldn’t play varsity basketball until you were a sophomore). “I was a 
      three-point shooter before they had the three-point line.” As a freshman 
      the team did very well. His sophomore year was the year of the point 
      shaving scandal, an unfortunate thing, but it happened. Dale’s junior year 
      was a rebuilding year, and as a senior the team had a pretty good year. It 
      was also the year Head Coach Hugh Greer died in the middle of the season. 
      The team went on to play in the NCAA tournament when there were only 32 
      teams selected, but lost by a couple of points in the first round to West 
      Virginia in a game that was played in Philadelphia at the Palestra. “We 
      lost by 3, 4, 5, or 6 points. We should have won. It was a good game for 
      me. It was a good game for the team. We should have won.” Dale was the 
      sixth man kind of player. “It was my job to go in, and shoot, and try to 
      give the team a lift. If I didn’t shoot the coach used to take me out.”

Dale graduated from UConn with a Bachelor’s Degree in Business 
      Administration specializing in Insurance. He went into the service; he was 
      in the Reserved Officers Training Corp (ROTC), and entered the army as a 
      lieutenant. He was stationed in Germany for almost two years. Dale’s first 
      year in Germany he had a good job, and didn’t want to lose the job, 
      however his orders were cut, and he had to play for the army basketball 
      team. “I played for a season. It was fun. We traveled all over Germany 
      playing games. That was really the last organized basketball I played.” 

After finishing his service responsibilities, Dale began a career at The 
      Hartford Insurance Group, in Hartford, Connecticut, and played a little 
      basketball in the Hartford Industrial League for a few years. Dale worked 
      for The Hartford, for close to 25 years; he became an actuary, and also 
      got into management in the company before becoming the President of the 
      Property and Casualty Company. Next he went to the parent company of The 
      Hartford Insurance Group, ITT Corporation as an Executive Vice President 
      for six years, and also had involvement with other businesses at ITT. In 
      1996, Dale retired from ITT but still remains on a few Boards of 
      Directors. While retired, Dale enjoys playing a lot of golf, and traveling 
      between his homes in Florida, Connecticut and Vermont. He said retirement 
      is fantastic. 

Dale is a member of the UConn School of Business Hall of fame, and in the 
      late 1990’s was a Red O’Neil Award winner, an award that recognizes UConn 
      athletes who have gone on to achieve success in life after UConn.

Dale’s thoughts on how basketball has changed over the years is that the 
      game is played faster, the players are bigger, and the biggest change is 
      the three-point basket.

Dale said, “Coach Calhoun has done a phenomenal job. He’s done an 
      absolutely phenomenal job. He’s obviously demonstrated his ability to 
      develop players but also to adhere to the team playing concept. He’s just 
      done an excellent phenomenal job, and he’s gotten better with time.”

Regarding this year’s team, Dale thinks they are fantastic athletes. His 
      expectations of them are very high. “I think they are going to do fine 
      this year, and their going to do better next year.”

Dale met his wife, Marilyn, who was a cheerleader, at UConn. They’ve been 
      married for 37 years. Marilyn is a retired social worker. They have three 
      children who were not basketball players, but were ski racers and hockey 
      players. Their first son Adam went to Evergreen State College in Olympia, 
      Washington, and currently has his own sports management company that 
      creates, manages, and promotes extreme sports events oriented toward 
      skiing and snowboarding in Salt Lake City, Utah. Their daughter, Rachel, 
      went to the University of Vermont, and owns her own clothing company. She 
      designs and manufacturers men’s and women’s clothing in Manhattan, New 
      York. Their youngest son Zachary went to the University of New Hampshire, 
      and works in Stamford, Connecticut as a merging markets bond trader. 
      Zachary is married and has one daughter and another child on the way.

Dale had some very positive things to say about UConn. “I’ve always been 
      an intense UConn fan—forever. I’ve always followed the teams, and how they 
      are doing, watching them all the time. As I look back now it was a 
      fantastic experience. A lot of great people. It was very healthy and 
      educational. UConn was great. Absolutely a good decision to go to UConn.” 
 





 





                  If you are a UConn basketball 
                legend and haven’t been contacted yet to be a part of this 
                website, please  contact us so you can 
                be included.                  

 If you know where we can find a UConn basketball 
                legend that is not listed, please contact us and 
                provide the contact information for us and hopefully they will 
                soon be on the website.

Mr. Comey brings an actuarial background and extensive operational and business leadership skills to the Board. Through his experience serving in various senior leadership positions with ITT Corporation, he has first-hand knowledge of the varied and complex financial, operational and governance issues that confront large (re)insurers, such as the Company. This experience makes him well-suited to serve as a Director of the Company. In addition, Mr. Comey's experience gained from serving as a director of a non-profit institution adds to the depth and breadth of his knowledge of operations, strategy and good governance practices.

Comey’s Memos Were a Product of a Culture of Note-Keeping

WASHINGTON — The revelation that James B. Comey documented his interactions with President Trump — describing in detail how the president urged him to quash the federal investigation into Michael T. Flynn, the former national security adviser — provided the clearest evidence yet that Mr. Trump tried to influence the government’s inquiry into possible links between his associates and Russia.It also shined a bright light on something more commonplace: the F.B.I.’s practice of keeping careful, contemporaneous notes.For law enforcement officials like Mr. Comey, who was fired last week as the director of the F.B.I., documenting sensitive conversations is a reflex — and in keeping with the habits of diligent lawyers. Mr. Comey was a federal prosecutor and corporate counsel before he took over the F.B.I.

Why do F.B.I. employees write memos?In sensitive investigations as well as in routine matters, it is standard for people who work in law enforcement to keep detailed phone and meeting logs, Lauren C. Anderson, a former top F.B.I. official, said. Continue reading the main story

“That’s the culture of the F.B.I. — you habitually document everything you do,” Ms. Anderson, a 29-year veteran of the bureau, said. “As a rule, you’re not taping every conversation, so your ability to recall details in a way that can be maintained and relied on is absolutely critical.”

A Times Exclusive: Trump, Comey and the Russia Investigation


Michael S. Schmidt, a New York Times reporter, explains new revelations from a memo written by James B. Comey, the fired F.B.I. director. The memo showed that President Trump may have tried to halt the agency's investigation into Michael T. Flynn.

The instinct to preserve possible evidence goes beyond the F.B.I.“The same is true in the C.I.A.,” Ms. Anderson said. “They’re meticulous in their documentation of both formal and informal communications.”


            In the cia, there is a sayin: if you didnt write it down it doesnt exist. in the fbi everything exists because everything is written down.         —

Why keep the records?Memos such as Mr. Comey’s help reflect a level of detail documented while events are still fresh in the writer’s mind. In court, they can serve to corroborate testimony.Interactions with people who may in some way figure into an investigation — regardless of what may be discussed — could be pertinent to an inquiry and later serve as evidence.“Memos give you the flexibility to report facts as well as atmospheric impressions,” Ms. Anderson said.“It goes to his credibility,” she said of Mr. Comey. “The fact that he wrote it when it happened lends weight to it. It’s not like he wrote something last weekend and backdated it.”

A look at what qualifies as obstructing justice, and whether the accusations against President Trump could fit in that definition.


 



Mr. Comey’s memos were not the standard forms that F.B.I. agents use to summarize the facts of interviews they conduct, called FD-302s, or 302s in bureau parlance. They were a more informal way to document not just the facts of an interaction but also personal impressions and analysis to help put those facts into context.

Were other memos ever so prominent?In 2007, the typewritten notes of Robert S. Mueller III, the F.B.I. director at that time, helped resolve a dispute over the Bush administration’s warrantless surveillance program.Mr. Comey, as it happens, was also involved. He testified in 2007 before a congressional committee about a series of meetings and phone conversations about the surveillance program he had in 2004, when he was deputy attorney general.Mr. Comey, who had opposed the surveillance program, had different recollections than senior White House officials, and Mr. Mueller’s notes provided key corroboration of Mr. Comey’s version of events.Mr. Comey had also documented concerns about the Bush administration’s use of brutal interrogation tactics in 2005 in emails, which were made public in part in The New York Times in 2009.

What has been the fallout?Democrats have used Mr. Comey’s memo to push again for an independent panel to investigate ties between Mr. Trump’s associates and Russia, and some even pressed for the impeachment of Mr. Trump, though many expressed caution on calling for such a drastic step.Many legal questions need to be answered first, said Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, including establishing Mr. Trump’s intent if he did ask Mr. Comey to end the inquiry into Mr. Flynn (which the White House denies).“It cannot serve as a method to nullify the election by other means,” Mr. Schiff said of possible impeachment proceedings.Representative Justin Amash, a Michigan Republican with a history of speaking out against his party, said that if Mr. Comey’s account was accurate, he believed it to be grounds for impeachment.

The Senate Intelligence Committee and House Oversight Committee separately requested documents related to Mr. Comey’s interactions with the president; leaders of both committees also said they were poised to issue subpoenas to obtain Mr. Comey’s memo if necessary. The Senate committee also invited Mr. Comey to testify openly and behind closed doors.The White House has expressed skepticism of Mr. Comey’s characterization of his interactions with Mr. Trump, insisting that the president never asked that the Flynn investigation be shut down.“The president is confident in the events that he has maintained, and he wants the truth in these investigations to get to the bottom of the situation,” Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, said Wednesday. “There are two investigations going on in the House and Senate, and he wants to get to the bottom of this.”
