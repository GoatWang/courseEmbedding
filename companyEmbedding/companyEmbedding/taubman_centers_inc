            2017.
          




           
        




            (2) Adjusted FFO for the three and six month periods ended June 
            30, 2016 exclude a $21.7 million ($0.25 per share) lump sum 
            termination payment the company received in the second quarter for 
            the termination of the company’s leasing services agreement at The 
            Shops at Crystals (Las Vegas, Nev.).
          




      “We are pleased with our financial results this quarter, which were in 
      line with our expectations, as we delivered strong earnings growth with 
      Adjusted FFO per share up more than 16 percent,” said Robert S. Taubman, 
      chairman, president and chief executive officer of Taubman Centers. 
      “Significant lease cancellation income and higher rents, combined with 
      lower operating and general and administrative expenses, drove our 
      results.”
    

Operating Statistics


      For the quarter, comparable center NOI, including lease cancellation 
      income, was up 6.5 percent, bringing year-to-date growth to 5.2 percent. 
      Excluding lease cancellation income, comparable center NOI growth was 
      2.8 percent for both the quarter and year-to-date.
    

      Comparable center mall tenant sales per square foot increased 2.9 
      percent from the second quarter of 2016. This brings the company's 
      12-month trailing mall tenant sales per square foot to $782, an increase 
      of 2.2 percent from the 12-months ended June 30, 2016. Year-to-date, 
      mall tenant sales per square foot were up 2.1 percent.
    

      “We were very pleased to see positive sales per square foot growth for 
      the fourth consecutive quarter,” said Mr. Taubman. “Our Florida assets 
      were strongest in the quarter, and have performed particularly well this 
      year.”
    

      Average rent per square foot was $62.08, up 1.6 percent from $61.13 in 
      the comparable period last year. Year-to-date, average rent per square 
      foot was up 1.3 percent, consistent with the company’s expectation of 
      rent per square foot growth of about 1 percent for the year.
    

      Trailing 12-month releasing spreads per square foot for the period ended 
      June 30, 2017 were 9.1 percent.
    

      Ending occupancy in comparable centers was 92.2 percent on June 30, 
      2017, down 1 percent from June 30, 2016. Leased space in comparable 
      centers was 94.6 percent on June 30, 2017, down 1.1 percent from June 
      30, 2016, but up 0.7 percent from March 31, 2017, consistent with the 
      company’s expectation of around 95 percent occupancy in comparable 
      centers at December 31, 2017.
    

2017 Guidance


      Taubman Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Simon J. 
      Leopold said, “While our year-to-date results have been strong, 
      challenges within the retail environment increased throughout the 
      quarter. Where appropriate, we are making the decision to preserve 
      occupancy and some income as we retenant space. In the interim there 
      will be impacts to our FFO and NOI growth. As a result, we believe it is 
      prudent to adjust our outlook for the year.”
    

      The company is updating its guidance. 2017 EPS is now expected to be in 
      the range of $1.03 to $1.23 per diluted common share, revised from the 
      previous range of $1.16 to $1.41.
    

      2017 FFO, which includes $0.14 per diluted common share of year-to-date 
      adjustments, is now expected to be in the range of $3.53 to $3.63 per 
      diluted common share, revised from the previous range of $3.60 to $3.75.
    

      2017 Adjusted FFO, which excludes $0.14 per diluted common share of 
      year-to-date adjustments, is expected to be in the range of $3.67 to 
      $3.77 per diluted common share, revised from the previous range of $3.67 
      to $3.82.
    

      The revision to the company’s Adjusted FFO guidance is primarily 
      attributable to reduced comparable center NOI growth expectations. The 
      company now assumes comparable center NOI growth, including lease 
      cancellation income, will be in the range of 1 to 3 percent for the 
      year. The company’s previous comparable center NOI growth guidance, 
      including lease cancellation income, was about 3 ½ percent. Excluding 
      lease cancellation income, comparable center NOI growth is expected to 
      be in the range of flat to 2 percent. The revised NOI outlook is 
      primarily a result of lower average occupancy for the year, lower net 
      recoveries, and increased bad debt expense.
    

      The company’s guidance does not reflect any future costs that may be 
      incurred related to shareowner activism.
    

      “Despite the significant headwinds our industry continues to face, there 
      is good demand for space in our centers. We believe our high quality 
      portfolio is well-positioned to weather this storm and will gain market 
      share over time,” added Mr. Taubman.

          EBITDA represents earnings before interest, income taxes, and 
          depreciation and amortization of the Operating Partnership's 
          consolidated and unconsolidated businesses. Beneficial interest in 
          EBITDA represents the Operating Partnership’s share of the earnings 
          before interest, income taxes, and depreciation and amortization of 
          its consolidated and unconsolidated businesses. The Company believes 
          EBITDA and beneficial interest in EBITDA provide useful indicators 
          of operating performance, as it is customary in the real estate and 
          shopping center business to evaluate the performance of properties 
          on a basis unaffected by capital structure.
        







           
        







          The Company uses Net Operating Income (NOI) as an alternative 
          measure to evaluate the operating performance of centers, both on 
          individual and stabilized portfolio bases. The Company defines NOI 
          as property-level operating revenues (includes rental income 
          excluding straight-line adjustments of minimum rent) less 
          maintenance, taxes, utilities, promotion, ground rent (including 
          straight-line adjustments), and other property operating expenses. 
          Since NOI excludes general and administrative expenses, 
          pre-development charges, interest income and expense, depreciation 
          and amortization, impairment charges, restructuring charges, and 
          gains from peripheral land and property dispositions, it provides a 
          performance measure that, when compared period over period, reflects 
          the revenues and expenses most directly associated with owning and 
          operating rental properties, as well as the impact on their 
          operations from trends in tenant sales, occupancy and rental rates, 
          and operating costs. The Company also uses NOI excluding lease 
          cancellation income as an alternative measure because this income 
          may vary significantly from period to period, which can affect 
          comparability and trend analysis. The Company generally provides 
          separate projections for expected comparable center NOI growth and 
          lease cancellation income. Comparable centers are generally defined 
          as centers that were owned and open for the entire current and 
          preceding period presented, excluding centers impacted by 
          significant redevelopment activity.
        







           
        







          The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT) 
          defines Funds from Operations (FFO) as net income (computed in 
          accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP)), 
          excluding gains (or losses) from extraordinary items and sales of 
          properties and impairment write-downs of depreciable real estate, 
          plus real estate related depreciation and after adjustments for 
          unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. The Company believes 
          that FFO is a useful supplemental measure of operating performance 
          for REITs. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets 
          implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes 
          predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have 
          historically risen or fallen with market conditions, the Company and 
          most industry investors and analysts have considered presentations 
          of operating results that exclude historical cost depreciation to be 
          useful in evaluating the operating performance of REITs. The Company 
          primarily uses FFO in measuring performance and in formulating 
          corporate goals and compensation.
        







           
        







          The Company may also present adjusted versions of NOI, beneficial 
          interest in EBITDA, and FFO when used by management to evaluate 
          operating performance when certain significant items have impacted 
          results that affect comparability with prior or future periods due 
          to the nature or amounts of these items. The Company believes the 
          disclosure of the adjusted items is similarly useful to investors 
          and others to understand management's view on comparability of such 
          measures between periods. For the three and six month periods ended 
          June 30, 2017, FFO and EBITDA were adjusted to exclude a 
          restructuring charge and costs incurred associated with shareowner 
          activism. For the six months ended June 30, 2017, FFO was also 
          adjusted for a charge recognized in connection with the partial 
          write-off of deferred financing costs related to an amendment of the 
          Company's primary unsecured revolving line of credit in February 
          2017. For the six months ended June 30, 2017, EBITDA was also 
          adjusted to exclude a gain recognized in connection with the sale of 
          the Valencia Place office tower at Country Club Plaza. For the three 
          and six month periods ended June 30, 2016, FFO and EBITDA were 
          adjusted to exclude the lump sum payment received in May 2016 for

          These non-GAAP measures as presented by the Company are not 
          necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures used by other 
          REITs due to the fact that not all REITs use the same definitions. 
          These measures should not be considered alternatives to net income 
          or as an indicator of the Company's operating performance. 
          Additionally, these measures do not represent cash flows from 
          operating, investing, or financing activities as defined by GAAP.
        







           
        







          The Company provides its beneficial interest in certain financial 
          information of its Unconsolidated Joint Ventures. This beneficial 
          information is derived as the Company’s ownership interest in the 
          investee multiplied by the specific financial statement item being 
          presented. Investors are cautioned that deriving the Company’s 
          beneficial interest in this manner may not accurately depict the 
          legal and economic implications of holding a non-controlling 
          interest in the investee.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

Taubman Centers, Inc.


	Taubman Centers, Inc., is a real estate investment trust that owns and operates major retail environments—including regional shopping malls—throughout North America. Taubman set out to change the way they had always worked by looking to develop an open, collaborative workspace for 300 employees at the Company's headquarters in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, a suburb of Detroit. Taubman worked with Landry Newman Architects to design a new space with a light, clean aesthetic and selected the Knoll Dividends® office system for the open plan and the Reff™ system for private offices.

	Defining the modern office with a diverse product offering, distinguishing details and unparalleled flexibility, Dividends brings practical, effective and aesthetic solutions to the workplace. Dividends with glass stacking panels and Calibre storage and ergonomic Life® chairs organize the open plan. In the office of Taubman's CFO, a classic Florence Knoll table desk and Brno chairs by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe create a stylish KnollStudio® environment, with a Life chair featuring an optional leather seat topper. Another office features the natural beauty of the Reff system, with Open Up side chairs.
