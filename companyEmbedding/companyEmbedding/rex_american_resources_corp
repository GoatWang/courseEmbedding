    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

						REX American Resources Corporation, headquartered in Dayton Ohio.









					In fiscal 2009 REX completed its transformation out of retail as we closed our remaining retail locations.  
					Recognizing the Company's transition primarily into alternative energy, on June 10, 2010, we 
					changed the Company's name to: 

                                               
                                    
					






					
					
					
													
					as it more closely reflects the Company's focus today. In conjunction with the name change we also changed our stock symbol to "REX."
					We think these changes help build awareness and recognition for our company within the investment community, as well as facilitate the
					number of relevant investment opportunities that are brought to us.
					

















REX American Resources senior management, members of the Board of Directors and guests commemorate the
30th anniversary of the company's listing on the NYSE with the ringing of The Closing Bell® on April 7,2016.

						REX American Resources Corporation, headquartered in Dayton Ohio.









					In fiscal 2009 REX completed its transformation out of retail as we closed our remaining retail locations.  
					Recognizing the Company's transition primarily into alternative energy, on June 10, 2010, we 
					changed the Company's name to: 

                                               
                                    
					






					
					
					
													
					as it more closely reflects the Company's focus today. In conjunction with the name change we also changed our stock symbol to "REX."
					We think these changes help build awareness and recognition for our company within the investment community, as well as facilitate the
					number of relevant investment opportunities that are brought to us.
					

















REX American Resources senior management, members of the Board of Directors and guests commemorate the
30th anniversary of the company's listing on the NYSE with the ringing of The Closing Bell® on April 7,2016.

Financial Analysis
REX AMERICAN RESOURCES CORP's gross profit margin for the first quarter of its fiscal year 2017 has increased when compared to the same period a year ago. The company has grown sales and net income during the past quarter when compared with the same quarter a year ago, however, it was unable to keep up with the growth of the average competitor within its industry. REX AMERICAN RESOURCES CORP  is extremely liquid. Currently, the Quick Ratio is 8.82 which clearly shows the ability to cover any short-term cash needs. The company's liquidity has decreased from the same period last year. During the same period, stockholders' equity ("net worth") has increased by 11.37% from the same quarter last year. Overall, the key liquidity measurements indicate that the company is very unlikely to face financial difficulties in the near future. STOCKS TO BUY: TheStreet Quant Ratings has identified a handful of stocks that can potentially TRIPLE in the next 12-months. To learn more visit www.TheStreetRatings.com.

Valuation
BUY.  The current P/E ratio indicates a significant discount compared to an average of 55.33 for the Oil, Gas & Consumable Fuels industry and a discount compared to the S&P 500 average of 24.66. To use another comparison, its price-to-book ratio of 1.83 indicates a discount versus the S&P 500 average of 3.07 and a significant discount versus the industry average of 79.95. The price-to-sales ratio is well below both the S&P 500 average and the industry average, indicating a discount. Upon assessment of these and other key valuation criteria, REX AMERICAN RESOURCES CORP proves to trade at a discount to investment alternatives within the industry.
