			Daniel N. Swisher Jr., 54, has served as a member of our Board since June 2011 and has served as Chair of the Board since October 2013. Mr. Swisher has served as the Chief Executive Officer of Sunesis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Sunesis, and a member of its board of directors since January 2004 and as its President since August 2005. From December 2001 to December 2003, he served as the Chief Business Officer and Chief Financial Officer of Sunesis. From June 1992 to September 2001, Mr. Swisher served in various management roles, including Senior Vice President of Sales and Marketing, for ALZA Corporation. He also serves on the board of directors of Corcept Therapeutics Incorporated, or Corcept Therapeutics, a pharmaceutical company. Mr. Swisher holds a B.A. from Yale University and an M.B.A. from the Stanford Graduate School of Business. 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the Board concluded that Mr. Swisher continues to be a valuable member of the Board based upon his relevant senior leadership experience acquired in executive leadership positions with Sunesis and ALZA Corporation, including as the former Chief Financial Officer and current Chief Executive Officer of Sunesis. Mr. Swisher also brings a high level of financial experience acquired in his roles as Chief Financial Officer and now Chief Executive Officer of Sunesis, which contributes significantly to Audit Committee and Board discussions on financial matters. As a former Senior Vice President of Sales and Marketing, Mr. Swisher also brings unique sales and marketing experience to Board, which is critical as we continue to expand our U.S. and overseas sales operations. 
While the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the Board recognize that Mr. Swisher serves as a director of both Sunesis and Corcept Therapeutics, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the Board believe that Mr. Swisher has demonstrated his ability to dedicate sufficient time to, and to focus on, his duties as a director of Cerus, including his role as a member of our Audit Committee and a member of our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. In 2016, Mr. Swisher attended all meetings held by our Board, our Audit Committee and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. Mr. Swisher serves only on board committees for Corcept Therapeutics, where he serves on the Audit Committee, and Cerus. Mr. Swisher attended all of the meetings of the boards of Sunesis and Corcept Therapeutics and the committees on which he served that were held in 2016. In addition to perfect attendance at all meetings of our Board and our Audit Committee during 2016, Mr. Swisher is highly engaged with management and other members of our Board, regularly meeting in advance of Board to assist with planning and discussion topics, as well as at other times to discuss developments that our management would like to bring to the Board on an informal basis. In accordance with our Board's standard practice, Mr. Swisher reviews scheduled Cerus Board and committee meeting dates a year in advance to confirm availability to participate and attend all Board and committee meetings. All of the companies for which he serves as a director are located in the San Francisco Bay Area, and Mr. Swisher does not serve on the boards of any privately-held, for-profit entities.
