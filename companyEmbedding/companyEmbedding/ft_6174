How Venezuela chaos could spark oil rally OPEC has failed to achieve 
              
              Political and economic turmoil in Venezuela could fuel a rise in oil prices—something the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, despite it’s efforts to cut back production, hasn’t been able to do.

What a constant stream of oil company spending cuts means for crude prices
              
              Oil companies are sounding a recurring theme: lower exploration and production spending estimates. Will that lead to a rally in oil prices?

              Millennials are frequently criticized by market experts for the way they invest—or, more accurately, the way they’re not investing—but recent research indicates that at least some young market participants are going about things in a more sophisticated way than they’re typically given credit for.

This soft, unpolished, natural cotton blend twine is a medium weight twine that handles well and knots easily. It is the preferred choice for general use in tying packages. Other popular uses include: recycling, handyman tasks, kitchen use, craft projects, and gardening. Cotton twine is able to absorb high amounts of water. It is the only fiber known that increases in strength with more moisture content . The cones are ideal for automatic tying machines.
