THE NANO MOBILE SENSOR
 Your browser does not support the video tag.

Nano Mobile Healthcare is developing a sensor that will screen for the Volatile Organic Compound signatures in a person’s breath. Our device and application (working with any smart phone, laptop or tablet) will be able to identify the presence of lung cancer from a single exhalation. Results will be able to be viewed by patient and doctor in-the-moment and when treatment options are discussed. The Nano Mobile Sensor was developed to address one of the longest standing unmet medical needs today which involves early stage lung cancer detection and to do so in an affordable, non-invasive, safe and convenient way.
Similarly, the device will be used by law enforcement to detect the presence of marijuana on a driver’s breath. As more and more states legislate the use of marijuana for medical use the risk of driving while drugged increases as does the death toll. Currently, this represents a significant unmet need as law enforcement struggles with multiple interventions to attempt to assess the condition of drivers that, if not legally intoxicated, appear to be drugged. The Nano Mobile Sensor and its application will provide in-the-moment results with a goal of making our roads safer for all drivers and creating a more effective tool for law enforcement.

Marijuana
ABC
“In the September 11, 2014 ABC News World News Tonight newscast, Clayton Sandell reported from Denver that, ‘There is no breathalyzer test and results from drawing blood can take weeks. Plus experts say seasoned users are less impaired with more in their blood and newer users are going to be impaired with less in their blood.’”Learn more about Our Solution to the Unmet Need.

CBS
CBS News Correspondent Barry Peterson reported on 'CBS This Morning' on March 16, 2014 that “An officer makes a roadside assessment if he suspects marijuana, but unlike alcohol, it can't be detected with a breathalyzer test. Marijuana does however, have a limit - five nanograms of active THC in your blood, but the only way to measure whether someone has reached or passed that limit is in a hospital with a blood test.”Learn more about Our Solution to the Unmet Need.

[OTCB: VNTH] Stock Quote Press Releases Investor FAQs SEC Filings
Nano Mobile Healthcare, Inc. | Investor Fact Sheet
Nano Mobile Healthcare, Inc. (OTCQB: VNTH) – Founded in 2010 and headquartered in New York City and Mountain View, CA is a leading mobile health technology company developing point-of-care screening using Apps based upon chemical sensing residing within a small Bluetooth enabled device that works with any smartphone, tablet or laptop called the Nano Mobile Sensor.
INVESTMENT HIGHLIGHTS
With its foundations in advanced nanotechnology, the Company’s first product, the Nano Mobile Sensor, is the convergence of nano-electronics, bio-informatics, and wireless technology to create the next generation mobile health application.
NASA Invention of the Year was awarded in April 2013.
NASA grants five-year exclusive worldwide license to the company for IP associated with all patents issued and pending for commercialization in areas of healthcare and narcotics.
Strategic Partnership for Mobile Health Technology with Scripps Translational Science Institute is announced.
FDA clinical trials are expected to start in 2015 and commercialization in 2016 for the Lung Cancer App.
Total Addressable Market for lung cancer (four main global regions) one year is $3.0 Billion for Healthcare Providers.
Marketing initially to Healthcare Providers through strategic large pharmaceutical partners.
Business model is subscription based with recurring revenue occurring after purchase of device and monthly subscription fee per application.
Business model delivers value to all parties (Healthcare Providers, Pharmacy, Patients and Insurance Companies).
Ongoing research collaborations with NASA and the Scripps Translational Science Institute.
 
OUR TECHNOLOGY – THE NANO MOBILE SENSOR
The Nano Mobile Sensor was birthed via  NASA by taking care of the astronauts in space, ensuring the quality of their air was free of carbon monoxide and other noxious gases. Our founder and Chief Scientist, before his life here at Nano Mobile, was a rocket scientist himself and repurposed the device with other scientists on the sensor team, to read our breath signature.
Everyone’s breath is composed of Volatile Organic Compounds and combinations of them can form giving Doctors indications of various illnesses that are present in our bodies.  Those same VOC compounds can be used to detect marijuana and other legal and illegal drugs present in our bodies.
The Nano Mobile Sensor is designed to screen for these various combinations so the doctor can identify them before symptoms appear, such as a tumor that appears when patients have a CT scan, which means patients will have many more treatment options available.
The fact that this technology will be Bluetooth enabled means that the Nano Mobile Sensor is small and compact and works with any smartphone, tablet or laptop making the data collected in real-time and immediately available for analysis to doctor and patient. In the case of law enforcement it means that an officer can detect in real time whether a driver has marijuana present in their body.
The Nano Mobile Sensor will automatically self-flush after each use so the Healthcare Provider can use the sensor with different patients as well as use the same sensor for different screening applications.  In the case of law enforcement the officer can test the driver of all involved and get the results in real time.
 
THE UNMET NEED AND SOLUTIONS FOR CANCER DETECTION
There are more deaths from Lung Cancer than from Prostate, Breast and Colorectal combined.
Only 15 percent of lung cancer cases are screened at an early stage.
The five-year survival rate for lung cancer is 67% percent for cases detected at stage 1A when the disease is still localized.
For stage 4 lung cancer, the five-year survival rate is only 2.5 percent and this is why most people with stage 4 lung cancer die within one year of being diagnosed.
There is an opportunity for low cost non-invasive detection of this disease at its earliest stages when treatment options are many and varied and lives can be saved.
Our Vision involves a Nano Mobile Sensor for each Healthcare Provider with the desire to screen for early indications of lung cancer.
We believe Healthcare Provider and patients will find breath analysis attractive – non-invasive, painless, having no side effects and available at an extremely low cost.
Our goal is to, with a strategic partner(s), commercialize mobile breath sensor technologies, with initial screening for lung cancer, that enable Healthcare Provider to better manage the health care continuum from managing illness to managing wellness.
Early, non-invasive, inexpensive lung cancer screening is the first step in reducing deaths and lowering healthcare costs.
Once the lung cancer application is launched (expected in 2016), Nano Mobile will start work on the next applications in the pipeline related to breast cancer, colorectal cancer, prostate cancer and other cancers and infectious diseases.
 
THE UNMET NEED AND SOLUTIONS FOR MOBILE MARIJUANA DETECTION
Marijuana is the number one illicit drug in America and the concentrations of THC in marijuana is three times more powerful than in the 1980’s.  Fatalities from marijuana use by drivers is rising.
At a time when we are seeing an increase in state by state legislative approvals for medical marijuana, it is inevitable that increased marijuana use will also correlate to impaired driving. Law enforcement needs mobile technology to save lives.
Law enforcement will need the Nano Mobile Sensor for detecting drivers under the influence of marijuana so they may in turn help protect our communities and save lives.
Nano Mobile, through its majority shareholder Nanobeak, is working with NASA to develop a capability which would specifically result in a test for marijuana.

CT Screening of People at Very High Risk for Lung Cancer -- Memorial Sloan-Kettering

Published May 21, 2012 by Memorial Sloan Kettering with Peter Bach, and epidemiologist and pulmonary and critical care physician.


Peter Bach, an epidemiologist and a pulmonary and critical care physician, explains that physicians and researchers have been searching for a way to effectively screen for lung cancer for more than 40 years. Dr. Bach, who sees patients with lung disease and directs Memorial Sloan-Kettering's Center for Health Policy and Outcomes, discusses new findings that CT screening of very high risk people may detect lung cancer earlier and improve the effectiveness of treatment. This research, led by Dr. Bach and members of four major medical societies, has led to new CT screening recommendations for a particular group of people between 55 and 74 years old who have smoked a significant amount for many years.

AND  MEET OUR INVESTORS: NANOBEAK MAJOR INVESTOR John Groman  CURRENT:   NANOBEAK Mobile (Stage 1 lung cancer detection) is the first sensor and app planned to be released in 2018. John Groman's History Excerpt Nanobeak History Summary My (John Groman) latest venture is a private medical device company that has a non-invasive, sensor and app that will detect stage one lung cancer as well as other detections offered at the price of $1 per test (wholesale). The technology combines our exclusive NASA license of four issued patents and two pending patents with the biomarker research and human trial data from our medical partner Johns Hopkins along with our own proprietary IP. The Sensor and app provide results in real time and will work with all Smartphones, Tablets, Laptops and Desktops.  Nanobeak, Inc, May 2013 - Present (4 years 1 month) Bella Sante, Chairman & Founder  - December 1993 – Present (23 years 6 months) Eames Capital Partners, LLC March 2013 – Present (4 years 3 months) Epsilon - Co Founder and EVP November 1969 – January 2000 (30 years 3 months) Greater Boston Area Advertising and database marketing agency  Education   Harvard Business School   NANOBEAK IS THE PARENT COMPANY OF NANO MOBILE HEALTHCARE  Images and some literature is courtesy of http://nanomobilehealthcare.com/      NANOTECHNOLOGY    The Nano Mobile Sensor detects chemicals and Volatile Organic Compounds using Carbon Nanotubes. The sensor was Awarded the NASA Invention of the Year :   http://www.spacefoundation.org/programs/space-certification/certified-products/space-technology/nanobeak-sensor           INFORMATION PROVIDED DIRECTLY FROM:        THE NANO MOBILE HEALTHCARE      'NANOBEAK' Development Team  PARENT COMPANY: Vantage mHealthcare Inc.

Our device and application (working with any smart phone, laptop or tablet) will be able to identify the presence of lung cancer from a single exhalation. Results will be able to be viewed by patient and doctor in-the-moment and when treatment options are discussed. The Nano Mobile Sensor was developed to address one of the longest standing unmet medical needs today which involves early stage lung cancer detection and to do so in an affordable, non-invasive, safe and convenient way.  http://nanomobilehealthcare.com/                              Vantage Health News History      USA TODAY - The Future Of Health Care Is Social And Techie http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/columnist/shinal/2014/03/08/health-apps-sxsw-shinal/6205491/   ISSUU - Government Health Care United States Buyers Guide: Winter 2014 http://issuu.com/govworld/docs/govt._health_care_winter/10?e=0/6390099  Meditek - Could A Smartphone Detect Lung Cancer?  http://www.mediteksurgical.com/smartphone-article/    Mobile Health News - Scripps To Test NASA-Developed, Smartphone-Enabled Lung Cancer Sensor http://mobihealthnews.com/29840/scripps-to-test-nasa-developed-smartphone-enabled-lung-cancer-sensor   Strategic Partnerships We have entered into a strategic partnership with Theranostics Laboratory, a translational research company, with offices in the USA and New Zealand. Theranostics Laboratory was founded at the Cleveland Clinic in 2010 and works on subcontracted research, in collaboration with the Auckland Bioengineering Institute (ABI), in New Zealand, and with NASA (via NASA Grant NCC 9-58). The Auckland Bioengineering Institute is recognized as a world-leader in the field of personalized modeling and is part of the international Virtual Physiologic Human (VPH) project. The Institute has successfully commercialized numerous mHealth technologies, including wireless telemetry systems, wearable sensors and a needle-free injectable system into the US market. The partnership between the Theranostics Laboratory and the Auckland Bioengineering Institute (ABI) is a strategic alliance for us through which the lab will act as principal investigators for us in the areas of mobile strep detection, mobile virus detection and other related areas including breath sample conditioning methodologies. The partnership gives us access to world-class expertise and skill in the field of personalized modeling.. We are working in conjunction with Nanobeak, LLC, a strategic partner, as well as NASA, to develop a mobile app to be used in connection with our sensor that will enable law enforcement to screen for marijuana use and deliver in-the-moment results to the officer’s smartphone, tablet or laptop in the field. Given the increase of marijuana legalization and decriminalization efforts by a growing number of states, we have made the development of a law enforcement sensor the short-term priority. There is a growing need on the part of law enforcement across the country for a portable sensor to detect marijuana abuse and impaired driving. We also plan to incorporate alcohol detection along with the marijuana sensing capability in one device so that law enforcement can have the capability to detect both alcohol (DUI breathalyzer) and marijuana abuse in a single device. The law enforcement device offers a quicker path to market based on reduced testing and regulatory requirements as compared to a medical diagnostic device. Regulatory Approval Our products as well as our research and development activities are regulated by numerous governmental authorities, principally the U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA), as well as state and foreign regulatory agencies. In the US, we believe that the medical diagnostic devices will be classified by the FDA as Class II medical devices and require clearance through a Form 510K. There can be no assurance that the FDA will provide marketing clearance for the device. Manufacturing, Distribution, Sales We intend to outsource manufacturing, distribution and sales but we have not entered into any definitive agreements for these functions. Competition We intend to compete with other detection devices by offering products that have enhanced value, ease of use, simple functionality, compatibility with various platforms, reliability, attractive price and are high in quality. The Company also believes its intellectual property provides an advantage over current competitors. Disease Screening There are a variety of methods to screen for the presence of disease. We are focused on non-invasive, point of care diagnostics. Following years of research, a number of companies are now in prototype phase with devices that can test the chemical compounds in a person’s breath and identify the early stages of disease. Entry to this market is expected to continue and sharply rise as more prototypes emerge and begin to gain market entry with commercialized products. While companies in development tend to be small and privately owned, there has been entry by larger publicly owned companies that have greater financial reserves, distribution channels and more experience in commercialization. Acquisitions and collaborations by and companies seeking a competitive advantage also affect the competitive environment. This is a global market, evidenced by the emergence of companies bringing competitive solutions from different parts of the world. New competitors may emerge and may develop products and capabilities which compete directly with our products. No assurance can be given that we will be successful in competing in the industries identified or in other industries that would benefit from our technology. Customers for our medical diagnostic products is expected to include health care providers such as medical doctors, nurse practitioners and physician assistants. Narcotics Screening There are currently a variety of breathalyzer smartphone apps which essentially focus on alcohol detection. We are developing devices to distinguish between alcohol and narcotics and screen for a variety of narcotics both legal and illicit. Making up the narcotic detection space are both domestic and international organizations that range from small, privately held companies to larger companies that include an array of diagnostic narcotics solutions. Although this market is more developed than disease detection, the space is dominated by a few key players making the possibility for new entrants feasible. Because toxicology screens are the most common type of narcotics testing products on the market, we believe that advanced technology that both detects and monitors discrete drug levels in an individual’s system through exhalation will cause this market to expand. The consumer market for mobile applications which provide detection and ongoing monitoring capabilities is anticipated to be significant. Customers for our product will include the different areas of law enforcement as well as the different areas of professional and amateur sports. Corporations are also a target area for the narcotics screening technology. Employees We outsource all of our non-executive functions to Nanobeak, LLC. As of the date of this filing Nanobeak has 18 employees and consultants, both full and part time, most of which are shared with NASA and other contractors. The employees are not presently covered by any collective bargaining agreement.         Presentation: Thursday, May 18 – 10:35 AM – 10:45 AM:  http://unbelievable.very-good-idea.com/watch.php?vid=9d62b79ea  3 Columbus Circle, 15th Floor, New York, NY 10019 Phone: (212) 520-4950 | www.nanobeak.com Category: Chemical Sensor Technology Innovation: Nanobeak      Charts:

					Full Description



Nano Mobile Healthcare, Inc., incorporated on January 9, 2015, is a mobile health technology company. The Company is developing personalized and point-of-care screening using applications based upon chemical sensing methods. The Company's point-of-care screening device will detect and analyze common components from human breath and provide an early indication of chronic diseases, such as heart failure and various forms of cancer, as well as contagious diseases, such as strep throat. The Company's product, the Nano Mobile Sensor, is designed to screen for various combinations so the doctor can identify them before symptoms appear, such as a tumor that appears when patients have a computed tomography (CT) scan, which means patients will have many more treatment options available. The sensor can connect through Bluetooth to any smart device running an iPhone operating system (iOS) or Android operating system.The Nano Mobile Sensor will automatically self-flush after each use so the healthcare provider can use the sensor with different patients, as well as use the same sensor for different screening applications. The Nano Mobile Sensor detects chemicals and volatile organic compounds using Carbon Nanotubes. The Company is also working on a device to enable law enforcement to detect marijuana use. The Breathalyzer utilizes engineering design techniques, nanotechnology and bio-informatics to collect sample data from test patients for certain key biomarkers in a clinical setting, including Breath Capture Device, Sensor Module and Application/Software for the Smart Devices. The Breath Capture Device component of the device attaches to the sensor module, captures breath from patient's mouth, pre-filters the breath, and sends it to the sensor module at a controlled flow rate. The Breath Capture Device includes the solution to monitor respiratory rate, lung function, heart rate and core body temperature.The Sensor Module component of the device contains an array filled with dozens of micro-fabricated nanomaterial-based chemical sensors, device hardware, and a battery pack. Each of these individual sensors is coated with specially formulated sensing materials that will show high sensitivity and specificity towards detecting biomarkers known by medical experts to be associated with particular diseases. The Application/Software for the Smart Devices component of the device communicates with smart devices using an iOS/Android application, which is used to interpret and present the results collected by the Sensor Module, and can be updated as the medical team collects sample calibration data. It can also be calibrated to detect other diseases when sample data for those are collected. The sensor and related devices demonstrate an integrated approach that can be used to collect data from human breath and evaluate it for early disease screening purposes. As of March 31, 2016, the Company had not generated any revenues.

Nano Mobile Healthcare’s Board and its Parent Company Approve Share Exchange Reducing Total Shares Outstanding | Business Wire


























































Nano Mobile Healthcare’s Board and its Parent Company Approve Share 
      Exchange Reducing Total Shares Outstanding






September 10, 2015 04:15 PM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nano Mobile Healthcare (OTCQB: VNTH), (“Nano Mobile” or the “Company”) 
      has announced its board of directors has agreed to exchange common 
      shares into preferred shares with Nanobeak LLC.
    

      The Company entered into an exchange agreement (the “Exchange 
      Agreement”) with its majority shareholder, Nanobeak, LLC (“Nanobeak”), 
      pursuant to which Nanobeak exchanged 117,366,840 shares of the Company’s 
      common stock, par value $0.001 (the “Common Stock”), in exchange for 
      23,473,368 shares of the Company’s Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, 
      par value $0.001 (the “Series A Convertible Preferred”).
    

      The 117,366,840 shares of the Company’s common stock have been returned 
      to Treasury, which has materially reduced the total shares outstanding 
      of Nano Mobile Healthcare.
    

      The new preferred shares represent a new class of stock of which 
      Nanobeak is the sole shareholder. Nanobeak will retain its voting rights 
      as if it were a common shareholder. Given that there is no market for 
      the preferred shares, Nanobeak has demonstrated its intentions as a 
      long-term shareholder of the Company.

NANO MOBILE WILL MAKE EARLY STAGE CANCER SCREENINGS AVAILABLE TO HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS AND THEIR PATIENTS IN REAL TIME

THE NANO MOBILE SENSOR
 Your browser does not support the video tag.

Nano Mobile Healthcare is developing a sensor that will screen for the Volatile Organic Compound signatures in a person’s breath. Our device and application (working with any smart phone, laptop or tablet) will be able to identify the presence of lung cancer from a single exhalation. Results will be able to be viewed by patient and doctor in-the-moment and when treatment options are discussed. The Nano Mobile Sensor was developed to address one of the longest standing unmet medical needs today which involves early stage lung cancer detection and to do so in an affordable, non-invasive, safe and convenient way.
Similarly, the device will be used by law enforcement to detect the presence of marijuana on a driver’s breath. As more and more states legislate the use of marijuana for medical use the risk of driving while drugged increases as does the death toll. Currently, this represents a significant unmet need as law enforcement struggles with multiple interventions to attempt to assess the condition of drivers that, if not legally intoxicated, appear to be drugged. The Nano Mobile Sensor and its application will provide in-the-moment results with a goal of making our roads safer for all drivers and creating a more effective tool for law enforcement.
