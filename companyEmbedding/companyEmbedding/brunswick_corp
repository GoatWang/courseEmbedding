Company Fact Book (PDF)

Ethics Program Directory(PDF)



Today, Brunswick is a market leader in the marine, fitness and billiards industries. We have made a commitment to focus our efforts on our core businesses and, as a result, have drawn upon decades of experience to design, build and market world-class recreational products. No company has Brunswick’s breadth and scope in the marine industry. No company rivals Brunswick’s quality and innovation in fitness equipment. And no company possesses Brunswick’s knowledge and heritage in billiards.
As evidenced by our current portfolio of businesses, we are a different company today than we were 165 years, 25 years or even five years ago, and we have an ambitious road before us. Despite our evolution, two fundamentals remain consistent:
• Our goal to be the best—and all it entails—in any industry in which we participate.
						• Our ability to create and unlock value in our varying portfolio of businesses.

History[edit]




J. M. Brunswick.






Delivery with horse carriage 1848.


Brunswick was founded by John Moses Brunswick who came to the United States from Switzerland at the age of 15. The J. M. Brunswick Manufacturing Company opened for business on September 15, 1845, in Cincinnati, Ohio. Originally J. M. Brunswick intended his company to be mainly in the business of making carriages, but soon after opening his machine shop, he became fascinated with billiards and decided that making billiard tables would be more lucrative, as the better tables then in use in the United States were imported from England. Brunswick billiard tables were a commercial success, and the business expanded and opened up the first of what would become many branch offices in Chicago, Illinois in 1848. It was later renamed J. M. Brunswick & Brother by 1871, after a family member came on board, and the company's rather hyperbolic slogan at this time was: "The oldest and most extensive billiard table manufacturers in the United States".[3]




H .W Collender Billiard Manufactory, Stanford, New York, 1870s


In 1874, the Brunswick company merged with competitor Great Western Billiard Manufactory owned by Julius Balke to become the J. M. Brunswick & Balke Company. It was incorporated in 1879 with a capital stock of $275,000, the same year it merged with another competitor, H. W. Collender Company of New York City (founded by Hugh W. Collender), to acquire Collender's patented billiard cushions. In 1884, the partners formed the Brunswick-Balke-Collender Company (or B.B.C. Company for short[4]) with capital of $1.5 million.[clarification needed]

The company expanded into making a number of other products. Large ornate neo-classical style bars for saloons were a popular product. Bowling balls, pins, and equipment led a growing line of sporting equipment. It popularized bowling balls of manufactured materials, vulcanized rubber at first; earlier bowling balls had been solid wood.
In the early 20th century, Brunswick expanded the product line to include such diverse products as toilet seats, automobile tires, and phonographs. In the late 1910s, they introduced a quickly-popular line of disc phonograph records, under the name Brunswick Records. In 1930, Brunswick sold the control of the record company to Warner Brothers and came out with a line of refrigerators.
During World War II, Brunswick-Balke-Collender made small target-drone aircraft for the U.S. military. After the war, Brunswick introduced a line of school furniture. In 1955, the Brunswick "Model A" Mechanical Pinsetter fully automated unit premiered, for the purpose of handling bowling pins for the sport of tenpins, in competition with American Machine and Foundry (AMF). Previously, Brunswick had made two models of semi-automated, manually operated "spotting tables" for the tenpin sport, that the "Model A" unit replaced. The decade also saw the introduction of a line of golfing equipment to compete with AMF in the leisure products and sporting goods markets.
The Brunswick-Balke-Collender Company officially changed its name to the Brunswick Corporation on April 10, 1960. The following year the company reported sales of $422 million. Brunswick acquired Mercury Marine in 1961. In the 1970s, Brunswick introduced the automatic scorer, which electronically tallied the score instead of the bowler doing it by hand.
The Brunswick Corporation patented a machine gun using a delayed blowback operation using a fluted chamber as part of the operation.[5] Another platform was the Rifleman's Assault Weapon, an unusual grenade launcher that used a spherical shaped rocket propelled grenade.[6][7][8][9]
In the 1980s, Brunswick became a major maker of yachts and pleasure boats, whose brands include Bayliner, Boston Whaler, Maxum, Sea Ray, and Trophy.
During the Gulf War, Brunswick supplied the military with camouflage nets. They also made radomes for the Patriot missile. In 1997, Brunswick purchased the Roadmaster bicycle division, one of the last U.S. manufacturers of low-cost, mass-market bicycles. However, it became apparent that continued U.S. manufacture of such products was not viable in the presence of surging low-priced imports from overseas producers, primarily China. In 1999, Brunswick sold its Roadmaster bicycle division and brand to Pacific Cycle, who went on to acquire several U.S. bicycle brands for use on bicycles imported from China.
On Nov 30, 2001, Brunswick Corporation completed the acquisition of Hatteras Yachts, Inc. from Genmar Industries, Inc. for approximately $80 million in cash.[10]

Recent events[edit]
As of the early 21st century, the Brunswick Corporation still manufactures sporting and fitness equipment (Life Fitness, Hammer Strength, Parabody) in addition to boats (Sea Ray, Bayliner, Maxum, etc.) and marine engines under the Mercury Marine brand name.
In 2004, Brunswick acquired Lowe Boats. The same year, the company also purchased Northstar Technologies, a leading marine electronics provider based in Acton, Massachusetts, from Canadian Marconi Corporation (now CMC Electronics, a wholly owned subsidiary of Esterline Technologies Corporation). Brunswick then merged Navman, based in Auckland, New Zealand, with Northstar to make Northstar/Navman a supplier to the Brunswick Boat Groups. Brunswick also acquired Mx-Marine. When George Buckley, CEO at the time, left to join 3M in 2006, new leadership decided to sell Northstar, Navman and Mx-Marine. Navico now owns those three brands in addition to the Eagle, Lowrance, B&G, and Simrad lines.
On November 9, 2006, the company announced that it was closing two plants and downsizing the workforce by 650 employees, citing slow demand for new boats. Numerous other layoffs occurred prior to this in the Brunswick New Technologies division.
Brunswick reports that in the past five years, their international sales have grown at twice the rate of domestic sales. It has established regional headquarters in Verviers, Belgium; Monterrey, Dandenong, Australia; and Dubai to better serve its customers by designing, engineering, manufacturing and distributing products based on local needs, using local talent.[11]
On July 17, 2014, Brunswick announced its intention to leave the bowling business by the end of 2014. The company disclosed that it had agreed to sell the bowling center business, which brought in $187 million in revenue in the prior year, to competitor Bowlmor AMF for $270 million. It also disclosed that it had retained Lazard to find a buyer for its bowling equipment and products business. The company said it was making these changes to focus on its “core” Marine and Fitness businesses, which provided 92% of company net revenues in 2013. It will retain its heritage billiards business and report billiards financial results as part of the fitness segment.[12] The sale of the bowling center business to Bowlmor AMF was completed in September 2014.[13]
Brunswick completed its exit from the bowling business in May 2015 with the sale of the bowling equipment and products division to BlueArc Capital Management, a private investment firm based in Atlanta, GA. BlueArc completed the acquisition with investments from Gladstone Investment Corporation, a publicly traded business development company in McLean, Va., and Capitala Finance Corp., a business development company in Charlotte, N.C.[14]

History[edit]




J. M. Brunswick.






Delivery with horse carriage 1848.


Brunswick was founded by John Moses Brunswick who came to the United States from Switzerland at the age of 15. The J. M. Brunswick Manufacturing Company opened for business on September 15, 1845, in Cincinnati, Ohio. Originally J. M. Brunswick intended his company to be mainly in the business of making carriages, but soon after opening his machine shop, he became fascinated with billiards and decided that making billiard tables would be more lucrative, as the better tables then in use in the United States were imported from England. Brunswick billiard tables were a commercial success, and the business expanded and opened up the first of what would become many branch offices in Chicago, Illinois in 1848. It was later renamed J. M. Brunswick & Brother by 1871, after a family member came on board, and the company's rather hyperbolic slogan at this time was: "The oldest and most extensive billiard table manufacturers in the United States".[3]




H .W Collender Billiard Manufactory, Stanford, New York, 1870s


In 1874, the Brunswick company merged with competitor Great Western Billiard Manufactory owned by Julius Balke to become the J. M. Brunswick & Balke Company. It was incorporated in 1879 with a capital stock of $275,000, the same year it merged with another competitor, H. W. Collender Company of New York City (founded by Hugh W. Collender), to acquire Collender's patented billiard cushions. In 1884, the partners formed the Brunswick-Balke-Collender Company (or B.B.C. Company for short[4]) with capital of $1.5 million.[clarification needed]

The company expanded into making a number of other products. Large ornate neo-classical style bars for saloons were a popular product. Bowling balls, pins, and equipment led a growing line of sporting equipment. It popularized bowling balls of manufactured materials, vulcanized rubber at first; earlier bowling balls had been solid wood.
In the early 20th century, Brunswick expanded the product line to include such diverse products as toilet seats, automobile tires, and phonographs. In the late 1910s, they introduced a quickly-popular line of disc phonograph records, under the name Brunswick Records. In 1930, Brunswick sold the control of the record company to Warner Brothers and came out with a line of refrigerators.
During World War II, Brunswick-Balke-Collender made small target-drone aircraft for the U.S. military. After the war, Brunswick introduced a line of school furniture. In 1955, the Brunswick "Model A" Mechanical Pinsetter fully automated unit premiered, for the purpose of handling bowling pins for the sport of tenpins, in competition with American Machine and Foundry (AMF). Previously, Brunswick had made two models of semi-automated, manually operated "spotting tables" for the tenpin sport, that the "Model A" unit replaced. The decade also saw the introduction of a line of golfing equipment to compete with AMF in the leisure products and sporting goods markets.
The Brunswick-Balke-Collender Company officially changed its name to the Brunswick Corporation on April 10, 1960. The following year the company reported sales of $422 million. Brunswick acquired Mercury Marine in 1961. In the 1970s, Brunswick introduced the automatic scorer, which electronically tallied the score instead of the bowler doing it by hand.
The Brunswick Corporation patented a machine gun using a delayed blowback operation using a fluted chamber as part of the operation.[5] Another platform was the Rifleman's Assault Weapon, an unusual grenade launcher that used a spherical shaped rocket propelled grenade.[6][7][8][9]
In the 1980s, Brunswick became a major maker of yachts and pleasure boats, whose brands include Bayliner, Boston Whaler, Maxum, Sea Ray, and Trophy.
During the Gulf War, Brunswick supplied the military with camouflage nets. They also made radomes for the Patriot missile. In 1997, Brunswick purchased the Roadmaster bicycle division, one of the last U.S. manufacturers of low-cost, mass-market bicycles. However, it became apparent that continued U.S. manufacture of such products was not viable in the presence of surging low-priced imports from overseas producers, primarily China. In 1999, Brunswick sold its Roadmaster bicycle division and brand to Pacific Cycle, who went on to acquire several U.S. bicycle brands for use on bicycles imported from China.
On Nov 30, 2001, Brunswick Corporation completed the acquisition of Hatteras Yachts, Inc. from Genmar Industries, Inc. for approximately $80 million in cash.[10]

Recent events[edit]
As of the early 21st century, the Brunswick Corporation still manufactures sporting and fitness equipment (Life Fitness, Hammer Strength, Parabody) in addition to boats (Sea Ray, Bayliner, Maxum, etc.) and marine engines under the Mercury Marine brand name.
In 2004, Brunswick acquired Lowe Boats. The same year, the company also purchased Northstar Technologies, a leading marine electronics provider based in Acton, Massachusetts, from Canadian Marconi Corporation (now CMC Electronics, a wholly owned subsidiary of Esterline Technologies Corporation). Brunswick then merged Navman, based in Auckland, New Zealand, with Northstar to make Northstar/Navman a supplier to the Brunswick Boat Groups. Brunswick also acquired Mx-Marine. When George Buckley, CEO at the time, left to join 3M in 2006, new leadership decided to sell Northstar, Navman and Mx-Marine. Navico now owns those three brands in addition to the Eagle, Lowrance, B&G, and Simrad lines.
On November 9, 2006, the company announced that it was closing two plants and downsizing the workforce by 650 employees, citing slow demand for new boats. Numerous other layoffs occurred prior to this in the Brunswick New Technologies division.
Brunswick reports that in the past five years, their international sales have grown at twice the rate of domestic sales. It has established regional headquarters in Verviers, Belgium; Monterrey, Dandenong, Australia; and Dubai to better serve its customers by designing, engineering, manufacturing and distributing products based on local needs, using local talent.[11]
On July 17, 2014, Brunswick announced its intention to leave the bowling business by the end of 2014. The company disclosed that it had agreed to sell the bowling center business, which brought in $187 million in revenue in the prior year, to competitor Bowlmor AMF for $270 million. It also disclosed that it had retained Lazard to find a buyer for its bowling equipment and products business. The company said it was making these changes to focus on its “core” Marine and Fitness businesses, which provided 92% of company net revenues in 2013. It will retain its heritage billiards business and report billiards financial results as part of the fitness segment.[12] The sale of the bowling center business to Bowlmor AMF was completed in September 2014.[13]
Brunswick completed its exit from the bowling business in May 2015 with the sale of the bowling equipment and products division to BlueArc Capital Management, a private investment firm based in Atlanta, GA. BlueArc completed the acquisition with investments from Gladstone Investment Corporation, a publicly traded business development company in McLean, Va., and Capitala Finance Corp., a business development company in Charlotte, N.C.[14]

Brunswick Bowling & Billiards is the business segment of Brunswick Corporation that historically encompassed the following three divisions:

Billiards
Bowling centers (now owned by Bowlmor AMF)
Bowling equipment and products (now owned by BlueArc Capital Management)

Brunswick announced in July 2014 its intention to leave the bowling business by the end of 2014. As part of the announcement, the company disclosed that it had agreed to sell the bowling center business, which brought in $187 million in revenue in the prior year, to its much larger competitor Bowlmor AMF for $270 million. It also disclosed that it had retained Lazard to find a buyer for its bowling equipment and products business. The company said it was making these changes to focus on its “core” Marine and Fitness businesses, which provided 92% of company net revenues in 2013.[1] The sale of the bowling center division to Bowlmor AMF was completed in September 2014.[2]
Brunswick completed its exit from the bowling business in May 2015 with the sale of the bowling equipment and products division to BlueArc Capital Management, a private investment firm based in Atlanta, GA.

Billiards[edit]




Logo used by Brunswick Billiards


The billiards division was established in 1845 and is Brunswick Corporation's heritage business. Brunswick Billiards designs and/or markets billiards tables, table tennis tables, air powered table hockey games, and other gaming tables, as well as billiard balls, cues, game room furniture, and related accessories, under the Brunswick and Contender brands.[4] Consumer billiards equipment is predominantly sold in the United States and distributed primarily through dealers.[5]
John Brunswick built his first billiards table in 1845 at his woodworking shop in Cincinnati, Ohio, for a successful Chicago meatpacker. The popularity of billiards grew quickly, and by the late 1860s, the U.S. billiards market was dominated by Brunswick’s firm and two others. In 1873 Brunswick merged with one of his competitors, Julius Balke’s Cincinnati-based Great Western Billiard Manufactory, to form J.M. Brunswick & Balke Company. In 1884, the company merged with the other competitor, New York-based Phelan & Collender, to form the Brunswick-Balke-Collender Company. (The company name was changed to Brunswick Corporation in 1960.) The company grew quickly and added new product lines to its business in the 1880s. Brunswick began selling functional and decorative wooden backs for bars. Prohibition prompted a drastic change in the products offered by the company. And while the Depression was a difficult period for Brunswick, World War II brought a great deal of new business. The company's billiard products were popular in the United Service Organizations (USO) centers.[6]
More than 13,000 billiards tables were installed at military bases by 1945. In 1972 Brunswick Billiards began the design and manufacture air hockey tables. In 2008 the company introduced a line of game room furniture.[7]
Brunswick Billiards dabbled in retail at two points in its history. In 1947 the company opened "Cue and Cushion" establishments, family-friendly billiards establishments that include a lounge and soda fountain. In 2003 the company opened its first “Home & Billards Store” in the Chicago area, and went on to open one other store in Boston and two in Denver. All of these establishments were later closed, and the company now sells its products exclusively through dealers.[7]
Bowling[edit]
Bowling centers[edit]




Logo used by Brunswick bowling centers


Before its acquisition by Bowlmor AMF in October 2014, the Brunswick bowling center division was the second largest operator of bowling centers in the United States, with 88 centers in the US and Canada as of December 31, 2013. Bowlmor AMF has said it will operate the division as a stand-alone division and no changes are currently planned. Brunswick centers currently offer bowling and, depending on size and location, may also offer in-house restaurants, taverns, outdoor patios, billiards, video and redemption games, laser tag, pro shops and meeting and party rooms. The Brunswick bowling center brands are:[4][8]

Brunswick's - A new, upscale concept featuring plush decor and mood lighting, innovative cuisine as well as traditional "American pub fare," and a higher level of customer service. Three Brunswick's have been opened to date.
Brunswick Zone XL - Larger family entertainment centers, most of which have been built in the last decade and feature multiple entertainment offerings, representing 15 of the company's centers.
Brunswick Zone - Mostly traditional bowling centers that have been upgraded to provide a more family-friendly atmosphere, representing 37 of the company's centers.
Traditional bowling centers acquired over the years and rebranded with the Brunswick name.
Iconic bowling centers that have always performed well and were not rebranded.

Brunswick opened its first bowling centers in the 1960s in England, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Austria, Mexico, Peru, Sweden, Brazil, Italy, Switzerland, Finland and Australia.
In 1965, facing a decline in business after a period of rapid expansion, many privately owned centers found it difficult to pay the bills, and Brunswick took physical possession of 131 of these centers as payment for bowling equipment. In 1966, still suffering from the decline, Brunswick closed many European bowling centers.[7]
In 2007 the company opened its first Brunswick Zone XL centers, large, smoke-free facilities aimed at families, bowling leagues, parties, corporate meetings and group events, offering bowling, laser tag, bumper cars, video game arcades, Brunswick billiards tables, large screen TVs, and spacious meeting rooms.[7]
During 2013 Brunswick Bowling divested its seven remaining European bowling centers.[4]
Bowling equipment and products[edit]




Logo used for Brunswick bowling products


Now owned by BlueArc Capital Management of Atlanta, GA and its investor partners, the former Brunswick bowling equipment and products division designs, manufactures and markets a wide variety of bowling products.
The division's products for bowling centers include capital equipment, such as automatic pinsetters, bowling pins, "house" bowling balls, ball returns, lane surfaces, scoring systems, and bowling center furniture, as well as aftermarket products such as pinsetter parts, lane conditioning machines, and conditioners and cleaners for lane machines. The company's current pinsetter model is in the GS Series but many A Series models remain in active service in bowling centers around the world. Similarly, many centers still use Brunswick AS-80, AS-90, Classic, Frameworx, and Vector scoring systems while the currently-offered system is Vector Plus. Brunswick lane surfaces include the Anvilane and Pro Lane brands.[4]
The division's consumer products include its bowling balls as well as, through licensing arrangements, bowling shoes, bags and accessories. Products are marketed under the Brunswick, DV8, Radical, and other brand names.
Products are manufactured or sourced mainly from facilities located in Michigan and Wisconsin in the United States, as well as in Hungary and Mexico. Bowling products are sold through a direct sales force or distributors in the United States and through distributors in non-U.S. markets.[5]
Brunswick began production of wooden lanes, bowling balls, and bowling pins in the 1880s as taverns began to install bowling lanes. John Brunswick’s son-in-law Moses Bensinger, who was then directing Brunswick’s day-to-day operations, actively promoted bowling as a participatory sport and was instrumental in organizing the American Bowling Congress in 1895.[7][9]
In 1906 Bensinger opened a large manufacturing plant in Muskegon, Michigan. The plant became the cornerstone of the firm's manufacturing, producing such products as the revolutionary $20 Mineralite (hard rubber) bowling ball, and grew to over one million square feet by the 1940s. During World War II, United Service Organizations (USO) centers and military bases eagerly purchased bowling equipment, leading to more than 3,000 bowling lanes being installed at military bases by 1945.[7]
At the time, Brunswick manufactured “spotting tables” which were manually operated to place bowling pins in their proper places on a lane before a bowling ball was thrown at them. The company had toyed with the idea of an automatic pinsetter since 1911, when inventor Ernest Hedenskoog joined the company. Many of his patents provided the basis for the automatic pinsetter later introduced.[7]
It was not until the American Machine and Foundry Company (AMF) introduced the first fully automatic pinsetter in 1952 that Brunswick scrambled to get its own machine to market. In 1954 Brunswick formed the Brunswick-Murray Pinsetter Corporation with Murray Corporation of America, a manufacturer of components for autos and aircraft. By the time Brunswick’s “Model A” pinsetters were in production in 1955, Brunswick had bought out Murray.[9]
Brunswick's policy of selling pinsetters on credit, suburban expansion, and an aggressive advertising campaign all combined to make bowling centers enormously popular in the late 1950s. By the mid-1960s, however, overexpansion led to a period of decline. Brunswick had begun assembling bowling equipment in Dublin in 1959, but it closed its Italian factory in 1966 and the Dublin facility in 1972. Then, in 1973, it entered into a manufacturing joint venture with Fuji Kikai-Hiroshima. In 2005 Brunswick moved its bowling ball production to Reynosa, Mexico, and in 2006 it closed the Muskegon plant.[9]
In 1967 Brunswick introduced the automatic scorer. In 1984, Brunswick acquired the Schmid Company of Scherzenbach, Switzerland, and with it the rights to manufacture and sell its GS pinsetter.[9] The GS is Brunswick’s current pinsetter series. The mechanical portion of the pinsetter was originally manufactured in the Brunswick plant located in Stockach, Germany. In 1999 the mechanical manufacturing was relocated to Hungary.[10]

Billiards[edit]




Logo used by Brunswick Billiards


The billiards division was established in 1845 and is Brunswick Corporation's heritage business. Brunswick Billiards designs and/or markets billiards tables, table tennis tables, air powered table hockey games, and other gaming tables, as well as billiard balls, cues, game room furniture, and related accessories, under the Brunswick and Contender brands.[4] Consumer billiards equipment is predominantly sold in the United States and distributed primarily through dealers.[5]
John Brunswick built his first billiards table in 1845 at his woodworking shop in Cincinnati, Ohio, for a successful Chicago meatpacker. The popularity of billiards grew quickly, and by the late 1860s, the U.S. billiards market was dominated by Brunswick’s firm and two others. In 1873 Brunswick merged with one of his competitors, Julius Balke’s Cincinnati-based Great Western Billiard Manufactory, to form J.M. Brunswick & Balke Company. In 1884, the company merged with the other competitor, New York-based Phelan & Collender, to form the Brunswick-Balke-Collender Company. (The company name was changed to Brunswick Corporation in 1960.) The company grew quickly and added new product lines to its business in the 1880s. Brunswick began selling functional and decorative wooden backs for bars. Prohibition prompted a drastic change in the products offered by the company. And while the Depression was a difficult period for Brunswick, World War II brought a great deal of new business. The company's billiard products were popular in the United Service Organizations (USO) centers.[6]
More than 13,000 billiards tables were installed at military bases by 1945. In 1972 Brunswick Billiards began the design and manufacture air hockey tables. In 2008 the company introduced a line of game room furniture.[7]
Brunswick Billiards dabbled in retail at two points in its history. In 1947 the company opened "Cue and Cushion" establishments, family-friendly billiards establishments that include a lounge and soda fountain. In 2003 the company opened its first “Home & Billards Store” in the Chicago area, and went on to open one other store in Boston and two in Denver. All of these establishments were later closed, and the company now sells its products exclusively through dealers.[7]
Bowling[edit]
Bowling centers[edit]

Before its acquisition by Bowlmor AMF in October 2014, the Brunswick bowling center division was the second largest operator of bowling centers in the United States, with 88 centers in the US and Canada as of December 31, 2013. Bowlmor AMF has said it will operate the division as a stand-alone division and no changes are currently planned. Brunswick centers currently offer bowling and, depending on size and location, may also offer in-house restaurants, taverns, outdoor patios, billiards, video and redemption games, laser tag, pro shops and meeting and party rooms. The Brunswick bowling center brands are:[4][8]

Brunswick's - A new, upscale concept featuring plush decor and mood lighting, innovative cuisine as well as traditional "American pub fare," and a higher level of customer service. Three Brunswick's have been opened to date.
Brunswick Zone XL - Larger family entertainment centers, most of which have been built in the last decade and feature multiple entertainment offerings, representing 15 of the company's centers.
Brunswick Zone - Mostly traditional bowling centers that have been upgraded to provide a more family-friendly atmosphere, representing 37 of the company's centers.
Traditional bowling centers acquired over the years and rebranded with the Brunswick name.
Iconic bowling centers that have always performed well and were not rebranded.

Brunswick opened its first bowling centers in the 1960s in England, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Austria, Mexico, Peru, Sweden, Brazil, Italy, Switzerland, Finland and Australia.
In 1965, facing a decline in business after a period of rapid expansion, many privately owned centers found it difficult to pay the bills, and Brunswick took physical possession of 131 of these centers as payment for bowling equipment. In 1966, still suffering from the decline, Brunswick closed many European bowling centers.[7]
In 2007 the company opened its first Brunswick Zone XL centers, large, smoke-free facilities aimed at families, bowling leagues, parties, corporate meetings and group events, offering bowling, laser tag, bumper cars, video game arcades, Brunswick billiards tables, large screen TVs, and spacious meeting rooms.[7]
During 2013 Brunswick Bowling divested its seven remaining European bowling centers.[4]
Bowling equipment and products[edit]




Logo used for Brunswick bowling products


Now owned by BlueArc Capital Management of Atlanta, GA and its investor partners, the former Brunswick bowling equipment and products division designs, manufactures and markets a wide variety of bowling products.
The division's products for bowling centers include capital equipment, such as automatic pinsetters, bowling pins, "house" bowling balls, ball returns, lane surfaces, scoring systems, and bowling center furniture, as well as aftermarket products such as pinsetter parts, lane conditioning machines, and conditioners and cleaners for lane machines. The company's current pinsetter model is in the GS Series but many A Series models remain in active service in bowling centers around the world. Similarly, many centers still use Brunswick AS-80, AS-90, Classic, Frameworx, and Vector scoring systems while the currently-offered system is Vector Plus. Brunswick lane surfaces include the Anvilane and Pro Lane brands.[4]
The division's consumer products include its bowling balls as well as, through licensing arrangements, bowling shoes, bags and accessories. Products are marketed under the Brunswick, DV8, Radical, and other brand names.
Products are manufactured or sourced mainly from facilities located in Michigan and Wisconsin in the United States, as well as in Hungary and Mexico. Bowling products are sold through a direct sales force or distributors in the United States and through distributors in non-U.S. markets.[5]
Brunswick began production of wooden lanes, bowling balls, and bowling pins in the 1880s as taverns began to install bowling lanes. John Brunswick’s son-in-law Moses Bensinger, who was then directing Brunswick’s day-to-day operations, actively promoted bowling as a participatory sport and was instrumental in organizing the American Bowling Congress in 1895.[7][9]
In 1906 Bensinger opened a large manufacturing plant in Muskegon, Michigan. The plant became the cornerstone of the firm's manufacturing, producing such products as the revolutionary $20 Mineralite (hard rubber) bowling ball, and grew to over one million square feet by the 1940s. During World War II, United Service Organizations (USO) centers and military bases eagerly purchased bowling equipment, leading to more than 3,000 bowling lanes being installed at military bases by 1945.[7]
At the time, Brunswick manufactured “spotting tables” which were manually operated to place bowling pins in their proper places on a lane before a bowling ball was thrown at them. The company had toyed with the idea of an automatic pinsetter since 1911, when inventor Ernest Hedenskoog joined the company. Many of his patents provided the basis for the automatic pinsetter later introduced.[7]
It was not until the American Machine and Foundry Company (AMF) introduced the first fully automatic pinsetter in 1952 that Brunswick scrambled to get its own machine to market. In 1954 Brunswick formed the Brunswick-Murray Pinsetter Corporation with Murray Corporation of America, a manufacturer of components for autos and aircraft. By the time Brunswick’s “Model A” pinsetters were in production in 1955, Brunswick had bought out Murray.[9]
Brunswick's policy of selling pinsetters on credit, suburban expansion, and an aggressive advertising campaign all combined to make bowling centers enormously popular in the late 1950s. By the mid-1960s, however, overexpansion led to a period of decline. Brunswick had begun assembling bowling equipment in Dublin in 1959, but it closed its Italian factory in 1966 and the Dublin facility in 1972. Then, in 1973, it entered into a manufacturing joint venture with Fuji Kikai-Hiroshima. In 2005 Brunswick moved its bowling ball production to Reynosa, Mexico, and in 2006 it closed the Muskegon plant.[9]
In 1967 Brunswick introduced the automatic scorer. In 1984, Brunswick acquired the Schmid Company of Scherzenbach, Switzerland, and with it the rights to manufacture and sell its GS pinsetter.[9] The GS is Brunswick’s current pinsetter series. The mechanical portion of the pinsetter was originally manufactured in the Brunswick plant located in Stockach, Germany. In 1999 the mechanical manufacturing was relocated to Hungary.[10]

Brunswick Bowling & Billiards

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

Brunswick Bowling & Billiards is the business segment of Brunswick Corporation that historically encompassed the following three divisions:

Billiards
Bowling centers (now owned by Bowlmor AMF)
Bowling equipment and products (now owned by BlueArc Capital Management)

Brunswick announced in July 2014 its intention to leave the bowling business by the end of 2014. As part of the announcement, the company disclosed that it had agreed to sell the bowling center business, which brought in $187 million in revenue in the prior year, to its much larger competitor Bowlmor AMF for $270 million. It also disclosed that it had retained Lazard to find a buyer for its bowling equipment and products business. The company said it was making these changes to focus on its “core” Marine and Fitness businesses, which provided 92% of company net revenues in 2013.[1] The sale of the bowling center division to Bowlmor AMF was completed in September 2014.[2]
Brunswick completed its exit from the bowling business in May 2015 with the sale of the bowling equipment and products division to BlueArc Capital Management, a private investment firm based in Atlanta, GA. BlueArc completed the acquisition with investments from Gladstone Investment Corporation, a publicly traded business development company in McLean, Va., and Capitala Finance Corp., a business development company in Charlotte, N.C.[3]

The plant became the cornerstone of the firm's manufacturing, producing such products as the revolutionary $20 Mineralite (hard rubber) bowling ball, and grew to over one million square feet by the 1940s. During World War II, United Service Organizations (USO) centers and military bases eagerly purchased bowling equipment, leading to more than 3,000 bowling lanes being installed at military bases by 1945.[7]
At the time, Brunswick manufactured “spotting tables” which were manually operated to place bowling pins in their proper places on a lane before a bowling ball was thrown at them. The company had toyed with the idea of an automatic pinsetter since 1911, when inventor Ernest Hedenskoog joined the company. Many of his patents provided the basis for the automatic pinsetter later introduced.[7]
It was not until the American Machine and Foundry Company (AMF) introduced the first fully automatic pinsetter in 1952 that Brunswick scrambled to get its own machine to market. In 1954 Brunswick formed the Brunswick-Murray Pinsetter Corporation with Murray Corporation of America, a manufacturer of components for autos and aircraft. By the time Brunswick’s “Model A” pinsetters were in production in 1955, Brunswick had bought out Murray.[9]
Brunswick's policy of selling pinsetters on credit, suburban expansion, and an aggressive advertising campaign all combined to make bowling centers enormously popular in the late 1950s. By the mid-1960s, however, overexpansion led to a period of decline. Brunswick had begun assembling bowling equipment in Dublin in 1959, but it closed its Italian factory in 1966 and the Dublin facility in 1972. Then, in 1973, it entered into a manufacturing joint venture with Fuji Kikai-Hiroshima. In 2005 Brunswick moved its bowling ball production to Reynosa, Mexico, and in 2006 it closed the Muskegon plant.[9]
In 1967 Brunswick introduced the automatic scorer. In 1984, Brunswick acquired the Schmid Company of Scherzenbach, Switzerland, and with it the rights to manufacture and sell its GS pinsetter.[9] The GS is Brunswick’s current pinsetter series. The mechanical portion of the pinsetter was originally manufactured in the Brunswick plant located in Stockach, Germany. In 1999 the mechanical manufacturing was relocated to Hungary.[10]

MUSKEGON, MI -- Brunswick Corp. has sold its remaining ties to the bowling industry, a field with which it has been synonymous for more than a century.
The Lake Forest, Illinois-headquartered corporation announced last week Brunswick Bowling Products, which is headquartered in Muskegon, has been sold to BlueArc Capital Management LLC. 
According to Brunswick Chairman and CEO Dustan McCoy, the Atlanta-based BlueArc is a long-term investor that plans to keep the company's bowling products headquarters in Muskegon with manufacturing operations in Szekesfehervar, Hungary and Reynosa, Mexico.
"The Brunswick name and all that it stands for will carry on and continue to set the standard in the bowling industry," McCoy said in a news release.
The sale comes about a year after the corporation agreed to sell its bowling center business to Bowlmor AMF for $270 million. At that time, the company announced its intention to divest its bowling products business, which it now has completed.
BlueArc completed the acquisition of Brunswick Bowling Products with investments from Gladstone Investment Corp., a publicly traded business development company in McLean, Virginia, and Capitala Finance Corp., a business development company in Charlotte, North Carolina. A sale price was not disclosed.
"Brunswick is a great fit for us," Michael Roher, managing partner of BlueArc's private equity business, said in a news release. "We focus in investing in well-established, market-leading companies and helping them innovate and grow over time. The brand, the products and the management team all demonstrate the high performance attributes we seek within our portfolio companies."
Officer of Brunswick Bowling Products Brent Perrier told MLive Muskegon Chronicle in July 2014 that Brunswick Corp. derives less than 10 percent of its overall business from bowling and billiards.
While it has financial interests in a wide variety of fields including boating and recreational equipment, bowling is what it has been most closely associated with for many in the general population.
The company's partnership with BlueArc would seem to indicate that association will continue for the time being, but in name only. The long-term future of Brunswick's Muskegon bowling operation also is completely up to BlueArc and its partners. 
The prospect of new ownership might be a bit an unsettling for some of its 200 employees in Muskegon, but Perrier seems content with the transaction.
"Brunswick Bowling Products has been known for quality products and innovation for 125 years," he said. "We're excited to be associated with BlueArc. Throughout the sale process, BlueArc was the obvious choice for our management team. Their commitment to our business is a very positive sign to the entire industry."
Brunswick brought its bowling and billiards operations to Muskegon in 1906. The Brunswick Bowling Products equipment manufacturing plant at Seaway Drive and Laketon Avenue was demolished in May 2013.
It had sat vacant since 2006 after an unsuccessful sale offer and the decision to move bowling ball manufacturing to a plant in Mexico.
