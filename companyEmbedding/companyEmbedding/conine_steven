Biography | Steven Conine















































 


Welcome To Steve Conine Website













 
Steven Edward Conine was born February 17, 1960, in Toledo, Ohio, and was the first son of Ivan David and Suzanne Conine. The Conines are descendants of Dutch-European immigrants who settled in Albany, New York in 1654.
Steve began drawing at an early age. He was surrounded by others with art interests; his maternal grandfather was an art collector and a great aunt, Pearl Hunter, was a respected Toledo area painter.
By age 8, young Conine was identifying subjects of artistic interest and exploring new media. By age 10, he was showing his art in school. One piece, in a very innovative collage process, was inspired by heraldic symbols.
Conine also discovered a penchant for design and for a time studied draftsmanship. By his senior year of high school he had produced his first art show.
After high school he attended the Columbus College of Art & Design, majoring in advertising. After graduating in 1983, he returned to Toledo.
Since then, Conine has maintained a dual artistic track; working in commercial art as an art director and designer by day and painting from his heart and soul at night. For several years he aligned himself with artist Virtus Gale, sharing ideas, theories, and techniques, and often painting side by side, using special glasses which forced them to work in color fields.
In 1989, Conine undertook creation of a ceiling mural for Sacred Heart Church in Toledo. He won the commission by creating a large replica of the actual ceiling, so that church officials could clearly see his intentions. Conine worked on the project for one year, daily ascending scaffolding high over the church floor, turning the twelve bays of the ceiling into a spectacular vision of the twelve Apostles.
The successful completion of this project launched Conine into a new level of fine art. He began taking private students while growing artistically. Among paintings completed during this period were several important commissions.
It was Conine’s first trip to the land of his ancestors which sparked a major explosion in his aesthetic development. In 1992 he visited Spain, studying the treasures of the country’s museums and its sun-drenched landscape. He describes the discovery as an epiphany and traces all the paintings in his European Sojourn catalog to that trip.
A few years later he returned to Europe, stopping in Paris and returning to Spain, where he was struck by Antonio Gaudi’s architecture in Barcelona and the Dali Museum in Figueres. On later trips, he drove the French Riviera to Rome and visited northern Europe, particularly Amsterdam, to study Rembrandt and Van Gogh.
In 1998 Conine moved to Ann Arbor, Michigan, where he set up a studio in the Kerrytown district north of the University of Michigan campus. He tapped the nearby farmer’s market and its varied shoppers for inspiration and began to experiment with a new approach to use color.
In 2000, he returned to Toledo, where he undertook a commission to recreate the apse paintings of Good Shepherd Church. After participating in a number of smaller group exhibitions, in 2003, Conine launched his first major one-man exhibition at 20 North Gallery called European Sojourn.
In 2004, Conine left the commercial art field and moved to Madrid, Spain. While there, he created a large body of work over a period of two years. He returned to Toledo in 2006 and launched his second one-man exhibition at 20 North Gallery in 2007 entitled Spanish Seduction. This exhibition was also successful in that seventeen of twenty paintings were sold.
In 2010, Conine moved to New York City, and lived in Manhattan until 2012. There he painted a number of works which are being compiled along with newer work for his next exhibition.
