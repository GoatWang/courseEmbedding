The Company provides enterprise software applications that automate and accelerate organizations' operational response to critical events in order to keep people safe and businesses running. During public safety threats, such as active shooter situations, terrorist attacks or severe weather conditions, as well as critical business events, such as information technology (IT) outages, cyber-attacks or other incidents, such as product recalls or supply-chain interruptions, its Software as a Service (SaaS)-based platform enables its customers to aggregate and assess threat data, locate people at risk and responders able to assist, automate the execution of pre-defined communications processes, and track progress on executing response plans.The Company's platform provides organizations with the ability to send and receive notifications based on the last known locations of people, not just based on a static office or home address. Its platform integrates with a range of sources of location information, including building access control systems and corporate network access solutions. The location-specific approach enables organizations to determine which individuals may be affected by a public safety threat or able to respond to a critical business event, and to provide targeted and relevant instructions and two-way communications.

Its Safety Connection helps businesses and organizations locate and communicate with their people in danger. Its Incident Management can be configured to fit the needs of any organization or government agency with customizable variables and a separate incident response plan by location, line of business, or facility. Its IT Alerting provides access to detailed reports and audit trails.The Company's SecureBridge is a messaging application for security-conscious organizations that need to provide an alternative way for their employees to communicate and share nonpublic information with their customers and colleagues. Its Community Engagement features multiple opt-in methods to provide residents, visitors, employees and other community members with the ability to sign-up for alerts. The Company provides a range of implementation services, which include on-site project management, consultation with a certified emergency management professional (CEM), creation of client-specific message and scenarios, development of ad-hoc report templates, and on-site emergency and incident communications reviews.

What We Do

Everbridge, Inc. (NASDAQ: EVBG) is a global software company that provides enterprise software applications that automate and accelerate an organization’s operational response to critical events in order to keep people safe and businesses running. During public safety threats such as active shooter situations, terrorist attacks or severe weather conditions, as well as critical business events such as IT outages or cyber-attack incidents, over 3,300 global customers rely on the company’s SaaS-based Critical Event Management platform to quickly and reliably aggregate and assess threat data, locate people at risk and responders able to assist, automate the execution of pre-defined communications processes, and track progress on executing response plans. The company’s platform sent over 1.5 billion messages in 2016, and offers the ability to reach over 200 countries and territories with secure delivery to more than 100 different communication devices. The company’s critical communications and enterprise safety applications include Mass Notification, Incident Management, IT Alerting, Safety Connection™, Community Engagement®, Visual Command Center®, Crisis Commander® and CareConverge™, and are easy-to-use and deploy, secure, highly scalable and reliable.



Our software automates the key steps for responding to a critical event. It aggregates threat data from third party and internal sources so customers can assess risk, and locates people in areas of threat and those needed to respond. It then enables customers to execute pre-defined processes based on the type of threat for who should be contacted and how, what message to send, and who to escalate to if a responder is not available. Our platform then sends out notifications and instructions via text, voice, email—over 100 modalities—in 15 languages as needed, organizes conference bridges for people to collaborate, and analyzes return messages. Automating these steps enables them to be completed quickly, highly reliably and at scale at a time when minutes often matter.



Some examples of how we automate and simplify critical communication processes

When an active shooter situation or terrorist attack occurs, organizations can quickly identify employees in the affected area, including employees not at their usual business location, in order to confirm that they are safe and provide relevant instructions.

When a hurricane is imminent, local emergency management departments can alert affected communities with relevant safety and evacuation instructions while organizations can notify employees of office closings and provide safety instructions.


When IT systems fail, IT administrators can shorten the time required to alert cross-department responders, using scheduling information to determine availability and quickly assembling them on a conference bridge, thereby reducing the costs incurred from downtime.

When a person is suspected of having a stroke, an on-call specialist can provide a patient assessment via video communications during the ambulance trip, and the emergency room can be readied for an immediate stroke treatment, speeding the time that critical medication is administered and lessening the loss of cognitive capabilities and associated rehabilitation costs.


When a power line is down, utility workers can utilize pre-configured incident management templates to alert affected customers and responders and provide updates on service.

When engine readings in critical equipment detect a malfunction, technicians with the appropriate skills can be automatically alerted and quickly deployed to minimize downtime and avoid revenue loss or service interruption.


When a young child goes missing, local officials can send alerts to and receive tips from their communities to aid in locating and returning the child.

When a financial services firm experiences disruptions in service, employees and clients can be promptly notified and audit confirmations can be provided to document delivery.

The severity and frequency of global events, violence and other emergencies, their implications for personal safety and business performance, and the complexity of regulatory challenges are increasing.



At the same time, the proliferation of connected devices, mobile and digital communications has accelerated the speed and effectiveness at which people communicate and consume information during all types of incidents.
However, traditional enterprise solutions for critical communications have not kept pace with this increasingly digital world and the evolving threat landscape. These solutions lack the scale and location awareness to reliably address the breadth of challenges that organizations increasingly face. Organizations today require a solution that is engineered for modern critical communications–the ability to deliver comprehensive communications, and location aware and contextual content, to keep people safe and businesses running.



Following the tragic events of 9/11, Everbridge was founded with a vision of helping facilitate this approach and improving the way that people communicate and locate their people in critical situations. Our SaaS-based critical communications platform is built on a secure, scalable and reliable infrastructure with multiple layers of redundancy to enable the rapid delivery of critical communications, with near real-time verification, over numerous devices and contact paths.











Since 2002, Everbridge has been there for over 3,300 corporations and communities as a trusted critical event management partner. The expertise that we garnered developing our platform, and our original emergency communications application, Mass Notification, led us to leverage our platform for use in other critical business communications contexts. We have developed a full suite of enterprise applications, including the ground breaking Safety Connection, that enable our customers to deliver location aware and contextually relevant communications whether to a broad audience or to a targeted subset of individuals, globally or locally, and accounting for cultural, linguistic, regulatory and technological differences.

(EVBG), a global software company that provides critical event management and enterprise safety applications to help keep people safe and businesses running, today announced its financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2017.“We are off to a strong start in 2017 with first quarter revenue and adjusted EBITDA both coming in above the high end of our guidance ranges,” said Jaime Ellertson, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of Everbridge. “We continue to see healthy demand for our core mass notification products, and are particularly excited about the momentum we are seeing with new application and multi-product deals, as these make up a growing portion of our overall sales activity. We believe this growing interest in taking a more holistic view to critical event management supports our longer-term strategy.”Ellertson continued, “Our plan to roll out a Critical Event Management platform is resonating well with customers and prospects, as they recognize the benefits of a single platform that provides an end-to-end view of threats, operational impact and response management. With a strong performance in the first quarter, and growing demand for our critical event management and enterprise safety solutions, we remain well positioned to extend our leadership in the underpenetrated market during 2017 as we continue to scale our business.”First Quarter 2017 Financial Highlights Total revenue was $22.8 million, an increase of 34% compared to $17.1 million for the first quarter of 2016.

GAAP net loss per share was $(0.23), based on 27.2 million basic and diluted weighted average common shares outstanding, compared to $(0.26) for the first quarter of 2016, based on 12.3 million basic and diluted weighted average common shares outstanding.  Non-GAAP net loss was $(4.0) million, compared to $(1.7) million in the first quarter of 2016.

We use these non-GAAP measures for financial, operational and budgetary decision-making purposes, to understand and evaluate our core operating performance and trends, and to generate future operating plans. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information regarding past financial performance and future prospects, and permit us to more thoroughly analyze key financial metrics used to make operational decisions. We believe that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial measures with other software companies, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors.Read MoreWe do not consider these non-GAAP measures in isolation or as an alternative to financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. The principal limitation of these non-GAAP financial measures is that they exclude significant expenses and income that are required by GAAP to be recorded in the Company's financial statements. In addition, they are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgment by management about which expenses and income are excluded or included in determining these non-GAAP financial measures. In order to compensate for these limitations, management presents non-GAAP financial measures in connection with GAAP results. We urge investors to review the reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures, which are included in this press release, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business.Cautionary Language Concerning Forward-Looking StatementsThis press release contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the “safe harbor” provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including but not limited to, statements regarding the anticipated opportunity and trends for growth in our critical communications and enterprise safety applications and our overall business, our market opportunity, our expectations regarding sales of our products, our goal to maintain market leadership and extend the markets in which we compete for customers, and our expected financial results for the second quarter of 2017 and the full fiscal year 2017. These forward-looking statements are made as of the date of this press release and were based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections as well as the beliefs and assumptions of management. Words such as "expect," "anticipate," "should," "believe," "target," "project," "goals," "estimate," "potential," "predict," "may," "will," "could," "intend," variations of these terms or the negative of these terms and similar expressions are intended to identify these forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, many of which involve factors or circumstances that are beyond our control. Our actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied in forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including but not limited to: our ability to attract new customers and retain and increase sales to existing customers; our ability to increase sales of our Mass Notification application and/or ability to increase sales of our other applications; our ability to successfully integrate businesses and assets that we have acquired or may acquire in the future; developments in the markets for critical event management and targeted and contextually relevant critical communications or the associated regulatory environment; our estimates of market opportunity and forecasts of market growth may prove to be inaccurate; we have not been profitable on a consistent basis historically and may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future; the lengthy and unpredictable sales cycles for new customers; nature of our business exposes us to inherent liability risks; our ability to maintain successful relationships with our channel partners and technology partners; our ability to manage our growth effectively; our ability to respond to competitive pressures; potential liability related to privacy and security of personally identifiable information; our ability to protect our intellectual property rights, and the other risks detailed in our risk factors discussed in filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including but not limited to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 filed with the SEC on March 23, 2017. The forward-looking statements included in this press release represent our views as of the date of this press release. We undertake no intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

HIGH RISK INVESTMENT WARNING:

                End-users of the NetDania software that make use of the trading integration features as direct clients of integrated brokers, should be aware of the level of risk carried by trading in financial markets. Trading foreign exchange and or other financial instruments on margin carries a high level of risk, and may not be suitable for all investors. The high degree of leverage can work against you as well as for you. Before deciding to invest you should carefully consider your investment objectives, level of experience, and risk appetite. The possibility exists that you could sustain a loss of some or more of your initial investment, and therefore you should not invest money that you cannot afford to lose. You should be aware of all the risks associated with trading, and seek advice from your broker and or an independent financial advisor if you have any doubts. Anyone opening a live trading account needs to adhere to the laws of their local country as such laws may differ from country to country.                
                
                NetDania expressly disclaims any liability for any lost principal or profits which without limitation may arise directly or indirectly from the use of or reliance on information on our website or the use of our software with broker integration.
