Price & Performance:

Average annual total return is the annual compound return for the indicated period. It reflects the change in share price and the reinvestment of all dividends and capital gains. NAV returns do not include the effect of any applicable sales charges. POP and w/CDSC returns include the effect of maximum applicable sales charges.

Returns for periods of less than one year are cumulative total returns.

Public Offering Price (POP): The price at which a fund's shares can be purchased. The offering price includes the current net asset value (NAV) per share plus any sales charges.
On each day the New York Stock Exchange is open for trading, the net asset value (NAV) is determined as of the close of trading (normally 4:00 pm Eastern Time). The NAV and POP for all funds are subject to change.

If you are participating in an employer sponsored retirement plan, such as a 401(k) plan, profit-sharing plan, defined benefit plan or other employer-directed plan, your company will provide you with the information you need to open an account and buy Class R6 Shares.
Morningstar Disclosures:The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.

Equity Securities:


							The market price of
						

							equity securities may be adversely affected
						

							by financial market, industry, or issuer-
						

							specific events. Focus on a particular style
						

							or on small or medium-sized companies
						

							may enhance that risk.
						

Industry/Sector


Concentration:


							A fund that focuses its
						

							investments in a particular industry or
						

							sector will be more sensitive to conditions
						

							that affect that industry or sector than
						

							a non-concentrated fund.

							The fund may be negatively affected by
						

							factors specific to the real estate market,
						

							including interest rates, leverage, property,
						

							and management.
						

Foreign & Emerging


Markets:


							Investing internationally,
						

							especially in emerging markets, involves

							accounting, economic, and market risk.

							Data presented as of
						

Morningstar


							For the 3- and 5-year periods, respectively, the Fund was rated 5 and 4 stars among 186 and 150 funds in the Global Real Estate category for
						

							the time period ending 12/30/2016.
						

Morningstar Rating


							TM
						

							for funds, or "star rating," is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts,
						

							exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are
						

							considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation
						

							in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10%
						

							of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the
						

							bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated
						

							with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60%
						

							five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more
						

							months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period
						

							actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.

INTRODUCTION                                                                    

Acadian Asset Management, Inc. ("Acadian") has adopted this Code of Ethics      
pursuant to Rule 204A-1 under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the "Advisers
Act") and rule amendments under Section 204 of the Advisers Act. The Code of    
Ethics sets forth standards of conduct expected of Acadian's employees and      
contractors and addresses conflicts that may arise from personal trading.       
Acadian's Compliance Committee has determined that all of Acadian's on-site     
consultants and employees (and their immediate family members as defined herein)
will be considered "Access Persons" for purposes of the Code.                   

Certain "offsite" employees or contractors, depending on their job              
responsibilities and access to customer and trading information, may also be    
considered "Access Persons" but may be exempt at the discretion of the CCO from 
certain reporting requirements under the Code.                                  

Acadian's non-resident Director is also considered an Access Person where       
specified herein. "NON-RESIDENT DIRECTOR" means any director of the Company who 
does not maintain a business address at the Company and who does not, in the    
ordinary cause of his or her business, receive current information regarding the
purchase or sale of securities by the Company or information regarding          
recommendations concerning the purchase or sale of securities by the Company.   

The policies and procedures outlined in the Code of Ethics are intended to      
promote compliance with fiduciary standards by Acadian and its Access Persons.  
As a fiduciary, Acadian has the responsibility to render professional,          
continuous and unbiased investment advice, owes its clients a duty of honesty,  
good faith and fair dealing, must act at all times in the best interests of     
clients and must avoid or disclose conflicts of interests.                      

This Code of Ethics is designed to:                                             
o  Protect Acadian's clients by deterring misconduct;                           
o  Educate Access Persons regarding Acadian's expectations and the laws         
governing their conduct;                                                  
o  Remind Access Persons that they are in a position of trust and must act with 
complete propriety at all times;                                          
o  Protect the reputation of Acadian;                                           
o  Guard against violation of the securities laws; and                          
o  Establish procedures for Access Persons to follow so that Acadian may        
 determine whether Access Persons are complying with its ethical principles.

This Code of Ethics is based upon the principle that the directors, officers and
other Access Persons of Acadian owe a fiduciary duty to, among others, the      
clients of Acadian to conduct their affairs, including their personal securities
transactions, in such a manner as to avoid (i) serving their own personal       
interests ahead of clients; (ii) taking inappropriate advantage of their        
position with Acadian; and (iii) any actual or potential conflicts of interest  
or any abuse of their position of trust and responsibility. This fiduciary duty 
includes the duty of the Chief Compliance Officer of Acadian to report          
violations of this Code of Ethics to Acadian's Executive Committee, Board of    
Directors, and the Board of Directors of any U.S. registered management         
investment company for which Acadian acts as adviser or sub-adviser.

PART 1. GENERAL PRINCIPLES                                                      

Our principles and philosophy regarding ethics stress Acadian's overarching     
fiduciary duty to its clients and the obligation of its Access Persons to uphold
that fundamental duty. In recognition of the trust and confidence placed in     
Acadian by its clients and to give effect to the belief that Acadian's          
operations should be directed to benefit its clients, Acadian has adopted the   
following general principles to guide the actions of its Access Persons:        

     1.       The interests of clients are paramount. All Access Persons
                must conduct themselves and their operations to give maximum
                  effect to this belief by at all times placing the interests of
clients before their own.                   

         2.       All personal transactions in securities by Access Persons must
           be accomplished so as to avoid even the appearance of a
                conflict of interest on the part of such Access Persons with
the interests of any client.                

         3.       All Access Persons must avoid actions or activities that allow
                  (or appear to allow) a person to profit or benefit from his or
                  her position with respect to a client, or that otherwise bring
        into question the person's independence or judgment.

        4.       All information concerning the specific security holdings and
     financial circumstances of any client is strictly
              confidential. Access Persons are expected to maintain such
                 confidentiality, secure such information and disclose it only
                 to other Access Persons with a need to know that information.

    5.       All Access Persons will conduct themselves honestly, with
                  integrity and in a professional manner to preserve and protect
Acadian's reputation.                       

Federal law requires that this Code of Ethics not only be adopted but that it   
must also be enforced with reasonable diligence. The Chief Compliance Officer   
will keep records of any violation of the Code of Ethics and of the actions     
taken as a result of such violations. Failure to comply with the Code of Ethics 
may result in disciplinary action, including monetary penalties and the         
potential for the termination of employment with Acadian. In addition,          
noncompliance with the Code of Ethics has severe ramifications, including       
enforcement actions by regulatory authorities, criminal fines, civil injunctions
and penalties, disgorgement of profits and sanctions on your ability to remain  
employed in any capacity in the investment advisory business or in a related    
capacity.                                                                       

PART 2. SCOPE OF THE CODE OF ETHICS                                             
A.       PERSONS COVERED BY THE CODE OF ETHICS                                  

Acadian's operational and investment management practices expose many if not all
its employees and contractors to client information, including holdings. As a   
result, to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements, Acadian has          
determined that it will characterize all on site employees and some contract    
employees and "off-site" employees (to be determined by the Compliance Committee
based primarily on access to client information and trading) as Access Persons  
under the Code of Ethics.                                                       

9 

P-->EX-99.P.311th�Page�of�70TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�11th
Reporting sections of the Code that are applicable to Acadian's "non-resident   
director" are the following:                                                    
(1) The preclearance of purchases of Initial Public Offerings             
   (2) The preclearance of the purchase of sale of Limited or Private Offerings.
(3) Quarterly reporting of transactions                                   
(4) Annual Certification of the receipt of the Code of Ethics             
(5) Year end holdings report.                                             

With respect to the reporting of personal securities accounts and pre-clearing  
transactions (requirements outlined below), the definition of an Access Persons 
is expanded to include the accounts and transactions of the Access Person's     
immediate family members. An immediate family member is defined to include any  
relative by blood or marriage living in an Access Person's household (spouse,   
minor children, a domestic partner etc.), or someone who is primarily supported 
financially by the Access Person.                                               

B.       ACCOUNTS COVERED BY THE CODE                                           

The Access Person must report accounts and personal securities transactions for 
any account in which he or she has a direct or indirect beneficial interest and 
in which a security covered by the Code is eligible for purchase. This typically
includes:                                                                       

o individual and joint accounts (with the exception of your Acadian 401k    
account)                                                                
o accounts in the name of a spouse or domestic partner                      
o accounts in the name of minor children or other living in your household  
and/or subject to your financial support                                
o trust accounts                                                            
o estate accounts                                                           
o accounts where you have power of attorney or trading authority            
o other type of accounts in which you have a present or future interest in  
the income, principal or right to obtain title to securities.           

Each employee is responsible for any of his or her immediate family members'    
compliance with the requirements imposed by the Code of Ethics. Education and   
oversight is a must. Noncompliance with the Code of Ethics by an immediate      
family member's will have the same ramifications on the related employee as if  
it were the employee who did not comply.                                        

C.       SECURITIES COVERED BY THE CODE OF ETHICS                               

For purposes of the Code of Ethics and its reporting requirements, the term     
"covered security" will include the following:                                  
o any stock or bond;                                                  
o investment or futures contracts with the exception of currency;     
o options or warrants to purchase securities;                         
  o limited partnerships meeting the definition of a "security" (including
    limited liability and other companies that are treated as partnerships
for U.S. federal income tax purposes);                            
o ETFs, ADRs, EDRS and GDRs;                                          
o closed-end investment companies;                                    

10

P-->EX-99.P.312th�Page�of�70TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�12th
o shares of open-end mutual funds that are advised or sub-advised by  
   Acadian or one of Acadian's affiliates, including all companies under
the Old Mutual umbrellas*; and                                    
o private investment funds, hedge funds, and investment clubs;        

but specifically does not include:                                              

o direct obligations of the U.S. government;                          
 o bankers' acceptances, bank certificates of deposit, commercial paper,
and high quality short-term debt obligations, including repurchase
agreements;                                                       
o shares issued by money market funds (domiciled inside or outside the
United States);                                                   
o shares of open-end mutual funds that are not advised or sub-advised 
by Acadian or one of Acadian's affiliates, including all companies
under the Old Mutual umbrellas; and                               
 o shares issued by unit investment trusts that are invested exclusively
in one or more open-end funds, none of which are funds advised or 
  sub-advised by Acadian or one of Acadian's affiliates, including all
companies under the Old Mutual umbrellas.                         

* The Chief Compliance Officer will attempt to maintain a current list of firm  
affiliates and open ended funds that will require pre-approval. If there is any 
doubt about any open ended fund you wish to purchase you should pre-clear.      

As a best practice, Access Persons are encouraged to report all accounts in     
which multi-family mutual funds can be purchased. This will address, in advance,
the addition of any fund families to the list of those advised or subadvised by 
Acadian or one of our Old Mutual affiliates. Access Persons should be aware that
accounts held directly at a mutual fund sponsor may also require reporting as   
these circumstances change.                                                     

PART 3. STANDARDS OF BUSINESS CONDUCT                                           

The Code of Ethics sets forth standards of business conduct that Acadian        
requires of its Access Persons and that relate to Acadian's and Access Person's 
fiduciary obligations. Access Persons should maintain the highest ethical       
standards in carrying out Acadian's business activities. Acadian's reputation is
one of its most important assets. Maintaining the trust and confidence of       
clients is a vital responsibility. This section sets forth Acadian's business   
conduct standards.                                                              

A.     COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS AND REGULATIONS                                     

Each Access Person must comply with applicable federal securities laws and all  
provisions of Acadian's Compliance Manual.                                      

     1.       As part of this requirement, Access Persons are not permitted,
    in connection with the purchase or sale, directly or
             indirectly, of a security held or to be acquired by a client:

a. to defraud that client in any manner;        

11

P-->EX-99.P.313th�Page�of�70TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�13th
      b.       to mislead that client, including by making a
      statement that omits material facts;

            c.       to engage in any act, practice or course of conduct
                      which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit
upon that client;             

            d.       to engage in any manipulative practice with respect
to that client; or            

            e.       to engage in any manipulative practice with respect
              to securities, including price manipulation.

B.     CONFLICTS OF INTEREST                                                    

As a fiduciary, Acadian has an affirmative duty of care, loyalty, honesty and   
good faith to act in the best interests of its clients. Compliance with this    
duty can be achieved by trying to avoid conflicts of interest and by fully      
disclosing all material facts concerning any conflict that does arise with      
respect to any client. In addition, Acadian imposes a higher standard by        
providing that Access Persons must try to avoid situations that have even the   
appearance of conflict or impropriety.                                          

  1.       CONFLICTS AMONG CLIENT INTERESTS. Conflicts of interest may
              arise where Acadian or its Access Persons have reason to favor
             the interests of one client over another client (e.g., larger
       accounts over smaller accounts, accounts compensated by
              performance fees over accounts not so compensated, accounts in
             which Access Persons have made material personal investments,
            or accounts of close friends or relatives of Access Persons,
     etc.). Access Persons are prohibited from engaging in
          inappropriate favoritism of one client over another client
 that would constitute a breach of fiduciary duty.

  2.       COMPETING WITH CLIENT TRADES. Access Persons are prohibited
          from using knowledge about pending or currently considered
         securities transactions for clients to profit personally,
         directly or indirectly, as a result of such transactions,
             including by purchasing or selling such securities. Conflicts
             raised by personal securities transactions also are addressed
more specifically in section D below.           

3.       OTHER POTENTIAL CONFLICTS PROVISIONS:                    

            A.       DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INTEREST. Access Persons are
               prohibited from recommending, implementing or
                     considering any securities transaction for a client
                  without having disclosed any material beneficial
                       ownership, business or personal relationship or other
                        material interest in the issuer, or its affiliates, to
                      the Chief Compliance Officer or, with respect to the
               Chief Compliance Officer's interests, another
                      designated senior officer. If such designated person
                    deems the disclosed interest to present a material
                        conflict, the access person may not participate in any
                     decision-making process regarding the securities of
that issuer.                  

                 This provision applies in addition to Acadian's
                 initial, monthly and annual personal securities
            reporting requirements for Access Persons.

12

P-->EX-99.P.314th�Page�of�70TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�14th
            B.       REFERRALS/BROKERAGE. Access Persons are required to
                act in the best interests of Acadian's clients
                     regarding execution and other costs paid by clients
                    for brokerage services. As part of this principle,
                  Access Persons will strictly adhere to Acadian's
             policies and procedures regarding brokerage
                    allocation, best execution, soft dollars and other
related policies.             

              C.       VENDORS AND SUPPLIERS. Each Access Person is required
               to disclose any personal investments or other
                   interests in vendors or suppliers with respect to
                    which that person negotiates or makes decisions on
                       behalf of Acadian. Access Persons with such interests
                     are prohibited from negotiating or making decisions
                    regarding Acadian's business with those companies.

             D.       SOFT-DOLLAR COMMISSIONS. All soft dollar trades must
                     comply with the "safe harbor" provisions of Section
                      28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and any
client specific restrictions. 

           E.       FRONT-RUNNING. The Company forbids Access Persons,
                       from purchasing or selling stock before a buy or sell
              recommendation is made to the Client if such
                transaction will have a negative impact on the
client.                       

   F.       CHURNING. Access Persons should not effect
                    transactions to generate increased commissions and
                   unnecessary expenses for a Client. The volume and
                    frequency of all sales and purchases of securities
                       must be measured against the need and purpose for the
                       activities, a Client's investment objectives, and the
                       expenses and benefits to the account. All trading for
                     a Client's account must be undertaken solely in the
Client's interest.            

              G.       UNFAIR TREATMENT OF CERTAIN CLIENTS VIS-A-VIS OTHERS.
                         An Access Person who handles one or more Clients may be
                       faced with situations in which it is possible to give
                   preference to certain Clients over others. Access
                       Persons must be careful not to give preference to one
                        Client over another even if the preferential treatment
                  would benefit Acadian or the Access Person. Each
                   situation should be examined closely to determine
                         whether the Client has consented to the Access Person's
                 actions favoring another Client and whether the
                     resulting relationship with the Client that was not
                    favored is fair and consistent with the securities
                       laws. If both parts of this test have been satisfied,
                         most likely there has been no breach of fiduciary duty.

C.     INSIDER TRADING                                                          

Access Persons are prohibited from trading, either personally or on behalf of   
others, while in possession of material nonpublic information and from          
communicating material nonpublic information to others in violation of the law. 
This specifically includes personally trading or informing others of the        
securities held in a client portfolio or securities transaction contemplated on 
behalf of any client.                                                           

13

P-->EX-99.P.315th�Page�of�70TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�15th
    1.       PENALTIES. Trading securities while in possession of material
      nonpublic information or improperly communicating that
         information to others may expose you to severe penalties.
         Criminal sanctions may include a fine of up to $1,000,000
          and/or ten years imprisonment. The Securities and Exchange
        Commission (the "SEC") can recover the profits gained or
             losses avoided through violative trading, impose a penalty of
              up to three times the illicit windfall and can permanently bar
         you from the securities industry. You may also be sued by
    those seeking to recover damages for insider trading
              violations. Regardless of whether a government inquiry occurs,
            Acadian views seriously any violation of its insider trading
    policies, and such violations constitute grounds for
      disciplinary sanctions, including immediate dismissal.

   2.       MATERIAL NONPUBLIC INFORMATION. The term "material nonpublic
              information" relates not only to issuers but also to Acadian's
             securities recommendations and client securities holdings and
transactions.                                   

     Information is "material" when there is a substantial
       likelihood that a reasonable investor would consider it
    important in making his or her investment decisions.
           Generally, this is information the disclosure of which will
     have a substantial effect on the price of a company's
         securities. You should direct any questions about whether
        information is material to the Chief Compliance Officer.

             Material information often relates to a company's results and
              operations, including, for example, dividend changes, earnings
           results, changes in previously released earnings estimates,
          significant merger or acquisition proposals or agreements,
        major litigation, liquidation problems and extraordinary
             management developments. Material information also may relate
             to the market for a company's securities. Information about a
             significant order to purchase or sell securities may, in some
       contexts, be deemed material. Similarly, prepublication
             information regarding reports in the financial press also may
be deemed material.                             

             Information is "public" when it has been disseminated broadly
          to investors in the marketplace. Tangible evidence of such
            dissemination is the best indication that the information is
              public. For example, information is public after it has become
            available to the general public through a public filing with
          the SEC or some other governmental agency, The Wall Street
         Journal, other publications of general circulation, media
broadcasts, or over public internet websites.   

           Access Persons shall not disclose any nonpublic information
          (whether or not it is material) relating to Acadian or its
             securities transactions to any person outside Acadian (unless
         such disclosure has been authorized by Acadian). Material
        nonpublic information may not be communicated to anyone,
           including persons within Acadian, with the exception of the
        Chief Compliance Officer or his designee, unless this is
          required for the performance of job responsibilities. Such
           information should be secured. For example, access to files
            containing material nonpublic information and computer files
            containing it should be restricted to Acadian employees, and
            conversations containing such information, if appropriate at
      all, should be conducted in private to avoid potential

   3.       Before executing any trade for yourself or others, including
              clients, an Access Person must determine whether he or she has
           access to material nonpublic information. If you think that
            you might have access to material nonpublic information, you
should take the following steps:                

              a.       report the information and proposed trade immediately
  to the Chief Compliance Officer.

            b.       do not purchase or sell the securities on behalf of
        yourself or others, including clients.

             c.       do not communicate the information inside or outside
                     Acadian, other than to the Chief Compliance Officer
or his designee.              

            d.       after the Chief Compliance Officer has reviewed the
                       issue, Acadian will determine whether the information
                   is material and nonpublic and, if so, what action
Acadian should take, if any.  

D.     PERSONAL SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS                                         

All Access Persons will strictly comply with Acadian's policies and procedures  
regarding personal securities transactions. Acadian's Pre-Clearance form is     
attached as Exhibit 2 and is discussed in greater detail in Section 4 (B) below+

       1.       INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERINGS - PRE-CLEARANCE. Unless prohibited from
              purchasing IPOs as a result of licensing with the NASD, Access
              Personsmust pre-clear for their personal accounts purchases of
                any securities in an initial public offering (IPO). Acadian will
          maintain a written record of any decision, and the reasons
               supporting the decision, to approve the personal acquisition of
               an IPO for at least five years after the end of the fiscal year
                in which the approval was granted. Before granting such approval
           Acadian will evaluate such investment to determine that the
          investment creates no material conflict between the access
      person and Acadian. Acadian may consider approving the
                transaction if it can determine that: (i) the investment did not
                result from directing Firm brokerage business to the underwriter
            of the issuer of the security, (ii) the access person is not
                misappropriating an opportunity that should have been offered to
          eligible clients, and (iii) the access person's investment
             decisions for clients will not be unduly influenced by his or
                her personal holdings, and investment decisions are based solely
              on the best interests of clients. Any access person authorized
               to purchase securities in an IPO shall disclose that investment
              when they play a part in the client's subsequent consideration
           of an investment in that issuer. In such circumstances, the
               client's decision to purchase securities of the issuer shall be
               subject to independent review by investment Access Persons with
no personal interest in the issuer.             

       2.       LIMITED OR PRIVATE OFFERINGS - PRE-CLEARANCE. Access Personsmust
      pre-clear for their personal accounts purchases of any
                securities in limited or private offerings (commonly referred to
             as private placements). Acadian will maintain a record of any
             decision, and the reasons supporting the decision, to approve
            the personal acquisition of a private placement for at least
five years after the end of                     

15

P-->EX-99.P.317th�Page�of�70TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�17th
         the fiscal year in which the approval was granted. Before
               granting such approval Acadian will evaluate such investment to
          determine that the investment creates no material conflict
           between the access person and Acadian. Acadian may consider
           approving the transaction if it can determine that: (i) the
                investment did not result from directing Firm brokerage business
          to the underwriter of the issuer of the security, (ii) the
                access person is not misappropriating an opportunity that should
           have been offered to eligible clients, and (iii) the access
            person's investment decisions for clients will not be unduly
          influenced by his or her personal holdings, and investment
                decisions are based solely on the best interests of clients. Any
            access person authorized to purchase securities in a private
              placement shall disclose that investment when they play a part
            in the client's subsequent consideration of an investment in
            that issuer. In such circumstances, the client's decision to
     purchase securities of the issuer shall be subject to
                independent review by investment Access Persons with no personal
              interest in the issuer. Qualified Access Persons are permitted
                to invest in private offering offered and/or managed by Acadian.

  3.       BLACKOUT PERIODS. A five (5) day blackout period applies to
             access person trading. A "pre-trade" blackout period of trade
               date plus two days prior to trade date will apply to all access
             persons who become aware or reasonably should have been aware
              because of their job responsibilities that a security is being
          considered for purchase or sale for a client account. This
                "pre-trade" blackout period will not apply to access persons who
        did not know of and had no reason to know of the pending
              transaction. A "post-trade" blackout period of trade date plus
          two days after trade date will apply to all access persons
regardless of job responsibilities.             

              Depending on the occurrence, trades made within the proscribed
          period shall generally be unwound, if possible. Otherwise,
             profits realized on trades within the proscribed period shall
            generally be disgorged to a charity designated by Acadian or
         to a client if appropriate at the discretion of the Chief
Compliance Officer.                             

4.       SHORT-TERM TRADING. Unless an exception is granted by the
            Chief Compliance Officer, no access person may profit in the
    purchase and sale, or sale and purchase, of the same
          securities within sixty (60) calendar days. Trades made in
             violation of this prohibition should be unwound, if possible.
         Otherwise, any profits realized on such short-term trades
           shall be subject to disgorgement to a charity designated by
              Acadian or to a client if appropriate at the discretion of the
Chief Compliance Officer.                       

      Access Persons are reminded that they are specifically
              prohibited from engaging in short-term trading in mutual funds
advised by Acadian or sub-advised by Acadian.   

              The ban on short-term trading profits is specifically designed
         to deter potential conflicts of interest and frontrunning
             transactions, which typically involve a quick trading pattern
            to capitalize on a short-lived market impact of a trade by a
             Client. Acadian shall consider the policy reasons for the ban
            on these short-term trades, as stated herein, in determining
        when an exception to this prohibition is permissible. An
        Access Person wishing to execute a short term trade must
              complete both the Pre-Clearance Form (Exhibit 2) and the Short
Term Trading                                    

16

                Form (Exhibit 4) and submit each to the Chief Compliance Officer
for review and approval.                        

PERSONAL SECURITIES THAT ARE SUBJECT TO PRECLEARANCE REQUIREMENTS BUT ARE EXEMPT
FROM THE BLACKOUT RESTRICTIONS NOTED ABOVE:                                     

Acadian's Chief Compliance Officer may allow exceptions to policy on a          
case-by-case basis when the abusive practices that the policy is designed to    
prevent, such as frontrunning or conflicts of interest, are not present and the 
equity of the situation strongly supports an exemption. Acadian has determined  
that the following categories of transactions will be subject to preclearance   
requirements but will be exempt from the blackout restrictions noted above as   
these transactions appear upon reasonable inquiry and investigation to present  
no reasonable likelihood of harm to the Client provided they are otherwise      
executed in accordance with this Code, Section 206 of the Advisers Act, and Rule
17j-1 of the Investment Company Act of 1940.                                    

           1.       purchases or sales of any securities with > $2
                        billion market capitalization on transaction date;

            2.       purchases or sales of 500 or fewer shares of an
                        equity security within any three-consecutive month
                         period (all trades within a three-consecutive month
                 period shall be aggregated to determine the
      availability of this exemption);
or                        
                         any amount if the actual or proposed acquisition or
                         disposition by the Client is in the amount of 1,000
                         or fewer shares (or less than $25,000 market value)
                         and the Security is listed on a national securities
    exchange or the NASDAQ system.

PERSONAL SECURITIES TRADES THAT ARE EXEMPT FROM BOTH THE PRECLEARANCE           
REQUIREMENTS AND THE PROHIBITIONS NOTED ABOVE:                                  

                  1.       purchases or sales affected in any account over which
                           the Access Person has no direct or indirect influence
                       or Control including accounts in which the Access
                           Person has granted to a broker, dealer, trust officer
                 or other third party non-access person full
                         discretion to execute transactions on behalf of the
                         Access Person without consultation or Access person
input or direction.       

                 2.       purchases or sales which are involuntary on the part
of the Access Person;     

           3.       purchases or sales within Acadian's 401k plan;

              4.       purchases which are part of an automatic dividend
reinvestment plan;        

                  5.       purchases effected upon the exercise of rights issued
                        by an issuer pro rata to all holders of a class of

                         acquired from such issuer, and sales of such rights
so acquired;

               6.       purchases or sales of currencies and interest rate
                instruments or futures or options on them.

E.       GIFTS AND ENTERTAINMENT.                                               
1.       GENERAL STATEMENT                                    

     A conflict of interest occurs when the personal interests of Access
Persons interfere or could potentially interfere with their   
     responsibilities to Acadian and its clients. Access Persons may not
accept inappropriate gifts, favors, entertainment, special    
       accommodations or other things of material value that could influence
       their decision-making or make them feel beholden to a person or firm.
 Access Persons are expressly prohibited from considering gifts,
gratuities or entertainment when choosing brokers or vendors. 
         Similarly, Access Persons may not offer gifts, favors, entertainment or
        other things of value that could be viewed as overly generous or aimed
    at influencing decision-making or making a client feel beholden to
Acadian or the Access Person.                                 

2.       GIFTS                                                

      A.       RECEIPT - No Access Person may receive any gift, service or
             other thing totaling more than de minimis value ($250 per
                 year) from any person or entity that does business with or on
           behalf of Acadian. (Note - If the access person is also
                registered with the NASD, the permissible limit is only $100
           per year). Access Persons are expressly prohibited from
soliciting any gift.                        

      B.       OFFER - No Access Person may give or offer any gift of more
              than de minimis value ($250 per year) to existing clients,
                prospective clients or any entity that does business with or
          on behalf of Acadian without pre-approval by the Chief
           Compliance Officer. (Note - Regulations relating to the
             investment management of state or municipal pension funds
             often severely restrict or prohibit the offer of gifts or
               entertainment of any value to government officials (elected
        officials and employees of elected offices) who have
                involvement or influence over the selection of an investment
                manager. As a best practice, it is advisable to consult with
        such individuals prior to providing any type gift or
entertainment.)                             

        3.       CASH - No Access Person may give or accept cash gifts or cash
              equivalents to or from a client, prospective client or any
           entity that does business with or on behalf of Acadian.

 4.       ENTERTAINMENT - No Access Person may provide or accept
               extravagant or excessive entertainment to or from a client,
                  prospective client, or any person or entity that does or seeks
               to do business with or on behalf of Acadian. Access Persons
              may provide or accept an occasional business entertainment
                 event, at a venue where business is typically discussed, such
                as dinner or a sporting event, of reasonable value, provided
               that the person or a representative of the entity providing
the entertainment is present.               

18

P-->EX-99.P.320th�Page�of�70TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�20th
                If the anticipated value of the entertainment is expected to
                exceed $250, preapproval from a supervisor is required prior
           to acceptance of the entertainment. Please use the form
provided as Exhibit 5 for this purpose.     

               Access Persons are expressly prohibited from soliciting any
                 entertainment. (Note - Regulations relating to the investment
                 management of state or municipal pension funds often severely
               restrict or prohibit the offer of gifts or entertainment of
            any value to government officials (elected officials and
         employees of elected offices) who have involvement or
               influence over the selection of an investment manager. As a
       best practice, it is advisable to consult with such
   individuals prior to providing any type gift or
entertainment.)                             

                 Using the form provided as Exhibit 6 attached, on a quarterly
         basis each Access Persons must disclose to his or her
    supervisor all gifts and entertainment received.

        5.       CONFERENCES - Employee attendance at all industry conferences
                  must be pre-approved by the employee's supervisor. If any part
             of the conference will be paid for by the host or a third
             party, conference attendance will require approval by the
               Chief Compliance Officer. The Chief Compliance Officer will
               review, among other factors, the purpose of the conference,
              the conference agenda, and the proposed costs that will be
paid or reimbursed by the third party.      

                It is against Acadian policy to pay to attend any conference
                  where the payment to attend will directly or indirectly impact
whether Acadian is awarded client business. 

        6.       QUARTERLY REPORTING - Acadian will require all Access Persons
                to report any gifts or entertainment received on a Quarterly
basis using the form provided at Exhibit 6. 

F.       POLITICAL AND CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTIONS                                 
A.       POLITICAL                                                              

Acadian as a firm does not make political contributions.                        

Access persons are prohibited from making a political contribution to any       
candidate for office in a state or district for which the employee is not       
eligible to vote. Individual exceptions may be granted by the CCO if it is      
determined that a candidate would not be in the position or appear to be in the 
position to potentially influence the direction of business to Acadian.         

An example of a prohibited contribution would be: A Massachusetts resident would
be prohibited by the Code from donating money to the Rhode Island governor's    
race.                                                                           

Access Persons are prohibited from making any political contributions to any    
political campaign for the office of Treasurer, office of Comptroller or any    
similar office or position that could or may appear to have any influence or    
control over the selection or retention of an investment manager.               

19

P-->EX-99.P.321st�Page�of�70TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�21st
Political contributions requested by a client or prospect will be prohibited as 
these may be deemed as an attempt to retain or win business.                    

B.       CHARITABLE                                                             

Although Acadian encourages its Access Persons to be charitable, no donations   
should be made or should appear to have been made for the purpose of obtaining  
or retaining client business.                                                   

Any client or prospect request to Acadian or an Acadian employee for a          
charitable donation should be brought to the attention of the Compliance        
Committee. Any donation made by the firm to a client or prospect charity should 
be nominal as to not appear to have been made to obtain or retain the business  
and should be done in accordance with the firm's Charitable giving policy.      

G.       CONFIDENTIALITY. Access Persons have the highest fiduciary obligation  
not to reveal confidential company information to any party that does not have a
clear and compelling need to know such information and to safeguard all client  
information. Access Persons must keep confidential at all times any nonpublic   
information they may obtain in the course of their employment at Acadian. This  
information includes but is not limited to:                                     

                a.       any client's identity (unless the client consents),
                    any information regarding a client's financial
                      circumstances or advice furnished to a client by
Acadian;                  

               b.       information on specific client accounts, including
                    recent or impending securities transactions by
                          clients and activities of the portfolio managers for
client accounts;          

              c.       specific information on Acadian's investments for
                        clients (including former clients) and prospective
       clients and account transactions;

                 d.       information on other Access Persons, including their
                compensation, benefits, position level and
performance rating; and   

          e.       information on Acadian's business activities,
                        including new services, products, technologies and
                      business initiatives, unless disclosure has been
authorized by Acadian.    

Access Persons should be sensitive to the problem of inadvertent or accidental  
disclosure, through careless conversation in a public place or the failure to   
safeguard papers and documents. Documents and papers should be kept in          
appropriately marked file folders and locked in file cabinets when appropriate. 

H.       SERVICE ON A BOARD OF DIRECTORS                                        

Prior to accepting a position as an officer, director, trustee, partner, or     
Controlling person in any other company or business venture (other than a       
non-profit organization that is not a Client of the Company), or as a member of 
an investment organizations (e.g., an investment club), Access persons, must

C.       REVIEW AND ENFORCEMENT                                                 

The Chief Compliance Officer (or other designated compliance associate) will    
review personal securities transactions and holdings reports periodically       
submitted by Access Persons under this Code. The review may include, but not    
limited to, the following:                                                      

       a.       An assessment of whether the access person followed the Code
                and any required internal procedures, such as pre-clearance,
                  including the comparison of the "Pre-Clearance Reports" to the
monthly account statements;                 
  b.       Comparison of personal trading to any restricted lists;
     c.       An assessment of whether the access person and Acadian are
                  trading in the same securities and, if so, whether the clients
          are receiving terms as favorable as the access person;
 d.       Periodically analyzing the access person's trading for
          patterns that may indicate potential compliance issues
               including front running, excessive or short term trading or
market timing.                              
        e.       Any pattern of trading raising the appearance that the access
                person may be taking advantage of their position at Acadian.

Before any determination is made that a personal trading or any other material  
code violation has been committed by any Access Person, the Access Person will  
have the opportunity to supply additional explanatory material. If the Chief    
Compliance Officer initially determines that a violation has occurred, he will  
prepare a written summary of the occurrence, together will all supporting       
information/documentation including any explanatory material provided by the    
Access Person, and present the situation to the Compliance Committee for initial
determination and recommendation for resolution. If deemed warranted by the     
Compliance Committee, the report of the incident and the recommendation for     
resolution will be forwarded to Acadian's Executive Committee and potentially   
outside counsel for evaluation and recommendation for resolution. No Access     
Person will participate in a determination of whether he/she has committed a    
violation or impose any sanction against him/her. All violations and resolutions
will be documented.                                                             

D.       CERTIFICATION OF COMPLIANCE                                            

     1.       INITIAL CERTIFICATION. Acadian provides all Access Persons
            with a copy of this Code of Ethics. Acadian requires all
            Access Persons to certify in writing that they have: (a)
            received a copy of the Code; (b) read and understand all
             provisions of the Code; and (c) agreed to comply with the
terms of the Code.                          

     2.       ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF AMENDMENTS. Acadian will provide Access
                  Persons with any material amendments to its Code of Ethics and
                  Access Persons will submit a written acknowledgement that they
             have received, read, and understood the amendments to the
               Code. Acadian and members of its compliance staff will make
                every attempt to bring important changes to the attention of
Access Persons.                             

         3.       ANNUAL CERTIFICATION. All Access Persons are required annually
                 to certify that they have read, understood, and complied with
the Code of Ethics.

PART 5.  MISCELLANEOUS                                                          
A.       EXCESSIVE OR INAPPROPRIATE TRADING                                     

The Company understands that it is appropriate for Access Persons to participate
in the public securities markets as part of their overall personal investment   
programs. As in other areas, however, this should be done in a way that creates 
no potential conflicts with the interests of any Fund or Portfolio. Further, it 
is important to recognize that otherwise appropriate trading, if excessive      
(measured in terms of frequency, complexity of trading programs, numbers of     
trades, or other measure as deemed appropriate by the Chief Compliance Officer),
may compromise the best interests of any Funds or Portfolios if such excessive  
trading is conducted during the workday or using Fund/Portfolio resources.      
Accordingly, if personal trading rises to such dimension as to create an        
environment that is not consistent with the Code of Ethics, such personal       
transactions may not be approved or may be limited by the Chief Compliance      
Officer.                                                                        

B.       ACCESS PERSON DISCLOSURES AND REPORTING                                

     1.       ACCESS PERSON BACKGROUND INFORMATION. The SEC registration
              form for investment advisors requires the reporting, under
                  oath, of past disciplinary actions taken against all "advisory
             affiliates." The Investment Advisers Act requires similar
           disclosure to the Client. The term "advisory affiliate"
        includes directors and chief officers of an advisor;
         individuals who have the power to direct or cause the
                 direction of the management or policies of a company; and all
                 current Access Persons except those performing only clerical,
               administrative, support or similar functions. Many advisory
              affiliates must also provide biographical information that
                  must be reported to the SEC. If any of the information becomes
             inaccurate or needs to be updated to make it accurate, it
                  shall be your obligation to bring this to the attention of the
Compliance Officer.                         

       2.       UPON OCCURRENCE. Any prior, current, or potential litigation
              in which the Access Person is, or has been, a party, or is
                aware of the possibility of being named as a party, which in
                 any way relates to the Company business, must be disclosed to
the Chief Compliance Officer.               

C.       RESPONSIBILITY TO KNOW THE RULES                                       

Access Persons are responsible for their actions under the law and are therefore
required to be sufficiently familiar with the Advisers Act and other applicable 
federal and state securities laws and regulations to avoid violating them.      
Claimed ignorance of any rule or regulation or of any requirement under this    
Code or any other Acadian policy or procedure is not a defense for employee     
conduct.                                                                        

PART 6.  RECORDKEEPING                                                          

Acadian will maintain the following records in a readily accessible place       
pertaining to this Code of Ethics:                                              

  o      A copy of each Code that has been in effect at any time during the past
five years;                                                   

26

P-->EX-99.P.328th�Page�of�70TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�28th
 o      A record of any violation of the Code and any action taken as a result
     of such violation for five years from the end of the fiscal year in
which the violation occurred;                                 

o      A record of all written acknowledgements of receipt of the Code and  
      amendments for each person who is currently, or within the past five
       years was, a Access Person (these records must be kept for five years
after the individual ceases to be a Access Person of Acadian);

o      Holdings and transactions reports made pursuant to the Code;         

o      A list of the names of persons who are currently, or within the past 
five years were, Access Persons;                              

o      A record of any decision and supporting reasons for approving the    
 acquisition of securities by Access Persons in IPOs and limited
       offerings for at least five years after the end of the fiscal year in
which approval was granted.                                   

o      A record of persons responsible for reviewing Access Persons' reports
currently or during the last five years; and                  

o      A copy of reports provided to the board of directors of any U.S.     
    registered management investment company for which Acadian acts as
adviser or sub-adviser regarding the Code.                    

PART 7.  FORM ADV DISCLOSURE                                                    

Acadian will include on Schedule F of Form ADV, Part II a description of        
Acadian's Code of Ethics, and Acadian will provide a copy of its Code of Ethics 
to any client or prospective client upon request.                               

PART 8.  ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT OF THE CODE                             
A.       TRAINING AND EDUCATION                                                 

Acadian has designated the Chief Compliance Officer and head of Human Resources 
as the persons primarily responsible for training and educating Access Persons  
regarding the Code. In addition to training newly hire Access Persons, a        
training session for all Access Persons will occur at least yearly.             

B.       ANNUAL REVIEW                                                          

The Chief Compliance Officer will review the Code on an ongoing basis to ensure 
effective implementation and to make any revisions necessary to comply with     
regulatory requirements, industry best practices and/or Acadian's changing      
business requirements.                                                          

C.       BOARD APPROVAL (FUND ADVISERS)                                         

Acadian will submit any material amendments to its own Board of Directors, the

D.       REPORT TO THE BOARD(S) OF INVESTMENT COMPANY CLIENTS                   

If requested, Acadian will provide an annual written report to the board of     
directors of each of its U.S. registered management investment company clients  
that describes any issues arising under Acadian's Code of Ethics since the last 
report, including information about material violations of the Code and         
sanctions imposed in response to such violations. The report will include       
discussion of whether any waivers that might be considered important by the     
board were granted during the period. The report must also certify that the     
adviser has adopted procedures reasonably necessary to prevent Access Persons   
from violating the code.                                                        

E.       REPORT TO SENIOR MANAGEMENT                                            

The Chief Compliance Officer will report to Acadian's Compliance and Executive  
Committees regarding the annual review of this Code and to bring all material   
violations to their attention.                                                  

F.       REPORTING VIOLATIONS                                                   

All Access Persons must report violations of Acadian's Code of Ethics promptly  
to the Chief Compliance Officer or other appropriate Access Persons designated  
in this Code. Failure to report a violation known to you will also be considered
a violation of the Code.                                                        

     1.       CONFIDENTIALITY. Any reports pursuant to Acadian's Code of
                 Ethics will be treated confidentially to the extent permitted
              by law and investigated promptly and appropriately. Access
             Persons may submit any violation report referenced herein
anonymously.                                

   2.       ADVICE OF COUNSEL. Access Persons are encouraged to seek
                advice from the Chief Compliance Officer with respect to any
             action or transaction which may violate Acadian's Code of
                 Ethics and should also refrain from any action or transaction
                  with might lead to the appearance of a violation of this Code.

    3.       APPARENT VIOLATIONS. Acadian encourages Access Persons to
              report "apparent" or "suspected" violations of the Code of
                 Ethics in addition to actual or known violations of the Code.

         4.       RETALIATION. Retaliation against any Access Person who reports
           a violation with respect to Acadian's Code of Ethics is
                prohibited and constitutes a further violation of this Code.
                  "Whistle Blower" protections will be afforded those who report
Code violations.                            

G.       SANCTIONS                                                              

Any violation of Acadian's Code of Ethics may result in disciplinary action that
the Chief Compliance Officer or other Firm employee(s) responsible for its      
administration deem appropriate, including but not limited to a warning, fines, 
disgorgement, suspension, demotion, or termination of employment. In addition to
sanctions, violations may result in referral to civil or criminal authorities   
where appropriate.

the Code)                                                                       

4. Which accounts require notice and approval and how do I notify you of a new  
investment account?                                                       

You must notify a member of the compliance team when opening any new account in 
which you have a direct or indirect beneficial interest and in which a security 
covered by the Code can be purchased. This includes but is not limited to:      
o  Individual and joint accounts                                    
o  Accounts in the name of a spouse or domestic partner             
   o  Accounts in the name of minor children or any other person living in
your house and/or dependent on you for financial support      
o  Trust accounts                                                   
o  Estate accounts                                                  
o  Accounts where you have power of attorney or trading authority

Please use the Investment Account Approval form (exhibit 1) in the Code of      
Ethics to report new accounts or disclose a new account as part of the monthly  
transaction reporting. A copy of these forms are also available on the employee 
web site. (See page 10 for information on accounts covered by the Code)         

5. DO I HAVE TO REPORT OR PRECLEAR TRANSACTIONS IN MY ACADIAN 401K?             

No, employees are not required to report or preclear transactions that they make
in their 401K accounts. (See page 10 for a list of accounts covered by the Code)

6. What type of securities require preclearance and how do I get a trade        
approved?                                                                 

Securities covered by the scope of the Code of Ethics include:                  
o  All stocks and bonds                                             
o  Investment or futures contracts (except for currency forwards)   
o  Options or warrants                                              
o  Limited partnerships                                             
o  ETFs, ADRs, EDRs and GDRs                                        
o  Closed-end investment companies                                  
      o  Open-end mutual funds that are advised or sub-advised by Acadian or one
of its affiliates                                             
o  Private investment funds, hedge funds and investment clubs       

All transactions in these security types must be pre-cleared by a member of the 
Compliance group. Preclearance is good for a period of 24 hours. To obtain      
trading approval, please complete the Personal Securities Transaction           
Preclearance form (exhibit 2 in the Code) which is available on the employee web
site. (See pages 15-16 for details on personal securities transactions)         

7. How long do I have to wait before I can sell a stock?                        

Unless the Chief Compliance Officer grants an exception, no Access Person may   
profit in the purchase or sale, or sale and purchase of the same securities     
within 60 calendar days. Trades made in violation of this prohibition should be 
unwound immediately if possible. Otherwise, any profits realized on such a      
transaction are subject to disgorgement to a charity designated by Acadian or to
a client if appropriate. (See page 16 for Acadian's short-term trading policy)  

8. How can I obtain pre-clearance for a short-term trade (less than 60 days     
between trades)?                                                          

The short-term trade rule can be circumvented with prior approval from the Chief
Compliance Officer. To submit a request for approval of a short-term trade,     
please complete the Short-Term Trading Reporting and Approval form (exhibit 4 in
the Code) which is available on the employee web site.                          

9. Does Acadian have a blackout period? If so, are there any exceptions?        

A five (5) day blackout period applies to Access Person trading. A "pre-trade"  
blackout period of trade date plus two days prior to trade date will apply to   
all Access Persons who become aware or reasonably should have been aware because
of their job responsibilities that a security is being considered for purchase  
or sale for a client account. This "pre-trade" blackout period will not apply to
Access Persons who did not know of and had no reason to know of the pending     

63

P-->EX-99.P.365th�Page�of�70TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�65th
transaction. A "post-trade" blackout period of trade date plus two days after   
trade date will apply to all Access Persons regardless of job responsibilities. 
Exeptions to this rule include transactions in stocks where the market cap      
exceeds $2 billion and/or where the number of shares being purchased or sold is 
less than 500. Also exempt from the blackout period are transactions effected   
for the employee's 401K plan or purchases made as part of a dividend            
reinvestment plan (DRIP). (See page 16 for additional details about black-out   
periods)                                                                        

10. What is Acadian's gift and entertainment policy?                            

Persons may not accept inappropriate gifts, favors, entertainment, special      
accommodations or other things of material value that could influence their     
decision making or make them feel beholden to a person or firm. Access Persons  
are expressly prohibited from considering gifts, gratuities or entertainment    
when choosing brokers or vendors. Similarly, Access Persons may not offer gifts,
favors, entertainment or other things of value that could be viewed as overly   
generous or aimed at influencing decision-making or making a client feel        
beholden to Acadian or the Access Person. For purposes of the Code, value of    
gifts or services received or offered may not exceed $250 ($100 if the Access   
Person is registered with the NASD). If the anticipated value of the            
entertainment is expected to exceed $250 per person, preapproval from a         
supervisor is required prior to acceptance of the entertainment. Persons may    
provide or accept an occasional business entertainment event, at a venue where  
business is typically discussed, such as dinner or a sporting event, of         
reasonable value, provided that the person or a representative of the entity    
providing the entertainment is present. Approval for such events should be      
solicited using the Entertainment Approval form (exhibit 5). All employees are  
required to report any gifts or entertainment received on a quarterly basis     
using the Quarterly Gift and Entertainment Reporting form (exhibit 6). (See     
pages 18-19 for details on Acadian's gift and entertainment policy)             

11. What is the policy regarding political contributions? Charitable            
contributions?                                                          

Acadian and all Access Persons are prohibited from making political             
contributions to any candidate or party for the purpose of obtaining or         
retaining advisory contracts. This includes contributing to any candidate       
involved with or having any influence over the investment manager selection     
process. Acadian as a firm does not make political contributions. In general,   
access persons are prohibited from making a political contribution to any       
candidate for office in a state or district for which the employee is not       
eligible to vote.                                                               

Although Acadian encourages its Access Persons to be charitable, no donations   
should be made or should appear to have been made for the purpose of obtaining  
or retaining client business. Any client or prospect request to Acadian or an   
Acadian employee for a charitable donation should be brought to the attention of
the Compliance Committee. Any donation made by the firm or an employee to a     
client or prospect charity should be nominal so as not appear to have been made 
to obtain or retain the business. (See page 19 for details on Acadian's         
contributions policy)                                                           

II. FIDUCIARY DUTY AND CONFLICTS OF INTEREST (SEE PAGES 12-13 FOR ADDITIONAL    
INFORMATION ON CONFLICTS OF INTEREST)                                   

1. What constitutes a conflict of interest?                                     

Conflicts of interest can arise in any number of situations. No comprehensive   
list of all possible conflicts of interest can be provided in this memorandum.  
However, the following example may                                              

64

P-->EX-99.P.366th�Page�of�70TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�66th
be helpful. Consider these two cases: an Access Person seeking to induce a bank 
to give the Access Person a loan in exchange for maintaining excessive cash     
balances of a Client with the bank, and an Access Person executing trades for a 
Client through a broker-dealer that provides research services for the Company  
but charges commissions higher than other broker-dealers. In the first case,    
such activity would be a violation of an Access Person's fiduciary duty and     
might subject the Access Person and the Company to liability under the Advisers 
Act and other applicable laws. In the latter case, if the Company determines in 
good faith that the higher commissions are reasonable in relation to the value  
of the brokerage and research services provided, the payment of higher          
commissions may be permitted under the safe harbor of Section 28(e) of the      
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 -- as long as appropriate disclosure is made to 
the Client and in the Company's Form ADV.                                       

Another common conflict of interest occurs when the Company pays some           
consideration to a person for recommending the Company as an adviser. In those  
circumstances, an Access Person must make disclosure to any prospective Client  
of any consideration paid for recommending the Company's services to that       
prospective Client and the Company must comply with Rule 206(4)-3 of the        
Advisers Act. This Rule governs situations involving cash payments for Client   
solicitations and requires that specific disclosure documents containing        
information about the solicitor and the adviser be provided to a prospective    
Client at the time of the solicitation.                                         

2. How should conflicts of interest be handled?                                 

The Company and its Access Persons have a fiduciary duty to act for the benefit 
of the Clients and to take action on the Clients' behalf before taking action in
the interest of any Access Person or the Company.                               

The manner in which any Access Person discharges this fiduciary duty depends on 
the circumstances. Sometimes general disclosure of common conflicts of interest 
may suffice. In other circumstances, explicit consent of the Client to the      
particular transaction giving rise to a conflict of interest may be required or 
an Access Person may be prohibited from engaging in the transaction regardless  
of whether the Client consents.                                                 

The Client's consent will not in all cases insulate the Access Person against a 
claim of breach of the Access Person's fiduciary duty. Full disclosure of all   
material facts must be given if consent is to be effective. As a result,        
consents concerning possible future breaches of laws will not usually work.     
However, waivers of known past violations may be effective. In addition, a      
Client under the Control and influence of the Access Person or who has come to  
rely on the Access Person's investment decisions cannot effectively consent to a
conflict of interest or breach of fiduciary duty. Consent must be competent,    
informed and freely given.                                                      

The duty to disclose and obtain a Client's consent to a conflict of interest    
must always be undertaken in a manner consistent with the Access Person's duty  
to deal fairly with the Client. Therefore, even when taking action with a       
Client's consent, each Access Person must always seek to assure that the action 
taken is fair to the Client.                                                    

If any Access Person is faced with any conflict of interest, he or she should   
consult the Chief Compliance Officer or designee prior to taking any action.

III. MATERIAL INSIDE INFORMATION (SEE PAGES 13-14 FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON 
INSIDER TRADING)                                                      

1. Who is subject to the insider trading rules?                                 

All Company staff and all persons -- friends, relatives, business associates and
others -- who receive nonpublic material inside information from Company staff  
concerning an issuer of securities (whether such issuer is a Client or not) are 
subject to these rules. It does not matter whether the issuer is public or      
private.                                                                        

At the Company, the rules apply to officers, marketing, advisory,               
administrative, secretarial, or other staff. Furthermore, if any Access Person  
gives nonpublic material inside information concerning an issuer of securities  
to a person outside the Company and that person trades in securities of that    
issuer, the Access Person and that person may have both civil and criminal      
liability.                                                                      

2. What is "material inside information"?                                       

Generally speaking, material inside information is significant information about
an issuer's business or operations (past, present or prospective) that becomes  
known to an Access Person and which is not otherwise available to the public.   
While the exact meaning of the word "material" is not entirely clear, it turns  
on whether the information about an issuer would influence an investor in any   
investment decision concerning that issuer's securities and whether the         
information has not already been disclosed to the public. Under current court   
decisions, it makes no difference whether the material inside information is    
good or bad. Needless to say, if the undisclosed information would influence an 
Access Person's own decision to buy or sell or to trade for a Client or the     
Company, the information probably is material and an Access Person should not   
trade or permit the Company to trade for a Client or itself until it has been   
publicly disclosed.                                                             

3. How does "material inside information" differ from "confidential             
information"?                                                             

Here is an example that should clarify the difference between the two. Suppose  
the Company is engaged by the president of a publicly traded corporation to     
provide advice concerning her personal pension fund and while working on the    
matter an Access Person learns the amount of alimony she pays to her former     
spouse. That discovery should be kept confidential, but it almost certainly has 
no bearing on the value of her corporation's securities (i.e., it is not        
material) and, in fact, it probably is not "inside information" about the       
corporation itself. Accordingly, an Access Person of the Company could buy or   
sell securities of that issuer so long as the Access Person possesses no        
material nonpublic information about the corporation. But disclosure of the     
president's alimony payments would be entirely improper and in breach of        
fiduciary duty.                                                                 

In other words, confidential information should never be disclosed, but it is   
not always material inside information. Knowing it is not necessarily an        
impediment to participating in the securities markets concerning a particular   
issuer.                                                                         

4.       Are there certain kinds of information that are particularly likely to 
be "material inside information"?                             

Yes. While the following list is by no means complete, information about the    
following subjects is particularly sensitive:                                   

66

       e.  Significant negotiations, new contracts or changes in significant

      g.  Adoption of stock option plans or other significant compensation

       h.  Proposed public or private sales of additional or new securities.
i.  Significant changes in operations.

1.  Significant increases or declines in backlogs of orders.  
m.  Significant new products to be introduced.                
n.  Write-offs.                                               
o.  Changes in accounting methods.                            
     p.  Unusual corporate developments such as major layoffs, personnel
        furloughs or unscheduled vacations for a significant number of
workers.                                              
q.  Labor slowdowns, work stoppages, strikes, or the pending  
negotiation of a significant labor contract.          
        r.  Significant reductions in the availability of goods from suppliers
or shortages of these goods.                          
s.  Extraordinary borrowings.                                 
t.  Major litigation.                                         
      u.  Governmental investigations concerning the Company or any of its
officers or directors.                                
v.  Financial liquidity problems.                             
w.  Bankruptcy proceedings.                                   
      x.  Establishment of a program to repurchase outstanding securities.

5. What is the law regarding the use of material inside information?            

Federal law, and the policy of the Company, prohibit any Access Person from     
using material inside information, whether obtained in the course of working at 
the Company or otherwise, for his or her private gain, for the Company's gain or
for a Client's gain and prohibit any Access Person from furnishing such         
information to others for their private gain. This is true whether or not the   
information is considered "confidential". When in doubt, the information should 
be presumed to be material and not to have been disclosed to the public. No     
trades should be executed for any Access Person, any Client or for the Company, 
if the person executing the trade or the Company has material inside information
about the issuer.                                                               

6. What is "tipping"?                                                           

Under the federal securities laws, it is illegal to disclose (or "tip") material
inside information to another person who subsequently uses that information for 
his or her profit.                                                              

Questions regarding whether such information may constitute "inside" information
should be referred to the Chief Compliance Officer.                             

67

P-->EX-99.P.369th�Page�of�70TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�69th
7. To whom must material inside information be disclosed before an Access Person
can trade?                                                                

To the public. Public disclosure of material events is usually made by means of 
an official press release or filing with the SEC. An Access Person's disclosure 
to a broker or other person will not be effective, and such Access Person may   
face civil or criminal liability if such Access Person (or the person to whom   
the Access Person makes disclosure) trades on the basis of the information.     
Company staff should be aware that in most cases they are not authorized to     
disclose material events about an issuer to the public and that right usually   
belongs to the issuer alone.                                                    

8. How does an Access Person know whether particular material inside            
information has been publicly disclosed?                                  

If an Access Person sees information in a newspaper or public magazine, that    
information will clearly have been disclosed. Information in a filing with the  
SEC or a press release will also have been disclosed. However, the courts have  
said that one should wait for a reasonable period of time after the publication,
filing or release date to assure that the information has been widely           
disseminated and that the public has had sufficient time to evaluate the news.  
If any Access Person has any questions about whether information has been       
disclosed, such Access Person should not trade in the affected securities.      

9. What must an Access Person do with respect to material inside                
information obtained after a decision is already made or buy or sell      
that Security?                                                            

Company staff may not purchase or sell any securities about which they have     
inside information for their own, the Company's or for a Client's account or    
cause Clients to trade on such information until after such information becomes 
public. The foregoing prohibition applies whether or not the material inside    
information is the basis for the trade. Company staff should be alert for       
information they receive about issuers on their recommendation or approved lists
that may be material inside information. Whenever Company staff come into       
possession of what they believe may be material nonpublic information about an  
issuer, they should notify the Chief Compliance Officer because the Company as a
whole may have an obligation not to trade in the securities of the issuer.      

10. Who is available for additional advice or advice about a particular         
situation?                                                              

The Chief Compliance Officer or his designee will oversee matters relating to   
inside information and prohibitions on insider trading. Currently, all questions
should be addressed to Scott Dias or, in his absence, Mark Minichiello.         

IV. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION (SEE PAGE 20 FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING  
CONFIDENTIALITY)                                                                

1. What is confidential information?                                            

An investment adviser has a fiduciary duty to its Clients not to divulge        
information obtained in connection with its services as an adviser. Therefore,  
all information, whether of a personal or business nature, that an Access Person
obtains about a Client's affairs during employment with the Company should be   
treated as confidential both during the Access Persons employment and after     
employment terminates. Such information may sometimes include information about 
non-

P-->EX-99.P.3Last�Page�of�70TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�70th
Clients, and that information should likewise be held in confidence. Even       
the fact that the Company advises a particular Client should ordinarily be      
treated as confidential.                                                        

2. Who is subject to the Company's policies concerning confidential information?

All personnel -- officers and advisory, marketing, administrative and           
secretarial staff -- are subject to these policies. (For the sake of            
convenience, this group is sometimes referred to in this memorandum as "Company 
staff").                                                                        

3. What are the duties and responsibilities of Company staff with respect to    
confidential information?                                                 

Since an investment adviser has a fiduciary duty to its Clients not to divulge  
information obtained from or about a Client in connection with its services as  
an adviser, Company staff must not repeat or disclose confidential information  
received from or about Clients outside the Company to anyone, including         
relatives, friends or strangers. Any misuse of confidential information about a 
Client is a disservice to the Client that may cause both the Client and the     
Company substantial injury. Failure to comply with this policy may have very    
serious consequences for Company staff and for the Company, including           
termination and criminal action.                                                

4. What are some steps that Company staff can take to assure that confidential  
information is not disclosed to persons outside the office?               

There are a number of steps Company staff should take to help preserve Client   
and other confidences, including the following:                                 

i.   Company staff should be sensitive to the problem of inadvertent or   
        accidental disclosure. Careless conversation, naming names or describing
      details of a current or proposed trade, investment or transaction in a
    lounge, hallway, elevator or restore, or in a train, taxi, airplane,
 restaurant or other public place, can result in the disclosure of
confidential information and should be strictly avoided.        

 ii.  Maintenance of confidentiality requires careful safeguarding of papers
        and documents, both inside and outside the Company. Documents and papers
      should be kept in appropriately marked file folders and locked in file
cabinets when appropriate.                                      

iii. If an Access Person uses a speakerphone, the Access Person should be 
   careful to refrain from using it in any way that might increase the
   likelihood of accidental disclosure. Use caution, for example, when
      participating in a speakerphone conversation dealing with confidential
        information if the office door is open, or if the speakerphone volume is
    set too high. The same applies if an Access Person knows or suspects
    that a speakerphone or a second extension phone is being used at the
other end of a telephone conversation.                          

iv.  In especially sensitive situations, it may be necessary to establish       
barriers to the exchange of information within the Company and to take other    
steps to prevent the leak of confidential information.

Dear Shareholder:                                                               

The Phoenix Appreciation Fund (the "Merged Series"), a series of Phoenix  
Trust (the "Trust"), will hold a Special Meeting of Shareholders at 2:00 p.m.,  
local time, on March 19, 2004, at the offices of Phoenix Investment Partners,   
Ltd., 56 Prospect Street, Hartford, Connecticut 06115. At the Special Meeting,  
the shareholders of the Merged Series (formerly known as the Phoenix-Hollister  
Appreciation Fund) will vote on an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization under   
which the Merged Series will be combined with the Phoenix Small Cap Value Fund  
(the "Surviving Series"), a series of Phoenix Investment Trust 97. The Surviving
Series has a similar investment objective to that of the Merged Series. If the  
reorganization agreement is implemented, you will become a shareholder of the   
Surviving Series and will receive shares of the corresponding class of the      
Surviving Series with an aggregate net asset value equal to the aggregate net   
asset value of your investment in the Merged Series. No sales charge will be    
imposed in connection with the reorganization. Phoenix Investment Partners, Ltd.
will pay all costs of the reorganization.                                       

The Board of Trustees of the Trust believes that the reorganization offers
you the opportunity to pursue your goals in a larger fund. The Board of Trustees
has carefully considered and has unanimously approved the proposed              
reorganization, as described in the accompanying materials, and believes that   
the reorganization is in the best interests of the Merged Series and its        
shareholders. Therefore, the Board of Trustees recommends that you vote in favor
of the Agreement and Plan of Reorganization.                                    

   We have enclosed a copy of the Notice of Special Meeting of Shareholders, the
Proxy Statement and a proxy card. This card should be used to register your vote

PROSPECTUS/PROXY STATEMENT
  DATED JANUARY 30, 2004

This Prospectus/Proxy Statement is being furnished in connection with the 
solicitation of proxies by the Board of Trustees of Phoenix Trust (the "Trust"),
for use at the Special Meeting of Shareholders of the Phoenix Appreciation Fund 
(the "Merged Series") to be held at 2:00 p.m., local time, on March 19, 2004 at 
Phoenix Investment Partners, Ltd., 56 Prospect Street, Hartford, Connecticut
06115, and at any adjournment(s).                                               

The purpose of the meeting is to consider an Agreement and Plan of        
Reorganization that would effect the reorganization of the Merged Series into   
the Phoenix Small Cap Value Fund (the "Surviving Series"), a series of Phoenix  
Investment Trust 97 (the "Acquiring Trust"), as described below. Under the      
reorganization agreement, all or substantially all of the assets of the Merged  
Series would be transferred to the Surviving Series in exchange solely for      
shares of the corresponding classes in the Surviving Series and the assumption  
by the Surviving Series of all liabilities of the Merged Series. These shares of
the Surviving Series would then be distributed pro rata to the shareholders of  
the corresponding classes of the Merged Series, and then the Merged Series would
be liquidated. As a result of the proposed transactions, each shareholder of the
Merged Series would receive a number of full and fractional shares of the       
corresponding class of the Surviving Series with an aggregate net asset value   
equal to the aggregate net asset value of the shareholder's Merged Series shares
on the effective date of the reorganization.                                    

The Surviving Series and the Merged Series are each portfolio series of   
open-end management investment companies. The Surviving Series has an investment
objective to seek long-term capital appreciation. The Merged Series has an      
investment objective of increasing the value of your investment over the long   
term (capital appreciation) consistent with preserving capital and reducing     
portfolio exposure to market risk. Phoenix Investment Counsel, Inc. is employed 
as the investment advisor for the Surviving Series. At a shareholder meeting of 
the Surviving Series held on January 27, 2004, shareholders of the Surviving    
Series approved Phoenix/Zweig Advisers LLC ("PZA"), as a subadvisor for the     
Surviving Series. PZA is the investment advisor for the Merged Series.

Merged Series, the Surviving Series, and the transactions contemplated by the   
reorganization agreement. As used in this Prospectus/Proxy Statement, the term

SYNOPSIS
BACKGROUND                                                                      

  The proposed reorganization is the outcome of deliberations by the Boards of
Trustees of the Phoenix Funds and two trusts. Phoenix/Zweig Advisers LLC ("PZA")
and Phoenix Investment Counsel, Inc. ("PIC"), the advisors to the Merged Series 
and the Surviving Series, respectively, recommended that the Trustees of the    
respective trusts consider the benefits that the shareholders would realize if  
the Merged Series was to be combined with the Surviving Series. In response to  
their recommendation, the independent trustees of each trust requested that     
management outline a specific reorganization proposal for their consideration   
and provide an analysis of the specific benefits that shareholders would realize
from the proposal. Independent trustees are trustees who are not "interested    
persons" of their respective trusts (as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the      
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act")). After considering 
the specific reorganization proposal, the Trustees of the Trust and the         
Acquiring Trust, including the independent trustees, at meetings held on        
November 12, 2003 and November 19, 2003, respectively, unanimously approved the 
reorganization.                                                                 

SUMMARY OF THE PROPOSED REORGANIZATION                                          

The reorganization will be effected in accordance with the terms of a     
reorganization agreement, a form of which is attached to this Prospectus/Proxy  
Statement as Exhibit A. The reorganization agreement provides for:              

o  the acquisition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Merged
Series by the Surviving Series in exchange solely for shares of the 
corresponding class in the Surviving Series;                        

o  the assumption by the Surviving Series of all liabilities of the Merged
Series;                                                             

o  the pro rata distribution of the corresponding class of the Surviving  
Series shares to the Merged Series shareholders in exchange for the 
outstanding Merged Series shares; and                               

o  the liquidation of the Merged Series.                                  

   The reorganization is anticipated to occur on or about March 26, 2004. If the
reorganization agreement is implemented, each Merged Series shareholder will    
receive a number of full and fractional shares of the corresponding class of the
Surviving Series shares with an aggregate net asset value equal to the aggregate
net asset value of his or her Merged Series shares as of the closing date of the
reorganization.                                                                 

  The implementation of the reorganization agreement is subject to a number of
conditions set forth in the reorganization agreement. See "The Proposed
Reorganization." Among the significant conditions (which may not be waived) are:

o  the receipt by each trust of an opinion of counsel as to the Federal   
income tax consequences of the reorganization; and                  

o  the approval of the reorganization agreement by the shareholders of the
Merged Series.                                                      

  The reorganization agreement provides that Phoenix Investment Partners, Ltd.
will bear all costs and expenses of the reorganization, including the costs of  
the Special Meeting, the costs and expenses incurred in the preparation and     
mailing of the notice, this Prospectus/Proxy Statement and the proxy, and the

 The investment objectives and principal investment strategies of the Merged
Series and the Surviving Series are similar:

 o  The Merged Series has an investment objective of increasing the value of
  the shareholder's investment over the long term (capital appreciation)
 consistent with preserving capital and reducing portfolio exposure to
 market risk. The Surviving Series has an investment objective to seek
long-term capital appreciation.                                     

o  Under normal circumstances, the Merged Series invests its total assets 
primarily in common stocks of companies with smaller capitalizations
(generally less than $2 billion) with both value or growth          
     characteristics. Under normal circumstances, the Surviving Series invests
at least 80% of its total assets in securities of issuers with      
   capitalization of less than $2 billion with value characteristic at the
time of investment.                                                 

Both the Merged Series and the Surviving Series invest primarily in equity
securities issued by small-cap companies (those with a market capitalization of 
below $2 billion). The Series differ, however, because the Merged Series invests
in small-cap companies with growth and value characteristics, while the         
Surviving Series invests primarily in small-cap companies with value            
characteristics. You may also see "Principal Risk Factors" and "Comparison of
Investment Objectives and Policies" below, for further information on the       
similarities and differences between the investment objectives, policies and    
risks of the Surviving Series and the Merged Series. You can also find          
additional information for the Surviving Series in its Prospectus.              

DISTRIBUTION AND PURCHASE ARRANGEMENTS                                          

   Each of the Merged Series and the Surviving Series currently offers three
classes of shares: Class A, Class B and Class C shares. Shares are offered to   
the public at a price equal to the net asset value per share plus applicable    
sales and distribution charges. For Class A Shares of each series, sales charges
are imposed at the time of purchase. For Class B and Class C Shares of each     
series, sales charges are imposed on a contingent deferred basis.               

See "Comparative Information on Distribution Arrangements", below, for    
further information on the distribution arrangements of each series. You can    
also find additional information on distribution arrangements for the Surviving 
Series in its Prospectus.                                                       

DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS                                                     

 The Merged Series distributes net investment income annually. The Surviving
Series distributes net investment income semi-annually. Both series distribute  
net realized capital gains, if any, at least annually.                          

   All dividends and distributions of the Merged Series and the Surviving Series
are paid in additional shares of the respective series unless shareholders elect
to receive cash. You can also find additional information on dividends and      
distributions for the Surviving Series in its Prospectus.                       

EXCHANGES                                                                       

The Merged Series and the Surviving Series currently offer shareholders   
identical exchange privileges. Shareholders of the Merged Series and the        
Surviving Series may exchange their shares for shares of a corresponding class  
of shares of other affiliated Phoenix funds.                                    

On exchanges with corresponding classes of shares that carry a contingent 
deferred sales charge, the contingent deferred sales charge schedule of the     
original shares purchased continues to apply. You can also find additional      
information on the Surviving Series' exchange privileges in its Prospectus.     

REDEMPTION PROCEDURES                                                           

Shareholders of both the Merged Series and the Surviving Series may redeem
their shares at a redemption price equal to the net asset value of the shares   
(minus any applicable contingent deferred sales charge) as next determined      
following the receipt of a redemption order in proper form. Ordinarily, payments
of redemption proceeds for redeemed Merged Series and Surviving Series shares   
are made within seven days after receipt of a redemption

FEDERAL TAX CONSEQUENCES OF PROPOSED REORGANIZATION                             

  At the closing of the reorganization, the Trust and the Acquiring Trust will
receive an opinion of counsel, subject to certain assumptions and               
representations, that:                                                          

   o  no gain or loss will be recognized by the Merged Series on the transfer of
   the assets of the Merged Series to the Surviving Series in exchange for
     Surviving Series shares and the assumption by the Surviving Series of all
  liabilities of the Merged Series or upon the distribution of Surviving
 Series shares to the Merged Series shareholders in exchange for their
shares of the Merged Series;                                        

o  the aggregate tax basis of the Surviving Series shares, including any  
fractional shares, received by each shareholder of the Merged Series
      pursuant to the reorganization will be the same as the aggregate tax basis
     of the Merged Series shares held by such shareholder immediately prior to
the reorganization; and                                             

o  the holding period of the Surviving Series shares, including fractional
shares, to be received by each shareholder of the Merged Series will
include the period during which the Merged Series shares exchanged  
   therefor were held by such shareholder (provided that the Merged Series
   shares were held as a capital asset on the date of the reorganization).

 See "The Proposed Reorganization--Federal Income Tax Consequences" for more
information.                                                                    

RISK FACTORS                                                                    

An investment in the Surviving Series is subject to specific risks arising
from the types of securities in which the Surviving Series invests and general  
risks arising from investing in any mutual fund type of investment. The specific
risks to which the Surviving Series is subject include the risks of investing in
the stocks of companies with small capitalizations and in convertible           
securities. Investors can lose money by investing in the Surviving Series. There
is no assurance that the Surviving Series will meet its investment objective.   

The Merged Series and the Surviving Series are each subject to general    
investment risk, as well as risks inherent to investment in small capitalization
companies. The Merged Series also has the risk of investing in growth stocks,   
which the Surviving Series does not. Conversely, the Surviving Series has the   
risk of investing in convertible securities, which the Merged Series does not.  
You may also see "Principal Risk Factors" for the principal risks associated    
with an investment in the Surviving Series.

The tables below include pro forma information for the combined Surviving 
Series resulting from the reorganization assuming the reorganization took place 
on August 31, 2003, and after adjusting such information to reflect current     
fees. The expense information for the Surviving Series and the Merged Series is 
based upon expenses for the twelve months ended August 31, 2003.                

 As indicated in the following tables, immediately upon effectiveness of the
reorganization, the "Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses" for the combined     
Surviving Series are expected to be slightly lower than the "Total Annual Fund  
Operating Expenses" for the Merged Series.

(a)  The investment management fee for the Merged Series has been reduced to    
0.90% pursuant to a voluntary fee waiver.                             
(b)  Distribution and Service Fees represent an asset-based sales charge that,  
     for a long-term shareholder, may be higher than the maximum front-end sales
charge permitted by the NASD.                                         
(c)  The Surviving Series' investment advisor has agreed to reimburse through   
 December 31, 2004 the Surviving Series' expenses, other than Management
  Fees and Distribution and Service Fees, to the extent that such expenses
   exceed 0.25% for each class of shares. Actual Total Annual Fund Operating
     Expenses, after expense reimbursement, were 1.40% for Class A Shares, 2.15%
    for Class B Shares, and 2.15% for Class C Shares for the fiscal year ended
August 31, 2003.

EXAMPLE                                                                         

These examples illustrate the impact of the above fees and expenses on an 
account with an initial investment of $10,000, based on the expenses shown      
above. They assume a 5% annual return, the reinvestment of all dividends and    
distributions and "Annual Fund Operating Expenses" remaining the same each year.
In the case of Class B Shares, it is assumed that your shares are converted to  
Class A Shares after seven years with respect to the Merged Series and after    
eight years with respect to the Surviving Series. These examples are            
hypothetical; actual series expenses and returns vary from year to year and may 
be higher or lower than those shown.                                            

   Fees and expenses if you redeemed your shares at the end of each time period:

  Note: Actual expenses for the Surviving Series may be lower than those shown
in the example above since the expense levels used to calculate the figures     
shown do not include the reimbursement of expenses over certain levels by the   
Surviving Series' investment advisor. In the same manner, the voluntary         
management fee waiver for the Merged Series is not reflected.                   

The purpose of the tables above is to help the investor understand the    
various costs and expenses that the investor will bear directly or indirectly.  
THE EXAMPLE SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED A REPRESENTATION OF PAST OR FUTURE         
EXPENSES. ACTUAL EXPENSES MAY BE GREATER OR LESS THAN SHOWN.                    

PRINCIPAL RISK FACTORS

 Because the Surviving Series' investment objective and policies are similar
to those of the Merged Series, an investment in the Surviving Series is subject 
to many of the same specific risks as an investment in the Merged Series. The   
following highlights the principal similarities and differences between the     
principal risk factors associated with an investment in the Surviving Series as 
contrasted with those associated with the Merged Series and is qualified in its 
entirety by the more extensive discussion of risk factors in the Prospectuses   
and Statements of Additional Information of the Surviving Series and the Merged 
Series, respectively.                                                           

The Merged Series and the Surviving Series are each subject to general    
investment risk, as well as risks inherent to investment in small capitalization
companies. The Merged Series also has the risk of investing in growth stocks,   
which the Surviving Series does not. Conversely, the Surviving Series has the   
risk of investing in convertible securities, which the Merged Series does not.  

An investment in the Surviving Series is subject to specific risks arising
from the types of securities in which the Surviving Series invests and general  
risks arising from investing in any mutual fund. You can lose money by investing
in the Surviving Series. There is no assurance that the Surviving Series will   
meet its investment objective.                                                  

GENERAL                                                                         

The value of the investments of the Merged Series and the Surviving Series
that supports your share value can decrease. If between the time you purchase   
shares and the time you sell shares, the value of your fund's investments       
decreases, you will lose money.                                                 

  Investment values can decrease for a number of reasons. Conditions affecting
the overall economy, specific industries or companies in which your fund invests
can be worse than expected and investments may fail to perform as the series'   
investment subadvisor expects. As a result, the value of your shares may        
decrease.                                                                       

SMALL CAPITALIZATIONS                                                           

Companies with small capitalizations are often companies with a limited   
operating history or companies in industries that have recently emerged due to  
cultural, economic, regulatory or technological developments. Such developments 
can have a significant impact or negative effect on small capitalization        
companies and their stock performance, and can make investment returns highly   
volatile. Product lines are often less diversified and subject to competitive   
threats. Small capitalization stocks are subject to varying patterns of trading 
volume and may, at times, be difficult to sell. This risk is common to both     
series.                                                                         

CONVERTIBLE SECURITIES                                                          

Convertible securities may be subject to redemption at the option of the  
issuer. If a security is called for redemption, the series may have to redeem   
the security, convert it into common stock or sell it to a third party at a     
price and time that is not beneficial for the series. In addition, securities   
convertible into common stocks may have higher yields than common stocks but    
lower yields than comparable non-convertible securities.

 THE PROPOSED REORGANIZATION
AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION 

The terms and conditions under which the proposed reorganization may be   
consummated are set forth in the reorganization agreement. Significant          
provisions of the reorganization agreement are summarized below. This summary,  
however, is qualified in its entirety by reference to the reorganization        
agreement, a form of which is attached to this Prospectus/Proxy Statement as    
Exhibit A.                                                                      

The Agreement and Plan of Reorganization contemplates:                    

o  the acquisition by the Surviving Series, on the closing date of the    
   reorganization, of all or substantially all of the assets of the Merged
  Series in exchange solely for shares of the corresponding class of the
Surviving Series and the assumption by the Surviving Series of all  
liabilities of the Merged Series; and                               

o  the distribution of shares of the corresponding class of the Surviving 
 Series to the shareholders of the Merged Series in exchange for their
respective shares of the Merged Series.                             

The assets of the Merged Series to be acquired by the Surviving Series    
include all property, including, without limitation, all cash, securities,      
commodities and futures interests, and dividends or interest receivables which  
are owned by the Merged Series and any deferred or prepaid expenses shown as an 
asset on the books of the Merged Series on the closing date of the              
reorganization. The Surviving Series will assume all liabilities, accrued or    
contingent expenses, costs, charges, and reserves of the Merged Series reflected
on an unaudited statement of assets and liabilities as of the closing date. The 
closing of the reorganization will occur following satisfaction (or waiver) of  
the conditions to closing set forth in the reorganization agreement (currently  
anticipated to be on or about March 26, 2004), or such later date as the parties
may agree.                                                                      

  The value of the Merged Series' assets to be acquired and the Merged Series'
liabilities to be assumed by the Surviving Series and the net asset value of    
each class of shares of the Surviving Series will be determined immediately     
after the close of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange on the closing
date, using the valuation procedures set forth in the series' then current      
Prospectus and Statement of Additional Information. The number of shares of each
class of the Surviving Series to be issued to the Merged Series will be         
determined by dividing (a) the value of the aggregate net assets attributable to
each class of shares of the Merged Series by (b) the net asset value per share  
of the corresponding class of the Surviving Series.                             

   On the closing date, the Merged Series will liquidate and distribute pro rata
to its shareholders of record the Surviving Series shares received by the Merged
Series in exchange for their respective shares in the Merged Series. This       
liquidation and distribution will be accomplished by opening an account on the  
books of the Surviving Series in the name of each shareholder of record of the  
Merged Series and by crediting to each account the shares due pursuant to the   
reorganization. Every Merged Series shareholder will own shares of the          
corresponding class of the Surviving Series immediately after the               
reorganization, the value of which will be equal to the value of the            
shareholder's Merged Series shares immediately prior to the reorganization.     

   At or prior to the closing date, the Merged Series will declare a dividend or
dividends which, together with all previous such dividends, will have the effect
of distributing to the Merged Series shareholders all of the Merged Series'     
investment company taxable income for all taxable years ending at or prior to   
the closing date (computed without regard to any deduction for dividends paid)  
and all of its net capital gains realized (after reduction for any capital loss 
carry-forward) in all taxable years ending at or prior to the closing date.     

  Subject to certain limitations on liability, the Surviving Series has agreed
to indemnify and hold harmless the Trustees of the Trust who are not "interested
persons" of the advisor or distributor of the Merged Series (the "Independent   
Trustees") from and against any and all claims, costs, expenses (including      
reasonable attorneys' fees), losses and liabilities of any sort or kind         
(collectively "Liability") which may be asserted against them or for which the  
Independent Trustees may become liable arising out of or attributable to the    
transactions contemplated by the                                                

12

P-->N-14/A20th�Page�of�68TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�20th
reorganization agreement, provided that any Independent Trustee seeking the     
benefit of this indemnification shall not have materially contributed to the    
creation of such Liability by acting in a manner contrary to his or her         
fiduciary duties as a trustee under the 1940 Act.                               

 The consummation of the reorganization is subject to a number of conditions
set forth in the reorganization agreement. Certain of these conditions may be   
waived by the Board of Trustees or by an authorized officer of each trust, as   
appropriate.                                                                    

   Among the significant conditions which may not be waived are: (a) the receipt
by the Trust and the Acquiring Trust of an opinion of counsel as to certain     
Federal income tax aspects of the reorganization and (b) the approval of the    
reorganization agreement by the shareholders of the Merged Series. The Plan may 
be terminated and the reorganization abandoned at any time, before or after     
approval by the shareholders of the Merged Series, prior to the closing date, by
either party by resolution of its Board of Trustees. In addition, the           
reorganization agreement may be amended by mutual agreement, except that no     
amendment may be made to the reorganization agreement subsequent to the Special 
Meeting that would change the provisions for determining the number of Surviving
Series shares to be issued to shareholders of the Merged Series without their   
further approval.                                                               

REASONS FOR THE REORGANIZATION                                                  

  The proposed reorganization is the outcome of the deliberation by the Boards
of Trustees of the trusts. The advisors to each series recommended that the     
Trustees of each trust consider the benefits that shareholders would realize if 
the Merged Series were to be combined with the Surviving Series. In response to 
this recommendation, the independent trustees of each trust requested that      
management outline a specific reorganization proposal for their consideration   
and provide an analysis of the specific benefits to be realized by shareholders 
from the proposal.                                                              

In the course of their review, the Trustees of the Trust noted that the   
reorganization would be a means of combining two series with similar investment 
objectives and principal investment strategies and would permit the shareholders
of the Merged Series to pursue their investment goals in a larger fund. In      
reaching this conclusion, the Board considered a number of additional factors,  
including the following:                                                        

o  the reorganization could result in economies of scale through the      
spreading of fixed costs over a larger asset base;                  

o  the total expense ratio of the combined Surviving Series following the 
   reorganization is projected to be slightly lower than the current total
expense ratio of the Merged Series;                                 

   o  the reorganization provides for continuity of distribution and shareholder
servicing arrangements; and                                         

  o  the reorganization will not result in the recognition of any gain or loss
for Federal income tax purposes either to the Merged Series or the  
Surviving Series or to the shareholders of either of the series.    

After considering these and other factors, the Board of Trustees of the   
Trust, including the independent trustees, unanimously concluded at a meeting   
held on November 12, 2003 that the reorganization would be in the best interests
of the Merged Series and its shareholders and that the interests of existing    
Merged Series' shareholders will not be diluted as a result of the transactions 
contemplated by the reorganization. The Board of Trustees of the Trust then     
unanimously voted to approve the reorganization and authorized the officers of  
the Trust to submit the reorganization proposal to shareholders for             
consideration.                                                                  

At a meeting held on November 19, 2003, the Board of Trustees of the      
Acquiring Trust, including the independent trustees, also unanimously concluded 
that the reorganization would be in the best interests of the Surviving Series  
and its shareholders and that the interests of existing Surviving Series'       
shareholders will not be diluted as a result of the reorganization. In the      
course of their review, the Board of Trustees of the Acquiring Trust noted that 
the advisors to each series have elected to use the historical financial        
statements and performance record of the Surviving Series.

FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES 

General                                                                   
-------                                                                   

   The reorganization has been structured with the intention that it qualify for
Federal income tax purposes as a tax-free reorganization under Section 368(a) of
the Internal Revenue Code (the "Code"). This means that, in the opinion of      
counsel, no gain or loss will be recognized by a shareholder of the Merged      
Series for Federal income tax purposes as a result of the reorganization.       

As a condition to the closing of the reorganization, the Merged Series and
the Surviving Series will receive an opinion of Shearman & Sterling LLP,        
substantially to the effect that, among other things, for Federal income tax    
purposes, upon consummation of the reorganization (i) no gain or loss will be   
recognized by the Merged Series or the Surviving Series as a result of the      
reorganization, (ii) no gain or loss will be recognized by a shareholder of the 
Merged Series upon his or her receipt of shares of the Surviving Series in the  
reorganization solely in exchange for his or her shares of the Merged Series,   
(iii) the Merged Series and the Surviving Series will be a "party to a          
reorganization" under Section 368(b) of the Code, (iv) the holding period of the
assets of the Merged Series acquired by the Surviving Series will include the   
period during which such assets were held by the Merged Series, (v) the holding 
period for shares of the Surviving Series received by each shareholder of the   
Merged Series in exchange for his or her shares in the Merged Series will       
include the period during which such shareholder held shares of the Merged      
Series (provided the Merged Series shares were held as capital assets on the    
date of the exchange), and (vi) immediately after the reorganization, the tax   
basis of the shares of the Surviving Series received by shareholders of the     
Merged Series in the reorganization will be equal, in the aggregate, to the tax 
basis of the shares of the Merged Series surrendered in exchange therefore.     
Shearman & Sterling LLP's opinion will be based upon certain assumptions and    
representations made by the Merged Series and the Surviving Series.             

An opinion of counsel does not have the effect of a private letter ruling 
from the Internal Revenue Services ("IRS") and is not binding on the IRS or any 
court.                                                                          

   If the reorganization is consummated but fails to qualify as a reorganization
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, the reorganization would be   
treated as a taxable sale of assets followed by a taxable liquidation of the    
Merged Series, and Merged Series' shareholders would recognize a taxable gain or
loss equal to the difference between their basis in the Merged Series shares and
the fair market value of the shares in the Surviving Series received.           

 To the extent the Surviving Series has unrealized capital gains at the time
of the reorganization, the Merged Series' shareholders may incur taxable gains  
in the year that the Surviving Series realizes and distributes those gains. This
will be true notwithstanding that the unrealized gains were reflected in the    
price of the Surviving Series' shares at the time they were exchanged for assets
of the Merged Series in the reorganization. Conversely, shareholders of the     
Surviving Series would share in unrealized capital gains of the Merged Series   
after the reorganization and bear a tax consequence on the subsequent           
realization of such gains.                                                      

 To the extent that the Merged Series has loss carry-forwards at the time of
the reorganization, the Merged Series' shareholders may not be able to benefit  
from such loss carry-forwards after the reorganization.                         

Shareholders should consult their tax advisers regarding the effect of the
reorganization in light of their individual circumstances. As the foregoing     
relates only to Federal income tax consequences, shareholders also should       
consult their tax advisers as to the foreign, state, local and other tax        
consequences of the reorganization.                                             

Status as a Regulated Investment Company                                  
----------------------------------------                                  

 The Merged Series and the Surviving Series have elected and qualified to be
taxed as regulated investment companies under Section 851-855 of the Code, and  
after the reorganization, the Surviving Series intends to operate or continue to
operate so as to qualify as a regulated investment company. The Merged Series'  
existence as a separate Series of the Trust will be terminated as part of the   
reorganization.

   The following table sets forth the capitalization of the Surviving Series and
the Merged Series, and on a pro forma basis for the combined Surviving Series as
of August 31, 2003 giving effect to the proposed acquisition of net assets of   
the Merged Series at net asset value. The pro forma data reflects an exchange   
ratio of approximately 0.8385, 0.8460 and 0.8451 for Class A, Class B and Class 
C shares, respectively, of the Surviving Series issued for each Class A, Class B
and Class C share, respectively, of the Merged Series.

  All returns represent past performance which may not be indicative of future

increasing the value of your investment over the long term (capital             
appreciation) consistent with preserving capital and reducing portfolio exposure
to market risk. The investment objectives of the Surviving Series and the Merged
Series are "fundamental policies" which may not be changed without the approval 
of the holders of at least a "majority of the outstanding voting shares" of the 
series. A majority of the outstanding voting shares is defined in the 1940 Act  
as the lesser of (a) the vote of the holders of 67% or more of the outstanding  
voting shares of the series present in person or by proxy, if the holders of    
more than 50% of the outstanding voting shares are present in person or by      
proxy, or represented by proxy, or (b) the vote of the holder of more than 50%  
of the outstanding voting shares of the series.                                 

The principal investment strategies of the Surviving Series and the Merged
Series are similar. The Merged Series invests primarily in common stocks of     
companies with smaller capitalizations (generally less than $2 billion) with    
both value or growth characteristics. Under normal circumstances, the Surviving 
Series invests at least 80% of its assets in securities of issuers with         
capitalizations of less than $2 billion at the time of investment. Both the     
Merged Series and the Surviving Series invest primarily in equity securities    
issued by small-cap companies (those with a market capitalization of below $2   
billion). The Series differ, however, because the Merged Series invests in      
small-cap companies with growth and value characteristics, while the Surviving  
Series invests primarily in small-cap companies with value characteristics.     

The Surviving Series invests in a portfolio of common stocks of primarily 
domestic (U.S.) companies. Each series utilizes a similar security selection    
process that selects stocks meeting certain investment criteria relating to     
price, dividend yield, going concern value and debt levels. For the few hundred 
of the approximately 5,000 companies that survive this screening process, the   
advisor (or subadvisor with respect to the Surviving Series) projects growth in 
earnings and dividends, earnings momentum and, relative undervaluation based on 
dividend discount models. From this analysis, the advisor (or subadvisor with   
respect to the Surviving Series) develops target prices and value ranges and    
selects the top-rated securities for purchase.                                  

 Each series may, as a temporary defensive strategy, invest without limit in
U.S. Government securities and in money market instruments.                     

As the investment advisor for the Surviving Series, PIC is responsible for
managing the investment program and the general operations of the Surviving     
Series. PZA, as subadvisor to the Surviving Series, is responsible for the      
day-to-day management of the Surviving Series' portfolio. PZA, the investment   
advisor for the Merged Series, is responsible for managing the Merged Series'   
investment program and general operations, as well as the day-to-day management 
of the Merged Series' portfolio.                                                

CERTAIN INVESTMENT RESTRICTIONS                                                 

The Surviving Series and the Merged Series are subject to identical       
investment restrictions that restrict the scope of their investments. These     
investment restrictions are "fundamental policies".                             

These investment restrictions are:                                        

(1)  A series may not, with respect to 75% of its total assets, purchase        
securities of an issuer (other than the U.S. Government, its agencies,
     instrumentalities or authorities or repurchase agreements collateralized by
  U.S. Government securities and other investment companies), if: (a) such
purchase would, at the time, cause more than 5% of the series' total  
 assets, taken at market value, to be invested in the securities of such
     issuer; or (b) such purchase would, at the time, result in more than 10% of
    the outstanding voting securities of such issuer being held by the series.

17

P-->N-14/A25th�Page�of�68TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�25th
(2)  A series may not purchase securities if, after giving effect to the        
purchase, more than 25% of its total assets would be invested in the  
securities of one or more issuers conducting their principal business 
activities in the same industry (excluding the U.S. Government, its   
agencies or instrumentalities).                                       

(3)  A series may not borrow money, except (i) in amounts not to exceed one     
third of the value of the series' total assets (including the amount  
   borrowed) from banks, and (ii) up to an additional 5% of its total assets
  from banks or other lenders for temporary purposes. For purposes of this
restriction, (a) investment techniques such as margin purchases, short
sales, forward commitments, and roll transactions, (b) investments in 
instruments such as futures contracts, swaps, and options, and (c)    
short-term credits extended in connection with trade clearances and   
settlement, shall not constitute borrowing.                           

(4)  A series may not issue senior securities in contravention of the 1940 Act. 
     Activities permitted by SEC exemptive orders or staff interpretations shall
not be deemed prohibited by this restriction.                         

(5)  A series may not underwrite the securities issued by other persons, except 
to the extent that, in connection with the disposition of portfolio   
  securities, a series may be deemed to be an underwriter under applicable
law.                                                                  

(6)  A series may not purchase or sell real estate, except that a series may (i)
     acquire or lease office space for its own use, (ii) invest in securities of
  issuers that invest in real estate or interests therein, (iii) invest in
   mortgage-related securities and other securities that are secured by real
     estate or interests therein, (iv) hold and sell real estate acquired by the
series as a result of the ownership of securities.                    

(7)  A series may not purchase or sell commodities or commodity contracts,      
except a series may purchase and sell derivatives (including, but not 
  limited to, options, futures contracts and options on futures contracts)
whose value is tied to the value of a financial index or a financial  
instrument or other asset (including, but not limited to, securities  
    indices, interest rates, securities, currencies and physical commodities).

(8)  A series may not make loans, except that a series may (i) lend portfolio   
    securities, (ii) enter into repurchase agreements, (iii) purchase all or a
    portion of an issue of debt securities, bank loan participation interests,
 bank certificates of deposit, bankers' acceptances, debentures or other
    securities, whether or not the purchase is made upon the original issuance
 of the securities, and (iv) participate in an interfund lending program
with other registered investment companies.                           

   If any percentage restriction described above for the series is adhered to at
the time of investment, a subsequent increase or decrease in the percentage     
resulting from a change in the value of the series' assets will not constitute a
violation of the restriction.                                                   

COMPARATIVE INFORMATION ON DISTRIBUTION ARRANGEMENTS
MULTIPLE CLASS STRUCTURE                                                        

  Each series currently offers three classes of shares: Class A, Class B and
Class C shares.                                                                 

 In the proposed reorganization, you will receive the corresponding class of
shares of the Surviving Series in exchange for your shares in the Merged Series.
The reorganization will be effected at net asset value. No sales charge will be 
imposed on your shares. For purposes of calculating the contingent deferred     
sales charge that you may pay when you dispose of any Class B or Class C shares 
acquired as a result of the reorganization, the length of time you hold shares  
in the Surviving Series will be added to the length of time you held shares in  
the Merged Series. If you acquire Class B or Class C shares as a result of the  
reorganization, you will continue to be subject to a contingent deferred sales  
charge upon subsequent redemption to the same extent as if you had continued to 
hold your shares of the Merged Series.                                          

The shares of the various classes are offered under the following       
arrangements:

  o  Have the same distribution and service fees (1.00%) as Class B shares and

DISTRIBUTION PLANS                                                              

   Phoenix Equity Planning Corporation serves as the distributor ("Distributor")
of shares for both the Surviving Series and the Merged Series. The Acquiring    
Trust has adopted a distribution plan for each class of shares of the Acquiring 
Trust under Rule 12b-1 under the 1940 Act relating to the sale and promotion of 
the Surviving Series' shares.                                                   

Under the Acquiring Trust's distribution plan, the Surviving Series       
compensates the Distributor 0.75% of the average daily value of the net assets  
of Class B and Class C shares. In addition, the Distributor is paid 0.25%       
annually of the average daily net assets of each class of shares (including     
Class A) for providing services to the shareholders, including assistance in    
connection with inquiries related to shareholder accounts.                      

The Trust has also adopted distribution plans pursuant to Rule 12b-1 on   
behalf of the Class A, Class B and Class C shares of the Merged Series          
(collectively, the "Trust Plans"). Under the Trust Plans, each class of shares  
of the Merged Series pays a distribution fee based on average daily net assets  
at the following rate: for Class A Shares at a rate of 0.05% per annum; for     
Class B Shares at a rate of 0.75% per annum; and for Class C Shares at a rate of
0.75% per annum. In addition, the Merged Series pays the Distributor 0.25%      
annually of the average daily net assets of each class of shares (including     
Class A) of the Merged Series as compensation for providing services to the     
shareholders, including assistance in connection with inquiries related to      
shareholder accounts.                                                           

 COMPARATIVE INFORMATION ON SHAREHOLDER SERVICES

Both the Merged Series and the Surviving Series offer the same shareholder
services including a Systematic Withdrawal Program, telephone exchanges,        
telephone redemptions, access to an Investo-Matic Program and an automatic      
investment program. The Surviving Series distributes net investment income      
semi-annually and distributes net realized capital gains, if any, at least      
annually. The Merged Series distributes net investment income                   

19

P-->N-14/A27th�Page�of�68TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�27th
annually and distributes net realized capital gains, if any, at least annually. 
All dividends and distributions with respect to the shares of the Merged Series 
and the Surviving Series are paid in additional shares of the respective series 
unless shareholders elect to receive cash. The number of shares received in     
connection with any reinvestment of dividends will be based upon the net asset  
value per share of the Merged Series and the Surviving Series in effect on the  
record date.                                                                    

The Surviving Series and the Merged Series currently offer shareholders   
identical exchange privileges. Shareholders of the Merged Series and the        
Surviving Series may exchange their shares for shares of a corresponding class  
of shares of other affiliated Phoenix funds.                                    

Shares of the Surviving Series and the Merged Series may be redeemed at a 
redemption price equal to the net asset value of the shares as next determined  
following the receipt of a redemption order and any other required documentation
in proper form. In the case of redemptions of Class B or Class C shares of both 
series, investors will be subject to the applicable contingent deferred sales   
charges, if any, for such shares. Payment of redemption proceeds for redeemed   
Surviving Series and Merged Series shares are generally made within seven days  
after receipt of a redemption request in proper form and documentation, provided
that each check used for purchases of shares has been cleared for payment.      

Because both the Surviving Series and the Merged Series offer the same    
shareholder services, after the closing the same services will continue to be   
available to the shareholders of the Merged Series but in their capacity as     
shareholders of the Surviving Series.                                           

 COMPARATIVE INFORMATION ON SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS

   The following is a summary of certain provisions of the Declarations of Trust
of each of the Trust and the Acquiring Trust.                                   

FORM OF ORGANIZATION                                                            

The Acquiring Trust and the Trust are Delaware Statutory Trusts. The      
operations of these trusts are governed by their respective Declarations of     
Trust and by Delaware law. Each trust is registered with the SEC as an open-end 
management investment company and is subject to the provisions of the 1940 Act  
and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder. The Trustees of each trust 
may generally authorize mergers, consolidations, share exchanges and            
reorganizations of a new series or of each respective series with another series
or other business organization.                                                 

SHARES                                                                          

 The Declaration of Trust of each trust authorizes the Trustees to create an
unlimited number of series. The Trust has three series; the Acquiring Trust     
currently has two series. Each trust may also organize other series in the      
future. When issued, the shares are fully paid and non-assessable, have no      
preference, preemptive or similar rights unless designated by the Trustees, and 
are freely transferable. The assets and proceeds received by each trust from the
issue or sale of shares of a series or class are allocated to that series and   
constitute the rights of that series, subject only to the rights of creditors.  
Any underlying assets of a series or class are required to be segregated on the 
books of account of each trust. These assets are to be used to pay the expenses 
of the series or class as well as a share of the general expenses of each trust.

MEETINGS                                                                        

The Trustees or President of each trust may call shareholder meetings as  
necessary. To the extent required by the 1940 Act, meetings held for the purpose
of voting on the removal of any trustee shall be called by trustees upon written
request by shareholders holding at least ten percent of the outstanding shares  
entitled to vote. Generally, one-third of the shares entitled to vote           
constitutes a quorum at a shareholder meeting.                                  

20

SHAREHOLDER LIABILITY                                                           

Unlike the stockholders of a corporation, under certain circumstances     
shareholders of a statutory trust may be held personally liable for the debts,  
claims or other obligations of a statutory trust. However, each Declaration of  
Trust limits shareholder liability. Each Declaration of Trust provides that     
shareholders shall not be subject to any personal liability for the acts or     
obligations of the Trust. Each Declaration of Trust provides for indemnification
for any shareholder and any former shareholder who is exposed to liability by   
reason of a claim or demand relating to such person being a shareholder. Thus,  
the risk of a shareholder incurring financial loss on account of shareholder    
liability, which is considered remote, is limited to circumstances in which the 
Trust itself would be unable to meet its obligations.                           

LIABILITY OF TRUSTEES                                                           

   Each Declaration of Trust provides that trustees will generally be personally
liable only for willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless    
disregard of duties. Each trust may purchase insurance for trustees to cover    
potential liabilities and will generally indemnify a trustee against such       
claims. Each trust may also advance payments to a trustee in connection with    
indemnification.                                                                

LIQUIDATION OR DISSOLUTION                                                      

   In the event of the liquidation or dissolution of either series, the trustees
shall distribute the assets of the series to the shareholders, according to     
their respective rights, after accounting for the liabilities of the respective 
series.                                                                         

 FISCAL YEAR

     Proxies executed by shareholders may be revoked at any time before they are
exercised by a written revocation received by the Secretary of the Trust, by    
properly executing a later-dated proxy (in writing, or by telephone or Internet)
or by attending the meeting and voting in person.                               

    We encourage you to vote by Internet or telephone; have your proxy card in
hand, and call the number or go to the website and follow the instructions      
there. These voting methods will reduce the time and cost associated with this  
proxy solicitation.                                                             

    THE ACQUIRING TRUST WILL FURNISH, WITHOUT CHARGE, TO ANY SHAREHOLDER, UPON
REQUEST, A COPY OF THE 2003 ANNUAL REPORT AND THE 2003 SEMI-ANNUAL REPORT. SUCH 
REQUESTS MAY BE DIRECTED TO PHOENIX EQUITY PLANNING CORPORATION, 56 PROSPECT    
STREET, P. O. BOX 150480, HARTFORD, CONNECTICUT 06115. SHAREHOLDERS MAY ALSO    
CALL PHOENIX EQUITY PLANNING CORPORATION TOLL-FREE AT (800) 243-4361.           

The Board of Trustees of the Trust knows of no business, other than that  
mentioned in the Notice of Special Meeting, that will be presented for          
consideration at the Special Meeting. If any other matter is properly presented,
it is the intention of the persons named on the enclosed proxy cards to vote in 
accordance with their best judgment.                                            

Shareholders are entitled to one vote for each dollar of net asset value  
(determined as of the Record Date) of each share owned by such shareholder      
(number of shares owned times net asset value per share) and each fractional    
dollar amount shall be entitled to a proportionate fractional vote. Shareholders
of the Merged Series will vote together as a single class on the reorganization 
proposal. One third (33-1/3%) of the shares entitled to vote shall constitute a 
quorum for the meeting. The affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding   
voting securities of the Trust (i.e., the lesser of (i) 67% or more of the      
eligible votes of the Merged Series represented at the meeting if more than 50% 
of the eligible votes of the Merged Series are present in person or by proxy or 
(ii) more than 50% of the eligible votes of the Merged Series) must approve the 
herein contemplated merger. For purposes of determining the presence of a quorum
for transacting business at the meeting and for determining whether sufficient  
votes have been received for approval of the proposal to be acted upon at the   
meeting, abstentions and broker "non-votes" (that is, proxies from brokers or   
nominees indicating that such persons have not received instructions from the   
beneficial owner or other persons entitled to vote shares on a particular matter
with respect to which the brokers or nominees do not have discretionary power)  
will be treated as shares that are present at the meeting, but which have not   
been                                                                            

22

voted. For this reason, abstentions and broker non-votes will assist the Merged 
Series in obtaining a quorum, but both have the practical effect of a "no" vote 
for purposes of obtaining the requisite vote for approval of the proposal.      

If either (a) a quorum is not present at the meeting or (b) a quorum is   
present but sufficient votes in favor of the reorganization proposal have not   
been obtained, then the persons named as proxies may propose one or more        
adjournments of the Special Meeting without further notice to shareholders to   
permit further solicitation of proxies provided such persons determine, after   
consideration of all relevant factors, including the nature of the proposal, the
percentage of votes then cast, the percentage of negative votes then cast, the  
nature of the proposed solicitation activities and the nature of the reasons for
such further solicitation, that an adjournment and additional solicitation is   
reasonable and in the interests of shareholders. The persons named as proxies   
will vote those proxies that such persons are required to vote FOR the          
reorganization proposal in favor of such an adjournment and will vote those     
proxies required to be voted AGAINST the reorganization proposal against such   
adjournment.                                                                    

The Special Meeting may be adjourned from time to time by the vote of a   
majority of the shares represented at the Special Meeting, whether or not a     
quorum is present. If the Special Meeting is adjourned to another time or place,
notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting at which the adjournment is   
taken, unless a new record date of the adjourned meeting is fixed or unless the 
adjournment is for more than sixty (60) days from the date set for the original 
meeting, in which case the Trustees shall set a new record date. Notice of any  
such adjourned meeting shall be given to each shareholder of record entitled to 
vote at the adjourned meeting in accordance with the provisions of the By-Laws  
of the Trust. At any adjourned meeting, the Trust may transact any business     
which might have been transacted at the original meeting.                       

The individuals named as proxies on the enclosed proxy card will vote in  
accordance with the shareholder's direction, as indicated thereon, if the proxy 
card is received and is properly executed. If the shareholder properly executes 
a proxy and gives no voting instructions with respect to the reorganization     
proposal, the shares will be voted in favor of the reorganization proposal. The 
proxies, in their discretion, may vote upon such other matters as may properly  
come before the meeting. The Board of Trustees of the Trust is not aware of any 
other matters to come before the meeting.                                       

Approval of the reorganization proposal by the shareholders of the Merged 
Series is a condition of the consummation of the reorganization. If the         
reorganization is not approved, the Merged Series will continue as a series of  
the Trust and the Board of Trustees of the Trust may consider other alternatives
in the best interests of the shareholders of the Merged Series.                 

REVOCATION OF PROXIES                                                           

Any shareholder who has given a proxy has the right to revoke the proxy at
any time prior to its exercise:                                                 

  o  by written notice of the proxy's revocation to the Secretary of the Trust
at the above address prior to the meeting;                          

  o  by the subsequent execution and return of another proxy card prior to the
meeting;                                                            

   o  by use of any electronic, telephonic or other alternative means authorized
by the Trustees for authorizing the proxy to act; or                

o  by being present and voting in person at the meeting and giving oral   
notice of revocation to the Chairman of the meeting.                

NO APPRAISAL RIGHTS                                                             

The staff of the SEC has taken the position that any rights to appraisal  
arising under state law are preempted by the provisions of the 1940 Act and Rule
22c-1 thereunder, which generally requires that shares of a registered open-end 
investment company be valued at their next determined net asset value.

SOLICITATION OF PROXIES                                                         

In addition to solicitation of proxies by mail, officers and employees of 
Phoenix Investment Partners, Ltd., or its affiliates, may solicit proxies       
personally or by telephone or telegram. Phoenix Investment Partners, Ltd., or   
other representatives of the Trust, may also use one or more proxy solicitation 
firms to assist with the mailing and tabulation effort and any special personal 
solicitation of proxies. Banks, brokers, fiduciaries and nominees will, upon    
request, be reimbursed by Phoenix Investment Partners, Ltd. for their reasonable
expenses in sending proxy material to beneficial owners of shares of the Merged 
Series. D.F. King & Co., Inc., a proxy solicitation firm, has been engaged to   
act as solicitor and will receive fees estimated at $12,500, plus out-of-pocket 
expenses. The agreement with D.F. King provides that D.F. King will perform     
various proxy solicitation services in connection with the Special Meeting, such
as contacting shareholders and providing information with respect to matters to 
be considered at the Special Meeting. The cost of the solicitation of proxies   
will be borne by Phoenix Investment Partners, Ltd.                              

 If a shareholder wishes to participate in the meeting, but does not wish to
authorize the execution of a proxy by telephone, the shareholder may still      
submit the proxy card included with this proxy statement or attend the meeting  
in person.                                                                      

OWNERSHIP OF VOTING SECURITIES                                            

Based on holdings and total shares outstanding as of January 13, 2004, the
Trustees and officers of the Trust owned as a group less than 1% of the         
outstanding voting securities of the Merged Series. If the reorganization were  
consummated as of January 13, 2004, the Trustees and officers of the Trust would
own less than 1% of the outstanding voting securities of the combined Surviving 
Series based on their holdings and total shares outstanding as of January 13,
2004.                                                                           

No one person who owns beneficially or of record 5% or more of the        
outstanding shares of the Merged Series, Surviving Series, or the combined      
Surviving Series assuming consummation of the reorganization, based on holdings 
and total shares outstanding as of January 13, 2004.                            

   THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF THE TRUST, INCLUDING THE INDEPENDENT TRUSTEES OF THE
TRUST, RECOMMENDS YOU APPROVE THE PLAN OF REORGANIZATION.                       
  WHETHER OR NOT YOU PLAN TO ATTEND THE MEETING, PLEASE FILL IN, DATE AND SIGN
THE ENCLOSED PROXY AND RETURN IT PROMPTLY IN THE ENCLOSED ENVELOPE. NO POSTAGE  
IS NECESSARY IF IT IS MAILED IN THE UNITED STATES. IN THE ALTERNATIVE, WE       
ENCOURAGE YOU TO VOTE USING THE TELEPHONE OR INTERNET.

   This growth of $10,000 chart assumes an initial investment of $10,000 made on
11/20/97 (inception of the Fund). Performance assumes dividends and capital     
gains are reinvested. The performance of other share classes will be greater or 
less than that shown based on differences in inception dates, fees and sales    
charges.                                                                        

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION OF SURVIVING SERIES PERFORMANCE                           

  The Phoenix Small Cap Value Fund is designed for long-term investors seeking
capital appreciation. Investors should note that the risks of investing in      
small-company stocks may include relatively low trading volumes, a greater      
degree of change in earnings, and greater short-term violability.               

   Reversing their preceding annual performances, all of the major stock indexes
recorded a strong year for the 12 months ended August 31, 2003. The Surviving   
Series also rebounded in this market environment. For the fiscal year ended     
August 31, 2003, Class A shares rose 18.76%, Class B shares rose 17.88%, and    
Class C shares were also up 17.88%. For the same period, the Russell 2000       
Index(1) rose 29.08%, and the Russell 2000 Value Index(2) was up 23.68%. The    
broad-based S&P 500 Index(3) rose 12.09%. All performance figures assume        
reinvestment of distributions and exclude the effect of sales charges. Past     
performance is not a guarantee of future performance.                           

During the year under review, technology and more recently telecom sectors
helped the Surviving Series' performance. The Surviving Series' underweight     
position in consumer durables and healthcare also added to performance. However,
being overweight in energy and energy service strategies had a negative effect  
on the Surviving Series' performance.                                           

Stocks that hurt the Surviving Series' performance during this period     
included Boston Communications Group (effected by the loss of the Verizon       
contract) and Valassis Communications (effected by the loss of a large coupon   
contract). Helping the Surviving Series' performance were WMS Industries        
(gambling machine software) and Mastec (trench digger for buried cable and fiber
optics).

   Russell 2000 companies with lower price-to-book ratios and lower forecasted
growth values. The index is not available for direct investment.

The roadmap for the next five to ten years will be similar to what was    
experienced between 1975-1982 and we feel that the two-year tailwind of         
ever-lower interest rates is over. Investment approaches that rely on index     
fund, mega cap stocks, and buy-and-hold-strategies will have difficulty         
outperforming. Contrarian ideas, short-term (12-18 months) rentals, and smaller 
size companies look appealing. We remain cautiously optimistic.

 As a Delaware Statutory Trust, the Trust does not hold shareholder meetings
unless required by the 1940 Act. Other than this meeting, the Trust does not    
anticipate holding any future meetings of shareholders in that should           
shareholder approval of the reorganization described herein and of the          
reorganizations of the Trust's other series be obtained, the Trust will be      
dissolved.                                                                      

OTHER BUSINESS

  The Board of Trustees of the Trust knows of no business to be brought before
the meeting other than the matters set forth in this Prospectus/Proxy Statement.
Should any other matter requiring a vote of Merged Series' shareholders arise,  
however, the proxies will vote thereon according to their best judgment in the  
interests of the Merged Series and the shareholders of the Merged Series.       

                          By Order of the Board of Trustees,

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION
------------------------------------

        THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION (the "Agreement") is made as
of this 19th day of March, 2004, by and between Phoenix Investment Trust 97     
(the "Investment Trust 97"), a Delaware Statutory Trust with its principal place
of business at 101 Munson Street, Greenfield, Massachusetts 01301, on behalf of 
the Phoenix Small Cap Value f/k/a Phoenix-Hollister Small Cap Value Fund (the   
"Surviving Series"), a portfolio series thereof, and the Phoenix Trust (formerly
known as the Phoenix-Zweig Trust) (the "Phoenix Trust"), a Delaware Statutory   
Trust with a principal place of business at 900 Third Avenue, 31st Floor, New
York, New York 10022, on behalf of the Phoenix Appreciation Fund f/k/a          
Phoenix-Hollister Appreciation Fund (the "Merging Series"), a portfolio series  
thereof. For the purposes hereof, all references in this Agreement to action    
taken by the Surviving Series or the Merging Series shall be deemed to refer to 
action taken by the Investment Trust 97 or the Phoenix Trust, on behalf of the  
respective portfolio series and all references to the "Trust(s)" shall          
collectively refer to the Investment Trust 97 and the Phoenix Trust.            

RECITALS

This Agreement is intended to be and is adopted as a plan of  
reorganization and liquidation within the meaning of Section 368(a)(1) of the   
United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") and the    
regulations thereunder. The reorganization (the "Reorganization") will consist  
of the transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the Merging Series 
to the Surviving Series in exchange solely for corresponding Class A, Class B   
and Class C shares of beneficial interest in the Surviving Series (the          
"Surviving Series Shares"), the assumption by the Surviving Series of all       
liabilities of the Merging Series, and the distribution of the Surviving Series 
Shares to the shareholders of the Merging Series in complete liquidation of the 
Merging Series as provided herein, all upon the terms and conditions hereinafter
set forth in this Agreement.                                                    

    The Merging Series and the Surviving Series are separate series of
Phoenix Trust and Investment Trust 97, respectively, which are open-end,        
registered investment companies of the management type. The Merging Series owns 
securities that generally are assets of the character in which the Surviving    
Series is permitted to invest. The Trustees of the Investment Trust 97,         
including a majority of the trustees thereof who are not interested persons, as 
such term is defined pursuant to the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended 
(the "1940 Act") have determined that participation in the Reorganization is in 
the best interests of the Surviving Series and its shareholders and that the    
interests of the existing shareholders of the Surviving Series would not be     
diluted as a result of effecting this transaction.                              

         The Trustees of the Phoenix Trust, including a majority of the trustees
thereof who are not interested persons, as such term is defined pursuant to the 
1940 Act, have also determined that participation in the Reorganization is in   
the best interests of the Merging Series and its shareholders and that the      
interests of the existing shareholders of the Merging Series would not be

    1.1 Subject to the requisite approval of the Merging Series shareholders
and the other terms and conditions herein set forth and on the basis of the     
representations and warranties contained herein, the Merging Series agrees to   
transfer all of the Merging Series' assets, as set forth in paragraph 1.2, to   
the Surviving Series, and the Surviving Series agrees in exchange therefor: (i) 
to deliver to the Merging Series the number of full and fractional Surviving    
Series Shares, determined by dividing the value of the Merging Series' net      
assets, computed in the manner and as of the time and date set forth in         
paragraph 2.1, by the net asset value of one Surviving Series Share, computed in
the manner and as of the time and date set forth in paragraph 2.2; and (ii) to  
assume all liabilities of the Merging Series, as set forth in paragraph 1.3.    
Such transactions shall take place on the next business day following the       
closing provided for in paragraph 3.1 (the "Closing Date").                     

1.2 The assets of the Merging Series to be acquired by the Surviving
Series shall consist of all assets and property, including, without limitation, 
all cash, securities, commodities and futures interests, and dividends or       
interest receivable, that are owned by the Merging Series, and any deferred or  
prepaid expenses shown as an asset on the books of the Merging Series on the    
Closing Date (collectively, the "Assets").                                      

1.3 The Merging Series will endeavor to discharge all of its known  
liabilities and obligations prior to the Closing Date. The Surviving Series     
shall also assume all of the liabilities of the Merging Series, whether accrued 
or contingent, known or unknown, existing at the Valuation Date, as defined in  
paragraph 2.1 (collectively, the "Liabilities"). On or as soon as practicable   
prior to the Closing Date, the Merging Series will declare and pay to its       
shareholders of record one or more dividends and/or other distributions so that 
it will have distributed substantially all (and in no event less than 98%) of   
its investment company taxable income and realized net capital gain, if any, for
the current taxable year through the Closing Date.                              

  1.4 Immediately after the transfer of Assets provided for in paragraph
1.1, the Merging Series will distribute to the Merging Series' shareholders of  
record, determined as of immediately after the close of business on the Closing 
Date (the "Merging Series Shareholders"), on a pro rata basis, the Surviving    
Series Shares received by the Merging Series pursuant to paragraph 1.1, and will
completely liquidate. Such distribution and liquidation will be accomplished,   
with respect to the Merging Series' shares, by the transfer of the Surviving    
Series Shares then credited to the account of the Merging Series on the books of
the Surviving Series to open accounts on the share records of the Surviving     
Series in the names of the Merging Series Shareholders. The aggregate net asset 
value of Surviving Series Shares to be so credited to Merging Series            
Shareholders shall be equal to the aggregate net asset value of the Merging     
Series' shares owned by such shareholders on the Closing Date. All issued and   
outstanding shares of the Merging Series will simultaneously be canceled on the 
books of the Merging Series.                                                    

      1.5 Ownership of Surviving Series Shares will be shown on the books of the
Surviving Series or its transfer agent, as defined in paragraph 3.3.            

     1.6 Any reporting responsibility of the Merging Series including, but not
limited to, the responsibility for filing of regulatory reports, tax returns, or
other documents with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the           
"Commission"), any state securities commission, and any federal, state or local 
tax authorities or any other relevant regulatory authority, is and shall remain 
the responsibility of the Merging Series.

     2.1 The value of the Assets shall be the value computed as of immediately
after the close of business of the New York Stock Exchange and after the        
declaration of any dividends on the Closing Date (such time and date being      
hereinafter called the "Valuation Date"), using the valuation procedures

described in the Surviving Series' then-current prospectus and statement of     
additional information.                                                         

2.3 The number of Surviving Series Shares to be issued (including   
fractional shares, if any) in exchange for the Assets shall be determined by    
dividing the value of the net assets with respect to the shares of the Merging  
Series determined using the same valuation procedures referred to in paragraph  
2.1, by the net asset value of a Surviving Series Share, determined in

the Merging Series (the "Custodian"), to deliver, on the next business day after
the Closing, a certificate of an authorized officer stating that (i) the Assets 
have been delivered in proper form to the Surviving Series, and (ii) all

such Surviving Series Shares have been credited to the Merging Series' account  
on the books of the Surviving Series. At the Closing, each party shall deliver  
to the other such bills of sale, checks, assignments, share certificates, if

reasonably request.                                                             

3.4 In the event that on the Valuation Date (a) the New York Stock  
Exchange or another primary trading market for portfolio securities of the      
Surviving Series or the Merging Series shall be closed to trading or trading    
thereupon shall be restricted, or (b) trading or the reporting of trading on    
such Exchange or elsewhere shall be disrupted so that, in the judgment of the   
Board of Trustees of the Trusts, accurate appraisal of the value of the net     
assets of the Surviving Series or the Merging Series, respectively, is          
impracticable, the Closing Date shall be postponed until the first Friday after 
the day when trading shall have been fully resumed and reporting shall have been

         (d) The current prospectus and statement of additional information of
the Merging Series conforms or conformed at the time of its use in all material 
respects to the applicable requirements of the 1933 Act and the 1940 Act and the

not materially misleading;                                                      

        (e) On the Closing Date, the Phoenix Trust, on behalf of the Merging

Trust, on behalf of the Merging Series, is a party or by which it is bound, or  
(ii) the acceleration of any obligation, or the imposition of any penalty, under

         (g) All material contracts or other commitments of the Merging Series
(other than this Agreement and certain investment contracts, including options,

Series on or prior to the Closing Date;                                         

       (h) Except as otherwise disclosed in writing to and accepted by the
Investment Trust 97, on behalf of the Surviving Series, no litigation or        
administrative proceeding or investigation of or before any court or            
governmental body is presently pending or, to its knowledge, threatened against 
the Phoenix Trust, on behalf of the Merging Series, or any of its properties or 
assets that, if adversely determined, would materially and adversely affect its 
financial condition or the conduct of its business. The Phoenix Trust, on behalf
of the Merging Series, knows of no facts or circumstances, which, individually  
or in the aggregate, with the passage of time or the giving of notice (or both) 
would form the basis for the institution of such proceedings, and is not a party
to or subject to the provisions of any order, decree or judgment of any court or
governmental body which materially and adversely affects its business or its    
ability to consummate the transactions herein contemplated or that does or could

coverage;                                                                       

         (i) The Statement of Assets and Liabilities, Statements of Operations
and Changes in Net Assets, and Schedule of Investments of the Merging Series at 
December 31, 2002, have been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLP ("PwC"),    
independent accountants, and are in accordance with generally accepted          
accounting principles ("GAAP") consistently applied, and such statements present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial condition of the Merging Series 
as of such date in accordance with GAAP, and there are no known contingent      
liabilities of the Merging Series required to be reflected on a balance sheet   
(including the notes thereto) in accordance with GAAP as of such date not       
disclosed therein;                                                              

        (j) Since December 31, 2002, there has not been any material adverse
change in the Merging Series' financial condition, assets, liabilities or       
business, other than changes occurring in the ordinary course of business, or   
any incurrence by the Merging Series of indebtedness maturing more than one year
from the date such indebtedness was incurred, except as otherwise disclosed to  
and accepted by the Surviving Series. For the purposes of this subparagraph (j),
a decline in net asset value per share of the Merging Series due to declines in 
market values of securities in the Merging Series' portfolio, the discharge the 
Liabilities, or the redemption of Merging Series' shares by shareholders of the 
Merging Series shall not constitute a material adverse change;                  

        (k) On the Closing Date, all Federal and other tax returns, dividend
reporting forms and other tax-related reports of the Merging Series required by 
law to have been filed by such date (including any extensions) shall have been  
filed and are or will be correct in all material respects, and all Federal and  
other taxes shown as due or required to be shown as due on said returns and     
reports shall have been paid or provision shall have been made for the payment  
thereof, and to the best of the Merging Series' knowledge, no such return is    
currently under audit and no assessment has been asserted with respect to such  
returns;                                                                        

          (l) For each taxable year of its operation (including the taxable year
ending on the Closing Date), the Merging Series has met (or will meet) the      
requirements of Subchapter M of the Code for qualification as a regulated       
investment company, has been (or will be) eligible to compute and has computed  
(or will compute) its federal income tax under Section 852 of the Code, and will
have distributed all of its investment company taxable income and net capital   
gain (as defined in the Code) that has accrued through the Closing Date, and    
before the Closing Date will have declared dividends sufficient                 

 A-5

to distribute all of its investment company taxable income and net capital gain 
for the period ending on the Closing Date;                                      

        (m) All issued and outstanding shares of the Merging Series are, and
on the Closing Date will be, duly and validly issued and outstanding, will be   
fully paid and non-assessable and have been offered and sold in every state and 
the District of Columbia in compliance in all material respects with applicable 
registration requirements of the 1933 Act and state securities laws. All of the 
issued and outstanding shares of the Merging Series will, at the time of        
Closing, be held by the persons and in the amounts set forth in the records of  
the Transfer Agent, on behalf of the Merging Series, as provided in paragraph   
3.3. Except for (x) the right of Class B shares of the Merged Series to         
automatically convert into Class A shares of the Merged Series seven years after
purchase, or (y) in connection with any automatic dividend reinvestment plan    
available to the Merged Series' shareholders, The Merging Series does not have  
outstanding any options, warrants or other rights to subscribe for or to        
purchase any of the shares of the Merging Series, nor is there outstanding any  
security convertible into any of the Merging Series shares;                     

      (n) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement will
have been duly authorized prior to the Closing Date by all necessary action, if 
any, on the part of the Trustees of the Phoenix Trust, on behalf of the Merging 
Series, and, subject to the approval of the shareholders of the Merging Series, 
this Agreement will constitute a valid and binding obligation of the Merging    
Series, enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject, as to enforcement, to
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other laws relating to or
affecting creditors' rights and to general equity principles;                   

        (o) The information to be furnished by the Merging Series for use in
registration statements, proxy materials and other documents filed or to be     
filed with any federal, state or local regulatory authority (including the      
NASD), which may be necessary in connection with the transactions contemplated  
hereby, shall be accurate and complete in all material respects and shall comply
in all material respects with Federal securities and other laws and regulations 
thereunder applicable thereto;                                                  

         (p) The proxy statement of the Merging Series (the "Proxy Statement")
to be included in the Registration Statement referred to in paragraph 5.6,      
insofar as it relates to the Merging Series, will, on the effective date of the 
Registration Statement and on the Closing Date (i) not contain any untrue       
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be    
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the     
circumstances under which such statements were made, not materially misleading  
provided, however, that the representations and warranties in this subparagraph 
(p) shall not apply to statements in or omissions from the Proxy Statement and  
the Registration Statement made in reliance upon and in conformity with         
information that was furnished by the Surviving Series for use therein, and (ii)
comply in all material respects with the provisions of the 1933 Act, the 1934   
Act and the 1940 Act and the rules and regulations thereunder; and              

  (q) Any person who acts as legal counsel for the disinterested
directors of the Phoenix Trust is an independent legal counsel as such term is  
defined under applicable law.                                                   

      4.2 The Investment Trust 97, on behalf of the Surviving Series, represents

assets, free of any liens of other encumbrances, except those liens or          
encumbrances as to which the Merging Series has received notice and necessary   
documentation at or prior to the Closing;                                       

         (f) The Surviving Series is not engaged currently, and the execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement will not result, in (i) a material   
violation of the Investment Trust 97's Declaration of Trust or By-Laws or of any
agreement, indenture, instrument, contract, lease or other undertaking to which 
the Investment Trust 97, on behalf of the Surviving Series, is a party or by    
which it is bound, or (ii) the acceleration of any obligation, or the imposition
of any penalty, under any agreement, indenture, instrument, contract, lease,    
judgment or decree to which the Investment Trust 97, on behalf of the Surviving 
Series, is a party or by which it is bound;                                     

       (g) Except as otherwise disclosed in writing to and accepted by the
Phoenix Trust, on behalf of the Merging Series, no litigation or administrative 
proceeding or investigation of or before any court or governmental body is      
presently pending or, to its knowledge, threatened against the Investment Trust 
97, on behalf of the Surviving Series, or any of the Surviving Series'          
properties or assets that, if adversely determined, would materially and        
adversely affect the Surviving Series' financial condition or the conduct of the
Surviving Series' business. The Investment Trust 97, on behalf of the Surviving 
Series, knows of no facts or circumstances which, individually or in the        
aggregate, with the passage of time or the giving of notice (or both) might form
the basis for the institution of such proceedings and is not a party to or      
subject to the provisions of any order, decree or judgment of any court or      
governmental body which materially and adversely affects the Surviving Series'  
business or the Surviving Series' ability to consummate the transactions herein 
contemplated or that does or could lead to a claim under existing directors and 
officers errors and omissions coverage;                                         

         (h) The Statement of Assets and Liabilities, Statements of Operations
and Changes in Net Assets and Schedule of Investments of the Surviving Series at
August 31, 2003, have been audited by PwC, independent accountants, and are in  
accordance with GAAP consistently applied, and such statements (copies of which 
have been furnished to the Merging Series) present fairly, in all material      
respects, the financial condition of the Surviving Series as of such date in    
accordance with GAAP, and there are no known contingent liabilities of the      
Surviving Series required to be reflected on a balance sheet (including the     
notes thereto) in accordance with GAAP as of such date not disclosed therein;   

 A-7

P-->N-14/A47th�Page�of�68TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�47th
      (i) Since August 31, 2003, there has not been any material adverse
change in the Surviving Series' financial condition, assets, liabilities or     
business, other than changes occurring in the ordinary course of business, or   
any incurrence by the Surviving Series of indebtedness maturing more than one   
year from the date such indebtedness was incurred, except as otherwise disclosed
to and accepted by the Merging Series. For purposes of this subparagraph (i), a 
decline in net asset value per share of the Surviving Series due to declines in 
market values of securities in the Surviving Series' portfolio, the discharge of
Surviving Series' liabilities, or the redemption of Surviving Series Shares by  
shareholders of the Surviving Series, shall not constitute a material adverse   
change;                                                                         

        (j) On the Closing Date, all Federal and other tax returns, dividend
reporting forms, and other tax-related reports of the Surviving Series required 
by law to have been filed by such date (including any extensions) shall have    
been filed and are or will be correct in all material respects, and all Federal 
and other taxes shown as due or required to be shown as due on said returns and 
reports shall have been paid or provision shall have been made for the payment  
thereof, and to the best of the Surviving Series' knowledge no such return is   
currently under audit and no assessment has been asserted with respect to such  
returns;                                                                        

          (k) For each taxable year of its operation (including the taxable year
including the Closing Date), the Surviving Series has met (or will meet) the    
requirements of Subchapter M of the Code for qualification as a regulated       
investment company has been eligible to compute and has computed (or will       
compute) its federal income tax under Section 852 of the Code;                  

          (l) All issued and outstanding shares of the Surviving Series are, and
on the Closing Date will be, duly and validly issued and outstanding, will be   
fully paid and non-assessable and have been offered and sold in every state and 
the District of Columbia in compliance in all material respects with applicable 
registration requirements of the 1933 Act. Except for (x) the right of Class B  
shares of the Merged Series to automatically convert into Class A shares of the 
Surviving Series seven years after purchase, or (y) in connection with any      
automatic dividend reinvestment plan available to the Surviving Series'         
shareholders, the Surviving Series does not have outstanding any options,       
warrants or other rights to subscribe for or purchase any shares of the         
Surviving Series, nor is there outstanding any security convertible into any    
shares of the Surviving Series;                                                 

      (m) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement will
have been fully authorized prior to the Closing Date by all necessary action, if
any, on the part of the Trustees of the Investment Trust 97, on behalf of the   
Surviving Series, and this Agreement will constitute a valid and binding        
obligation of the Investment Trust 97, on behalf of the Surviving Series,       
enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject, as to enforcement, to        
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other laws relating to or
affecting creditors' rights and to general equity principles;                   

         (n) Surviving Series Shares to be issued and delivered to the Merging
Series, for the account of the Merging Series Shareholders, pursuant to the     
terms of this Agreement, will on the Closing Date have been duly authorized and,
when so issued and delivered, will be duly and validly issued Surviving Series  
Shares, and will be fully paid and non-assessable;                              

          (o) The information to be furnished by the Investment Trust 97 for use
in the registration statements, proxy materials and other documents filed or to 
be filed with any federal, state or local regulatory authority (including the   
NASD) that may be necessary in connection with the transactions contemplated    
hereby shall be accurate and complete in all material respects and shall comply 
in all material respects with Federal securities and other laws and regulations 
applicable thereto;                                                             

(p) That insofar as it relates to the Surviving Series, the 
Registration Statement relating to the Surviving Series Shares issuable         
hereunder, and the Proxy Statement to be included in the Registration Statement,
and any amendment or supplement to the foregoing, will, from the effective date 

 A-8

of the Registration Statement through the date of the meeting of shareholders of
the Merging Series contemplated therein (i) not contain any untrue statement of 
a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein  
or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which such statements were made, not misleading provided, however, that the     
representations and warranties in this subparagraph (p) shall not apply to      
statements in or omissions from the Registration Statement made in reliance upon
and in conformity with information that was furnished by the Merging Series for 
use therein, and (ii) comply in all material respects with the provisions of the
1933 Act, the 1934 Act and the 1940 Act and the rules and regulations           
thereunder;                                                                     

       (q) The majority of the Trustees of the Investment Trust 97 are not
interested persons of the Investment Trust 97, and those directors select and   
nominate any of the disinterested directors of the Investment Trust 97; and     

  (r) Any person who acts as legal counsel for the disinterested
directors of the Investment Trust 97 is an independent legal counsel as such    
term is defined under applicable law.                                           

5.    COVENANTS OF THE INVESTMENT TRUST 97 AND THE PHOENIX TRUST, ON BEHALF OF  
THE SURVIVING SERIES AND THE MERGING SERIES, RESPECTIVELY           

 5.1 The Surviving Series and the Merging Series each will operate its
business in the ordinary course between the date hereof and the Closing Date, it
being understood that such ordinary course of business will include the         
declaration and payment of customary dividends and distributions, and any other 
distribution that may be advisable.

     5.3 The Investment Trust 97 covenants that the Surviving Series Shares to

   5.5 As soon as is reasonably practicable after the Closing, the Merging
Series will make a liquidating distribution to its shareholders consisting of

5.6 The Phoenix Trust will provide the Investment Trust 97 with     
information reasonably necessary for the preparation of a registration statement

Statement.                                                                      

     5.7 The Phoenix Trust, on behalf of the Merging Series, covenants that it
will, from time to time, as and when reasonably requested by the Investment     
Trust 97, on behalf of the Surviving Series, execute and deliver or cause to be

or cause to be taken such further action as the Investment Trust 97, on behalf  
of the Surviving Series, may reasonably deem necessary or desirable in order to 
carry out the intent and purpose of this

delivered hereunder, and (b) the Investment Trust 97's on behalf of the         
Surviving Series', title to and possession of all the Assets.                   

  5.8 The Surviving Series will use all reasonable efforts to obtain the
approvals and authorizations required by the 1933 Act and the 1940 Act as may be
necessary in order to continue its operations after the Closing Date.           

5.9 (a) Subject to governing law, until the fifth anniversary of the
Closing Date, the Investment Trust 97, on behalf of itself and any successor    
thereto by reason of merger, reorganization, sale or other similar transaction, 
shall: (a) continue that certain joint insured bond referred to as Investment   
Management Insurance Policy No. 281-35-77 issued by American International      
Specialty Lines Insurance Company (such policy, or any replacement thereof      
during the operative period referenced above shall hereafter be referred to as  
the "D&O/E&O Insurance"), or such greater insurance as the Investment Trust 97  
and all other requisite parties to such joint insured bond shall reasonably     
determine; and (b) maintain those indemnity provisions as provided in the       
current Declaration of Trust of the Investment Trust 97 and By-Laws applicable  
with regard to the proper and lawful activities of a trustee (the "Indemnity"). 

          (b) In the event that the D&O/E&O Insurance shall be terminated during
the period transpiring from the Closing Date until the fifth anniversary        
thereof, then the Investment Trust 97, individually or together with one or more
parties to the above referenced joint insured bond, will use its best efforts to
procure a directors' and officers errors and omissions insurance policy for the 
benefit of the Trustees of the Phoenix Trust, among others, for claims made     
against such Trustees during the period stated above, on not less than          
substantially the same terms and conditions, including, without limitation,     
exclusions from coverage, retention limits and limitations of liability, as     
exist for the benefit of such Trustees under the D&O/E&O Insurance Policy       
existing as of the Closing Date.                                                

      (c) The D&O/E&O Insurance and Indemnity shall apply equally to the
trustees of the Phoenix Trust (constituted as of the date of this Agreement) as 
they apply to the trustees of the Investment Trust 97.                          

       (d) Nothing in this Paragraph 5.9 shall be construed as imposing an
obligation on the Investment Trust 97 to take any action to the extent such     
action would be prohibited by governing law or the exercise of the fiduciary    
duties of the board of trustees of the Investment Trust 97.                     

          (e) In the event that the D&O/E&O Insurance shall be terminated during
the period transpiring from Closing until the fifth anniversary thereof, and the
Investment Trust 97 shall fail or be unwilling to fulfill its obligations       
pursuant to clause (b) of this Paragraph 5.9, then Phoenix Investment Counsel,  
Inc, the adviser to the Investment Trust 97, individually or together with one  
or more parties to the above referenced joint insured bond, will use its best   
efforts to procure a directors' and officers errors and omissions insurance     
policy for the benefit of the Trustees of the Phoenix Trust, among others, for  
claims made against such Trustees during the period stated above, on not less   
than substantially the same terms and conditions, including, without limitation,
exclusions from coverage, retention limits and limitations of liability, as     
exist for the benefit of such Trustees under the D&O/E&O Insurance Policy       
existing as of the Closing Date. The foregoing notwithstanding, in no event     
shall Phoenix Investment Counsel, Inc., nor any of its affiliates, subsidiaries,
parent companies, officers, employees or directors, in any way be liable or     
otherwise obligated to directly or indirectly indemnify or hold harmless the    
Trustees of the Phoenix Trust for any loss, cost or liability (including        
attorneys fees) arising in connection with the subject transaction or with      
regard to any claims or causes of action as might have been subject to possible

10.   ENTIRE AGREEMENT; SURVIVAL OF WARRANTIES                                  

10.1 The Phoenix Trust and the Investment Trust 97 have not made any
representation, warranty or covenant not set forth herein, and this Agreement   
constitutes the entire agreement between the parties.                           

10.2 The representations, warranties and covenants contained in this
Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant hereto or in connection herewith
shall survive the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereunder. The  
covenants to be performed after the Closing shall survive the Closing.          

11.   TERMINATION                                                               

     This Agreement may be terminated and the transactions contemplated hereby
may be abandoned by either party: (i) by mutual agreement of the parties, or    
(ii) either party if the Closing shall not have occurred on or before           
June 30, 2004, unless such date is extended by mutual agreement of the          
parties, or (iii) either party if the other party shall have materially breached
its obligations under this Agreement or made a material and intentional         
misrepresentation herein or in connection herewith. In the event of any such    
termination, this Agreement shall become void and there shall be no liability   
hereunder on the part of any party or their respective Trustees or officers,    
except for any such material breach or intentional misrepresentation, as to each
of which all remedies at law or in equity of the party adversely affected shall 
survive.

     This Agreement may be amended, modified or supplemented in such manner as
may be deemed necessary or advisable by the authorized officers of the Phoenix  
Trust and the Investment Trust 97; provided, however, that following the meeting
of the shareholders of the Merging Series called by the Phoenix Trust pursuant  
to paragraph 5.2 of this Agreement, no such amendment may have the effect of    
changing the provisions for determining the number of the Surviving Series      
Shares to be issued to the Merging Series Shareholders under this Agreement to  
the detriment of such shareholders without their further approval.              

13.   NOTICES

     14.3 This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with
the laws of the State of Delaware without regard to its principles of conflicts 
of laws.                                                                        

  14.4 This Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of the parties
hereto and their respective successors and assigns, but no assignment or        
transfer hereof or of any rights or obligations hereunder shall be made by any  
party without the written consent of the other party. Nothing herein expressed  
or implied is intended or shall be construed to confer upon or give any person, 
firm or corporation, other than the parties hereto and their respective         
successors and assigns, any rights or remedies under or by reason of this       
Agreement.                                                                      

 14.5 It is expressly agreed that the obligations of the Phoenix Trust
hereunder shall not be binding upon any of the Trustees, shareholders, nominees,
officers, agents, or employees of the Phoenix Trust personally, but shall bind  
only the trust property of the Merging Series, as provided in the Declaration of
Trust of the Phoenix Trust. The execution and delivery by such officers of the  
Phoenix Trust shall not be deemed to have been made by any of them individually 
or to impose any liability on any of them personally, but shall bind only the   
trust property of the Merging Series as provided in the Declaration of Trust of 
the Phoenix Trust. The Phoenix Trust is a series company with multiple series,  
and the Phoenix Trust has entered into this Agreement on behalf of one such     
series, the Merging Series. With respect to any obligation of the Phoenix Trust 
arising hereunder, the Investment Trust 97 and the Surviving Series shall look  
for payment or satisfaction of such obligations solely to the assets and        
property of the Merging Series.                                                 

    14.6 It is expressly agreed that the obligations of the Investment Trust
97 hereunder shall not be binding upon any of the Trustees, shareholders,       
nominees, officers, agents or employees of the Investment Trust 97 personally,  
but shall bind only the trust property of the Surviving Series, as provided in  
the Declaration of Trust of the Investment Trust 97. The execution and delivery 
by such officers of the Investment Trust 97 shall not be deemed to have been    
made by any of them individually or to impose any liability on any of them      
personally, but shall bind only the trust property of the Surviving Series as   
provided in the Declaration of Trust of the Investment Trust 97. The Investment 
Trust 97 is a series company with two portfolio series, and the Investment Trust
97 has entered into this Agreement on behalf of one such series, the Surviving  
Series. With respect to any obligation of the Investment Trust 97 arising       
hereunder, the Phoenix Trust and the Merging Series shall look for payment or   
satisfaction of such obligations solely to the assets and property of the       
Surviving Series.                                                               

   14.7 Except as specifically provided herein, the sole remedy of a party
hereto for a breach of any representation or warranty made in this Agreement by 
the other party shall be an election by the non-breaching party not to complete 
the transactions contemplated herein as set forth in Sections 6 and 7.          

    IN WITNESS WHEREOF, each of the parties hereto has caused this Agreement
to be executed by its President or Vice President and its seal to be affixed    
thereto and attested by its Secretary or Assistant Secretary.

PHOENIX-SMALL CAP VALUE FUND/PHOENIX APPRECIATION FUND                          
NOTES TO PRO FORMA COMBINING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS                               
AUGUST 31, 2003 (UNAUDITED)                                                     
1.  BASIS OF COMBINATION                                                        

The unaudited Pro Forma Combined Portfolio of Investments, Pro Forma Combined   
Statement of Assets and Liabilities and Pro Forma Combined Statement of         
Operations give effect to the proposed merger of the Phoenix Appreciation Fund  
("Appreciation") into the Phoenix Small Cap Value Fund ("Small Cap Value"). The 
proposed merger will be accounted for by the method of accounting for tax-free  
mergers of investment companies. The merger provides for the transfer of all or 
substantially all of the assets of Appreciation to Small Cap Value and the      
subsequent liquidation of Appreciation. The accounting survivor in the proposed 
merger will be Small Cap Value. This is because although Appreciation has the   
same investment objective as Small Cap Value, the surviving fund will invest in 
a style that is similar to the way in which Small Cap Value is currently        
operated (including hedging and investment in debt securities). Additionally,   
Small Cap Value has a significantly larger asset base than Appreciation.        

The pro forma combined statements should be read in conjunction with the        
historical financial statements of the constituent fund and the notes thereto   
incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement filed on Form N-14. The 
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles    
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make  
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets,           
liabilities, revenues and expenses. Actual results could differ from those      
estimates.                                                                      

Appreciation and Small Cap Value are both, open-end, management investment      
companies registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.      

2. SHARES OF BENEFICIAL INTEREST                                                

The Pro Forma net asset value per share assumes the issuance of additional      
shares of Small Cap Value which would have been issued at August 31, 2003 in    
connection with the proposed reorganization. The amount of additional shares    
assumed to be issued was calculated based on the net assets, as of August 31,
2003, of Appreciation Class A of $62,539,657 and the net asset value of Small   
Cap Value Class A of $13.42; the net assets of Appreciation Class B of          
$7,782,422 and the net asset value of Small Cap Value Class B of $12.79; and the
net assets of Appreciation Class C of $29,047,971 and the net asset value of    
Small Cap Value Class C of $12.79. The Pro Forma Statement of Assets &          
Liabilities reflects the combined Pro Forma shares outstanding as calculated    
above.                                                                          

3. PRO FORMA OPERATIONS                                                         

Pro Forma operating expenses include the expenses of Small Cap Value restated to
reflect the expense schedule which became effective May 1, 2003, the actual     
expenses of each Appreciation and the combined Fund, with certain expenses      
adjusted to reflect the expected expenses of the combined entity. The investment
advisory and financial agent fees have been calculated for the combined Fund    
based on the fee schedule in effect for Small Cap Value at the combined level of
average net assets for the period ended August 31, 2003.                        

4. PORTFOLIO VALUATION                                                          

Equity securities are valued at the last sale price, or if there had been no    
sale that day, at the last bid price. Debt securities are valued on the basis of
broker quotations or valuations provided by a pricing service which utilizes    
information with respect to recent sales, market transactions in comparable     
securities, quotations from dealers, and various relationships between          
securities in determining value. Short-term investments having a remaining      
maturity of 60 days or less are valued at amortized cost which approximates     
market. All other securities and assets are valued at fair value as determined  
in good faith by or under the direction of the Trustees.

thereto by reason of merger, reorganization, sale or other similar transaction, 
shall: (a) continue that certain joint insured bond referred to as Investment   
Management Insurance Policy No. 281-35-77 issued by American International

        (b) In the event that the D&O/E&O Insurance shall be terminated during

procure a directors' and officers errors and omissions insurance policy for the 
benefit of the Trustees of the Phoenix Trust, among others, for claims made     
against such Trustees during the period stated above, on not less than          
substantially the same terms and conditions, including, without limitation,     
exclusions from coverage, retention limits and limitations of liability, as     
exist for the benefit of such Trustees under the D&O/E&O Insurance Policy       
existing as of the Closing Date.                                                

    (c) The D&O/E&O Insurance and Indemnity shall apply equally to the
trustees of the Phoenix Trust (constituted as of the date of this Agreement) as 
they apply to the trustees of the Investment Trust 97.

Performance data quoted represents past results. Past performance is no guarantee of future results and current performance may be higher or lower than the performance shown. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate, so your shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
Returns for periods of less than one year are cumulative total returns.
The investments for the Series are managed by the same portfolio manager(s) who manage one or more other funds that have similar names, investment objectives and investment styles as the Series. You should be aware that the Series is likely to differ from the other mutual funds in size, cash flow pattern and tax matters. Accordingly, the holdings and performance of the Series can be expected to vary from those of the other mutual funds. Shares of the separate Series of Virtus Variable Insurance Trust are sold only through the currently effective prospectuses and are not available to the general public. Shares of the VIT Series may be purchased only by life insurance companies to be used with their separate accounts which fund variable annuity and variable life insurance policies or qualified retirement plans and are also available as an underlying investment fund for certain qualified retirement plans. The performance information for the Series does not reflect fees and expenses of the insurance companies. If such fees and expenses were deducted, performance would be lower.
Morningstar Disclosures:The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accouts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.

What does it mean?


A fund's Morningstar Rating is a quantitative assessment of a fund's past performance that accounts for both risk and return, with funds earning between 1 and 5 stars. As always, this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process. A high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision.











 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Below Average


This fund scores Below Average because it delivered returns that were in the bottom 22.5% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category:� top 10% - High� next 22.5% - Above Average� middle 35% - Average� next 22.5% - Below Average� bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Expenses


LOW
AVG
HIGH


High


This fund's expenses are rated as High because they are above the 80th percentile when compared with other funds in the category.





How is it calculated?


This Morningstar data point compares the fund's net expense ratio to the net expense ratio of all the other funds within its Morningstar Category grouping.





What does it mean?


Excessive expenses can detract from overall returns and can be a drain on performance. While you should not base any investment decision entirely on expenses or expense ratios, a fund's expense structure may be one factor to consider.











 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.






How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

Fund Overview




Objective



The investment seeks capital appreciation and income with approximately equal emphasis.




Strategy



The fund normally invests at least 80% of its assets in publicly-traded REITs and companies that are principally engaged in the real estate industry. It offers exposure to the equity real estate investment trust ("REIT") market utilizing a Growth at a Reasonable Price style with macroeconomic and fundamental security analysis designed to identify the most attractive investment candidates.


Risk



Real Estate is a cyclical industry that is sensitive to interest rates, economic conditions (both nationally and locally), property tax rates, and other factors. Changes in real estate values or economic downturns can have a significant negative effect on issuers in the real estate industry. Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, economic or other developments. These risks may be magnified in foreign markets. Sector funds can be more volatile because of their narrow concentration in a specific industry. In general the bond market is volatile, and fixed income securities carry interest rate risk. (As interest rates rise, bond prices usually fall, and vice versa. This effect is usually more pronounced for longer-term securities.) Fixed income securities also carry inflation risk and credit and default risks for both issuers and counterparties. Unlike individual bonds, most bond funds do not have a maturity date, so avoiding losses caused by price volatility by holding them until maturity is not possible. Additional risk information for this product may be found in the prospectus or other product materials, if available.




Additional Disclosures

This description is only intended to provide a brief overview of the mutual fund. Read the fund's prospectus for more detailed information about the fund.
The analysis on these pages may be based, in part, on adjusted historical returns for periods prior to the class's actual inception of 07/25/2003.  These calculated returns reflect the historical performance of the oldest share class of the fund, with an inception date of 03/01/1995, adjusted to reflect the fees and expenses of this share class (when this share class's fees and expenses are higher.)  Please refer to a fund's prospectus for information regarding fees and expenses.  These adjusted historical returns are not actual returns.  Calculation methodologies utilized by Morningstar may differ from those applied by other entities, including the fund itself.
As of May 8, 2017, this fund changed its name from Virtus Real Estate Securities Fund C.

Risk


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Average

This fund scores Average because Morningstar has rated its risk between the 40th and 60th percentiles when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.




How is it calculated?


Risk is calculated using the Sharpe ratio, which compares portfolio returns to a rate comparable to U.S. Treasury bonds, relative to the fund's overall volatility. For this measure, Morningstar has compared the Sharpe ratio of this fund against all other funds that invest in it's Morningstar Category.




What does it mean?


A higher Sharpe implies better risk-adjusted returns. Therefore, if a fund has a Sharpe ratio higher than its category average, it's returns relative to it's risk were better than other similar funds. If its Sharpe ratio is lower, that's usually a sign that the risk-adjusted returns were lower than other similar funds.










 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Below Average


This fund scores Below Average because it delivered returns that were in the bottom 22.5% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category:� top 10% - High� next 22.5% - Above Average� middle 35% - Average� next 22.5% - Below Average� bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.






How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

Risk



Real Estate is a cyclical industry that is sensitive to interest rates, economic conditions (both nationally and locally), property tax rates, and other factors. Changes in real estate values or economic downturns can have a significant negative effect on issuers in the real estate industry. Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, economic or other developments. These risks may be magnified in foreign markets. Sector funds can be more volatile because of their narrow concentration in a specific industry. In general the bond market is volatile, and fixed income securities carry interest rate risk. (As interest rates rise, bond prices usually fall, and vice versa. This effect is usually more pronounced for longer-term securities.) Fixed income securities also carry inflation risk and credit and default risks for both issuers and counterparties. Unlike individual bonds, most bond funds do not have a maturity date, so avoiding losses caused by price volatility by holding them until maturity is not possible. Additional risk information for this product may be found in the prospectus or other product materials, if available.

The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. (Exchange-traded funds and open-end mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes.) It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of  funds in each fund category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information. Fidelity does not review the Morningstar data and, for fund performance, you should check the fund's current prospectus or other product materials for the most up-to-date information concerning applicable loads, fees and expenses.

The "Mutual Funds" area at the top of each page allows access to mutual fund holdings with individual and joint Fidelity non-retirement accounts. Individual stock positions, ETFs and 529 funds are not available through this view. For the full list of your holdings visit Portfolio Summary.Mutual Funds are priced as of the previous business day's market close when the market is open. Mutual fund positions are priced as of the official market close (typically 4p.m.) and prices are generally available between 5 p.m. and 6p.m.

The performance data featured represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results.  Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate; therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.  Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.











1. Transaction Fee:A transaction fee is similar to a  brokerage fee or commission which you pay when you buy or sell a stock. For some funds available through Fidelity you are required to pay a transaction fee. However, you will not pay a sales load on Transaction Fee (TF) funds. You will only be charged a transaction fee when you buy a FundsNetwork TF fund, not when you sell one. All other fees and expenses described in a fund's prospectus still apply. You can choose to buy or sell shares directly from the fund itself or its principal underwriter or distributor without paying a transaction fee to Fidelity.Online Transaction Fees:  $49.95 for most funds.  Certain funds will have a transaction fee of $75. To identify any applicable transaction fees associated with the purchase of a given fund, please refer to the "Fees and Distributions" tab.Fidelity Automated Service Telephone (FAST): 25% off representative-assisted rates, Maximum: $187.50, Minimum:$75Representative-Assisted: 0.75% of principal, Maximum: $250, Minimum: $100Automatic Investment: $5 per transaction, after the initial investment.Sales load:A sales charge added to the price of the fund.  Funds have different sales charge structures, including front-end loads, back-end loads (deferred), and no loads. Sales loads can either be charged when a fund is purchased, commonly known as a front-end load, or when a fund is sold, known as a deferred load. Not  all funds charge a load. Refer to the Loads, Expense and Minimums section of the fund's prospectus for details on these amounts. Although no load funds do not have a front-end or deferred load, they may incur other fees, such as a 12b-1 fee.
2. Total returns are historical and include change in share value and reinvestment of dividends and capital gains, if any. Cumulative total returns are reported as of the period indicated. Life of fund figures are reported as of the commencement date to the period indicated and are cumulative if the fund is less than one year old. Total returns do not reflect the fund's [%] sales charge. If sales charges were included, total returns would have been lower. Except for Life of Fund returns, the analysis on these pages may be based, in part, on adjusted historical returns for periods prior to the class's actual inception of 7/25/2003.  These calculated returns reflect the historical performance of the oldest share class of the fund, with an inception date of 3/1/1995, adjusted to reflect the fees and expenses of this share class (when this share class's fees and expenses are higher.)  Please refer to a fund's prospectus for information regarding fees and expenses.  These adjusted historical returns are not actual returns.  Calculation methodologies utilized by Morningstar may differ from those applied by other entities, including the fund itself.
3. The Morningstar Category Average is the average return for the peer group based on the returns of each individual fund within the group, for the period shown. This average assumes reinvestment of dividends.
4. This chart illustrates the performance of a hypothetical $10,000 investment made in this investment product (and a benchmark or category average, if shown) from the beginning date shown or on the inception date of the product (whichever is later).  The inception date used for products with underlying funds, or multiple shares classes, or are offered as a separate account, strategy or sub account, may be the inception date of the underlying fund, the earliest share class of the product, or the date composite performance for the product was first made available. The product's returns may not reflect all its expenses. Any fees not reflected would lower the returns. Benchmark returns include reinvestment of capital gains and dividends, if any, but do not reflect any fees or expenses. It is not possible to invest in an index. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. This chart is not intended to imply any future performance of the investment product.
5. Initial minimum investments into group retirement accounts such as Fidelity Simplified Employee Pension-IRA, Keogh, Self-Employed 401(k), and Non-Fidelity Prototype Retirement accounts are $500 or higher. Additional investments into Regular, IRA, and Group accounts are $250 or higher.
6. The current yield reflects the current earnings of the fund, while the total return refers to a specific past holding period. The 7-Day Yield is the average income return over the previous seven days, assuming the rate stays the same for one year and that dividends are reinvested. It is the Fund's total income net of expenses, divided by the total number of outstanding shares and includes any applicable waiver or reimbursement.
7. A standard yield calculation developed by the Securities and Exchange Commission for bond funds. The yield is calculated by dividing the net investment income per share earned during the 30-day period by the maximum offering price per share on the last day of the period. The yield figure reflects the dividends and interest earned during the 30-day period, after the deduction of the fund's expenses. It is sometimes referred to as "SEC 30-Day Yield" or "standardized yield".
8. Any holdings, asset allocation, diversification breakdowns or other composition data shown are as of the date indicated and are subject to change at any time. They may not be representative of the fund's current or future investments. Some breakdowns may be intentionally limited to a particular asset class or other subset of the fund's entire portfolio, particularly in multi-asset class funds where the attributes of the equity and fixed income portions are different. Under the asset allocation section, international (or foreign) assets may be reported differently depending on how an investment options reports its holdings.  Some do not report international (or foreign) holdings here, but instead report them in a "Regional Diversification" section.  Some report them in this section as an to the equity, bond and other allocation shown.  Others report international (or foreign) holding as a subset of the equity and bond allocations shown.  If the allocation without the foreign component (or round to) 100%, then international (or foreign) is a subset of the equity and bond percentage shown.
9. Percent Rank in Category is the fund's total-return percentile rank relative to all funds that have the same Morningstar Category.  The highest (or most favorable) percentile rank is 1 and the lowest (or least favorable) percentile rank is 100. The top-performing fund in a category will always receive a rank of 1. % Rank in Category is based on total returns which include reinvested dividends and capital gains, if any, and exclude sales charges.
10. The analysis on these pages may be based, in part, on adjusted historical returns for periods prior to the class's actual inception of 7/25/2003.  These calculated returns reflect the historical performance of the oldest share class of the fund, with an inception date of 3/1/1995, adjusted to reflect the fees and expenses of this share class (when this share class's fees and expenses are higher.)  Please refer to a fund's prospectus for information regarding fees and expenses.  These adjusted historical returns are not actual returns.  Calculation methodologies utilized by Morningstar may differ from those applied by other entities, including the fund itself.
11. StyleMap� depictions of mutual fund characteristics are produced using data and calculations provided by Morningstar, Inc. StyleMapsSM estimate characteristics of a fund's equity holdings over two dimensions: market capitalization and valuation. The percentage of fund assets represented by these holdings is indicated beside each StyleMap. Current StyleMap characteristics are calculated each time Morningstar receives updated portfolio holdings from a fund and are denoted with a dot. Historical StyleMap characteristics are calculated for the shorter of either the past 3 years or the life of the fund, and are represented by the shading of the box(es) previously occupied by the dot. StyleMap characteristics represent an approximate profile of the fund's equity holdings (e.g., domestic stocks, foreign stocks, and American Depositary Receipts), are based on historical data, and are not predictive of the fund's future investments. Although the data are gathered from reliable sources, accuracy and completeness cannot be guaranteed.
12. Please note Regional Diversification information is based on the equity components only.


Generally, data on Fidelity mutual funds is provided by FMR, LLC, Morningstar ratings and data on non-Fidelity mutual funds is provided by Morningstar, Inc. and data on non-mutual fund products is provided by the product's investment manager, trustee or issuer or the plan sponsor whose plan is offering the product to  participants.  Although Fidelity believes the data gathered from these third-party sources is reliable, it does not review such information and cannot warrant it to be accurate, complete or timely.  Fidelity is not responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this third-party information.

All Cap Core Strategy (ALLC0173)
	
	




Strategy
Invesco Unit Trusts offers a portfolio that seeks to provide the potential for capital appreciation by using 3 separate and unique enhanced index strategies* to select a portfolio of 120 stocks.




Different market capitalizations—  large, medium and small — have historically taken turns "leading the pack". Investing across the entire market cap spectrum of stocks, starting from large-caps all the way down to small-caps, may be a smart addition to a long-term investment strategy.
The All Cap Core Strategy offers the potential opportunity to take advantage of investment opportunities across the market cap spectrum utilizing a balanced, quantitative approach to selecting securities. Invesco Unit Trusts sought to combine multiple factors across the three categories of "Value", "Health", and "Growth" to help balance the risk profile and identify companies that are true to their investment style, but share certain health, growth or value characteristics which we feel are critical to identifying strong stocks for the portfolio.
* An enhanced index strategy refers to a unit investment trust strategy, sponsored by Invesco Capital Markets, Inc., that seeks to outperform an index by investing in an objectively selected subset of stocks from the same index.

The style characteristics of the Portfolio are determined as of the initial date of deposit. For a complete description of these characteristics, see below.

Key Stats



Weighted Avg P/E 
22.14


Weighted Avg P/B 
3.56


Weighted Avg Market Cap (MM) 
$45,191.30




Each Key Stat shows the weighted average of a particular metric attributable to the underlying securities included in the portfolio of the trust, and does not represent a statistic of the trust itself.



1The Portfolio will make distributions of income and capital on each specified Distribution Date to unitholders of record on the preceding Record Date, provided that the total cash held for distribution meets or exceeds any applicable minimum that may be specified in the prospectus. Undistributed income and capital will be distributed on the next Distribution Date in which the total cash held for distribution meets or exceeds any applicable minimum that may be specified in the prospectus.  The Estimated Annual Income per Unit is as of the date listed in the prospectus during the trust's initial offering period, and is updated each calendar quarter thereafter. This amount is based on the most recently declared dividends or interim and final dividends accounting for any foreign withholding taxes, but may also be based upon several recently declared dividends. The actual net annual distributions you receive will vary from the estimate set forth above with changes in the trust's fees and expenses, in dividends and distributions received, currency fluctuations and with the sale of trust securities. The actual net annual distributions are expected to decrease over time because a portion of the securities included in the trust will be sold over time to pay for organization costs. Securities may also be sold to pay regular fees and expenses during the trust's life.  The Portfolio may make distributions that represent a return of capital for tax purposes to the extent of the Unitholder's basis in the Units, and any additional amounts in excess of basis would be taxed as a capital gain. Generally, you will treat all capital gains dividends as long-term capital gains regardless of how long you have owned your Units. Unitholders should consult with their individual tax advisors.
2As of the close of business day prior to Initial Date of Deposit. The actual distributions you may receive will vary from the estimated amount due to changes in the Portfolio's fees and expenses, in actual income received by the Portfolio, currency fluctuations and with changes in the Portfolio such as acquisition or liquidation of securities.


The trust portfolio is provided for informational purposes only and should not be deemed as a recommendation to buy or sell the individual securities shown above.



 Important Information About Benchmarks





About risk



There is no assurance a trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in these unit investment trusts are subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. The trust is unmanaged and its portfolio is not intended to change during the trust's life except in limited circumstances. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in these trusts. The trust should be considered as a part of a long term investment strategy and you should consider your ability to pursue it by investing in successive trusts, if available. You will realize tax consequences associated with investing from one series to the next.
Common stocks do not assure dividend payments. Dividends are paid only when declared by an issuer's board of directors and the amount of any dividend may vary over time. There can be no guarantee or assurance that companies will declare dividends in the future or that if declared, they will remain at current levels or increase over time.
The financial condition of an issuer may worsen or its credit ratings may drop, resulting in a reduction in the value of your Units. This may occur at any point in time, including during the initial offering period.
You could experience dilution of your investment if the size of the Portfolio is increased as Units are sold. There is no assurance that your investment will maintain its proportionate share in the Portfolio's profits and losses.
This Portfolio is concentrated in the financials sector industry and may present more risk than a more diversified investment. There are certain risks specific to the financials sector, including the potential adverse effects of economic recession, volatile interest rates, and state and federal regulations.
The Portfolio invests primarily in stocks of large cap companies. Large cap companies are more mature and may grow more slowly than the economy as a whole and tend to go in and out of favor based on market and economic conditions.
Stocks of smaller capitalization companies are often more volatile than those of larger companies as a result of several factors such as limited trading volumes, products or financial resources, management inexperience and less publicly available information.

1The Portfolio will make distributions of income and capital on each specified Distribution Date to unitholders of record on the preceding Record Date, provided that the total cash held for distribution meets or exceeds any applicable minimum that may be specified in the prospectus. Undistributed income and capital will be distributed on the next Distribution Date in which the total cash held for distribution meets or exceeds any applicable minimum that may be specified in the prospectus.  The Estimated Annual Income per Unit is as of the date listed in the prospectus during the trust's initial offering period, and is updated each calendar quarter thereafter. This amount is based on the most recently declared dividends or interim and final dividends accounting for any foreign withholding taxes, but may also be based upon several recently declared dividends. The actual net annual distributions you receive will vary from the estimate set forth above with changes in the trust's fees and expenses, in dividends and distributions received, currency fluctuations and with the sale of trust securities. The actual net annual distributions are expected to decrease over time because a portion of the securities included in the trust will be sold over time to pay for organization costs. Securities may also be sold to pay regular fees and expenses during the trust's life.  The Portfolio may make distributions that represent a return of capital for tax purposes to the extent of the Unitholder's basis in the Units, and any additional amounts in excess of basis would be taxed as a capital gain. Generally, you will treat all capital gains dividends as long-term capital gains regardless of how long you have owned your Units. Unitholders should consult with their individual tax advisors.
2As of the close of business day prior to Initial Date of Deposit. The actual distributions you may receive will vary from the estimated amount due to changes in the Portfolio's fees and expenses, in actual income received by the Portfolio, currency fluctuations and with changes in the Portfolio such as acquisition or liquidation of securities.


The trust portfolio is provided for informational purposes only and should not be deemed as a recommendation to buy or sell the individual securities shown above.



 Important Information About Benchmarks





About risk



There is no assurance a trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in these unit investment trusts are subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. The trust is unmanaged and its portfolio is not intended to change during the trust's life except in limited circumstances. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in these trusts. The trust should be considered as a part of a long term investment strategy and you should consider your ability to pursue it by investing in successive trusts, if available. You will realize tax consequences associated with investing from one series to the next.
Common stocks do not assure dividend payments. Dividends are paid only when declared by an issuer's board of directors and the amount of any dividend may vary over time. There can be no guarantee or assurance that companies will declare dividends in the future or that if declared, they will remain at current levels or increase over time.
The financial condition of an issuer may worsen or its credit ratings may drop, resulting in a reduction in the value of your Units. This may occur at any point in time, including during the initial offering period.
You could experience dilution of your investment if the size of the Portfolio is increased as Units are sold. There is no assurance that your investment will maintain its proportionate share in the Portfolio's profits and losses.
This Portfolio is concentrated in the financials sector industry and may present more risk than a more diversified investment. There are certain risks specific to the financials sector, including the potential adverse effects of economic recession, volatile interest rates, and state and federal regulations.
The Portfolio invests primarily in stocks of large cap companies. Large cap companies are more mature and may grow more slowly than the economy as a whole and tend to go in and out of favor based on market and economic conditions.
Stocks of smaller capitalization companies are often more volatile than those of larger companies as a result of several factors such as limited trading volumes, products or financial resources, management inexperience and less publicly available information.

LIQUIDATION PRICE  Represents the value per unit that a unitholder would receive if the unitholder redeemed or sold units. This price is equal to the net asset value per unit plus any remaining organization costs and creation and development fee. This price reflects any remaining deferred sales charges payable in connection with a liquidation of units.
OFFER PRICE Represents the net asset value per unit plus any applicable organization costs and sales charges. This is the regular public offering price per unit paid to purchase units. This price is often subject to certain sales charge discounts described in a trust prospectus.
NET ASSET VALUE (NAV) Represents the value per unit of a trust's portfolio securities and other assets reduced by trust expenses and other liabilities, including remaining organization costs, deferred sales charges and creation and the development fee.This page contains historical pricing or historical income distributions information for the unit trust listed above.

The performance data quoted for the individual series of a trust that has not terminated or has an open termination date is from the deposit date through the current date quoted. For individual series that have terminated, performance data quoted is from the deposit date through the termination date.Performance data quoted represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate and units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
Returns are cumulative total returns (not annualized) unless labeled as average annual total returns. All returns reflect trust expenses as incurred and assume reinvestment of income and principal distributions, except for trusts that do not offer the option of reinvesting distributions into additional trust units. Please see the related trust prospectus for additional information. Returns do not reflect taxes.
A trust's performance, especially for short time periods, should not be the sole factor in making your investment decision. Please keep in mind that high, double-digit returns are highly unusual and cannot be sustained. Investors should also be aware that these returns were primarily achieved during favorable market conditions.
Returns With Sales Charge reflect the maximum sales charge that would be payable by an investor upon sale or redemption of units at the end of the applicable period(s). The sales charge includes any initial or deferred sales charges other than creation and development fee. These returns do not reflect any creation and development fee prior to collection (generally the close of the initial offering period). Any creation and development fee is reflected in the returns as of the time of payment. by a trust. These returns reflect any contingent deferred sales charges only if the charges would be payable upon a unit sale or redemption at or prior to the end of the applicable performance period(s). Certain trusts are no longer offered for sale to the public and, as a result, do not publish an offer price or have a sales charge. In these cases, returns will not reflect a sales charge if a trust was not actually offered for sale to the public on the first day of the applicable period because units of the trust could not have been purchased by an investor at that time. These returns will show 'N/A' for With Sales Charge data
Returns Without Sales Charge do not reflect any sales charge and do not reflect any creation and development fee prior to collection (generally the close of the initial offering period). Any creation and development fee is reflected in the returns as of the time of payment by a trust.
There is no assurance the trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit investment trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust. Certain trusts are unmanaged and their portfolios are not intended to change during the trusts' lives except in limited circumstances. Certain trusts are passively managed and seek to track their target index during the trust's life. For a more complete discussion of the risks of investing in this trust, click on the Fact Card.

1The Portfolio will make distributions of income and capital on each specified Distribution Date to unitholders of record on the preceding Record Date, provided that the total cash held for distribution meets or exceeds any applicable minimum that may be specified in the prospectus. Undistributed income and capital will be distributed on the next Distribution Date in which the total cash held for distribution meets or exceeds any applicable minimum that may be specified in the prospectus.  The Estimated Annual Income per Unit is as of the date listed in the prospectus during the trust's initial offering period, and is updated each calendar quarter thereafter. This amount is based on the most recently declared dividends or interim and final dividends accounting for any foreign withholding taxes, but may also be based upon several recently declared dividends. The actual net annual distributions you receive will vary from the estimate set forth above with changes in the trust's fees and expenses, in dividends and distributions received, currency fluctuations and with the sale of trust securities. The actual net annual distributions are expected to decrease over time because a portion of the securities included in the trust will be sold over time to pay for organization costs. Securities may also be sold to pay regular fees and expenses during the trust's life.  The Portfolio may make distributions that represent a return of capital for tax purposes to the extent of the Unitholder's basis in the Units, and any additional amounts in excess of basis would be taxed as a capital gain. Generally, you will treat all capital gains dividends as long-term capital gains regardless of how long you have owned your Units. Unitholders should consult with their individual tax advisors.
2As of the close of business day prior to Initial Date of Deposit. The actual distributions you may receive will vary from the estimated amount due to changes in the Portfolio's fees and expenses, in actual income received by the Portfolio, currency fluctuations and with changes in the Portfolio such as acquisition or liquidation of securities.


 Important Information About Benchmarks





About risk



There is no assurance a trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in these unit investment trusts are subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. The trust is unmanaged and its portfolio is not intended to change during the trust's life except in limited circumstances. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in these trusts. The trust should be considered as a part of a long term investment strategy and you should consider your ability to pursue it by investing in successive trusts, if available. You will realize tax consequences associated with investing from one series to the next.
Common stocks do not assure dividend payments. Dividends are paid only when declared by an issuer's board of directors and the amount of any dividend may vary over time. There can be no guarantee or assurance that companies will declare dividends in the future or that if declared, they will remain at current levels or increase over time.
The financial condition of an issuer may worsen or its credit ratings may drop, resulting in a reduction in the value of your Units. This may occur at any point in time, including during the initial offering period.
You could experience dilution of your investment if the size of the Portfolio is increased as Units are sold. There is no assurance that your investment will maintain its proportionate share in the Portfolio's profits and losses.
This Portfolio is concentrated in the financials sector industry and may present more risk than a more diversified investment. There are certain risks specific to the financials sector, including the potential adverse effects of economic recession, volatile interest rates, and state and federal regulations.
The Portfolio invests primarily in stocks of large cap companies. Large cap companies are more mature and may grow more slowly than the economy as a whole and tend to go in and out of favor based on market and economic conditions.
Stocks of smaller capitalization companies are often more volatile than those of larger companies as a result of several factors such as limited trading volumes, products or financial resources, management inexperience and less publicly available information.

 The above graph represents a hypothetical $10,000 investment in the trust strategy (not any actual trust) and the associated benchmark over the period indicated in the graph. The graph assumes the sum of the initial investment ($10,000) and all dividends (including those on stocks trading ex-dividend as of the last day of the year) and appreciation during a year are reinvested at the end of that year. 
All strategy performance is hypothetical (not any actual trust) and reflects trust sales charges (full sales charge in first year of 2.95% and reduced rollover charge thereafter of 1.95%) and expenses but not brokerage commissions on stocks or taxes. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Actual returns will vary from hypothetical strategy returns due to timing differences and because the trust may not be invested equally in all stocks or be fully invested at all times. In any given year the strategy may lose money or underperform the index. Returns are calculated by taking year-end prices, subtracting them from the prices at the end of the following year (adjusting for any stock splits that might have occurred during the year) and adding dividends received for the period divided by starting price. Average annual total return and total return measure change in the value of an investment plus dividends, assuming quarterly reinvestment of dividends. Average annual total return reflects annualized change while total return reflects aggregate change and is not annualized. Standard deviation is a measure of volatility that represents the degree to which an investment's performance has varied from its average performance over a particular period. Standard deviation does not compare the volatility of an investment relative to other investments or the overall stock market. The more an investment's return varies from the investment's average return, the more volatile the investment. Standard deviation is based on past performance and is no guarantee of future results.
 Please keep in mind that high, double-digit and/or triple-digit returns are highly unusual and cannot be sustained. Investors should also be aware that these returns were primarily achieved during favorable market conditions. 
Indices are statistical composites and their returns do not include payment of any sales charges or fees an investor would pay to purchase the securities they represent. Such costs would lower performance. It is not possible to invest directly in an index. The historical performance of the indices are shown for illustrative purposes only; it is not meant to forecast, imply or guarantee the future performance of any particular investment or the trust, which will vary.

Undistributed income and capital will be distributed on the next Distribution Date in which the total cash held for distribution meets or exceeds any applicable minimum that may be specified in the prospectus.  The Estimated Annual Income per Unit is as of the date listed in the prospectus during the trust's initial offering period, and is updated each calendar quarter thereafter.

History[edit]
Virtus Investment Partners, formerly known as Phoenix Investment Partners, Ltd., was formed on November 1, 1995 through a reverse merger with Duff & Phelps Investment Management Co., at the time the investment management affiliate of Duff & Phelps Corporation.
1995 - 2006[edit]
From 1995 to 2001, Virtus was a majority-owned indirect subsidiary of Phoenix Life Insurance Co. During this period, the company purchased a majority interest in several boutique investment management companies to establish its multi-manager business model. In addition to Duff & Phelps Investment Management, Virtus’ affiliated managers include Kayne Anderson Rudnick Investment Management, LLC, Newfleet Asset Management (formerly SCM Advisors, LLC, and previously Seneca Capital Management), and Zweig Advisers LLC, which was founded by legendary Wall Street investor Martin Zweig.
On January 11, 2001, a subsidiary of Phoenix acquired the outstanding shares of Phoenix Investment Partners not already owned, and the company became an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Phoenix.
In May 2005, Phoenix Investment Partners acquired the remaining minority interest in SCM Advisors and in September of that year acquired the remaining minority interest in Kayne Anderson Rudnick, thereby increasing ownership of both companies to 100%. In May 2006, Phoenix Investment Partners acquired the rights to advise, distribute and administer the Insight Funds from Harris Investment Management, Inc.
2006 - 2009[edit]
In February 2008, Phoenix announced it would spin-off Phoenix Investment Partners as an independent asset management company through a pro-rata dividend of Phoenix Investment Partners common stock to Phoenix's shareholders.[1] On October 30, 2008, Harris Bankcorp Inc., a US subsidiary of Bank of Montreal announced it would acquire $45 million in convertible preferred stock, representing a 23 percent equity position in Virtus.[2]
Virtus became an independent publicly traded company on December 31, 2008 upon completion of its spin-off from Phoenix. The first day of trading of VRTS was January 2, 2009, and company officials rang the opening bell at NASDAQ Market Site on January 5, 2009.[3]
Business Overview[edit]
Retail products (available to individual investors) include open-end mutual funds, closed-end funds and separately managed accounts. The Virtus Mutual Funds family consists of approximately 45 open-end mutual funds that are distributed primarily through intermediaries, including national and regional broker-dealers, independent broker-dealers and independent financial advisory firms. Virtus' five closed-end funds, which are provided by two affiliated managers, encompass utility and tactical asset allocation strategies. The closed-end funds trade on the New York Stock Exchange.
Retail separately managed accounts comprise intermediary programs, sponsored and distributed by unaffiliated brokerage firms, and private client accounts, which are offered to the high-net-worth clients of the affiliated managers.
Virtus also manages institutional accounts for corporations, multi-employer retirement funds, foundations, endowments, and special purpose funds.[4]
Principal Subsidiaries[edit]
Virtus operates a multi-manager asset management business, comprising a number of individual affiliated managers, each having its own distinct investment style, autonomous investment process and brand, and the services of unaffiliated subadvisers. Affiliated managers include:[5]

Cliffwater Investments LLC, located in Los Angeles and NYC, provides alternative advisory services to institutional investors including endowments, foundations, retirement systems and financial institutions. In 2015, it reportedly advised clients with $800 million to exit the Carlyle Group's Claren Road hedge fund.[6]
Duff & Phelps Investment Management Co., headquartered in Chicago, manages open- and closed-end funds and institutional separate accounts investing in global utilities, infrastructure and REITs. Institutional services are offered to corporations, municipalities, retirement and benefit plans, endowments, foundations and others.
Euclid Advisors LLC is a New York-based investment management affiliate of Virtus Investment Partners that manages both domestic and international equity portfolios.
Kayne Anderson Rudnick Investment Management, LLC of Los Angeles offers a variety of actively managed equity and fixed-income strategies to individuals through open end mutual funds and separately managed accounts primarily to high-net-worth individuals. Institutional clients include endowments, foundations, corporations, public funds, and pension plans.
Kleinwort Benson Investors International, Ltd. is an investment affiliate of Kleinwort Benson Investors (KBI), an established institutional asset manager headquartered in Dublin, Ireland. KBI International has been managing assets for institutional investors since 1980.
Newfleet Asset Management is a full-service, multi-capability fixed income firm that manages open-end funds, institutional accounts, structured products, and high-net-worth/private client assets. It manages assets in three distinctive strategies: Multi-Sector Fixed Income; Core Plus Fixed Income; and Specialty Fixed Income.
Rampart Investment Management, a Boston-based investment management affiliate of Virtus Investment Partners, manages client positions and portfolios using domestic and international index and equity options.
Zweig Advisers LLC is a registered investment advisor headquartered in New York that manages open- and closed-end funds in fundamental, small cap value, and tactical asset allocation investment styles. Its tactical asset allocation investment style, which seeks to participate in rising markets and limit losses during major declines, was modeled after the approach of Dr. Martin Zweig, author of Winning on Wall Street and a regular panelist on Louis Rukeyser's Wall Street.

Unaffiliated Subadvisers[edit]
Virtus supplements the investment capabilities of its affiliated managers through select unaffiliated subadvisers whose strategies are not available to retail mutual fund customers. These subadvisers include:[5]

History[edit]
Virtus Investment Partners, formerly known as Phoenix Investment Partners, Ltd., was formed on November 1, 1995 through a reverse merger with Duff & Phelps Investment Management Co., at the time the investment management affiliate of Duff & Phelps Corporation.
1995 - 2006[edit]
From 1995 to 2001, Virtus was a majority-owned indirect subsidiary of Phoenix Life Insurance Co. During this period, the company purchased a majority interest in several boutique investment management companies to establish its multi-manager business model. In addition to Duff & Phelps Investment Management, Virtus’ affiliated managers include Kayne Anderson Rudnick Investment Management, LLC, Newfleet Asset Management (formerly SCM Advisors, LLC, and previously Seneca Capital Management), and Zweig Advisers LLC, which was founded by legendary Wall Street investor Martin Zweig.
On January 11, 2001, a subsidiary of Phoenix acquired the outstanding shares of Phoenix Investment Partners not already owned, and the company became an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Phoenix.
In May 2005, Phoenix Investment Partners acquired the remaining minority interest in SCM Advisors and in September of that year acquired the remaining minority interest in Kayne Anderson Rudnick, thereby increasing ownership of both companies to 100%. In May 2006, Phoenix Investment Partners acquired the rights to advise, distribute and administer the Insight Funds from Harris Investment Management, Inc.
2006 - 2009[edit]
In February 2008, Phoenix announced it would spin-off Phoenix Investment Partners as an independent asset management company through a pro-rata dividend of Phoenix Investment Partners common stock to Phoenix's shareholders.[1] On October 30, 2008, Harris Bankcorp Inc., a US subsidiary of Bank of Montreal announced it would acquire $45 million in convertible preferred stock, representing a 23 percent equity position in Virtus.[2]
Virtus became an independent publicly traded company on December 31, 2008 upon completion of its spin-off from Phoenix. The first day of trading of VRTS was January 2, 2009, and company officials rang the opening bell at NASDAQ Market Site on January 5, 2009.[3]
Business Overview[edit]
Retail products (available to individual investors) include open-end mutual funds, closed-end funds and separately managed accounts. The Virtus Mutual Funds family consists of approximately 45 open-end mutual funds that are distributed primarily through intermediaries, including national and regional broker-dealers, independent broker-dealers and independent financial advisory firms. Virtus' five closed-end funds, which are provided by two affiliated managers, encompass utility and tactical asset allocation strategies. The closed-end funds trade on the New York Stock Exchange.
Retail separately managed accounts comprise intermediary programs, sponsored and distributed by unaffiliated brokerage firms, and private client accounts, which are offered to the high-net-worth clients of the affiliated managers.
Virtus also manages institutional accounts for corporations, multi-employer retirement funds, foundations, endowments, and special purpose funds.[4]
Principal Subsidiaries[edit]
Virtus operates a multi-manager asset management business, comprising a number of individual affiliated managers, each having its own distinct investment style, autonomous investment process and brand, and the services of unaffiliated subadvisers. Affiliated managers include:[5]

Cliffwater Investments LLC, located in Los Angeles and NYC, provides alternative advisory services to institutional investors including endowments, foundations, retirement systems and financial institutions. In 2015, it reportedly advised clients with $800 million to exit the Carlyle Group's Claren Road hedge fund.[6]
Duff & Phelps Investment Management Co., headquartered in Chicago, manages open- and closed-end funds and institutional separate accounts investing in global utilities, infrastructure and REITs. Institutional services are offered to corporations, municipalities, retirement and benefit plans, endowments, foundations and others.
Euclid Advisors LLC is a New York-based investment management affiliate of Virtus Investment Partners that manages both domestic and international equity portfolios.
Kayne Anderson Rudnick Investment Management, LLC of Los Angeles offers a variety of actively managed equity and fixed-income strategies to individuals through open end mutual funds and separately managed accounts primarily to high-net-worth individuals. Institutional clients include endowments, foundations, corporations, public funds, and pension plans.
Kleinwort Benson Investors International, Ltd. is an investment affiliate of Kleinwort Benson Investors (KBI), an established institutional asset manager headquartered in Dublin, Ireland. KBI International has been managing assets for institutional investors since 1980.
Newfleet Asset Management is a full-service, multi-capability fixed income firm that manages open-end funds, institutional accounts, structured products, and high-net-worth/private client assets. It manages assets in three distinctive strategies: Multi-Sector Fixed Income; Core Plus Fixed Income; and Specialty Fixed Income.
Rampart Investment Management, a Boston-based investment management affiliate of Virtus Investment Partners, manages client positions and portfolios using domestic and international index and equity options.
Zweig Advisers LLC is a registered investment advisor headquartered in New York that manages open- and closed-end funds in fundamental, small cap value, and tactical asset allocation investment styles. Its tactical asset allocation investment style, which seeks to participate in rising markets and limit losses during major declines, was modeled after the approach of Dr. Martin Zweig, author of Winning on Wall Street and a regular panelist on Louis Rukeyser's Wall Street.

Unaffiliated Subadvisers[edit]
Virtus supplements the investment capabilities of its affiliated managers through select unaffiliated subadvisers whose strategies are not available to retail mutual fund customers. These subadvisers include:[5]

Aberdeen Asset Management, Inc., is the wholly owned U.S. subsidiary of Aberdeen Asset Management PLC, a global investment management group formed in 1983 and headquartered in Scotland, U.K. With investment teams based in the markets or regions in which they invest, the firm manages assets for both institutions and private individuals from offices around the globe.
Horizon Asset Management LLC, a subsidiary of Horizon Kinetics LLC, is an independently owned and operated investment boutique formed by the 2011 merger of Horizon Asset Management, Inc. (founded in 1994) and Kinetics Asset Management, Inc. (founded in 1996) and its affiliates.
Sasco Capital, Inc., of Fairfield, CT, which specializes in contrarian/value equity investing using a disciplined approach that includes extensive fundamental analysis of business segments.
Thomas J. Herzfeld Advisors, Inc., is an investment management firm based in Miami, Florida, specializing in closed-end fund research, analysis, and investment since 1984.
Vontobel Asset Management, Inc. of New York, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Vontobel Holding AG of Switzerland that specializes in managing long-only global equity portfolios.

History[edit]
Virtus Investment Partners, formerly known as Phoenix Investment Partners, Ltd., was formed on November 1, 1995 through a reverse merger with Duff & Phelps Investment Management Co., at the time the investment management affiliate of Duff & Phelps Corporation.
1995 - 2006[edit]
From 1995 to 2001, Virtus was a majority-owned indirect subsidiary of Phoenix Life Insurance Co. During this period, the company purchased a majority interest in several boutique investment management companies to establish its multi-manager business model. In addition to Duff & Phelps Investment Management, Virtus’ affiliated managers include Kayne Anderson Rudnick Investment Management, LLC, Newfleet Asset Management (formerly SCM Advisors, LLC, and previously Seneca Capital Management), and Zweig Advisers LLC, which was founded by legendary Wall Street investor Martin Zweig.
On January 11, 2001, a subsidiary of Phoenix acquired the outstanding shares of Phoenix Investment Partners not already owned, and the company became an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Phoenix.
In May 2005, Phoenix Investment Partners acquired the remaining minority interest in SCM Advisors and in September of that year acquired the remaining minority interest in Kayne Anderson Rudnick, thereby increasing ownership of both companies to 100%. In May 2006, Phoenix Investment Partners acquired the rights to advise, distribute and administer the Insight Funds from Harris Investment Management, Inc.
2006 - 2009[edit]
In February 2008, Phoenix announced it would spin-off Phoenix Investment Partners as an independent asset management company through a pro-rata dividend of Phoenix Investment Partners common stock to Phoenix's shareholders.[1] On October 30, 2008, Harris Bankcorp Inc., a US subsidiary of Bank of Montreal announced it would acquire $45 million in convertible preferred stock, representing a 23 percent equity position in Virtus.[2]
Virtus became an independent publicly traded company on December 31, 2008 upon completion of its spin-off from Phoenix. The first day of trading of VRTS was January 2, 2009, and company officials rang the opening bell at NASDAQ Market Site on January 5, 2009.[3]
Business Overview[edit]
Retail products (available to individual investors) include open-end mutual funds, closed-end funds and separately managed accounts. The Virtus Mutual Funds family consists of approximately 45 open-end mutual funds that are distributed primarily through intermediaries, including national and regional broker-dealers, independent broker-dealers and independent financial advisory firms. Virtus' five closed-end funds, which are provided by two affiliated managers, encompass utility and tactical asset allocation strategies. The closed-end funds trade on the New York Stock Exchange.
Retail separately managed accounts comprise intermediary programs, sponsored and distributed by unaffiliated brokerage firms, and private client accounts, which are offered to the high-net-worth clients of the affiliated managers.
Virtus also manages institutional accounts for corporations, multi-employer retirement funds, foundations, endowments, and special purpose funds.[4]
Principal Subsidiaries[edit]
Virtus operates a multi-manager asset management business, comprising a number of individual affiliated managers, each having its own distinct investment style, autonomous investment process and brand, and the services of unaffiliated subadvisers. Affiliated managers include:[5]

Cliffwater Investments LLC, located in Los Angeles and NYC, provides alternative advisory services to institutional investors including endowments, foundations, retirement systems and financial institutions. In 2015, it reportedly advised clients with $800 million to exit the Carlyle Group's Claren Road hedge fund.[6]
Duff & Phelps Investment Management Co., headquartered in Chicago, manages open- and closed-end funds and institutional separate accounts investing in global utilities, infrastructure and REITs. Institutional services are offered to corporations, municipalities, retirement and benefit plans, endowments, foundations and others.
Euclid Advisors LLC is a New York-based investment management affiliate of Virtus Investment Partners that manages both domestic and international equity portfolios.
Kayne Anderson Rudnick Investment Management, LLC of Los Angeles offers a variety of actively managed equity and fixed-income strategies to individuals through open end mutual funds and separately managed accounts primarily to high-net-worth individuals. Institutional clients include endowments, foundations, corporations, public funds, and pension plans.
Kleinwort Benson Investors International, Ltd. is an investment affiliate of Kleinwort Benson Investors (KBI), an established institutional asset manager headquartered in Dublin, Ireland. KBI International has been managing assets for institutional investors since 1980.
Newfleet Asset Management is a full-service, multi-capability fixed income firm that manages open-end funds, institutional accounts, structured products, and high-net-worth/private client assets. It manages assets in three distinctive strategies: Multi-Sector Fixed Income; Core Plus Fixed Income; and Specialty Fixed Income.
Rampart Investment Management, a Boston-based investment management affiliate of Virtus Investment Partners, manages client positions and portfolios using domestic and international index and equity options.
Zweig Advisers LLC is a registered investment advisor headquartered in New York that manages open- and closed-end funds in fundamental, small cap value, and tactical asset allocation investment styles. Its tactical asset allocation investment style, which seeks to participate in rising markets and limit losses during major declines, was modeled after the approach of Dr. Martin Zweig, author of Winning on Wall Street and a regular panelist on Louis Rukeyser's Wall Street.

Unaffiliated Subadvisers[edit]
Virtus supplements the investment capabilities of its affiliated managers through select unaffiliated subadvisers whose strategies are not available to retail mutual fund customers. These subadvisers include:[5]

Aberdeen Asset Management, Inc., is the wholly owned U.S. subsidiary of Aberdeen Asset Management PLC, a global investment management group formed in 1983 and headquartered in Scotland, U.K. With investment teams based in the markets or regions in which they invest, the firm manages assets for both institutions and private individuals from offices around the globe.
Horizon Asset Management LLC, a subsidiary of Horizon Kinetics LLC, is an independently owned and operated investment boutique formed by the 2011 merger of Horizon Asset Management, Inc. (founded in 1994) and Kinetics Asset Management, Inc. (founded in 1996) and its affiliates.
Sasco Capital, Inc., of Fairfield, CT, which specializes in contrarian/value equity investing using a disciplined approach that includes extensive fundamental analysis of business segments.
Thomas J. Herzfeld Advisors, Inc., is an investment management firm based in Miami, Florida, specializing in closed-end fund research, analysis, and investment since 1984.
Vontobel Asset Management, Inc. of New York, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Vontobel Holding AG of Switzerland that specializes in managing long-only global equity portfolios.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
