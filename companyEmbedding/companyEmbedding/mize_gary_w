      Agribusiness Expert, Gary W. Mize, Joins Gevo’s Board of Directors
    





September 15, 2011 10:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time



ENGLEWOOD, Colo.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Further rounding out the experience base of its board of directors, 
      Gevo, Inc. (NASDAQ: GEVO), a renewable chemicals and advanced biofuels 
      company, has appointed Gary W. Mize, partner and owner at MR & 
      Associates, as a director. With over 35 years of experience in 
      agribusiness, Mize brings a critical expertise in commodities and 
      trading.
    


      “Gevo’s vision of a biobased economy seeks to connect the agricultural 
      supply chain to the refining and petrochemical supply chain using a 
      drop-in biofuel/biochemical building block,” said Patrick Gruber, Ph.D., 
      chief executive officer of Gevo. “Gary has been in senior executive 
      positions at Cargill, ConAgra, Nobel, and Ceres AG, where he has been 
      responsible for businesses that trade and process agricultural 
      commodities. This experience, along with Gary’s insights and expertise 
      in agricultural commodities, trading and agricultural inputs, will be a 
      valuable addition to our board and our world class team.”
    

      Prior to his current position at MR & Associates, which he’s held since 
      2010, Mize was president of Rawhide Energy LLC, an ethanol company, and 
      served as non-executive chairman at Ceres Global AG, a Canadian public 
      company that serves as a vehicle for agribusiness investments. He also 
      has served as the chief operating officer and executive director of 
      Noble Group, Hong Kong, was president of the Grain Processing Group at 
      ConAgra Foods, Inc., president and CEO of ConAgra Malt and held various 
      positions at Cargill, Inc.
