            NewSouth Communications Receives $62.5 Million In Equity Financing

            3/5/2003
        
Greenville, SC - March 5, 2003 - - NewSouth Communications, an Integrated Communications Provider (ICP) serving thousands of business customers across the South, today announced that it has received $62.5 million in equity financing. Firms participating in this round of financing include three existing investors, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company (KKR), who remains NewSouth's largest investor, Wachovia Capital Partners, and Vaxa Capital Partners, LP. Also participating are two new investors, M/C Venture Partners and Quadrangle Group LLC. This investment will be used to fund the continued growth of the business, and fully funds NewSouth to profitability.This equity investment follows NewSouth's announcement last month of excellent 2002 financial and operational results, marked by a 25 percent increase in total revenue to $156 million, a 31 percent increase in the number of lines installed, and a 9 percent reduction in SG&A expense. Operating cash flow in 2002 exceeded the company's plan by $17 million."NewSouth is now generating positive operating cash flow each month, and this investment will provide substantial opportunities for accelerated growth and profitability in the future. The demand for our data, voice, and bundled products is growing, and we are further penetrating each of our markets in the Southeast. The support from our existing investors, combined with participation from two additional exceptional private equity groups in M/C and Quadrangle, absolutely positions NewSouth as a leader in the communications space," commented Jim Akerhielm, President & CEO of NewSouth Communications."Today, NewSouth is well capitalized to build on its solid foundation and proven track record in delivering communications solutions to medium to large business customers. In differentiating itself from other providers through disciplined, controlled growth and spending, NewSouth has clearly shown the strength of its strategy. KKR looks forward to continuing to work with Jim Akerhielm and his team to drive NewSouth's growth and success over the long term. We are very enthusiastic about NewSouth's future and being an active player in the company's success," stated James H. Greene, Jr., Member of KKR LLC, the general partner of KKR, and a director of NewSouth."M/C was attracted to NewSouth for a wide variety of reasons. The quality of NewSouth's customer base, almost exclusively medium and large business customers, combined with the proven expertise of the management team, made this deal a very good fit for M/C. We are looking forward to working with the NewSouth team and seeing very strong financial results going forward," commented James F. Wade, Managing Partner with M/C Venture Partners and a new director of NewSouth.Joshua L. Steiner, Managing Principal of Quadrangle and a new director of NewSouth, said, "We're delighted to partner with Jim Akerhielm and the entire NewSouth team. By focusing on superior customer service and network reliability, Jim and his team have built a sustainable telecommunications company with tremendous growth prospects. We look forward to contributing to NewSouth's continued success."The Board of Directors at NewSouth Communications will expand to a 12-member body as a result of the investment. KKR, Wachovia Capital Partners, M/C Venture Partners, and Quadrangle Group will be allocated two seats each; one seat is for Jim Akerhielm, President & CEO of NewSouth; and the remaining three seats will be filled by independent directors, including R. Clint Johnstone, who will continue to serve as Chairman of the Board, Leighton Cubbage, and John Fujii. Wachovia Capital Partners made its initial investment in NewSouth Communications in 1998, while both KKR and Vaxa Capital Partners participated for the first time in July 2000. "Wachovia Capital Partners is excited to remain closely involved with the pre-eminent communications provider in the Southeast. NewSouth has grown successfully in a difficult economic environment. The completion of this financing is a very strong endorsement of NewSouth's excellent management team," added Scott B. Perper, Managing Partner of Wachovia Capital Partners and a director of NewSouth.NewSouth Communications was advised in this transaction by Sonenshine Pastor and King & Spalding LLP. Other terms of the agreement were not disclosed.
