Corporate history[edit]
Protalix BioTherapeutics was established in 1993.[3] It was founded by Yoseph Shaaltiel, who received his Ph.D. in Plant Biochemistry from the Weizmann Institute in Israel and served in the Biology Department of the Israel Defense Forces' Biological and Chemical Center.[4] One of the earliest and largest investors in the company was Phillip Frost.[5] Protalix has two Nobel Prize winners (Chemistry) in it's Scientific Advisory Board. Roger Kornberg Ph.D and Prof. MD. Aaron Ciechanover
In its early days Protalix operated out of a warehouse in the town of Qiryat Shemona in northern Israel.[6] On July 19, 2005, Protalix Biotherapeutics announced the closing of a $5.3 million private placement of its series C preferred stock.[7] Protalix entered into a partnership agreement with Teva Pharmaceutical Industries in 2006 for the development of two proteins[8] and in 2009 signed a collaboration agreement with Pfizer for the development and commercialization of its taliglucerase alfa treatment.[9] Also in 2009, Protalix reported that Frost & Sullivan presented the company with its 2009 European Orphan Diseases Market Product Innovation of the Year Award.[10] In 2011 Protalix announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had approved the company's manufacturing facility in Karmiel.[11]
Protalix initially became a public company through a reverse merger process with Orthodontix, a company which was at the time traded "over the counter" on the NASDAQ.[12] This merger was completed on December 31, 2006, and is notable as one of the largest reverse mergers executed, valuing the joint entity at almost $1 billion.[13] It subsequently applied for a listing on the AMEX, and sold 10 million shares in a public offering.
Products[edit]
Protalix has been using cultured plant cells to manufacture biopharmaceuticals. As of 2017, Protalix has one FDA approved product sold by Pfizer in the U.S. and currently developing four products:

Taliglucerase alfa (Elelyso) – a recombinant glucocerebrosidase enzyme produced from transgenic carrot cell cultures.[14] Known also as Elelyso, taliglucerase won approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in May 2012 as an orphan drug for the treatment of Type 1 Gaucher's disease.[15] Protalix has licensed global development and commercialization rights for Elelyso to Pfizer, except for Brazil, where Protalix retains full rights. Brazil has the third largest number of Gaucher patients identified worldwide, after the U.S. and Israel.[16] The Brazilian National Health Surveillance Agency, known as ANVISA, granted regulatory approval for Elelyso (Uplyso) to treat adults with Gaucher disease in March 2013, and extended that approval to children in December 2016.
Alidornase alfa (PRX-110) – proprietary plant cell-expressed recombinant form of human deoxyribonuclease I (DNase I), that Protalix has designed, through chemical modification, to be resistant to inhibition by actin. DNase I is part of current Cystic Fibrosis therapy, intended to reduce sputum viscosity that accumulates in the lungs of Cystic Fibrosis patients, which exposes patients to recurrent infections and compromises lung function.[17] AIR DNase (alidornase alfa), developed to make mucus in the lungs of cystic fibrosis patients less sticky, showed remarkably good results in 2017.[18] Alidornasa alfa is being developed to treat all cystic fibrosis patients and expected to replace Pulmozyme® in 2020.
Pegunigalsidase alfa (PRX-102) – plant cell culture expressed and a chemically modified version of the recombinant alpha-Galactosidase-A protein. Protein sub-units are covalently bound via chemical cross-linking using PEG chains, resulting in a more active and stable molecule than the current available versions. Protalix is currently conducting Phase 3 clincial trial for PRX-102 for the treatment of Fabry Disease following a successful meeting with U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Protalix announced positive results from its clicnical trial for PRX-102.[19] Pegunigalsidase alfa is being developed to replace Fabrazyme and interim data shows potential superiority in efficacy.[20]
OPRX-106 – plant cell-expressed recombinant human tumor necrosis factor receptor II fused to an IgG1 Fc domain (TNFRII-Fc), in development for oral administration. If successful, OPRX-106 will be the first ever oral enzyme treatment as currently there are no other oral enzyme treatments available.
PRX-105 – a recombinant human Acetylcholinesterase, produced from genetically modified cell line of tobacco cells (Nicotiana tabacum),[21] which can be used as a counter-measure against nerve agents attack. PRX-105 completed exploratory Phase I clinical trails.[22]

Corporate history[edit]
Protalix BioTherapeutics was established in 1993.[3] It was founded by Yoseph Shaaltiel, who received his Ph.D. in Plant Biochemistry from the Weizmann Institute in Israel and served in the Biology Department of the Israel Defense Forces' Biological and Chemical Center.[4] One of the earliest and largest investors in the company was Phillip Frost.[5] Protalix has two Nobel Prize winners (Chemistry) in it's Scientific Advisory Board. Roger Kornberg Ph.D and Prof. MD. Aaron Ciechanover
In its early days Protalix operated out of a warehouse in the town of Qiryat Shemona in northern Israel.[6] On July 19, 2005, Protalix Biotherapeutics announced the closing of a $5.3 million private placement of its series C preferred stock.[7] Protalix entered into a partnership agreement with Teva Pharmaceutical Industries in 2006 for the development of two proteins[8] and in 2009 signed a collaboration agreement with Pfizer for the development and commercialization of its taliglucerase alfa treatment.[9] Also in 2009, Protalix reported that Frost & Sullivan presented the company with its 2009 European Orphan Diseases Market Product Innovation of the Year Award.[10] In 2011 Protalix announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had approved the company's manufacturing facility in Karmiel.[11]
Protalix initially became a public company through a reverse merger process with Orthodontix, a company which was at the time traded "over the counter" on the NASDAQ.[12] This merger was completed on December 31, 2006, and is notable as one of the largest reverse mergers executed, valuing the joint entity at almost $1 billion.[13] It subsequently applied for a listing on the AMEX, and sold 10 million shares in a public offering.
Products[edit]
Protalix has been using cultured plant cells to manufacture biopharmaceuticals. As of 2017, Protalix has one FDA approved product sold by Pfizer in the U.S. and currently developing four products:

Protalix BioTherapeutics Announces FDA Approval To Operate Its Current Facility as A Multi-Product Facility






GlobeNewswire



Jun 1, 2017 7:30 AM EDT













 


















































 CARMIEL, Israel, June 01, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Protalix BioTherapeutics, Inc. (NYSE MKT:PLX) (TASE:PLX), announced today that a Supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has been approved by the FDA.  Approval of the sNDA allows the Company to convert its manufacturing facility in Carmiel, Israel, from a single dedicated product facility to a multi-product facility. The facility's current capacity can serve all of the Company's current and expected commercial and clinical needs.  The Company believes that conversion of the facility to a multi-product facility will serve the Company's production needs for the anticipated commercialization of pegunigalsidase alfa (PRX-102) for the treatment of Fabry disease together with the current and expected significant increase in the manufacturing of taliglucerase alfa, mainly due to the increased activities in Brazil.  The Company expects that the conversion will allow the Company to realize potentially significant operational savings as it progresses towards the anticipated commercialization of pegunigalsidase alfa. "We have been producing drug substance for our clinical trials of pegunigalsidase alfa in our facility and have already upgraded our manufacturing facility to become a multi-product facility to support the potential manufacturing of both pegunigalsidase alfa and taliglucerase alfa in a commercial scale," said Moshe Manor, Protalix's President and Chief Executive Officer.  "Given the unique aspects of our ProCellEx® protein expression system, the conversion of the facilities did not entail substantial additional capital expenditures and will allow us to use our capital resources more efficiently in the commercial production of pegunigalsidase alfa, if approved.  We are excited to have reached this milestone in our progression towards the commercialization of pegunigalsidase alfa alongside the expected increase in activities in Brazil."  About Protalix BioTherapeutics, Inc. Protalix is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of recombinant therapeutic proteins expressed through its proprietary plant cell-based expression system, ProCellEx®.  Protalix's unique expression system presents a proprietary method for developing recombinant proteins in a cost-effective, industrial-scale manner. Protalix's first product manufactured by ProCellEx, taliglucerase alfa, was approved for marketing by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in May 2012 and, subsequently, by the regulatory authorities of other countries. Protalix has licensed to Pfizer Inc. the worldwide development and commercialization rights for taliglucerase alfa, excluding Brazil, where Protalix retains full rights.  Protalix's development pipeline includes the following product candidates: pegunigalsidase alfa (PRX-102), a modified version of the recombinant human alpha-GAL-A protein for the treatment of Fabry disease; PRX-106, an orally delivered anti-inflammatory treatment; alidornase alfa (PRX-110), a chemically modified DNase I for the treatment of Cystic Fibrosis; and others.

Protalix BioTherapeutics, Inc. Announces Phase II Clinical Trial Results for Alidornase Alfa in Cystic Fibrosis
Jun 7 17
Protalix BioTherapeutics, Inc. announced that phase II trial results, including new clinical data, for alidornase alfa (PRX-110) for the treatment of Cystic Fibrosis (CF) will be the subject of an oral presentation at the 40th European Cystic Fibrosis Society Conference in Seville, Spain.  Alidornase alfa is a plant cell-expressed, chemically-modified recombinant DNase I enzyme resistant to inhibition by actin, which the Company has specifically designed to enhance the enzyme’s efficacy in CF patients. The phase II trial is a 28-day switchover study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of alidornase alfa in CF patients previously treated with Pulmozyme (currently the only commercially available DNase I therapy for CF).  Participation in the trial was preceded by a two-week washout period from Pulmozyme before treatment with alidornase alfa via inhalation.  Sixteen patients were enrolled in the study, all of whom completed the trial. In accordance with the trial design, each participating patient was tested at three major time-points during the study for percent predicted forced expiratory volume in one second, or ppFEV1, a key efficacy measure.  The first ppFEV1 test was performed at screening, when the patient was still being treated with Pulmozyme®.  The second ppFEV1 test was performed after the patient underwent a two-week washout period from Pulmozyme® but before first inhalation with alidornase alfa – the baseline – and the third ppFEV1 test was performed at the end of the 28-day study after the patient underwent daily inhalation treatments of alidornase alfa. Final analysis of the data demonstrated a mean absolute increase in ppFEV1 of 3.4 points from baseline, and an increase in ppFEV1 of 3.3 points, when compared to measurements taken from patients at enrollment before the switch from Pulmozyme® to alidornase alfa. In addition to the ppFEV1 measurements taken during the study, an additional ppFEV1 measurement was taken two weeks after patients stopped treatment with alidornase alfa.  For this measurement point, a mean decrease in ppFEV1 of -2.7 points was observed from the last alidornase alfa inhalation, while patients taken off Pulmozyme® at the beginning of the trial for two weeks experienced a mean decrease in ppFEV1 of only 0.06 points for the same off treatment duration.


Protalix Bio Therapeutics Announces FDA Approval to Operate Current Facility as Multi-Product Facility
Jun 1 17
Protalix BioTherapeutics, Inc. announced that a Supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has been approved by the FDA. Approval of the sNDA allows the Company to convert its manufacturing facility in Carmiel, Israel, from a single dedicated product facility to a multi-product facility. The facility’s current capacity can serve all of the Company’s current and expected commercial and clinical needs. The company believes that conversion of the facility to a multi-product facility will serve the company’s production needs for the anticipated commercialization of pegunigalsidase alfa (PRX-102) for the treatment of Fabry disease together with the current and expected significant increase in the manufacturing of taliglucerase alfa, mainly due to the increased activities in Brazil. The company expects that the conversion will allow the Company to realize potentially significant operational savings as it progresses towards the anticipated commercialization of pegunigalsidase alfa.

Its principal product candidate, prGCD, is a proprietary plant cell expressed recombinant Glucocerebrosidase enzyme-based protein for the treatment of Gaucher Disease. The company is also developing PRX-102, a proprietary alpha Galactosidase enzyme for the treatment of Fabry disease, a genetic lysosomal storage disorder in humans, the symptoms of which involve the accumulation of lipids in the cells of the kidneys, heart, and other organs; and PRX-111, a human fertility hormone targeted at the infertility market. In addition, it is developing a proprietary plant-based acetylcholinestrase and its molecular variants for use in various therapeutic and prophylactic indications, including a Biodefense program; and an oral platform for delivering active recombinant proteins systematically through enteral administration through the oral administration of transgenic plant cells. Protalix BioTherapeutics has strategic collaboration with Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Ltd. for the development and manufacturing of two proteins using the company's plant cell expression system; and Yeda Research and Development Company Limited to design Glucocerebrosidase for the treatment of Gaucher Disease, as well as a licensing agreement with Icon Genetics AG to license Icon's amplification technology for utilization in the expression of its products. The company was founded in 1993 and is based in Carmiel, Israel.    Proprietary Protein Therapeutics with Clinically Improved Profiles Protalix is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development, production and commercialization of recombinant therapeutic proteins produced by our proprietary ProCellEx® plant cell-based protein expression system. Our pipeline consists of proprietary, potentially clinically superior versions of recombinant therapeutic proteins that target established pharmaceutical markets.     Track record of success Protalix was founded by Dr. Yoseph Shaaltiel and began as a greenhouse company in Israel’s northern town of Kiryat Shmona, in 1993. The first manufacturing facility was constructed in May 2004 in Carmiel in the Western Galilee, which was later expanded and upgraded at the end of 2009 in preparation for the commercial production of Elelyso® and production of pipeline candidates for clinical trials. We maintain the highest global quality of product and quality assurance standards. Our cGMP manufacturing facility has been successfully inspected and audited by multiple regulatory agencies including the US FDA, EMA, Australian TGA, Brazilian ANVISA, and the Israeli Ministry of Health. Protalix is proud to be the first company to gain FDA approval for a plant cell culture expressed protein. Elelyso® (taliglucerase alfa for injection) is Protalix’s first drug product produced by its proprietary ProCellEx® protein expression system, and was approved for marketing by the FDA in May 2012, followed soon after by approval by ANVISA in Brazil, Israel’s Ministry of Health, and other regulatory authorities around the world. For more information about Elelyso®, please visit  http://www.elelyso.com Protalix’s ProCellEx® platform has the ability to manufacture complex proteins, antibodies, and vaccines and has the ability to orally deliver certain therapeutic proteins as demonstrated in animal models.  Elelyso® for Gaucher Disease   ABOUT GAUCHER DISEASE Gaucher disease, also known as glucocerebrosidase deficiency, is an autosomal recessive disorder and the most prevalent Lysosomal Storage Disorder (LSD) in the world. It is one of a group of disorders that affect specific enzymes that normally break down materials for reuse in the cells. If the enzymes are missing or do not work properly, the materials can build up and become toxic. Gaucher disease occurs when a lipid called glucosylceramide accumulates in the bone marrow, lungs, spleen, liver, and sometimes the brain. It is present in approximately 1 in 20,000 live births. Gaucher disease symptoms can include fatigue, anemia, easy bruising and bleeding, severe bone pain and easily broken bones, and distended stomach due to an enlarged spleen and thrombocytopenia. The gold standard of care for Gaucher disease is enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). Enzyme replacement therapy is a medical treatment in which recombinant enzymes are injected into patients in whom the enzyme is lacking or dysfunctional. For Gaucher disease, recombinant glucocerebrosidase (GCD) is injected to replace the mutated or deficient natural GCD enzyme. ERT treatment may help people live normal lives.   ABOUT ELELYSO®/UPLYSO™ On May 1, 2012, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved taliglucerase alfa for injection, as an enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) for the long-term treatment of adult patients with a confirmed diagnosis of type 1 Gaucher disease. Taliglucerase alfa is a proprietary, recombinant form of glucocerebrosidase (GCD) is the company’s first approved drug product developed using ProCellEx®. Taliglucerase alfa was also approved by the Israeli Ministry of Health in September 2012, by the Brazilian Ministry of Health in March 2013, and by the applicable regulatory authorities of certain other countries. Taliglucerase alfa is the first plant cell-based recombinant therapeutic protein approved by the FDA or any other major regulatory authority. In 2009 Protalix entered into a collaboration agreement with Pfizer Inc. for the continued development and commercialization of Elelyso®. In October 2015, this agreement was amended providing Pfizer worldwide marketing rights for Elelyso® , marketed in Latin America under the name Uplyso™) with exception of Brazil. In Brazil, taliglucerase alfa is sold under the brand name Bio-Manguinhos alfataliglicerase under a special supply and technology transfer agreement with Fundação Oswaldo Cruz.         Moving forward: Leveraging the benefits of our platform technology   We will continue to leverage multiple unique advantages of the proprietary plant cell culture expression technology platform:  We have internal capabilities to improve biologic dynamics (e.g., glycosylation, half-life extension) of a protein and have been successful in leveraging these capabilities in the current pipeline. 	We can develop and commercialize recombinant proteins without infringing upon the method-based patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties 	Our platform has the ability to express certain proteins that are difficult to express in other systems. 	Our system enjoys a lower cost of scale-up (CapEx) and production. 	Through our system we have the ability to more rapidly develop a protein for clinical testing versus other protein platforms.

Our multidisciplinary scientific teams are focused on modifying biological properties of biotherapeutics aimed at improving clinical outcomes of therapies in areas of unmet need. These capabilities are well demonstrated in Protalix’s current pipeline.   A Proven Alternative to Mammalian Cell-Based Production Technology Our platform is a proven alternative to the mammalian cell-based production technology (the most common form of recombinant protein production), overcoming many of its weaknesses while offering significant production, regulatory, and cost benefits.  As opposed to mammalian cells, plant cells tolerate a relatively wide range of culturing conditions and naturally do not carry the risk of infection by human or animal pathogens. This translates into lower capital investment in the set up as well as in ongoing maintenance of the production plant. 	Plant cells provide a natural barrier to human and animal pathogens and are able to utilize a simple culture medium with no requirement to any animal originated supplements. This may prove to be important advantage from a regulatory perspective. 	Protalix’s ProCellEx® platform uses flexible polyethylene disposable bioreactors designed and optimized for plant cell cultures. As opposed to the large stainless steel reactors commonly used for recombinant protein production, the ProCellEx® bioreactors are easy to use, entail low initial capital investment, and can be scalable cost-effectively. Additionally, they require relatively low hands-on maintenance between cycles. 	ProCellEx® can potentially express certain proteins that are difficult to express in other systems. 	Through the ProCellEx® system, it is possible in certain cases to develop and commercialize recombinant proteins without infringing upon the method-based patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties. 	Additionally, the ProCellEx® platform has the ability to more rapidly develop clinical material for testing versus other protein platforms.       Development of transgenic cell lines for production of target protein       Orally Delivered Proteins   A solution for oral delivery of proteins has been a long sought-after aspiration of the biopharmaceutical industry. Orally delivered proteins provide more convenient drug administration than some of the current delivery options for proteins, which include intravenous infusions and intra-muscular and subcutaneous injections. An oral delivery solution is expected to result in better patient compliance along with increased quality of life. To date, efforts have been met with very limited success due to the inability of proteins to survive the gastric environment of the digestive tract and to act only in the intestine. There is a need for a safe, non-invasive method for continuous delivery of protein therapeutics. Oral delivery of protein therapies produced through the ProCellEx® platform can be made possible due to the unique cellulose wall of plant cells that makes them resistant to degradation when passing through the digestive tract. The plant cell can serve as a natural vehicle for oral administration. OPRX-106 is an oral anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor (anti-TNF) candidate, currently in a phase II  clinical trial for inflammatory bowel diseases.     From Concept to Market   We offer the following significant opportunities for the biopharmaceutical industry:  Broad range of expression capabilities. ProCellEx® is able to produce a broad array of complex glycosylated proteins, some of which are difficult to produce in mammalian, bacterial and  and yeast cell-based systems. 	Significantly lower capital and production costs. 	Rapid scalable manufacturing based on requirements. Elimination of risk of mammalian viral transmission or infection. 	Biologic Optimization: ProCellEx® has internal capabilities developed to improve the biologic dynamics of an expressed protein, and thus to develop modified therapeutic proteins with potentially superior clinical profiles. 	Opportunities to penetrate patent-protected markets. 	Potential ability to administer active therapeutic enzymes orally. 	In-house capabilities for clinical development and regulatory affairs.

All of our pipeline candidates are proteins expressed via our proprietary ProCellEx® system. We are advancing clinical programs addressing Fabry disease, cystic fibrosis, and immune and inflammatory diseases. In addition, Protalix is conducting initial research to evaluate additional programs for developing proprietary proteins with improved clinical profiles exploiting the unique nature of plant cell expression.   Pipeline Overview   Pegunigalsidase alfa (PRX-102) for the treatment of Fabry Disease    About Fabry Disease Fabry disease is an X-linked inherited disease that results from abnormal deposits of a fatty substance called globotriaosylceramide in blood vessel walls throughout the body. It occurs in one person per 40,000. Patients with Fabry disease inherit a deficiency of the enzyme alpha-galactosidase-A, which is normally responsible for the breakdown of globotriaosylceramide. The abnormal storage of globotriaosylceramide increases with time and so it accumulates, primarily in the blood and in the blood vessel walls. The channels of blood vessels narrow, leading to decreased blood flow and decreased tissue nourishment. The ultimate consequences of globotriaosylceramide deposition range from episodes of pain and impaired peripheral sensation to end-organ failure—particularly of the kidneys, but also of the heart and cerebrovascular system. Fabry Disease is generally treated by enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), meaning replacing the missing alpha-Galactosidase-A enzyme with a recombinant protein via intravenous infusion once every two weeks.     About Pegunigalsidase alfa Pegunigalsidase alfa is a plant cell culture expressed and a chemically modified version of the recombinant alpha-Galactosidase-A protein. Protein sub-units are covalently bound via chemical cross-linking using PEG chains, resulting in a more active and stable molecule than the current available versions. PRX 102 demonstrated enhanced circulatory half-life, with higher enzyme activity in target organs affected by Fabry disease. Protalix believes that this may potentially lead to a better clinical efficacy and an improved safety profile compared to currently available treatments. See the latest presentation     Clinical data from Phase I/II Study         14 days of active enzyme In clinical trials, pegunigalsidase alfa has been shown to be active in the plasma for the entire two weeks between infusions This level of enzyme activity in the blood is substantially higher than that of currently available enzyme replacement therapies.      Circulatory Half-Life Pegunigalsidase alfa has demonstrated a half-life of approximately 80 hours. It is a more stable molecule with a significantly longer circulatory half-life than the currently marketed enzyme replacement therapies.      Positive Impact on Kidney Function Results of the Phase I/II study  with pegunigalsidase alfa showed a stability in eGFR levels of the patients from baseline (BL) through 6 months and 12 months of treatment with the drug. eGFR (estimated glomerular filtration rate) measures level of kidney function and determines stage of kidney disease and function. Consistent eGFR levels means that the kidney function does not deteriorate. *Germaine et al; 2015      Favorable safety and tolerability Throughout the Phase I/II trial 417 infusions of pegunigalsidase alfa were administered. This  amounts to approximately 16 patient years. Pegunigalsidase alfa was found to be  well tolerated, with 98% of events being mild and moderate Pegunigalsidase alfa demonstrated lower immunogenicity: Only three patients (19%) tested positive for treatment-induced anti-drug antibodies. Lower immunogenicity means that the drug provokes a lower immune response. As such, patients may potentially experience less side effects *Fabrazyme prescribing information      POSITIVE IMPACT ON Cardiac FUNCTION Results of the Phase I/II study with pegunigalsidase alfa showed stability in key parameters relating to cardiac function.      MEANINGFUL REDUCTION IN Pain Results of the Phase I/II study showed that patients experienced less pain while being treated with pegunigalsidase alfa.      Pivotal Studies In 2016, we have commenced two pivotal trials to support registration of pegunigalsidase alfa. The BALANCE Study is a randomized, double blind, active control study of pegunigalsidase alfa (PRX-102) compared to Fabrazyme® in Fabry patients previously treated with Fabrazyme®. The objective of the study is to demonstrate superiority of pegunigalsidase alfa (PRX-102) in renal function by comparison of the eGFR slope (mean annualized change) between treatment groups.  The BRIDGE study is an open label, single arm switch-over study to assess the efficacy and safety of pegunigalsidase alfa (PRX-102) in Fabry patients currently treated with Replagal®.      Alidornase alfa (PRX-110) for the Treatment of Cystic Fibrosis   About Cystic Fibrosis  Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a life-threatening genetic disease affecting the lungs and digestive system. An estimated 70,000 children and adults worldwide have CF. In patients with CF, a defective gene and its protein product cause the body to produce unusually thick, sticky mucus that clogs the lungs. This may lead to lung damage, high exposure to lung infections and loss of respiratory function. Additionally the thickened mucus obstructs the pancreas and stops natural enzymes from helping the body break down food and absorb vital nutrients. Current therapies include multiple daily physiotherapy sessions to improve breathing, various drug therapies, as well as acute and preventive antibiotic therapy. Despite progress in understanding and treating CF, it remains a challenge to significantly improve quality of life and prolong life.     PRX-110 (alidornase alfa) Alidornase alfa (PRX-110) is a proprietary plant cell-expressed recombinant form of human deoxyribonuclease I (DNase I), that Protalix has designed, through chemical modification, to be resistant to inhibition by actin. DNase I is part of current CF therapy, intended to reduce sputum viscosity that accumulates in the lungs of CF patients, which exposes patients to recurrent infections and compromises lung function. The current therapy is known as Pulmozyme® (dornase alfa). Given actin is a potent inhibitor of DNase I activity, Protalix’s alidornase alfa (PRX-110) has the potential to enhance the enzyme’s efficacy significantly in CF patients when compared to the currently approved DNase treatment (Pulmozyme®). However, DNase I activity is compromised by actin, a globular multi-functional protein, found in high concentration in CF patients’ sputum, which is a potent inhibitor of DNase I. Actin may decrease the enzyme’s DNA degradation activity and potentially interfere with the effectiveness of inhaled DNase I in the lungs of CF patients. In order to reduce the actin-DNase I interaction and the subsequent inhibition of DNase I activity by actin, Protalix developed alidornase alfa by chemically modifying the enzyme forming an Actin Inhibition Resistant DNase I. This novel treatment may result in an improved lung function and decreased incidence of recurrent infections in patients. Inhaled alidornase alfa (PRX-110) was found safe in healthy volunteers. Protalix has begun a phase IIa trial of alidornase alfa (PRX-110) in CF patients, following which Protalix intends to actively seek collaboration with strategic partners for further development.     PRX-110 Clinical Data We have completed a phase I trial with 18 healthy volunteers. alidornase alfa (PRX-110) was found to be safe and tolerable. In July 2016, the first patient was dosed in Protalix’s phase IIa clinical trial of alidornase alfa (PRX-110).  In January 2017, Protalix announced positive interim results from the phase II clinical trial for the first 13 CF patients enrolled in the study. At that time, 15 patients had been enrolled in, and were expected to complete, the study. The initial primary efficacy result shows that alidornase alfa (PRX-110) improves lung function as demonstrated by a mean absolute increase in the percent predicted forced expiratory volume in one second (ppFEV1) of 4.1 points from baseline. A commercially available small molecule CFTR modulator for the treatment of CF has reported a mean absolute increase in ppFEV1 of 2.5 from baseline in its registration clinical study. This score was achieved while 74% of the patients participating in the trial of the CFTR modulator were also treated with Pulmozyme® on top of the modulator. While this marketed CFTR addresses a certain mutation applicable to less than 50% of CF patients, alidornase alfa (PRX-110) is being developed to treat all CF patients. Sputa available DNA samples were analyzed for approximately half of the patients. A mean reduction of approximately 60% in DNA content from baseline was observed, and a mean reduction of approximately 90% from baseline was observed for sputa visco-elasticity. This data provides further supportive evidence of improved lung function after treatment with alidornase alfa (PRX-110), as demonstrated by the increase in ppFEV1. No serious adverse events were reported, and all adverse events that occurred during the study were mild and transient in nature. The phase II trial is a 28-day switch-over study of 15 CF patients previously treated with Pulmozyme® to evaluate the efficacy and safety of alidornase alfa (PRX-110) in CF patients. Participation in the trial is preceded by a two-week washout period from Pulmozyme® before treatment with PRX-110 via inhalation.   The main efficacy endpoint is the change of forced expiratory volume (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC).  Additional endpoints include safety and tolerability, immunogenicity and pharmacokinetic data. In the trial, alidornase alfa (PRX-110) is administered through Philips Respironics’ I-neb AAD Inhaler System, for which Protalix has a supply agreement for the exclusive use of the device for the development of an inhaled product based on dornase alfa for the treatment of CF.  The I-neb AAD is a small, lightweight, virtually silent device that is fully portable and has a unique vibrating mesh technology that allows for faster administration than conventional jet or ultrasonic nebulizers.     AIR DNase™ (PRX-110) remains active In vitro assays have shown that that alidornase alfa (PRX-110) remains active in the relevant concentrations of actin and alidornase alfa (PRX-110), as opposed to Pulmozyme® which loses activity.      Reduction in mucus viscosity Through rheological measurements in human sputa samples, alidornase alfa (PRX-110)  demonstrated a greater reduction in mucus viscosity compared to Pulmozyme®.      OPRX-106 for for the Treatment of Inflammatory Diseases    About auto-immune-mediated disorders Auto-immune-mediated inflammatory disorders are conditions that are characterized by common pathways that lead to inflammation and are caused or triggered by a compromised or dysregulation of the normal immune response. Immune-mediated inflammatory disorders can cause organ damage, and are associated with increased morbidity. Common auto-immune diseases include Rheumatoid Arthritis, Inflammatory Bowel Disease such as Ulcerative Colitis and Crohn’s Disease, psoriasis, and others. Some of the major treatments are anti-Tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) drugs, administered as subcutaneous injections or as intravenous infusions. Sales of anti-TNF drugs exceeded $30 billion annually.     About OPRX-106 OPRX-106 is a plant cell-expressed recombinant human tumor necrosis factor receptor II fused to an IgG1 Fc domain (TNFRII-Fc), in development for oral administration. When administered orally and while passing through the digestive tract, the plant cells function as a natural delivery vehicle, having the unique attribute of a cellulose cell wall which makes them resistant to degradation compared to proteins produced via mammalian cell expression.     Pre-Clinical Data and Clinical Studies In November 2016, the first patient was enrolled in Protalix’s phase II clinical trial of OPRX-106 for the treatment of ulcerative colitis. OPRX-106 is a plant cell-expressed recombinant human tumor necrosis factor receptor II fused to an IgG1 Fc domain (TNFRII-Fc). The phase II clinical trial is a randomized, open label, 2-arm study of OPRX-106 in 20 patients with active mild to moderate ulcerative colitis. Patients will be randomized to receive 2 mg or 8 mg of OPRX-106 administered orally, once daily, for 8 weeks. The primary endpoint of the study is safety, including monitoring for adverse events following daily administration of the drug. Key efficacy endpoints include relevant disease parameters of the drug, including Mayo score and rectal bleeding. If successful, OPRX-106 will be the first ever oral enzyme treatment as currently there are no other oral enzyme treatments available. In August 2015, we announced positive clinical study results from our Phase I clinical trial of OPRX-106. PRX-106 demonstrated a favorable safety and tolerability profile and biological activity in the gut. The phase I Clinical trial was a randomized, parallel-design, open-label study designed to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of PRX-106 in healthy volunteers. The trial enrolled 14 subjects that were randomized to one of three dosing cohorts receiving PRX-106 doses equivalent to 2mg, 8mg or 16mg Tumor Necrosis Factor receptor-Fc fusion protein. Subjects received once daily oral administrations for five consecutive days. The results demonstrated that oral administration of PRX-106 is safe and well tolerated. No major side effects were noted, and no suppression of the immune system was observed. Regulatory T cell activation showing biological activity in the gut was observed. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis (FACS) was performed using various antibodies for surface markers, and it was observed that all three dosages of PRX-106 promoted the induction of various subsets of T cells, some of which are correlated with anti-inflammatory response. The efficacy of OPRX-106 was shown in preclinical studies using mouse models of immune-mediated diseases such as IBD (inflammatory bowel diseases) and immune-mediated hepatitis. Results showed that PRX-106 has the potential to positively affect these diseases, displaying changes in symptoms and in serum levels of anti-inflammatory markers.       Inflamatory Disease Animal Model Oral Anti-tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha (anti TNF α) OPRX-106  for  Inflammatory Diseases. Potential to locally deliver higher doses with fewer side effects in an oral formulation      Collaborations   Protalix is leveraging internally developed capabilities to improve biologic dynamics (e.g., glycosylation, half-life extension) of a protein combined with the multiple unique advantages of its proprietary ProCellEx® protein expression system, including advanced genetic engineering technology and plant cell-based protein expression methods, to develop a pipeline of novel, next-generation or clinically superior versions of recombinant therapeutic proteins. Significant advantages of ProCellEx® over existing expression systems of mammalian, bacterial, yeast and transgenic cell-based expression technologies, include biologic optimization, the ability to penetrate certain patent-protected markets, a broad range of expression capabilities, significantly lower capital and production costs, elimination of the risk of viral transmission or infection by mammalian components, and the potential ability to administer active therapeutic proteins and vaccines orally. We believe that all these elements along with our success in bringing Elelyso® (taliglucerase alfa for injection) through clinical trials, regulatory agency approval, and into the market demonstrates a full set of capabilities which make Protalix a partner of choice for other complex therapeutic proteins. Protalix is interested in considering partnership opportunities on biobetter and novel therapeutic proteins and vaccines as well as exploring oral delivery of biotherapeutics and vaccines by utilizing ProCellEx® technology, in addition to collaborations relating to Protalix’s current pipeline of proprietary therapeutic proteins. For partnership inquiries, please contact: William Taylor, Vice President Business Development BD@Protalix.com Current Partnerships Pfizer  In October 2015, we entered into an amended agreement with our commercialization partner for taliglucerase alfa, Pfizer Inc., pursuant to which we licensed to Pfizer the worldwide development and commercialization rights for taliglucerase alfa, excluding Brazil, where we retain full rights. Our original agreement with Pfizer, which was entered into in November 2009, provided that we share with Pfizer revenues and expenses for the development and commercialization of Elelyso on a 60%/40% basis globally, excluding Israel and Brazil. The amended agreement effectively represents the sale of our share in the collaboration agreement to Pfizer.

Style Scores:



F Value | C Growth | A Momentum | D VGM                


The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.


Value Score
A


Growth Score
A


Momentum Score
A


VGM Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Corporate history[edit]
Protalix BioTherapeutics was established in 1993.[3] It was founded by Yoseph Shaaltiel, who received his Ph.D. in Plant Biochemistry from the Weizmann Institute in Israel and served in the Biology Department of the Israel Defense Forces' Biological and Chemical Center.[4] One of the earliest and largest investors in the company was Phillip Frost.[5] Protalix has two Nobel Prize winners (Chemistry) in it's Scientific Advisory Board. Roger Kornberg Ph.D and Prof. MD. Aaron Ciechanover
In its early days Protalix operated out of a warehouse in the town of Qiryat Shemona in northern Israel.[6] On July 19, 2005, Protalix Biotherapeutics announced the closing of a $5.3 million private placement of its series C preferred stock.[7] Protalix entered into a partnership agreement with Teva Pharmaceutical Industries in 2006 for the development of two proteins[8] and in 2009 signed a collaboration agreement with Pfizer for the development and commercialization of its taliglucerase alfa treatment.[9] Also in 2009, Protalix reported that Frost & Sullivan presented the company with its 2009 European Orphan Diseases Market Product Innovation of the Year Award.[10] In 2011 Protalix announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had approved the company's manufacturing facility in Karmiel.[11]
Protalix initially became a public company through a reverse merger process with Orthodontix, a company which was at the time traded "over the counter" on the NASDAQ.[12] This merger was completed on December 31, 2006, and is notable as one of the largest reverse mergers executed, valuing the joint entity at almost $1 billion.[13] It subsequently applied for a listing on the AMEX, and sold 10 million shares in a public offering.

Protalix has been using cultured plant cells to manufacture biopharmaceuticals. As of 2017, Protalix has one FDA approved product sold by Pfizer in the U.S. and currently developing four products:

Taliglucerase alfa (Elelyso) – a recombinant glucocerebrosidase enzyme produced from transgenic carrot cell cultures.[14] Known also as Elelyso, taliglucerase won approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in May 2012 as an orphan drug for the treatment of Type 1 Gaucher's disease.[15] Protalix has licensed global development and commercialization rights for Elelyso to Pfizer, except for Brazil, where Protalix retains full rights. Brazil has the third largest number of Gaucher patients identified worldwide, after the U.S. and Israel.[16] The Brazilian National Health Surveillance Agency, known as ANVISA, granted regulatory approval for Elelyso (Uplyso) to treat adults with Gaucher disease in March 2013, and extended that approval to children in December 2016.
Alidornase alfa (PRX-110) – proprietary plant cell-expressed recombinant form of human deoxyribonuclease I (DNase I), that Protalix has designed, through chemical modification, to be resistant to inhibition by actin. DNase I is part of current Cystic Fibrosis therapy, intended to reduce sputum viscosity that accumulates in the lungs of Cystic Fibrosis patients, which exposes patients to recurrent infections and compromises lung function.[17] AIR DNase (alidornase alfa), developed to make mucus in the lungs of cystic fibrosis patients less sticky, showed remarkably good results in 2017.[18] Alidornasa alfa is being developed to treat all cystic fibrosis patients and expected to replace Pulmozyme® in 2020.
Pegunigalsidase alfa (PRX-102) – plant cell culture expressed and a chemically modified version of the recombinant alpha-Galactosidase-A protein. Protein sub-units are covalently bound via chemical cross-linking using PEG chains, resulting in a more active and stable molecule than the current available versions. Protalix is currently conducting Phase 3 clincial trial for PRX-102 for the treatment of Fabry Disease following a successful meeting with U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Protalix announced positive results from its clicnical trial for PRX-102.[19] Pegunigalsidase alfa is being developed to replace Fabrazyme and interim data shows potential superiority in efficacy.[20]
OPRX-106 – plant cell-expressed recombinant human tumor necrosis factor receptor II fused to an IgG1 Fc domain (TNFRII-Fc), in development for oral administration. If successful, OPRX-106 will be the first ever oral enzyme treatment as currently there are no other oral enzyme treatments available.
PRX-105 – a recombinant human Acetylcholinesterase, produced from genetically modified cell line of tobacco cells (Nicotiana tabacum),[21] which can be used as a counter-measure against nerve agents attack. PRX-105 completed exploratory Phase I clinical trails.[22]

Corporate history[edit]
Protalix BioTherapeutics was established in 1993.[3] It was founded by Yoseph Shaaltiel, who received his Ph.D. in Plant Biochemistry from the Weizmann Institute in Israel and served in the Biology Department of the Israel Defense Forces' Biological and Chemical Center.[4] One of the earliest and largest investors in the company was Phillip Frost.[5] Protalix has two Nobel Prize winners (Chemistry) in it's Scientific Advisory Board. Roger Kornberg Ph.D and Prof. MD. Aaron Ciechanover
In its early days Protalix operated out of a warehouse in the town of Qiryat Shemona in northern Israel.[6] On July 19, 2005, Protalix Biotherapeutics announced the closing of a $5.3 million private placement of its series C preferred stock.[7] Protalix entered into a partnership agreement with Teva Pharmaceutical Industries in 2006 for the development of two proteins[8] and in 2009 signed a collaboration agreement with Pfizer for the development and commercialization of its taliglucerase alfa treatment.[9] Also in 2009, Protalix reported that Frost & Sullivan presented the company with its 2009 European Orphan Diseases Market Product Innovation of the Year Award.[10] In 2011 Protalix announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had approved the company's manufacturing facility in Karmiel.[11]
Protalix initially became a public company through a reverse merger process with Orthodontix, a company which was at the time traded "over the counter" on the NASDAQ.[12] This merger was completed on December 31, 2006, and is notable as one of the largest reverse mergers executed, valuing the joint entity at almost $1 billion.[13] It subsequently applied for a listing on the AMEX, and sold 10 million shares in a public offering.
Products[edit]
Protalix has been using cultured plant cells to manufacture biopharmaceuticals. As of 2017, Protalix has one FDA approved product sold by Pfizer in the U.S. and currently developing four products:

Taliglucerase alfa (Elelyso) – a recombinant glucocerebrosidase enzyme produced from transgenic carrot cell cultures.[14] Known also as Elelyso, taliglucerase won approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in May 2012 as an orphan drug for the treatment of Type 1 Gaucher's disease.[15] Protalix has licensed global development and commercialization rights for Elelyso to Pfizer, except for Brazil, where Protalix retains full rights. Brazil has the third largest number of Gaucher patients identified worldwide, after the U.S. and Israel.[16] The Brazilian National Health Surveillance Agency, known as ANVISA, granted regulatory approval for Elelyso (Uplyso) to treat adults with Gaucher disease in March 2013, and extended that approval to children in December 2016.
Alidornase alfa (PRX-110) – proprietary plant cell-expressed recombinant form of human deoxyribonuclease I (DNase I), that Protalix has designed, through chemical modification, to be resistant to inhibition by actin. DNase I is part of current Cystic Fibrosis therapy, intended to reduce sputum viscosity that accumulates in the lungs of Cystic Fibrosis patients, which exposes patients to recurrent infections and compromises lung function.[17] AIR DNase (alidornase alfa), developed to make mucus in the lungs of cystic fibrosis patients less sticky, showed remarkably good results in 2017.[18] Alidornasa alfa is being developed to treat all cystic fibrosis patients and expected to replace Pulmozyme® in 2020.

PRX-105 – a recombinant human Acetylcholinesterase, produced from genetically modified cell line of tobacco cells (Nicotiana tabacum),[21] which can be used as a counter-measure against nerve agents attack. PRX-105 completed exploratory Phase I clinical trails.[22]

In its early days Protalix operated out of a warehouse in the town of Qiryat Shemona in northern Israel.[6] On July 19, 2005, Protalix Biotherapeutics announced the closing of a $5.3 million private placement of its series C preferred stock.[7] Protalix entered into a partnership agreement with Teva Pharmaceutical Industries in 2006 for the development of two proteins[8] and in 2009 signed a collaboration agreement with Pfizer for the development and commercialization of its taliglucerase alfa treatment.[9] Also in 2009, Protalix reported that Frost & Sullivan presented the company with its 2009 European Orphan Diseases Market Product Innovation of the Year Award.[10] In 2011 Protalix announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had approved the company's manufacturing facility in Karmiel.[11]
Protalix initially became a public company through a reverse merger process with Orthodontix, a company which was at the time traded "over the counter" on the NASDAQ.[12] This merger was completed on December 31, 2006, and is notable as one of the largest reverse mergers executed, valuing the joint entity at almost $1 billion.[13] It subsequently applied for a listing on the AMEX, and sold 10 million shares in a public offering.
Products[edit]
Protalix has been using cultured plant cells to manufacture biopharmaceuticals. As of 2017, Protalix has one FDA approved product sold by Pfizer in the U.S. and currently developing four products:

Taliglucerase alfa (Elelyso) – a recombinant glucocerebrosidase enzyme produced from transgenic carrot cell cultures.[14] Known also as Elelyso, taliglucerase won approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in May 2012 as an orphan drug for the treatment of Type 1 Gaucher's disease.[15] Protalix has licensed global development and commercialization rights for Elelyso to Pfizer, except for Brazil, where Protalix retains full rights. Brazil has the third largest number of Gaucher patients identified worldwide, after the U.S. and Israel.[16] The Brazilian National Health Surveillance Agency, known as ANVISA, granted regulatory approval for Elelyso (Uplyso) to treat adults with Gaucher disease in March 2013, and extended that approval to children in December 2016.
Alidornase alfa (PRX-110) – proprietary plant cell-expressed recombinant form of human deoxyribonuclease I (DNase I), that Protalix has designed, through chemical modification, to be resistant to inhibition by actin. DNase I is part of current Cystic Fibrosis therapy, intended to reduce sputum viscosity that accumulates in the lungs of Cystic Fibrosis patients, which exposes patients to recurrent infections and compromises lung function.[17] AIR DNase (alidornase alfa), developed to make mucus in the lungs of cystic fibrosis patients less sticky, showed remarkably good results in 2017.[18] Alidornasa alfa is being developed to treat all cystic fibrosis patients and expected to replace Pulmozyme® in 2020.
Pegunigalsidase alfa (PRX-102) – plant cell culture expressed and a chemically modified version of the recombinant alpha-Galactosidase-A protein. Protein sub-units are covalently bound via chemical cross-linking using PEG chains, resulting in a more active and stable molecule than the current available versions. Protalix is currently conducting Phase 3 clincial trial for PRX-102 for the treatment of Fabry Disease following a successful meeting with U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Protalix announced positive results from its clicnical trial for PRX-102.[19] Pegunigalsidase alfa is being developed to replace Fabrazyme and interim data shows potential superiority in efficacy.[20]
OPRX-106 – plant cell-expressed recombinant human tumor necrosis factor receptor II fused to an IgG1 Fc domain (TNFRII-Fc), in development for oral administration. If successful, OPRX-106 will be the first ever oral enzyme treatment as currently there are no other oral enzyme treatments available.
PRX-105 – a recombinant human Acetylcholinesterase, produced from genetically modified cell line of tobacco cells (Nicotiana tabacum),[21] which can be used as a counter-measure against nerve agents attack. PRX-105 completed exploratory Phase I clinical trails.[22]
