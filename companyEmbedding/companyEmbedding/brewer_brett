My experience here ranges from engineering leader focused on a single family of products all the way to developing product vision and strategy for a multibillion dollar business like Office.While most known for leading innovation labs and V1 products, I've also managed mature products like Microsoft Office and Project. The messy, difficult, ambiguous area of creating a new, successful product from scratch is where I thrive. I love any opportunity where I can be challenged and learn new skills, particularly if it has deep technical needs like Bing where I led ranking and relevance measurement, or Surface Hub for combined hardware and software integration.A sampling of the products I led from incubation to product:Surface Hub -

In particular, the architecture can receive an image that depicts a view of the local environment including a set of entities represented in the image. One or more of the entities can be matched or correlated to modeled entities included in a geospatial model of the environment, potentially based upon location and direction, in order to scope or frame the view depicted in the image to a modeled view. In addition, the architecture can select additional content that can be presented. The additional content typically relates to services or data associated with modeled entities included in the geospatial model or associated with modeled entities included in an image-based data store.Inventors: Brett BrewerPrivacy-centric ad models that leverage social graphsUnited States 8909546Issued December 2014The claimed subject matter relates to an architecture that can mitigate privacy concerns in connection with ad targeting or data collection. In particular, architecture can be included in a personal mobile communication device such as a cell phone. During communication transactions between the host device and a peer device, shared information can be extracted either from content included in the communication or from metadata. Based upon the shared information, a social graph maintained on the host device can be updated. In addition, the host device can receive a large set of ads and select or tailor a custom ad from the set based upon the social graph.Inventors: Brett BrewerProcedural AuthoringUnited States 20140254921Issued September 2014The claimed subject matter provides a system and/or a method that facilitates generating a model from a 3-dimensional (3D) object assembled from 2-dimensional (2D) content. A content aggregator can construct a 3D object from a collection of two or more 2D images each depicting a real entity in a physical real world, wherein the 3D object is constructed by combining the two or more 2D images based upon a respective image perspective. A 3D virtual environment can allow exploration of the 3D object. A model component can extrapolate a true 3D geometric model from the 3D object, wherein the true 3D geometric model is generated to include scaling in proportion to a size within the physical real world.Inventors: Brett BrewerProcedural AuthoringUnited States 8737721Issued May 2014A system and a method that facilitates generating a model from a 3-dimensional (3D) object assembled from 2-dimensional (2D) content are described.

A browsing session can enable navigation and display of a portion of published content. A render definition enforcer can implement a tag related to the portion of published content with at least one view-level display property, the view-level display property is at least one of a definition to at least one of display or not display the portion of published content based upon a view-level within the browsing session or a definition related to a size scale factor for the portion of published content based upon a view-level within the browsing session. The browsing session can utilize the portion of published content at a view-level in accordance to the view-level display property.Inventors: Brett BrewerAugmenting a Field of ViewUnited States Filed January 2015A method for enhancing an experience associated with a field of view of a local environment, comprising:capturing, by a device, an image that depicts a view of a local environment, the view being a specific portion of the local environment that includes a set of entities, the device having an associated display;displaying the image that depicts the view of the local environment;identifying a correlation between an environment entity included in the view and a corresponding modeled entity included in a three-dimensional (3D), spatially accurate geospatial model of the environment based upon a relative orientation, shape, or size of the environment entity;defining boundaries of a modeled view of the geospatial model corresponding to associated boundaries of the view depicted in the image based upon the correlation;identifying a modeled object entity from a set of modeled entities included in the geospatial model based on the modeled view of the geospatial model having the defined boundaries;selecting additional content associated with the included representation of the identified modeled object entity included in the geospatial model, the identified modeled object entity corresponding to an entity that is non-existent in the image; andpresenting the additional content in association with the displayed image.Inventors: Brett BrewerCreating Variations When Transforming Data Into Consumable ContentUnited States Filed April 2015A computer-implemented method for transforming data, the computer-implemented method comprising performing computer-implemented operations for:obtaining, at a computing device, data comprising a plurality of data elements;analyzing the data to identify relationships between the plurality of data elements;identifying a plurality of worlds that can be used to generate output comprising at least one of the plurality of data elements, each of the plurality of worlds defining a visualization model to apply to the plurality of data elements based, at least partially, upon the relationships;ranking the plurality of worlds based, at least partially, upon a determination of an appropriateness of the each of the plurality of worlds for a shape determined for the data;selecting a world from the plurality of worlds based, at least partially, upon the data;obtaining rules for applying the data to the world selected; andapplying the rules to the data to generate the output.Inventors: Brett BrewerTransforming Data Into Consumable ContentUnited States Filed March 2015A computer-implemented method for transforming data, the computer-implemented method comprising performing computer-implemented operations for:obtaining, at a computing device, data comprising a plurality of data elements;analyzing the data to identify relationships between the plurality of data elements;determining a world defining a visualization model to apply to the plurality of data elements based, at least partially, upon the relationships;obtaining rules for applying the data to the world; andapplying the rules to the data to generate output comprising the at least one of the plurality of data elements arranged according to the world.Inventors: Brett BrewerEducationCarnegie Mellon UniversityB.S., Chemical EngineeringB.S., Chemical Engineering1984  –  1988focus of study on process controlRecommendationsA preview of what LinkedIn members have to say about Brett:I first met Brett when he joined Microsoft in 1997.  My only regret in working with him is that it was not earlier in my career, and for a longer period.
