Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial highlights based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement. We were not engaged to perform an audit of the Trust s internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Trust s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our procedures included confirmation of securities owned at February 29, 2016 by correspondence with The Bank of New York Mellon, Trustee. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Investment Grade Municipal Trust, Intermediate Series 49 (included in Invesco Unit Trusts, Municipal Series 1183) as of February 29, 2016, and the results of its operations and changes in net assets for the period from March 25, 2014 (date of deposit) through February 28, 2015 and for the year ended February 29, 2016, and the financial highlights for the period from March 25, 2014 (date of deposit) through February 28, 2015 and for the year ended February 29, 2016, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. /s/ GRANT THORNTON LLP New York, New York June 23,5 INVESCO UNIT TRUSTS, MUNICIPAL SERIES 1183 Statement of Condition February 29, 2016 IGIN Trust Trust property Cash... $ Tax-exempt securities at fair value (cost $4,806,669) (notes 1 and 2)... 5,031,191 Accrued interest... 58,891 Receivable for securities sold... $ 5,090,082 Liabilities and interest to Unitholders Cash overdraft... $ 48,094 Redemptions payable...

The Evaluator may determine the value of the Bonds (1) on the basis of current bid prices of the Bonds obtained from dealers or brokers who customarily deal in Bonds comparable to those held by the Trust, (2) on the basis of bid prices for comparable Bonds, (3) by determining the value of the Bonds by appraisal or (4) by any combination of the above. Security Cost - The original cost to the Trust (Investment Grade Municipal Trust, Intermediate Series 49) was based on the determination by the Evaluator of the offering prices of the Bonds on the date of deposit (March 25, 2014). Since the valuation is based upon the bid prices, the Trust (Investment Grade Municipal Trust, Intermediate Series 49) recognized a downward adjustment of $20,377 on the date of deposit resulting from the difference between the bid and offering prices. This downward adjustment was included in the aggregate amount of unrealized depreciation reported in the financial statements for the Trust for the period ended February 28, Unit Valuation - The redemption price per Unit is the pro rata share of each Unit in each Trust based upon (1) the cash on hand in such Trust or monies in the process of being collected, (2) the Bonds in such Trust based on the value determined by the Evaluator and (3) interest accrued thereon, less accrued expenses of the Trust, if any. Federal Income Taxes - For a Trust with a Date of Deposit prior to August 2, 2006, such Trust has been structured to be treated as a grantor trust for federal income tax purposes. Thus, such a Trust will not be treated as a taxable entity for federal income tax purposes, and each Unitholder will be considered to be the owner of a pro rata portion of the assets of such Trust. Accordingly, no provision has been made for federal income taxes. For a Trust with a Date of Deposit on or after August 2, 2006, each such Trust has elected and intends to qualify on a continuous basis for special income tax treatment as a regulated investment company ( RIC ) under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. If such Trust so qualifies, as expected, it will not be subject to federal income tax on amounts distributed to Unitholders. Your Trust s Date of Deposit is listed above in the section entitled Summary of Essential Financial Information. For a discussion of the federal tax status of income earned on Units, see Federal Tax Status--Grantor Trusts or Federal Tax Status--Regulated Investment Companies, as applicable, in Part II of this Prospectus. For each calendar year-end, a RIC trust files an annual tax return, Form 1120-RIC, with the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ). These returns are subject to IRS examination under a three-year statute of limitations. To date, the Trust has no IRS examination pending. Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes - FASB Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ), clarifies the appropriate method of accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements and provides related guidance. There is no material effect on the net asset value, financial condition or results of operations of the Trust. Subsequent Events - Events or transactions that have occurred from the balance sheet date through the date of issuance are evaluated by the Sponsor. Other - The financial statements are presented on the accrual basis of accounting. Any realized gains or losses from securities transactions are reported on an identified cost basis. NOTE 2 - PORTFOLIO Ratings - The source of all ratings, exclusive of those designated NR or * is Standard & Poor s, A Division of the McGraw-Hill Companies ( S&P ). Ratings marked * are by Moody s Investors Service, Inc. ( Moody s ) as these Bonds are not rated by S&P. NR indicates that the Bond is not rated by S&P or Moody s. The ratings shown represent the latest published ratings of the Bonds. For a brief description of rating symbols and their related meanings, see Description of Securities Ratings in the Information Supplement. Redemption Feature - There is shown under this heading the year in which each issue of Bonds is initially or currently callable and the call price for that year. Each issue of Bonds continues to be callable at declining prices thereafter (but not below par value) except for original issue discount Bonds which are redeemable at prices based on the issue price plus the amount of original issue discount accreted to redemption date plus, if applicable, some premium, the amount of which will decline in subsequent years. S.F. indicates a sinking fund is established with respect to an issue of Bonds. P.R. indicates a bond has been prerefunded. Redemption pursuant to call provisions generally will, and redemption pursuant to sinking fund provisions may, occur at times when the redeemed Bonds have an offering side evaluation which represents a premium over par. To the extent that the Bonds were deposited in the Trust at a price higher than the price at which they are redeemed, this will represent a loss of capital when compared with the original Public Offering Price of the Units. Conversely, to the extent that the Bonds were acquired at a price lower than the redemption price, this will represent an increase in capital when compared with the original Public Offering Price of the Units. Distributions will generally be reduced by the amount of the income which would otherwise have been paid with respect to redeemed Bonds and there will be distributed to Unitholders the principal amount in excess of $1 per Unit semi-annually for Trusts with a Date of Deposit prior to April 21, 2009, or in excess of $5 per Unit monthly for Trusts with a Date of Deposit on or after April 21, 2009, and any premium received on such redemption. However, should the amount available for distribution in the Principal Account exceed $10.00 per Unit for Trusts with a Deposit Date prior to April 21, 2009, the Trustee will make a special distribution from the Principal Account on the next succeeding monthly distribution date to holders of record on the related monthly record date. The Estimated Current Return in this event may be affected by such redemptions. For the federal tax effect on Unitholders of such redemptions and resultant distributions, see Federal Tax Status in Part II of this Prospectus. 1112 NOTE 2 - PORTFOLIO (continued) Certain Bonds may have a make whole call option and are redeemable in whole or in part at any time at the option of the issuer at a redemption price that is generally equal to the sum of the principal amount of such Bonds, a make whole amount, and any accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. The make whole amount is generally equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the aggregate present value as of the date of redemption of principal being redeemed and the amount of interest (exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption) that would have been payable if redemption had not been made, determined by discounting the remaining principal and interest at a specified rate (which varies from bond to bond and is generally equal to an average of yields on municipal obligations with maturities corresponding to the remaining life of the bond plus a premium rate) from the dates on which the principal and interest would have been payable if the redemption had not been made, over (ii) the aggregate principal amount of the bonds being redeemed. Insurance - Insurance coverage providing for the timely payment when due of all principal and interest on certain of the Bonds in the Trust may have been obtained by the Trust or by one of the Preinsured Bond Insurers (as indicated in the Bond name), however, certain other Bonds may not be insured. Such insurance does not guarantee the market value of the Bonds or the value of the Units. For Bonds covered under the Trust's insurance policy the insurance is effective only while Bonds thus insured are held in the Trust and the insurance premium, which is a Trust obligation, is paid on a monthly basis. The premium for insurance which has been obtained from various insurance companies by the issuer of the Bond involved is payable by the issuer. ASC states that, for financial reporting purposes, insurance coverage of the type acquired by the Trust does not have any measurable fair value in the absence of default of the underlying Bonds or of indications of the probability of such default. Fair Value Measurements - As described in Note 1, the Trust utilizes various methods to measure the fair value of its investments. ASC establishes both a framework for measuring fair value as well as a hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation methods. The various inputs that may be used to determine the value of the Trust s investments are summarized in the three levels presented below. The inputs or methodologies used for valuing securities are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing in those securities. Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical securities. Level 2 Prices determined using other significant observable inputs. Observable inputs are inputs that other market participants would use in pricing a security, which may include quoted prices for similar securities, interest rates, prepayment speeds and credit risk. Level 3 Prices determined using significant unobservable inputs. In certain situations where quoted prices or observable inputs are unavailable, unobservable inputs may be used. Unobservable inputs reflect the Trust s own assumptions about the factors market participants would use in pricing an investment, and would be based on the best information available. The following table summarizes the Trust s investments as of February 29, 2016 based on the inputs used to value them: Investments Valuation Inputs in Securities Level 1 Quoted prices $ Level 2 Other significant observable inputs 5,031,191 Level 3 Significant unobservable inputs Total $ 5,031,191 Unrealized Appreciation and Depreciation - An analysis of net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) at February 29, 2016 is as follows: Unrealized Appreciation $ 240,622 Unrealized Depreciation (16,100) $ 224,522 NOTE 3 - OTHER Marketability - Although it is not obligated to do so, the Sponsor may maintain a market for Units and continuously offer to purchase Units at prices, subject to change at any time, based upon the aggregate bid price of the Bonds in the portfolio of the Trust, plus interest accrued to the date of settlement. If the supply of Units exceeds demand, or for other business reasons, the Sponsor may discontinue purchases of Units at such prices. In the event that a market is not maintained for the Units, a Unitholder desiring to dispose of his Units may be able to do so only by tendering such Units to the Trustee for redemption at the redemption price. 1213 NOTE 3 - OTHER (continued) Cost to Investors - The cost to original investors was based on the Evaluator s determination of the aggregate offering price of the Bonds per Unit on the date of an investor s purchase, plus a sales charge of 3.00% of the public offering price which was equivalent to 3.093% of the aggregate offering price of the Bonds. The secondary market cost to investors is based on the Evaluator s determination of the aggregate bid price of the Bonds per Unit on the date of an investor s purchase plus a sales charge based upon the years to average maturity of the Bonds in the portfolio. The sales charge ranges from 1.50% of the public offering price (1.523% of the aggregate bid price of the Bonds) for a Trust with a portfolio with less than two years to average maturity to 4.80% of the public offering price (5.042% of the aggregate bid price of the Bonds) for a Trust with a portfolio with fifteen or more years to average maturity. Compensation of Evaluator and Supervisor - The Supervisor receives a fee for providing portfolio supervisory services for the Trust ($.25 per Unit, not to exceed the aggregate cost of the Supervisor for providing such services to the Trust). In addition, the Evaluator receives an annual fee for regularly evaluating each of the Trust s portfolios. Both fees may be adjusted for increases under the category Services Less Rent of Shelter in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers. NOTE 4 - REDEMPTION OF UNITS During the period from March 25, 2014 (date of deposit) through February 28, 2015 and for the year ended February 29, 2016, 246 Units and 832 Units, respectively, were presented for redemption.

Your Trust is one of several unit investment trusts created under the name Insured Municipals Income Trust, Insured Municipals Income Trust and Investors Quality Tax-Exempt Trust, Van Kampen Focus Portfolios, Municipal Series, Van Kampen Unit Trusts, Municipal Series or Invesco Unit Trusts, Municipal Series (the Fund ). The Fund was created under the laws of the State of New York pursuant to a Trust Indenture and Agreement (the Trust Agreement ), dated the Date of Deposit among Invesco Capital Markets, Inc. as Sponsor, Standard & Poor s Securities Evaluations, Inc., as Evaluator, Invesco Investment Advisers LLC, as Supervisor, and The Bank of New York Mellon, as Trustee, or their predecessors. The Fund consists of separate portfolios of interest-bearing obligations issued by or on behalf of states and territories of the United States, and political subdivisions and authorities thereof, the interest on which is, in the opinion of recognized bond counsel to the issuing authorities, excludable from gross income for Federal income tax purposes under existing law. All issuers of bonds in a State Trust are located in the state for which the Trust is named or in United States territories or possessions and their public authorities; consequently, in the opinion of recognized bond counsel to the issuing authorities, the interest earned on the bonds is exempt from state and local taxes to the extent indicated herein and to the extent permitted under local law. Further, in the opinion of bond counsel to the respective issuers rendered at closing, the interest income of each bond in a U.S. Territorial IM-IT Trust is exempt from state, Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and local income taxation. Interest on certain bonds in a National Quality AMT Trust may be a preference item for purposes of the alternative minimum tax. Accordingly, a National Quality AMT Trust may be appropriate only for investors who are not subject to the alternative minimum tax. Trusts that hold only insured bonds are referred to herein as Insured Trusts. Long-Term Trust refers to IM-IT, Investment Grade Municipal, U.S. Territorial IM-IT, High Grade Tax-Exempt Bond, 20+ Year Series, Long-Term State and National Quality Trusts. Investment Grade Municipal Intermediate Trust refers to an Investment Grade Municipal Trust which is designated as an intermediate series or 7-13 Year Series in the name of such Trust. Intermediate-Term Trust refers to Strategic Municipal Trust Intermediate Series, State Intermediate Trusts, Investment Grade Municipal Intermediate Trusts and State Intermediate Laddered Maturity Trusts. Trusts that are named for a particular state are referred to herein as State Trusts. State Intermediate Trust refers to a State Trust which is designated as an intermediate series in the name of such Trust. State Intermediate Laddered Maturity Trust refers to a State Trust which is designated as an intermediate laddered maturity series in the name of such Trust. State Trusts, other than State Intermediate Laddered Maturity Trusts or State Intermediate Trusts, are referred to herein as Long-Term State Trusts. Investment Grade Municipal Limited Maturity Trust refers to an Investment Grade Municipal Trust which is designated as a limited maturity series in the name of such Trust Year Trust refers to a trust which is designated as a year series in the name of such trust. On the Date of Deposit, the Sponsor deposited the bonds with the Trustee. The bonds initially consisted of delivery statements relating to contracts for their purchase and cash, cash equivalents and/or irrevocable letters of credit issued by a financial institution. Thereafter, the Trustee, in exchange for the bonds, delivered to the Sponsor evidence of ownership of the Units. The following table sets forth the approximate range of maturities in years from the Date of Deposit for bonds held in the indicated Trusts: Approximate Maturity From Date of Deposit Trust in Years IM-IT, Investment Grade Municipal, IM-IT Discount, U.S. Territorial IM-IT, Long-Term State and National Quality Trust to 40 High Grade Tax-Exempt Bond Trust, 20+ Year Series to 30 IM-IT Laddered Series to 30 Investment Grade Municipal Limited Maturity Trust to Year Trust to 20 IM-IT Limited Maturity Trust and Quality Municipals Income Trust (QM-IT) Limited Maturity Series to 15 Investment Grade Municipal Intermediate Trust to 13 IM-IT Intermediate Trust and Strategic Municipal Trust Intermediate Series to 15 State Intermediate Laddered Maturity Trust to 10 IM-IT Short Intermediate Trust to 7 The portfolio of any IM-IT Laddered Series is structured so that approximately 20% of the bonds will mature every five years, beginning in approximately the tenth year of the Trust, entitling each Unitholder to return of principal. The portfolio of any State Intermediate Laddered Maturity Trust is structured so that approximately 20% of the bonds will mature each year, beginning in approximately the fifth year of the Trust, entitling each Unitholder to a return of principal. This return of principal may offer 216 Unitholders the opportunity to respond to changing economic conditions and to specific financial needs that may arise during the periods of scheduled maturities. However, the flexibility provided by the return of principal may also eliminate a Unitholder s ability to reinvest at a rate as high as the yield on the bonds which matured. Each Unit represents a fractional undivided interest in the principal and net income of a Trust. To the extent that any Units are redeemed to the Trustee, the fractional undivided interest in a Trust represented by each Unit will increase, although the actual interest in the Trust will remain unchanged. Units will remain outstanding until redeemed by Unitholders or until the termination of the Trust Agreement. Objectives and Bond Selection. The Trusts seek to preserve capital and to provide federal tax-exempt income and, in the case of most State Trusts, Federal and state tax-exempt income. The Trusts invest in portfolios of municipal bonds issued by or on behalf of states and territories of the United States, and political subdivisions and authorities thereof, the interest on which is, in the opinion of recognized bond counsel to the issuing authorities, excludable from gross income for federal and, for State Trusts, state and, if applicable, local personal income tax purposes under existing law. An IM-IT Laddered Series has additional objectives of providing protection against changes in interest rates and investment flexibility through an investment in a laddered portfolio of interest-bearing obligations with maturities ranging from approximately 10 to 30 years in which roughly 20% of the bonds mature every five years beginning in approximately the tenth year of the Trust. A State Intermediate Laddered Maturity Trust has additional objectives of providing protection against changes in interest rates and investment flexibility through an investment in a laddered portfolio of intermediate-term interest-bearing obligations with maturities ranging from approximately 5 to 10 years in which roughly 20% of the bonds mature each year beginning in approximately the fifth year of the Trust. There is, of course, no guarantee that the Trusts will achieve their objectives. A Trust may be an appropriate investment vehicle for investors who desire to participate in a portfolio of tax-exempt fixed income bonds with greater diversification than they might be able to acquire individually. Diversification of a Trust s assets will not eliminate the risk of loss always inherent in the ownership of bonds. Insurance guaranteeing the timely payment, when due, of all principal and interest on the bonds in each Insured Trust has been obtained from municipal bond insurance companies. See Insurance on the Bonds. In addition, these bonds are often not available in small amounts. In selecting bonds for the Trusts, the Sponsor considered the following factors, among others: the ratings criteria applicable to your Trust as listed under Principal Investment Strategy, (b) the prices of the bonds relative to other bonds of comparable quality and maturity, (c) the current income provided by the bonds, (d) the diversification of bonds as to purpose of issue and location of issuer and (e) the probability of early return of principal or high legal or event risk. After the Date of Deposit, a bond may cease to be rated or its rating may be reduced below the minimum required as of the Date of Deposit. Neither event requires elimination of a bond from a Trust but may be considered in the Sponsor s determination as to whether or not to direct the Trustee to dispose of the bond (see Trust Administration--Portfolio Administration ). In particular, the ratings of the bonds in any Investment Grade Municipal Trust could fall below investment grade (i.e., below BBB- or Baa3 ) during the Trust s life and the Trust could continue to hold the bonds. See The Trusts--Risk Factors. The Bonds. Your Trust invests in municipal bonds. States, municipalities and public authorities issue these bonds to raise money for a variety of purposes. In selecting bonds, we seek to diversify your portfolio by type of bond purpose. This section briefly describes different bond types to help you better understand your investment. The types of bonds a percentages they represent in your portfolio as listed under Summary of Essential Financial Information. These bonds are described in greater detail in the Information Supplement. See Additional Information. General obligation bonds are backed by the general taxing power of the issuer. The issuer secures these bonds by pledging its faith, credit and unlimited taxing power for the payment of principal and interest. Revenue bonds are payable only from the revenue of a specific project or authority. They are not supported by the issuer s general power to levy taxes. The risk of default in payment of interest or principal increases if the income of the related project falters because that income is the only source of payment. All of the following bonds are revenue bonds. Airport bonds are obligations of issuers that own and operate airports. The ability of the issuer to make payments on these bonds primarily depends on the ability of airlines to meet their obligations under use agreements. Due to increased competition, deregulation, increased fuel costs and other factors, some airlines may have difficulty meeting these obligations. Bond banks are vehicles that pool various municipal obligations into larger offerings. This reduces the cost of borrowing for the municipalities. The types of financing projects that these obligations support vary. Certificates of participation are generally a type of municipal lease obligation. Lease payments of a governmental entity secure payments on these bonds. These payments depend on the governmental entity budgeting appropriations for the lease payments. A governmental body cannot obligate future governments to appropriate for or make lease payments, but governments typically promise to take action necessary to include lease payments in their budgets. If a government fails to budget for or make lease payments, sufficient funds may not exist to pay interest or principal on these bonds. 317 Health care bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenue from hospitals and hospital systems. The ability of these issuers to make payments on bonds depends on factors such as facility occupancy levels, demand for services, competition resulting from hospital mergers and affiliations, the need to reduce costs, government regulation, costs of malpractice insurance and claims, and government financial assistance (such as Medicare and Medicaid). Higher education bonds are obligations of issuers that operate universities and colleges. These issuers derive revenues from tuition, dormitories, grants and endowments. These issuers face problems related to declines in the number of college-age individuals, possible inability to raise tuitions and fees, uncertainty of continued federal grants, state funding or donations, and government legislation or regulation. Industrial revenue bonds finance the cost of acquiring, building or improving industrial projects. Private corporations usually operate these projects. The ability of the issuer to make payments on these bonds depends on factors such as the creditworthiness of the corporation operating the project, revenues generated by the project, expenses of the project and environmental or other regulatory restrictions. Multi-family housing bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from mortgage loans on multiple family residences, retirement housing or housing projects for low to moderate-income families. These bonds are generally pre-payable at any time. It is likely that their life will be less than their stated maturity. The ability of these issuers to make payments on bonds depends on such factors as rental income, occupancy levels, operating expenses, mortgage default rates, taxes, government regulations and appropriation of subsidies. Other care bonds include obligations of issuers that derive revenue from mental health facilities, nursing homes and intermediate care facilities. These bonds are similar to health care bonds and the issuers face the same general risks. Public building bonds finance the cost of acquiring, leasing, building or improving public buildings such as offices, recreation facilities, convention centers, police stations, correctional institutions and parking garages. The ability of the issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on factors such as the government budgeting sufficient funds to make lease or mortgage payments on the facility, user fees or rents, costs of maintenance and decreases in use of the facility. Public education bonds are obligations of issuers that operate primary and secondary schools. The ability of these issuers to make payments on these bonds depends primarily on ad valorem taxes. These issuers may also face problems related to litigation contesting state constitutionality of public education financing. Retail electric/gas/telephone bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from the retail sale of utilities to customers. The ability of these issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on factors such as the rates and demand for these utilities, competition, government regulation and rate approvals, overhead expenses and the cost of fuels. Single family housing bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from mortgage loans on single family residences. Single family residences generally include one to four-family dwellings. These bonds are similar to multi-family housing bonds and the issuers face the same general risks. Tax district bonds are obligations secured by a pledge of taxing power by a municipality, such as tax increment financing or tax allocation bonds. These bonds are similar to general obligation bonds. Unlike general obligation bonds, however, the municipality does not pledge its unlimited taxing power to pay these bonds. Instead, the municipality pledges revenues from a specific tax to pay these bonds. If the tax cannot support payment of interest and principal, a municipality may need to raise the related tax to pay these bonds. An inability to raise the tax could have an adverse effect on these bonds. Transportation bonds are obligations of issuers that own and operate public transit systems, ports, highways, turnpikes, bridges and other transportation systems. The ability of these issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on variations in use, the degree of government subsidization, competition from other forms of transportation and increased costs. Port authorities derive revenues primarily from fees imposed on ships using the port facilities. These fees can fluctuate depending on the local economy and competition from air, rail and truck transportation. Increased fuel costs, alternative transportation modes and competition from toll-free bridges and roads will impact revenues of issuers that operate bridges, roads or tunnels. Waste disposal bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from resource recovery facilities. These facilities process solid waste, generate steam and convert steam to electricity. These issuers face problems such as costs and delays due to environmental concerns, effects of conservation and recycling, destruction or condemnation of a project, void or unenforceable contracts, changes in the economic availability of raw materials, operating supplies or facilities, and other unavoidable changes that adversely affect operation of a project. Water and sewer bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from user fees from the sale of water and sewerage services. These issuers face problems such as the ability to obtain rate increases, population declines, difficulties in obtaining 418 new fresh water supplies and no-growth zoning ordinances. These issuers also face many of the same problems of waste disposal issuers. Wholesale electric bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from selling electricity to other utilities. The ability of these issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on factors such as the rates and demand for electric utilities, competition, overhead expenses and government regulation and rate approvals. More About the Bonds. In addition to describing the purpose of the bonds, other information about the bonds is also listed in the Portfolio in Prospectus Part I. This information relates to other characteristics of the bonds. This section briefly describes some of these characteristics. Original issue discount bonds were initially issued at a price below their face (or par) value. These bonds typically pay a lower interest rate than comparable bonds that were issued at or above their par value. In a stable interest rate environment, the market value of these bonds tends to increase more slowly in early years and in greater increments as the bonds approach maturity. The issuers of these bonds may be able to call or redeem a bond before its stated maturity date and at a price less than the bond s par value. Zero coupon bonds are a type of original issue discount bond. These bonds do not pay any current interest during their life. If an investor owns this type of bond, the investor has the right to receive a final payment of the bond s par value at maturity. The price of these bonds often fluctuates greatly during periods of changing market interest rates compared to bonds that make current interest payments. The issuers of these bonds may be able to call or redeem a bond before its stated maturity date and at a price less than the bond s par value. Municipal Bond Risk Factors. All investments involve risk. This section describes the main risks that can impact the value of bonds in your Trust. You should understand these risks before you invest. If the value of the bonds falls, the value of your Units will also fall. You can lose money by investing in a Trust. No one can guarantee that your Trust will achieve its objective or that your investment return will be positive over any period. The Information Supplement contains a more detailed discussion of risks related to your investment. Current economic conditions. The economic recession in the United States which began in 2007 technically came to an end in June of 2009, however the U.S. and global economies continue to feel the effects of this recessionary period, including increased unemployment and below-average levels of economic activity. The U.S. and other foreign governments have taken extraordinary steps to combat the effects of the economic crisis, however the ultimate impact of these measures is unknown and cannot be predicted. In December of 2013, the U.S. Federal Reserve announced it would begin tapering its quantitative easing program, however, there continues to be uncertainty concerning potential future changes to the federal funds rate following a period of near zero interest rates over the previous five years. On August 5, 2011, Standard & Poor s Rating Services downgraded the long-term sovereign credit rating of the United States of America to AA+ from AAA, citing the prolonged controversy over raising the statutory debt ceiling and the related fiscal policy debate. Any substantial change in general market conditions may result in sudden and significant valuation increases or declines in your Trust s holdings. Market risk is the risk that the value of the bonds in your Trust will fluctuate. This could cause the value of your Units to fall below your original purchase price or below the par value. Market value fluctuates in response to various factors. These can include changes in interest rates, inflation, the financial condition of a bond s issuer or insurer, perceptions of the issuer or insurer, or ratings on a bond. Even though the Supervisor supervises your portfolio, you should remember that no one manages your portfolio. Your Trust will not sell a bond solely because the market value falls as is possible in a managed fund. Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of bonds will fall if interest rates increase. Bonds typically fall in value when interest rates rise and rise in value when interest rates fall. Bonds with longer periods before maturity are often more sensitive to interest rate changes. Given the historically low interest rate environment in the U.S., risks associated with rising rates are heightened. The negative impact on fixed income securities from any interest rate increases could be swift and significant. Credit risk is the risk that a bond s issuer or insurer is unable to meet its obligation to pay principal or interest on the bond. Call risk is the risk that the issuer prepays or calls a bond before its stated maturity. An issuer might call a bond if interest rates fall and the bond pays a higher interest rate or if it no longer needs the money for the original purpose. If an issuer calls a bond, your Trust will distribute the principal to you but your future interest distributions will fall. You might not be able to reinvest this principal at as high a yield. A bond s call price could be less than the price your Trust paid for the bond and could be below the bond s par value. This means that you could receive less than the amount you paid for your units. If enough bonds in your Trust are called, your Trust could terminate early. The first date that the issuer can call each bond in the portfolio is listed in Prospectus Part I along with the price the issuer would have to pay. Some or all of the bonds may also be subject to extraordinary optional or mandatory redemptions if certain events occur, such as certain changes in tax laws, the substantial damage or destruction by fire or other casualty of the project for which the proceeds of the bonds were used, and 5  View more

Quality Municipal Income Trust, 20+ Year (QUAL0196)
	
	




Objective
Take advantage of federal tax-exempt investments through a convenient and efficient way of purchasing a professionally selected and diversified portfolio of quality municipal bonds. The Trust is a long-term portfolio1 that offers tax-exempt federal income with the potential for a higher yield than a portfolio holding insured municipal bonds. The bonds in the portfolio are generally not insured, and, if rated, have credit ratings of at least A- by Standard & Poor's or at least A3 by Moody's as of the deposit date.2 The Trust seeks to provide federal tax-exempt income3 and to preserve capital. The Trust invests in a portfolio of tax-exempt municipal bonds. 




1 Due to the nature of municipal bonds, there is a risk that a bond may be called before maturity, potentially below it's par value, and investors may be unable to reinvest their principal at the same rate of return.
2 Each bond’s rating may change after its inclusion in the Trust. 
3 A portion of your interest income may be subject to state or local taxes.
Diversification does not ensure a profit or eliminate the risk of loss.

1Estimated current return (ECR) is based on the estimated annual income as a percentage of the current price of the units. Estimated long-term return (ELTR) is calculated using a formula which (1) takes into consideration and determines and factors in the relative weightings of the market values, yields (which takes into account the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts) and estimated retirement of all the bonds in the trust and (2) takes into account the expenses and sales charge associated with each trust unit. There can be no assurance that either the estimated current return or ELTR will be realized in the future and an investor's units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
2The ELTR life represents the estimated life of the bonds in a Trust's portfolio determined for the purposes of calculating Estimated Long-Term Return.
3Estimated Annual Income Per Unit is as of close the most recent business day and is based on the estimated cash flows per unit. This amount will vary with changes in expenses, interest rates and the maturity, call or sale of bonds.
4Estimated Daily Rate of Accrual represents the annual interest from the securities within the portfolio divided by the number of days on which interest is calculated annually.
5Represents the principal amount of the underlying bonds per unit. Bonds may be sold to meet redemptions, to pay expenses, and in other limited circumstances. The sale of bonds will affect the principal amount of bonds included in the trust and as a result the principal amount of bonds per unit. There can be no assurance that a unitholder will receive this par value per unit in the future.


For Fixed-Income trusts, "S.F." indicates a sinking fund is established with respect to an issue of bonds.The trust portfolio is provided for informational purposes only and should not be deemed as a recommendation to buy or sell the individual securities shown above.



 Important Information About Benchmarks





About risk



There is no assurance that a unit investment trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust. 
An investment in a trust should be made with an understanding of the risks associated therewith, such as the inability of the issuer or an insurer to pay the principal of or interest on a bond when due, volatile interest rates, early call provisions and changes to the tax status of the bonds.
The financial condition of an issuer may worsen or its credit ratings may drop, resulting in a reduction in the value of your Units. This may occur at any point in time, including during the primary offering period.
The value of the bonds will generally fall if interest rates, in general, rise. Given the historically low interest rate environment in the U.S., risks associated with rising rates are heightened. The negative impact on fixed income securities from any interest rate increases could be swift and significant. No one can predict whether interest rates will rise or fall in the future.
A portion of your interest may be subject to state and local taxes.
A credit rating is an assessment provided by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization (NRSRO) of the creditworthiness of an issuer with respect to debt obligations, including specific securities, money market instruments or other debts. Ratings are measured on a scale that generally ranges from AAA/Aaa (highest) to D/C (lowest); ratings are subject to change without notice. For more information on Standard and Poor's rating methodology, please visit www.standardandpoors.com and select "Understanding Ratings" under Rating Resources on the homepage or Moody's at www.moodys.com and select "Rating Methodologies" under Research and Ratings on the homepage.
Please see the information supplement for a discussion of situations in which the Trust may designate previously distributed interest income during the year as taxable net capital gain in order to satisfy certain of the annual distribution requirements for regulated investment companies.
Invesco and its representatives do not provide tax advice. Individuals should consult their personal tax advisors before making any tax-related investment decisions.

1The S&P and Moody's ratings apply to the bonds held by the trust, and not the trust itself.   A Standard & Poor's credit rating is a current opinion of the creditworthiness of an obligor with respect to a specific debt obligation. This opinion of creditworthiness may take into consideration the creditworthiness of guarantors, insurers or other forms of credit enhancement on the obligation.  Moody's municipal ratings are opinions of the investment quality of the issues and issues in the US municipal and tax-exempt markets. As such, these ratings incorporate Moody's assessment of the default probability and loss severity of these issuers and issues.

LIQUIDATION PRICE  Represents the value per unit that a unitholder would receive if the unitholder redeemed or sold units. This price is equal to the net asset value per unit plus any remaining organization costs and creation and development fee. This price reflects any remaining deferred sales charges payable in connection with a liquidation of units.
OFFER PRICE Represents the net asset value per unit plus any applicable organization costs and sales charges. This is the regular public offering price per unit paid to purchase units. This price is often subject to certain sales charge discounts described in a trust prospectus.
NET ASSET VALUE (NAV) Represents the value per unit of a trust's portfolio securities and other assets reduced by trust expenses and other liabilities, including remaining organization costs, deferred sales charges and creation and the development fee.This page contains historical pricing or historical income distributions information for the unit trust listed above. It should not be used for federal or state tax purposes. Please contact your financial advisor for tax information.This information does not constitute an offer to sell, or a solicitation of an offer to buy securities in any state, or other jurisdiction to any person to whom it is not lawful to make such an offer. A trust that contains a state name in the trust name is generally available for sale only to investors in that state. The information shown may relate to a trust that is no longer offered to the public. In such a case, this information does not constitute an offer to sell, or a solicitation of an offer to buy units of the trust. 





1Estimated current return (ECR) is based on the estimated annual income as a percentage of the current price of the units. Estimated long-term return (ELTR) is calculated using a formula which (1) takes into consideration and determines and factors in the relative weightings of the market values, yields (which takes into account the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts) and estimated retirement of all the bonds in the trust and (2) takes into account the expenses and sales charge associated with each trust unit. There can be no assurance that either the estimated current return or ELTR will be realized in the future and an investor's units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
2The ELTR life represents the estimated life of the bonds in a Trust's portfolio determined for the purposes of calculating Estimated Long-Term Return.
3Estimated Annual Income Per Unit is as of close the most recent business day and is based on the estimated cash flows per unit. This amount will vary with changes in expenses, interest rates and the maturity, call or sale of bonds.
4Estimated Daily Rate of Accrual represents the annual interest from the securities within the portfolio divided by the number of days on which interest is calculated annually.
5Represents the principal amount of the underlying bonds per unit. Bonds may be sold to meet redemptions, to pay expenses, and in other limited circumstances. The sale of bonds will affect the principal amount of bonds included in the trust and as a result the principal amount of bonds per unit. There can be no assurance that a unitholder will receive this par value per unit in the future.

About risk



There is no assurance that a unit investment trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust. 
An investment in a trust should be made with an understanding of the risks associated therewith, such as the inability of the issuer or an insurer to pay the principal of or interest on a bond when due, volatile interest rates, early call provisions and changes to the tax status of the bonds.
The financial condition of an issuer may worsen or its credit ratings may drop, resulting in a reduction in the value of your Units. This may occur at any point in time, including during the primary offering period.
The value of the bonds will generally fall if interest rates, in general, rise. Given the historically low interest rate environment in the U.S., risks associated with rising rates are heightened. The negative impact on fixed income securities from any interest rate increases could be swift and significant. No one can predict whether interest rates will rise or fall in the future.

For individual series that have terminated, performance data quoted is from the deposit date through the termination date.Performance data quoted represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate and units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
Returns are cumulative total returns (not annualized) unless labeled as average annual total returns. All returns reflect trust expenses as incurred and assume reinvestment of income and principal distributions, except for trusts that do not offer the option of reinvesting distributions into additional trust units. Please see the related trust prospectus for additional information. Returns do not reflect taxes.
A trust's performance, especially for short time periods, should not be the sole factor in making your investment decision. Please keep in mind that high, double-digit returns are highly unusual and cannot be sustained. Investors should also be aware that these returns were primarily achieved during favorable market conditions.
Returns With Sales Charge reflect the maximum sales charge that would be payable by an investor upon sale or redemption of units at the end of the applicable period(s). The sales charge includes any initial or deferred sales charges other than creation and development fee. These returns do not reflect any creation and development fee prior to collection (generally the close of the initial offering period). Any creation and development fee is reflected in the returns as of the time of payment. by a trust. These returns reflect any contingent deferred sales charges only if the charges would be payable upon a unit sale or redemption at or prior to the end of the applicable performance period(s). Certain trusts are no longer offered for sale to the public and, as a result, do not publish an offer price or have a sales charge. In these cases, returns will not reflect a sales charge if a trust was not actually offered for sale to the public on the first day of the applicable period because units of the trust could not have been purchased by an investor at that time. These returns will show 'N/A' for With Sales Charge data

1Estimated current return (ECR) is based on the estimated annual income as a percentage of the current price of the units. Estimated long-term return (ELTR) is calculated using a formula which (1) takes into consideration and determines and factors in the relative weightings of the market values, yields (which takes into account the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts) and estimated retirement of all the bonds in the trust and (2) takes into account the expenses and sales charge associated with each trust unit. There can be no assurance that either the estimated current return or ELTR will be realized in the future and an investor's units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
2The ELTR life represents the estimated life of the bonds in a Trust's portfolio determined for the purposes of calculating Estimated Long-Term Return.
3Estimated Annual Income Per Unit is as of close the most recent business day and is based on the estimated cash flows per unit. This amount will vary with changes in expenses, interest rates and the maturity, call or sale of bonds.
4Estimated Daily Rate of Accrual represents the annual interest from the securities within the portfolio divided by the number of days on which interest is calculated annually.

A credit rating is an assessment provided by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization (NRSRO) of the creditworthiness of an issuer with respect to debt obligations, including specific securities, money market instruments or other debts.

1Estimated current return (ECR) is based on the estimated annual income as a percentage of the current price of the units. Estimated long-term return (ELTR) is calculated using a formula which (1) takes into consideration and determines and factors in the relative weightings of the market values, yields (which takes into account the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts) and estimated retirement of all the bonds in the trust and (2) takes into account the expenses and sales charge associated with each trust unit. There can be no assurance that either the estimated current return or ELTR will be realized in the future and an investor's units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
2The ELTR life represents the estimated life of the bonds in a Trust's portfolio determined for the purposes of calculating Estimated Long-Term Return.
3Estimated Annual Income Per Unit is as of close the most recent business day and is based on the estimated cash flows per unit. This amount will vary with changes in expenses, interest rates and the maturity, call or sale of bonds.
4Estimated Daily Rate of Accrual represents the annual interest from the securities within the portfolio divided by the number of days on which interest is calculated annually.
5Represents the principal amount of the underlying bonds per unit. Bonds may be sold to meet redemptions, to pay expenses, and in other limited circumstances. The sale of bonds will affect the principal amount of bonds included in the trust and as a result the principal amount of bonds per unit. There can be no assurance that a unitholder will receive this par value per unit in the future.


For Fixed-Income trusts, "S.F." indicates a sinking fund is established with respect to an issue of bonds.The trust portfolio is provided for informational purposes only and should not be deemed as a recommendation to buy or sell the individual securities shown above.



 Important Information About Benchmarks





About risk



There is no assurance that a unit investment trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust.
An investment in the trust should be made with an understanding of the risks associated therewith, such as the inability of the issuer or an insurer to pay the principal of or interest on a bond when due, volatile interest rates, early call provisions and changes to the tax status of the bonds. As interest rates rise, bond prices fall.
Investments in this trust may be subject to interest rate risk. If interest rates rise, the value of the bonds in a trust may decline and if interest rates decline the value of the bonds may increase. Also, the longer the period to maturity, the greater the sensitivity to interest rate changes tends to be.
This trust is concentrated in bonds of issuers in the health care sector. The ability of health care issuers, such as hospitals and hospital systems, to make payments on bonds depends on factors such as facility occupancy levels, government regulation, cost of malpractice insurance and claims, and government financial assistance (such as Medicare and Medicaid).
A bond issuer may cease to be rated or its ratings may be downgraded. Such action may adversely effect the value of the bond in the trust and the value of the units.
Please see the information supplement for a discussion of situations in which the trust may designate previously distributed interest income during the year as taxable net capital gain in order to satisfy certain of the annual distribution requirements for regulated investment companies.
Invesco and its representatives do not provide tax advice. Individuals should consult their personal tax advisors before making any tax-related investment decisions.
A credit rating is an assessment provided by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization (NRSRO) of the creditworthiness of an issuer with respect to debt obligations, including specifi c securities, money market instruments or other debts. Ratings are measured on a scale that generally ranges from AAA/Aaa (highest) to D/C (lowest); ratings are subject to change without notice. For more information on Standard and Poor’s rating methodology, please visit www.standardandpoors.com and select “Understanding Ratings” under Rating Resources on the homepage or Moody’s at www.moodys.com and select “Rating Methodologies” under Research and Ratings on the homepage.

1The S&P and Moody's ratings apply to the bonds held by the trust, and not the trust itself.   A Standard & Poor's credit rating is a current opinion of the creditworthiness of an obligor with respect to a specific debt obligation. This opinion of creditworthiness may take into consideration the creditworthiness of guarantors, insurers or other forms of credit enhancement on the obligation.  Moody's municipal ratings are opinions of the investment quality of the issues and issues in the US municipal and tax-exempt markets. As such, these ratings incorporate Moody's assessment of the default probability and loss severity of these issuers and issues.

Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate and units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
Returns are cumulative total returns (not annualized) unless labeled as average annual total returns. All returns reflect trust expenses as incurred and assume reinvestment of income and principal distributions, except for trusts that do not offer the option of reinvesting distributions into additional trust units. Please see the related trust prospectus for additional information. Returns do not reflect taxes.

Estimated long-term return (ELTR) is calculated using a formula which (1) takes into consideration and determines and factors in the relative weightings of the market values, yields (which takes into account the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts) and estimated retirement of all the bonds in the trust and (2) takes into account the expenses and sales charge associated with each trust unit. There can be no assurance that either the estimated current return or ELTR will be realized in the future and an investor's units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
2The ELTR life represents the estimated life of the bonds in a Trust's portfolio determined for the purposes of calculating Estimated Long-Term Return.

About risk



There is no assurance that a unit investment trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust.
An investment in the trust should be made with an understanding of the risks associated therewith, such as the inability of the issuer or an insurer to pay the principal of or interest on a bond when due, volatile interest rates, early call provisions and changes to the tax status of the bonds. As interest rates rise, bond prices fall.
Investments in this trust may be subject to interest rate risk. If interest rates rise, the value of the bonds in a trust may decline and if interest rates decline the value of the bonds may increase. Also, the longer the period to maturity, the greater the sensitivity to interest rate changes tends to be.
This trust is concentrated in bonds of issuers in the health care sector. The ability of health care issuers, such as hospitals and hospital systems, to make payments on bonds depends on factors such as facility occupancy levels, government regulation, cost of malpractice insurance and claims, and government financial assistance (such as Medicare and Medicaid).
A bond issuer may cease to be rated or its ratings may be downgraded. Such action may adversely effect the value of the bond in the trust and the value of the units.
Please see the information supplement for a discussion of situations in which the trust may designate previously distributed interest income during the year as taxable net capital gain in order to satisfy certain of the annual distribution requirements for regulated investment companies.
Invesco and its representatives do not provide tax advice. Individuals should consult their personal tax advisors before making any tax-related investment decisions.
A credit rating is an assessment provided by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization (NRSRO) of the creditworthiness of an issuer with respect to debt obligations, including specifi c securities, money market instruments or other debts. Ratings are measured on a scale that generally ranges from AAA/Aaa (highest) to D/C (lowest); ratings are subject to change without notice.
