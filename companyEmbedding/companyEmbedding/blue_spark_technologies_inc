					Powered Cards				












				Powered Cards			


Powered Cards, such as “smart cards,” printed display cards, single password proximity cards, and consumer loyalty and gift cards, have become a worldwide trend across a multitude of industries. These interactive powered cards make it possible for people to conduct cashless transactions, track a running balance, gain authorized regular or one-time access to secure sites or high-value technology assets – activities we would have thought impossible with a simple credit card-sized form factor.
Blue Spark’s low-cost thin printed battery solutions provide the perfect power source for all kinds of powered cards, for all kinds of applications. Our 1.5V carbon-zinc batteries offer the compact size, flat profile, flexibility and capacity required – plus they are affordable and completely eco-friendly for easy disposal at the end of the card’s service life. Blue Spark’s UT (hyperlink) Series batteries offer the perfect solution for powered card applications. At less than 500 microns (0.020”), it is the industries thinnest printed battery.
Industries that can benefit from Blue Spark battery solutions for their powered card applications include:

Financial Services
Retail
Entertainment & Hospitality
Transportation & Municipal Transit
Security & Access Control

Are you planning to develop a powered card product or system – or would like an opportunity to move to a lower cost form factor for your existing system?

Biobliss Anit-wrinkle Patch

The Biobliss Patch is a revolutionary new skincare product that can be used in conjunction with current skin care regimens. With proven clinical safety and efficacy in reducing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, Biobliss users have been amazed by the results reducing wrinkles on the forehead and the crow’s feet area around the eyes. While traditional wrinkle creams simply sit on the surface of your skin, requiring hours of wear time for absorption to occur, the Biobliss Patch operates using a micro-current process that gently pushes dermatologist-approved anti-wrinkle ingredients to the surface of the skin. These well-known wrinkle-fighting ingredients, recognized for their ability to reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, are able to diffuse into the surface of the skin much more rapidly as compared to standard creams, reducing the time to see results from weeks or months to just 30 minutes.

Blue Spark Technologies, Inc. Key Developments

Blue Spark Technologies Unveils TempTraq Connect at 2016 Consumer Electronics Show
Jan 5 16
Blue Spark Technologies, Inc. unveiled TempTraq Connect at 2016 Consumer Electronics Show. TempTraq® now offers parents and caregivers the ability to remotely monitor real-time temperature data from anywhere through its new secure TempTraq Connect service. Whether dropping a child off at grandma's for an overnight visit or checking in on a chronically ill parent's recovery, TempTraq Connect makes it possible to stay connected to the ones love, even at a distance. The Bluetooth®, wearable temperature monitor comes in the form of a soft, comfortable patch to provide caregivers with continuous temperature data. Additionally, the patch will also be available in a new extended 48-hour version so temperature can be monitored longer when needed. TempTraq delivers on-the-spot temperature readings in just seconds. The wearable patch alleviates many concerns of those caring for an ill or recovering loved one, including eliminating the need to continually disturb or wake them. TempTraq includes a free downloadable Apple® or Android™ compatible app, allowing users to reach a new level of health care for people of all ages. Unlike other devices that provide users with only one point of data and offer no continuous monitoring or alerts, the TempTraq app displays both real time and historical temperature data transmitted from the patch in graphical or tabular view, making it possible for caregivers to see fluctuations and quickly adapt treatment. TempTraq further simplifies the temperature reading process by providing easy-to-follow colors that indicate temperature levels: Green, less than 100.4°F; orange, equal to or greater than 100.4°F; red, equal to or above the user-set temperature alert level. Caregivers can even receive alerts when a patient's temperature enters this designated red zone. For those who want to share temperature data with their doctors or family members, TempTraq allows users to securely send temperature information via email. Through the app, users can also keep track of when the patient eats, drinks or takes medicine. For those caring for multiple people, the TempTraq app conveniently allows them to monitor multiple patches simultaneously. Manufacturer's suggested retail price is $19.99. It also will be available in Target stores in mid-April.

CLEVELAND, June 1, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Blue Spark Technologies, Inc., a leader in developing thin, flexible, solutions for wearables and medical devices, announced today that the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) issued a Notice of Allowance for U.S. Application Serial Number 14/587626, also referred to as "body temperature logging patch" or better known by its brand name, TempTraq®.

This wearable, Bluetooth® temperature monitor continuously senses, records and sends body temperature for up to 24 or 48 hours to a mobile device through its free downloadable app. A 72-hour version is being tested in leading hospitals as a way to monitor patient body temperatures and detect fevers faster. 
"This historic milestone in our corporate evolution helps us to secure a more competitive position in the wearable, connected health space," said John Gannon, CEO of Blue Spark Technologies and co-inventor of TempTraq. "We are now a major player and the sole developer of this technology, empowering us to improve and transform health care for people of all ages."
The TempTraq system is scalable and can support a single hospital or a multi-hospital/physician group healthcare system. Unlike other devices and methods that provide physicians with only one point of data and offer no continuous monitoring or alerts, TempTraq is the ideal, non-invasive, solution for doctors and nurses who need a continuous, smarter way to track, log and respond to fevers quickly. 
"Our FDA-cleared device experienced huge success and traction with the consumer market in recent years," said Matt Ream, EVP of Marketing and Innovation, and co-inventor of TempTraq. "With this patent, we are ready to deliver a new standard of care to the health care industry by offering a reliable, non-invasive, continuous way to monitor body temperature." 
Also, through TempTraq Connect, a secure, HIPAA-compliant service supported by the Google Healthcare Cloud Platform, the patch may be integrated directly with hospital central monitoring systems and electronic health records (EHR) to safely and securely store patient health care data. Nurses can view the temperature in their system as frequently as needed and can receive real-time audible or visual temperature change alerts at patient bedsides and/or through the central nursing station. Plus, no more waking patients to take their temperatures, and the hygienic, single-use, disposable design eliminates the hassle, time and cost of sterilizing the device between uses.

Spark’s Gesture Mode also includes a new set of advanced gesture recognition capabilities, including PalmControl, Follow, Beckon, and PalmLand.

 Remote Controller

 What mobile device sizes fit inside Spark’s remote controller?


Spark’s remote controller fits mobile devices 6.5‑8.5 mm thick and up to 160 mm long, without a phone case. Mobile devices larger than this do not fit the remote controller’s device holder. 


 How do I update the remote controller firmware?


The remote controller firmware can be updated in DJI GO 4.

 How long does it take to fully charge the remote controller? How long is the battery life?


It takes 2 hours to fully charge the remote controller for up to 2.5 hours of operation. 


How do I link Spark to the remote controller?


Press the Pause, Fn, and C1 buttons at the same time. Once the controller starts beeping, release these buttons. With Spark powered on, press and hold the battery power button. When you hear Spark beep, release this button. Linking is now complete. 

What Wi-Fi frequencies does the remote controller support?


The remote controller supports 2.4 GHz and 5.8 GHz dual‑band Wi‑Fi frequencies. 

What are the dimensions of the remote controller?


The remote controller is approximately 15 cm long, 8 cm high, and 6 cm thick. 

Propulsion


 Do I have to remove the propellers when storing or transporting Spark?


No. Just fold the propellers.

 What happens if the propellers are not fully unfolded before flight? 


Once the rotors start spinning, centrifugal force will automatically unfold the propellers into the correct position. 

Spark’s motors are not all on the same plane. Will this affect flight performance?


No. Each motor sits at a 5° angle for optimal flight performance. 

What wind speeds can Spark resist?


Spark can withstand wind speeds between 13‑18 mph (20‑28 kph).

Video Transmission

What’s the resolution of Spark’s video transmission?


720p 30 fps.

 What’s the latency of Spark’s video transmission?


The video transmission latency to your mobile device is about 200 ms. It is subject to the performance of your mobile device and signal interference. 

What is Spark’s effective transmission range?


When connected to a remote controller: 
2.4 GHz
FCC: 1.2 mi (2 km); CE: 0.3 mi (500 m); SRRC: 0.3 mi (500 m) (unobstructed and free of interference)
5.8 GHz
FCC: 1.2 mi (2 km); CE: 0.18 mi (300 m); SRRC: 0.7 mi (1.2 km) (unobstructed and free of interference)
When connected directly to a mobile device:
A max height of 50 m and distance of 100 m. 

Can frequency bands be manually adjusted during video transmission?


Yes. Users can manually choose between 2.4 GHz and 5.8 GHz or let DJI GO 4 choose a frequency band automatically. 

Where can I check the aircraft Wi-Fi’s username and password?


There are three places where you can check this information: 
a. The battery compartment on the aircraft (only the default Wi-Fi username and password can be found here);
b. The Settings option in DJI Assistant 2 or DJI GO 4;
c. The foam outer box (only the default Wi-Fi username and password can be found here). 


How do I reset or modify Spark’s Wi-Fi username and password?


To reset, hold the power button down for 9 seconds until you hear the aircraft beep three times. 
To modify, connect your mobile device to Spark, enter the DJI GO 4 app, and modify the Wi-Fi username and password in the Connection Help Menu.
 (Note: If Spark is connected with DJI Assistant 2 on a computer, restart the aircraft before resetting the Wi-Fi username and password.) 

 My mobile device does not detect Spark’s Wi-Fi when I turn it on. What should I do?


This may be because Spark was previously connected to the remote controller. To prompt detection, power on the aircraft, then press down on the power button for six seconds until you hear the aircraft beep twice. This indicates that Spark’s Wi-Fi is now detectable on your mobile device. 

Battery

 How do I charge Spark? 


Use the included USB cable to charge Spark. During charging, do not remove the battery from the aircraft.
Use the Charging Hub to charge three batteries simultaneously. If using the Charging Hub, you will need to remove the batteries from the aircraft and place them in the Charging Hub.

 My newly purchased battery is not responding when I press the power button. What should I do? 


New batteries are shipped in Hibernation Mode. In order to activate your newly purchased battery, charge it fully. 

How long does it take to fully charge a battery?


When using a standard USB charger, it takes 80 minutes to fully charge a battery. When using a Charging Hub, it takes 52 minutes to fully charge one battery, 55 minutes when charging two batteries and 85.2 minutes when charging three batteries at the same time.

 How often should I fully charge my Spark batteries?


It is recommended to fully charge Spark batteries at least once every three months. 

When does a battery enter Hibernation Mode?


When a battery is less than 10% charged, it will enter Hibernation Mode after approximately six hours of nonuse. 
When a battery is completely drained, it will enter Hibernation Mode within 10 minutes of turning off.  

 What functions can the power button perform?


a. Turning the battery on and off: Press the power button once, and then press again and hold it down for at least two seconds to turn the battery on or off. 
b. Checking the current battery level: Press the power button once to check the current battery level. 
c. Linking Spark and the remote controller: Hold down on Spark’s power button for three seconds, and release on hearing a beep. Spark’s front indicators will start to flash in red, signifying Spark and the remote controller have been linked. 
d. Delinking Spark and the remote controller: In order to use your mobile device to control Spark, you will need to delink the aircraft and remote controller. Power on Spark, and hold down on Spark’s power button for six seconds until you hear it beep twice. Now Spark and the remote controller have successfully been delinked and you can search for Spark’s Wi-Fi on your mobile device. 
e. Resetting Spark’s Wi-Fi username and password: Hold down on the power button for nine seconds, and release after hearing it beep three times. Your Wi-Fi settings will be reset to the factory default.  
f. PalmLaunch: Power on Spark and place it on your palm with the camera facing you. Make sure your fingers are lower than Spark’s arms. Press the power button twice when the flight indicators start to flash green. The indicators will change to a slowly flashing yellow, and FaceAware will begin to recognize your face. The front indicators will turn to green if detection is successful, and PalmLaunch will be activated. If not, the indicators will flash red. 

 What can I do with the two USB ports on the Charging Hub?


You can charge two mobile devices or your Spark.

Updating Firmware

 Can I use other apps while DJI GO 4 is updating?


No. If you do, the update will fail. You will then need to download the firmware and update again.

 Why does DJI GO 4 remind me to reconnect to Spark’s Wi-Fi right before it restarts to complete the update?


Before the update is complete, Spark will need to restart. Once it does, reconnect your mobile device to Spark’s Wi-Fi. DJI GO 4 is just reminding you that you will need to do this for a successful update. 

 Can I disconnect from the internet once the firmware is downloaded successfully?


Yes.

 If the aircraft or the remote controller battery levels drop below 50% during an update, will the update fail? 


No, but it is recommended that both have a high level of battery charge during the update. 

 What should I do if the aircraft and battery firmware versions are inconsistent?


Connect Spark to DJI GO 4, and the app will inform you of appropriate updates to ensure consistency.

 What should I do if the update is really slow?


Please wait patiently and do not operate Spark or the remote controller during the update. Usually, it takes two minutes to update the remote controller and five minutes to update Spark. If the update process is taking much longer, please check your internet connection or move to a different environment. You could also restart Spark and the remote controller to begin the update again.

 What factors could lead to an update failure?


a. Low battery level. Make sure the battery level is higher than 50%. 
b. Powering off Spark or the remote controller during the update. If this happens, please restart Spark/remote controller and begin the update again.  
c. Internet disconnection when downloading firmware.  
d.Aircraft and remote controller firmware version inconsistency. Use DJI GO 4 to update the aircraft and remote controller to the latest version.    
It is recommended that you use DJI Assistant 2 on your computer to update your aircraft.  
 Please note that Spark will restart once the update finishes.
