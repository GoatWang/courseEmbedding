Jun 1 17

leading direct and indirect sales at national and global levels. Most recently, Lovett was vice president of Oracle CRM Sales in North America.


SnapLogic Delivers AI-Powered Integration Assistant to Accelerate Digital Transformation
May 18 17
SnapLogic announced delivery of its Spring 2017 release, featuring artificial intelligence (AI) technology that promises to dramatically reduce the time and cost of cloud, analytics, and digital transformation initiatives. The first AI-powered feature is SnapLogic Integration Assistant, a recommendation engine that uses machine learning to deliver expert step-by-step guidance for building data pipelines -- with up to 90% accuracy. SnapLogic's Spring 2017 release also introduces new and enhanced features that help customers jumpstart their CRM, HR and cloud data warehousing projects. Specifically, the release includes a new Snap Pack for Microsoft Dynamics 365 CRM integration, and enhanced Snaps for Workday, Anaplan, Amazon Redshift, Confluent, Tableau, and Apache Hive.  The release also includes new Snaps for encrypting and decrypting sensitive data at a granular field level, providing greater security.


SnapLogic, Inc. Unveils Self-Driving Technology to Automate Enterprise Integration
Apr 18 17
SnapLogic announced technology that applies machine learning to enterprise integration dramatically changing the economics of cloud, analytics, and digital transformation initiatives. The new technology, named Iris, uses artificial intelligence to automate highly repetitive development tasks, eliminating integration backlogs that stifle most technology initiatives. Iris uses advanced algorithms to learn from millions of metadata elements and billions of data flows via the SnapLogic Enterprise Integration Cloud. It applies that learning to deliver expert step-by-step guidance, improving the speed and quality of integrations across data, applications, and business processes. The "self-driving" software thus shortens the learning curve for line-of-business users to manage their own data flows, while freeing up technology teams for higher-value design and deployment needs.

Unified Integration Platform

Does your IT organization have one set of integration technologies and people focused on enterprise application integration and another team focused on data integration for business intelligence? Are you struggling with “The Integrator’s Dilemma”?
At SnapLogic, we’re 100% focused on delivering a unified integration platform as a service (iPaaS) that can handle extraction, transformation and load (ETL) or ELT and low-latency enterprise service bus (ESB) requirements without the overhead.


Learn More






















Self-Service User Experience

At SnapLogic we’re focused on simplifying how you connect and automate the integration of all your enterprise data and business applications. Whether you’re focused on meeting the needs of so-called “citizen integrators” or addressing the advanced requirements of integration specialists, SnapLogic’s self-service user interface makes it easy to design, manage and monitor all of your integrations and connect faster.


Learn More






















Modern Architecture

In a world of unstructured and semi-structured data, a rows-and-columns-centric approach to data integration is a big data bottleneck, not an accelerator. If line-of-business agility and real-time integration processing are the requirements, a JSON-centric iPaaS that is entirely REST-based is going to ensure you connect faster.
A 2016 Gartner Magic Quadrant Leader for iPaaS, SnapLogic “supports hybrid deployments and provides rich and differentiating features for analytics and big data integration (Hadooplex).”

Connected: 400+ Snaps

SnapLogic Snaps are modular collections of integration components built for a specific data source, business application, or technology. We have over 400 Snaps and a Snap Development Kit (SDK) for building custom Snaps. Whether you’re powering big data with SnapReduce, adopting cloud applications and cloud analytics, or integrating the Internet of Things with the rest of your enterprise, Snaps are designed to allow you to connect faster.

Why SnapLogic?
“The dilemma for enterprise IT organizations is that their legacy integration technologies were built before the era of big data, social, mobile and cloud computing and simply can’t keep up.”
- Gaurav Dhillon
SnapLogic Founder and CEO














Accelerate Your Enterprise Integration. Accelerate Your Business.

In a world that has never been more connected, how do you ensure that your business data isn’t fragmented? Salesforce, ServiceNow,  the Workday® solution – are they streamlined or SaaS silos? Whether you need real-time app integration, business process automation, better business analytics or big data integration, SnapLogic’s cloud integration solutions deliver an enterprise integration platform as a service (iPaaS) that connects all of your cloud applications, APIs and disparate data sources with the rest of the enterprise.


Learn More ›










Unified Platform: Connect Data, Apps, APIs, Things Faster
The SnapLogic Enterprise Integration Cloud has 400+ Snaps to connect everything from AWS Redshift to Zuora and a streaming architecture that supports real-time, event-based and low-latency enterprise integration requirements and high volume, variety and velocity of big data integration requirements in the same easy-to-use interface. From Ultra Pipelines to Spark Data Pipelines, SnapLogic’s unified iPaaS delivers maximum performance and productivity for all of your legacy and modern big data, cloud application and API integration needs.

Self Service: Citizen and Advanced Integrators
The SnapLogic Enterprise Integration Cloud balances design simplicity with platform power so you can get up and running with a faster time to value. The SnapLogic Enterprise Integration Cloud consists of the Designer, Manager and Monitoring Dashboard, which are HTML5-based and delivered as a multi-tenant cloud service. The Designer allows you to easily snap and assemble orchestrations in a drag-and-drop user interface by choosing from a library of intelligent Snaps that quickly deliver cloud-to-cloud and cloud-to-on-premises integrations. The Manager provides cloud-based administration, auditing, scheduling, notifications and alerts. The Monitoring Dashboard delivers real-time insights into key cloud integration and big data integration metrics and statistics.

Watch a Demo: The SnapLogic Enterprise Integration Cloud










Modern Architecture: Hybrid and Elastic
Unlike traditional ETL and ESB technologies, the SnapLogic Enterprise Integration Cloud is purpose-built for the cloud, meaning there are no legacy components that prevent the data and application integration service from running at cloud speed. Data streams between applications, databases, files, social and big data sources via the Snaplex, a self-upgrading, elastic execution grid. The Snaplex can be easily configured to run in the cloud or behind the firewall, depending on where the majority of your systems and sources reside. It can scale out and in elastically based on the volume of data being processed or the latency requirements of integration flows, and it is built to handle both real-time and batch use cases. The SnapLogic Enterprise Integration Cloud is 100% REST-based so developers and ISV partners can easily embed our award-winning iPaaS into your applications and platforms.

Whitepaper: The SnapLogic Enterprise Integration Cloud - A Technical Overview















Connected: 400+ Snaps
The SnapLogic Enterprise Integration Cloud provides the industry’s widest variety of pre-built application and data integration connectors, called Snaps. Whether you need to connect SaaS applications, analytics, Big Data, ERP, identity management social media, online storage, or technologies like SFTP, Oauth and SOAP, there’s usually a Snap for that. If not, you have the ability to build your own custom Snap using our Java-based Snap SDK. Unlike point-to-point integration tools, SnapLogic allows easy orchestration across multiple endpoints in a single workflow, which we call a pipeline, that can be triggered based on events or scheduled jobs that are called via REST APIs or invoked programmatically via the snAPI.

Connect Data Faster

Go beyond point-to-point cloud integration and eliminate SaaS silos.







Connect Things Faster
A modern platform to connect data, apps, APIs and the Internet of Things (IoT).

Unified Integration Platform

Does your IT organization have one set of integration technologies and people focused on enterprise application integration and another team focused on data integration for business intelligence? Are you struggling with “The Integrator’s Dilemma”?
At SnapLogic, we’re 100% focused on delivering a unified integration platform as a service (iPaaS) that can handle extraction, transformation and load (ETL) or ELT and low-latency enterprise service bus (ESB) requirements without the overhead.


Learn More






















Self-Service User Experience

At SnapLogic we’re focused on simplifying how you connect and automate the integration of all your enterprise data and business applications. Whether you’re focused on meeting the needs of so-called “citizen integrators” or addressing the advanced requirements of integration specialists, SnapLogic’s self-service user interface makes it easy to design, manage and monitor all of your integrations and connect faster.


Learn More






















Modern Architecture

In a world of unstructured and semi-structured data, a rows-and-columns-centric approach to data integration is a big data bottleneck, not an accelerator. If line-of-business agility and real-time integration processing are the requirements, a JSON-centric iPaaS that is entirely REST-based is going to ensure you connect faster.
A 2016 Gartner Magic Quadrant Leader for iPaaS, SnapLogic “supports hybrid deployments and provides rich and differentiating features for analytics and big data integration (Hadooplex).”

Connected: 400+ Snaps

SnapLogic Snaps are modular collections of integration components built for a specific data source, business application, or technology. We have over 400 Snaps and a Snap Development Kit (SDK) for building custom Snaps. Whether you’re powering big data with SnapReduce, adopting cloud applications and cloud analytics, or integrating the Internet of Things with the rest of your enterprise, Snaps are designed to allow you to connect faster.

System Integration Services in a Snap
SnapLogic Snaps are modular collections of integration components built for a specific application or data source. Snaps shield both business users and developers from much of the complexity of the underlying application, data model, and service. Snaps are easy to build and modify, and are based on an open and standardized development environment.
Below are some good examples of the types of Snaps available for the SnapLogic Enterprise Integration Cloud. Be sure to also check out our primary Applications Snaps and Analytics Snaps.
