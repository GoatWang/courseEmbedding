	1) 





	On June 28, 2016, (i) TSG6 PF Investment LLC ("Investment") exchanged 6,483,501 Common Units of Pla-Fit Holdings, LLC ("Holding Units") and 6,483,501 shares of Class B common stock of Planet Fitness, Inc. (the "Company") for 6,483,501 shares of Class A common stock of the Company, and substantially simultaneously sold all 6,483,501 shares of Class A common stock of the Company to the underwriters in the Company's secondary offering, which closed on June 28, 2015 (the "Offering"), and (ii) TSG6 PF Investment II LLC ("Investment II") exchanged 1,037,546 Holding Units of Pla-Fit Holdings, LLC and 1,037,546 shares of Class B common stock of the Company for 1,037,546 shares of Class A common stock of the Company, and substantially simultaneously sold all 1,037,546 shares of Class A common stock of the Company to the underwriters in the Offering.
