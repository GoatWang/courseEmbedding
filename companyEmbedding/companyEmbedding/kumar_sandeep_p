Academic Degrees
B.S. (1991) Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur
M.S. (1993) Pennsylvania State University
Ph.D. (1996) Pennsylvania State University
Research Interests
My primary research interest lies in the area of food engineering. Within food engineering, thermal/aseptic processing of particulate foods using conventional heat exchangers and microwaves is my major area of research. This includes various aspects of fluid mechanics and heat transfer. I also deal with mathematical modeling of velocity and temperature profiles during thermal processing. Developing and using sensors (electronic, enzymatic, thermomagnetic, and microbial) to monitor various aspects of the process is another area that I deal with. All these efforts are geared towards assuring commercial sterility of a product by microbiological validation. Identifying the optimum processing conditions that yields a safe and high quality product is another aspect of food processing that comes under the realms of my research interests. Some of my other areas of research include development of biodegradable packaging material (with the use of extrusion and nanotechnology) and scale-up of mixing and heating operations.
Teaching Activities
I teach the following courses:
• Principles of Food and Bioprocess Engineering (FS 231): Undergraduate level
• Thermal Processing of Foods (FS 741): Graduate level
• Food Packaging (FS 522): Undergraduate and graduate level
Extension and Outreach Activities
I offer the following workshops and short courses for the food industry:
• HTST Equipment, Control and Tests: A Basic Workshop for Dairy Processors
• Thermal Process Design & Calculations
• Conventional and Advanced Thermal Processing Technologies
• Heat Exchangers and their Design
• Continuous Flow Microwave Processing
Service Activities
I serve as the site director for the Center for Advanced Processing and Packaging Studies (CAPPS), a NSF-funded Industry-University Cooperative Research Center.
Our Thermal Analysis Service Center has the capability to determine various thermal and dielectric properties of foods for the food industry. For more information on this, please contact me.
Achievements
Our microwave research group s work has received recognition from IFT (Industrial Achievement Award in 2009), USDA (Superior Efforts in Technology Transfer Award, 2009), and NSF (Compendium of Industry Nominated Technology Breakthroughs). It has also resulted in two commercializations (Yamco, LLC: ~80 jobs; Wright Foods: ~150 jobs).

Features

Presents a thorough and informative account of the usefulness of computation—informatics, data analyses, modeling and simulations—in biopharmaceutical drug development
Shows how using computation at early stages of lead candidate design or selection can help make discovery of biologic drugs more efficient, thus reducing developmental costs as well as attrition rates
Describes applications of computational biophysics to challenges in biopharmaceutical drug development
Demonstrates the importance and need to increase awareness of matters related to biopharmaceutical drug development
Provides a starting point for discovering new applications of computation in biotherapeutics
Summary
Biopharmaceuticals are emerging as frontline medicines to combat several life-threatening and chronic diseases. However, such medicines are expensive to develop and produce on a commercial scale, contributing to rising healthcare costs. Developability of Biotherapeutics: Computational Approaches describes applications of computational and molecular modeling techniques that improve the overall process of discovery and development by removing empiricism.
The concept of developability involves making rational choices at the pre-clinical stages of biopharmaceutical drug development that could positively impact clinical outcomes. The book also addresses a general lack of awareness of the many different contributions that computation can make to biopharmaceutical drug development.
This informative and practical reference is a valuable resource for professionals engaged in industrial research and development, scientists working with regulatory agencies, and pharmacy, medicine, and life science students and educators. It focuses primarily on the developability of monoclonal antibody candidates, but the principles described can also be extended to other modalities such as recombinant proteins, fusion proteins, antibody drug conjugates and vaccines.
The book is organized into two sections. The first discusses principles and applications of computational approaches toward discovering and developing biopharmaceutical drugs. The second presents best practices in developability assessments of early-stage biopharmaceutical drug candidates.
In addition to raising awareness of the promise of computational research, this book also discusses solutions required to improve the success rate of translating biologic drug candidates into products available in the clinic. As such, it is a rich source of information on current principles and practices as well as a starting point for finding innovative applications of computation towards biopharmaceutical drug development.

Reviews
‘Developability of Biotherapeutics: Computational Approaches presents the most extensive and systematic overview to date, of modern computational approaches that are being used industrially to assess potential manufacturability and overall ease of development of biotherapeutics such as monoclonal antibodies.  The book covers a wide array of topics, spanning from immunogenicity and pharmacokinetic/dynamic properties to key chemical and physical stability attributes.  It is recommended as important reading for researchers from both academic and industrial perspectives, and will be of particular interest for graduate students seeking to gain an experienced perspective of the current state of the art and opportunities for high impact research in the future’.

– Christopher J. Roberts, Professor of Chemical & Biomolecular Engineering, University of Delaware.
'Developability of Biotherapeutics: computational approaches" presents a state-of-the art and modern overview on computational approaches for evaluating developability of biotherapeutics. Optimal molecule design and selection is a yet underappreciated and underutilized element of finding, developing, and finally commercializing the best molecule. The optimum molecule not only serves patient needs by ensuring efficacy and safety, but is also optimized from a technical drug product development perspective. This book is a must-read for industrial and academic researchers involved in discovering, identifying and optimizing molecules and transitioning from research to development and beyond.' 

– Prof. Dr. Hanns-Christian Mahler, Head of Drug Product Services, Lonza AG.
‘This book represents a compelling opening salvo to the field of computational methods applied to antibody developability. The chapters are… supported by extensive and timely literature citations: the average number of citations per chapter goes above 90, with over 50% of the references dating to 2009 or later. Developability of Biotherapeutics: Computational Approaches should be a good addition to the libraries of industrial and academic groups engaged in, or supporting, development of biopharmaceutical drugs.’
– Charlotte M. Deane & Maximiliano Vásquez (2016), mAbs, DOI: 10.1080/19420862.2016.1256723.
