Stephen C. Coley Elected Chairman of UL’s Board of Trustees
Underwriters Laboratories (UL), one of the world’s leading product safety testing and certification organizations, announced that Stephen C. Coley has been elected chairman of UL’s board of trustees.

NORTHBROOK, Ill. – June 18, 2010: Underwriters Laboratories (UL), one of the world’s leading product safety testing and certification organizations, announced that Stephen C. Coley has been elected chairman of UL’s board of trustees.
Coley succeeds Fred Marcon, who has been chairman since 2002 and is retiring from UL’s board after 17 years of service.  
“We thank Fred for the guidance he has provided for nearly two decades and look forward to the insight and leadership Steve will offer as chairman of UL’s board of trustees,” said Keith Williams, UL president and CEO.  “His extensive understanding of corporate strategy, growth management and the ever-increasing needs of the global marketplace make him an excellent successor to Fred Marcon.”  
“It is an honor to have been chosen as chairman of a company committed to facilitating technological advancement while addressing public safety concerns,” said Coley, who has been an active member of UL’s board since 2004. “I look forward to helping guide UL’s growth strategy and continue to expand upon the proud tradition of providing global market access with authority and integrity.” 
As Director Emeritus of McKinsey & Company, a global management consulting firm, Coley has led a wide variety of business strategy efforts for technology industry clients and oversaw the firm’s corporate growth practice.
He is also co-author of The Alchemy of Growth, an international best-selling management book, and serves on the boards of directors of Dycom Industries and Flagstone Reinsurance Holdings Ltd., as well as the board of visitors of Duke University Pratt School of Engineering.
Mr. Coley received an M.B.A., with distinction, from Harvard Business School, where he was named a Loeb Fellow in finance.  He has a B.S. in electrical engineering from the Duke University Pratt School of Engineering and served in the U.S. Navy for six years in the naval reactors program.

Article excerpt

  Operational excellence is not the whole story    Successful companies need privileged assets, growth-enabling skills, and special relationships too    How to bundle them into a competitive edge    How did Gillette, a razor blade company, justify spending $7 billion to buy battery maker Duracell? How has SAP, Europe's leading software company, managed to sustain such high growth rates? And how has entrepreneur Li Kashing been able to pull off the kinds of deals in China about which others only dream?    The answer is capabilities: the skills, assets, and relationships that companies assemble to build competitive businesses. Our research into companies that succeed in sustaining growth for long periods reveals that they think broadly about capabilities. Naturally, some rely on operational skill, the narrow definition of capability. But a surprising number from our sample thrived by employing less obvious capabilities.    When businesspeople refer to organizational capabilities, they usually mean the skills embedded in a company's people, processes, and institutional knowledge. These are so basic to survival that they are often referred to as core competencies. In any competitive environment, a company must be good at what it does and possess skills that make it stand out. Distinctive competencies allow growth companies not only to make more money from existing businesses but also to extract greater value from new opportunities.    Important as operational skills or competencies are to a company's success, too narrow a focus on them can stunt growth. A broader definition of capability - one that includes all resources useful in gaining competitive advantage - is required. In addition to operational skill, our definition of capability would include three other classes of resources: privileged assets, growth-enabling skills, and special relationships.    Privileged assets    Privileged assets are physical or intangible assets that are hard to replicate and confer competitive advantage on their owner. They include infrastructure, intellectual property, distribution networks, brands and reputations, and customer information.    Distribution networks. A business can use the scale of its distribution network to increase sales of its existing products and services or to reduce the cost of a new-product launch. For Gillette, the principal motive for its $7 billion acquisition of battery maker Duracell in late 1996 was synergy in distribution. The distribution network that gets Gillette's razor blades into supermarkets and convenience stores - the same outlets where batteries are sold - was second to none. So big was this opportunity that investors added $4.1 billion to the companies' combined capitalization in the two days following the announcement of the deal.    Gillette was able to help Duracell grow by taking it global. This strong domestic player had 50 percent of the US market, but little exposure in such emerging economies as China and India, where Gillette's network was especially strong.    Brands and reputation. Strong brands can be extended to launch products without threatening the credibility of the current business. Gillette has used its brand to enter the market for men's grooming products. The Gillette Series for Men includes products such as aftershave, shaving cream, and deodorant as well as razors and blades. Launched in 1990, the men's Sensor razor achieved $2.9 billion in sales in 1997 alone, with over 60 million users worldwide. Gillette is seeking to beat this record with the MACH3, a three-blade multiangled razor.    Customer information. Detailed information of all kinds can be critical to maximizing sales. Some of the most valuable information involves customers' buying habits and needs. Seven-Eleven Japan's point-of-sale information system helps to ensure that the company has the right product mix for every customer who walks into its stores. …
