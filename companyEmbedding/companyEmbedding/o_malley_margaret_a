5.0 out of 5 starsCoel has a great formulaByRadio Lab Listeneron February 20, 2015Margaret Coel has a fairly standard formula that she follows in the Wind River series, but that is a good thing.  The formula works very well.  OK, it is hard to believe that a priest would be involved closely in so many murders and almost gets killed in every other book (and goes on in the next book without any counseling for PTSD), but one could say the same of the main characters in most good mystery series, e.g., John Sandford, William Kent Krueger, C.J. Box, etc.What is the formula?  Father John O'Malley, a Jesuit Priest on an Arapaho Reservation has been there long enough to gain the trust of the Native Americans, especially the tribe elders.  Thus both whites and Indians go to him as a bridge between cultures when problems, e.g., murders, arise. Vicky Holden is a beautiful, smart, Arapaho lawyer who like Father O'Malley, and O'Malley likes her.  Together they cooperate to solve problems, e.g., murders.  But unlike some novels where the priest gives into passion because "How can I deny that I am a man?" O'Malley and Holden both recognize that crossing the line would change them both, especially O'Malley, in ways that would permanently alter his identity and his value to the community (something that they both recognize to be important).  So, just as O'Malley fights the urge to have a shot of whiskey when he is facing difficult times (he is a recovering alcoholic) he manages to put away thoughts of romantic involvements with Vicky or leaving the priesthood to marry her.  It makes for a realistic tension that dignifies both characters.Coel has really developed interesting characters and has beautiful descriptions of Wyoming.  Her apparent (I can't fully judge) sensitivity to Native American cultures also makes for interesting reading.So I hope that in the later books she doesn't depart too far from her "formula" or her characters who I now count as friends, friends that I enjoy spending time with.I will probably read through all of this series.

3.0 out of 5 starsGood short-term read.ByFoghornon January 11, 2017My Kindle says to expect to polish off these books in about 3 hours each. That's about right.  I don't think they're as rich as Tony Hillerman's, but they are all enjoyable. Ms. Coel keeps some of the same phrases and conventions between her books, and the forbidden romance between Vicki and Fr. O'Malley is sort of predictable, but tasteful.I've enjoyed every one, but won't read any twice.

There was a problem loading comments right now. Please try again later.4.0 out of 5 starsGripping to the end.ByMieczyslaw Kasprzykon February 23, 2012Format: Mass Market Paperback|Verified PurchaseFather O'Malley has his problems and his doubts. He worries constanly about his being a recovering alcoholic (after all, you never really get cured) and agonises about the future of the Mission... and he's always thinking about Vicky. Vicky Holden has her issues as well. Her marriage is broken but her husband will not accept the fact, and professionally she is constantly fighting to help her people against big business or individuals chasing their own agenda. Margaret Coel is good at creating that atmosphere of self-doubt and angst.Father O'Malley has been asked by two of his aged parishoners to locate a young Arapaho man. There are "ghost dancers" causing ripples on the reservation. Vicky's husband, Ben, is causing problems. Just as you think you know where it's going Margaret throws a "curve ball". Who saw THAT coming?Hopes and false hopes, desperation and desperate acts. People missing, murder, confusion... just an ordinary day on the prairie.This might not be Margaret's best book (I almost felt it was awaiting a film contract) but it remains gripping to the end.0Comment|

This time out it's the last Monday in May, the Moon When the Ponies Shed their Shaggy Hair.Despite this poetic beginning, this is one of the most action-packed books in the Wind River Reservation series.Arapaho lawyer Vicki Holden is under suspicion of shooting and killing her ex-husband. And her friend Father John is in danger of losing the St. Francis Mission (the Jesuits think it should be closed because it's barely solvent). And instead of defending the mission, Father John spends his time worrying about Vicki and looking for a young Arapaho man who's gone missing. Meanwhile there's a dangerous cult in the neighborhood bent on establishing a new world for Indians without whites.The plot is rich in complications that keep the reader racing to the next page. The cult with its frenzied dancers has an interesting link to Indian history.These books can be a bit formulaic, but are nonetheless always enjoyable.0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuseCommentInsert product linkPaste the product's web address below:Product not found.

There was a problem loading comments right now. Please try again later.4.0 out of 5 starsI love reading about the Wind River ReservationByM. C. Crammeron September 15, 2003Format: Mass Market Paperback|Verified PurchaseMargaret Coel has a rich sense of place and describes the Arapaho/Shoshone reservation so well you can imagine you've been there many times -- and it is for this and her description of reservation life that I read her books so eagerly.This was a pretty good mystery, involving Jesuit priest/detective John O'Malley and his Arapaho lawyer friend Vicki Holden.  Vicki's ex-husband is found shot to death, and since they had just had a very public fight in a restaurant (and they are well known to have had a very difficult marriage), she is the obvious suspect.  Even her own children suspect her.  She must find the real killer or killers to avoid getting charged (and probably convicted) of this murder.  Her only lead is a fight her ex told her about at dinner -- with two Lakota Indians who had been working for him.  She must find them and discover what the fight was about, since they are obvious suspects.  She believes they are hiding out at a ranch that holds an apocalyptic cult, but the cult is very secretive and locating these two men proves difficult and dangerous.  John O'Malley gets involved, trying to keep Vicki from harm.  He is also looking for someone -- an Arapaho man who has disappeared.  Of course there is a connection between the death of ex-husband Ben Holden and the disappearance of this other man, but that connection is only uncovered late in the story.My only complaint -- and I think Coel is figuring out this can't continue -- is the pointlessness of Vicki and John pining quietly for each other, knowing that nothing but a friendship can result. The "romance" between the two is an annoyance. I keep wanting to tell VIcki to find someone who is actually available (unlike this priest).  This book suggests that Coel may be moving in that direction.11 comment|

Ogdenon November 24, 2014Format: Mass Market Paperback|Verified PurchaseMargaret Coel and the Wind River Reservation mysteries are adicting.  Wind River Reservation is a real place and I am glad she chose this local for her books.  Great characters in "Father John" who is a Jesuit missionary to the reservation and "Vicky Holden" who is a lawyer and an Arapaho Indian.  They make a great team.  Recommend the books but DO READ THEM IN ORDER.  YOU get caught up in the people on the reservation and their stories.0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuseCommentInsert product linkPaste the product's web address below:Product not found.

There was a problem loading comments right now. Please try again later.4.0 out of 5 starsAnother intriguing book by Coel.ByKaren J. Frisbyon January 25, 2013Format: Kindle Edition|Verified PurchaseI enjoyed the book because it's about Native Americans and seems to be realistic.  I like the relationship between Father John and Vicky Holden; I can imagine the conflicts they both face because he's a priest.  This was exciting and held my interest quite well.I tend to read novels set in the Southwest and ones that are anthropologically correct.  Archaeology is my greatest interest, so I do like to read about Southwestern Native Americans.I would recommend the book to people who enjoy mysteries that are well written about Native Americans.  Coel develops her characters well and they seem very realistic.0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuseCommentInsert product linkPaste the product's web address below:Product not found.

Can't get enough of Ms. Coel, and this is a really good one.  Don't ask me for my favorite though, I couldn't pick.  If you like audio books, and mysteries, This is a good pick.  The narrator Stephanie Brush is familiar with Coel's work, and delivers a great rendition.0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuseCommentInsert product linkPaste the product's web address below:Product not found.
