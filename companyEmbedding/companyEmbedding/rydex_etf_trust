START









Build a strong core portfolio
Answer 5 quick questions to start.













Question 1
What do you consider your investment style to be?

Conservative
Moderate
Aggressive





Consider risk versus return


Your comfort with risk can depend on your previous investment experience, performance goals, time horizon, and net worth. In general, the higher return you want, the greater risk you'll have to take.






NEXT



Question 1 of 5





Question 2
If the market sees a big downward swing how would you react?

Do nothing
Invest more



Sell some investments
Sell everything


Pause and reflect


Your risk tolerance is key to deciding on your overall portfolio mix. So even when you know that markets constantly move up and down, you should carefully consider these peaks and valleys - and how much of your total investment you're really willing to risk on a possible long-term downturn.

Question 2 of 5





Question 3
If the market sees a big upward swing how would you react?

Do nothing

Sell some investments

Think of the future


Keeping in mind the constant movement of markets, now consider what you would do in an up market. You should take into consideration not just current gains, but also your long-term financial goals.

Question 4
How long do you plan to keep your assets invested for?

YEARS


Estimating your time horizon


Your investing goal may be far in the future, or it could be right around the corner. How many years you have to reach your goals will shape your portfolio.

Question 4 of 5





Question 5
How much would your initial investment be?







Why does the amount matter?


As your portfolio increases in size you can incorporate a larger number of funds to further diversify your portfolio and access more targeted exposures.




Laying the foundation


No matter how much you have to invest, a well-diversified core can help reduce your overall risk long-term. You can use iShares Core Funds as the essential building blocks of your portfolio and add on other kinds of investments to customize for your specific goals.

What is an ETF?










An ETF (Exchange Traded Fund) is a diversified collection of assets (like a mutual fund) that trades on an exchange (like a stock). ETFs are an easy-to-use, low cost and tax efficient way to invest your money.








What are the benefits of ETFs?
 





iShares Core ETFs have outperformed more than 75% of their mutual fund peers on average over the past 5 years1


 




1/3 the price of atypical mutual fund2

1/2 the tax cost of theaverage active mutual fund3

Word on the street

We took to the streets of San Francisco and asked people, "What is an exchange traded fund?" In their words, here's what they had to say.





What is an exchange traded fund






 







Comparing ETFs and mutual funds
Many investors are familiar with mutual funds. How are ETFs similar? And what makes them different?
Hover over the icons to learn more.


Learn more about the differences in investment strategy, fees,and tax implications of ETFs vs mutual funds.







Similarities




Diversification
You get a diversified collection of stocks and/or bonds, which can potentially help reduce risk compared to individual securities.





Professionally managed
The funds are overseen by professional managers.





Risk and reward
The risk profile of an ETF is derived from its underlying holdings, as with mutual funds.



Differences




Cost
ETFs typically cost less than comparable mutual funds (⅓ the cost, on average), and there are no hidden loads or fees. (Your broker may charge a transaction fee, though many iShares ETFs are available commission-free at providers like Fidelity⁴). What’s more, your taxes may be significantly lower: tax costs for iShares ETFs on average are less than ½ those of the average mutual fund³.





Fund performance
Most ETFs seek to closely match the performance of an established stock or bond index, such as the S&P 500 or the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index. Actively managed mutual funds try to beat the index, which can be hard to do, especially after fees and taxes. iShares Core ETFs have outperformed more than 75% of their mutual fund peers on average over the past five years¹.





Buying and selling
As with stocks, you can buy and sell ETFs at the market price whenever the market is open. Mutual fund shares are purchased directly from the fund at Net Asset Value (NAV) and priced once a day after the market closes.





Knowing what you own
Because ETFs usually aim to track an index, their holdings change relatively little over time – without the “style drift” that may surprise mutual fund investors.

1Morningstar, as of 12/31/2016. Post-tax comparison between the 1, 3 and 5 year returns at NAV of the iShares Core ETFs and the oldest share class of active open-end mutual funds within the same Morningstar categories as the iShares Core ETFs. Mutual funds are generally more tax inefficient than ETFs and, as a result, are typically more negatively impacted than ETFs when comparing performance based on post-tax returns rather than total returns. The number of ETFs and mutual funds used for each period varies based on the inception date of the iShares Core ETFs. iShares Core ETFs included in this comparison vary based on the time period analyzed: 1 year (19 Core ETFs existed for the full 1-year period ended 1/31/15); 3 year (15 Core ETFs existed for the full 3-year period ended 1/31/13); and 5 year (9 Core ETFs existed for the full 5-year period ended 1/31/11). iShares Core ETFs outperformed 77.5% (1955/2426), 84.6% (1804/2157), and 79.9% (1330/1515) of their active mutual fund peers over the 1, 3, and 5 year periods ended 12/31/16, respectively. Performance was averaged for Morningstar categories containing more than one iShares fund, and may be different for other time periods. Returns are calculated after taxes on distributions, including capital gains and dividends, assuming the highest federal tax rate for each type of distribution in effect at the time of the distribution. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. For more information on the differences between iShares ETFs and mutual funds, click here.
2Morningstar, as of 12/31/16. Comparison is between the average Prospectus Net Expense Ratio for the iShares ETFs (0.38%) and the oldest share class of active open-end mutual funds (1.22%) with 10-year track records that were available in the U.S. between 1/1/2007 and 12/31/2016.
3Morningstar, as of 12/31/16. "Tax Cost Ratio" is a Morningstar measure of the impact of taxes on capital gains and income distributions on performance. The average 10-year Tax Cost Ratio of iShares ETFs and the oldest share class of all actively managed open-end mutual funds available in the U.S. between 1/1/2007 and 12/31/2016 (excluding municipal bond and money market funds) included in the comparison is 0.51% and 1.20%, respectively.
4ETFs are subject to a short-term trading fee by Fidelity, if held less than 30 days. Other conditions and fees may apply. See Fidelity.com/commissions for details.  BlackRock is not affiliated with Fidelity or any of their affiliates.





 
Carefully consider the Funds' investment objectives, risk factors, and charges and expenses before investing. This and other information can be found in the Funds' prospectuses or, if available, the summary prospectuses, which may be obtained by visiting the iShares Fund and BlackRock Fund prospectus pages. Read the prospectus carefully before investing.
Investing involves risk, including possible loss of principal.







Fixed income risks include interest-rate and credit risk. Typically, when interest rates rise, there is a corresponding decline in bond values. Credit risk refers to the possibility that the bond issuer will not be able to make principal and interest payments.






International investing involves risks, including risks related to foreign currency, limited liquidity, less government regulation and the possibility of substantial volatility due to adverse political, economic or other developments. These risks often are heightened for investments in emerging/ developing markets or in concentrations of single countries.

Transactions in shares of ETFs will result in brokerage commissions and will generate tax consequences. All regulated investment companies are obliged to distribute portfolio gains to shareholders.






Certain traditional mutual funds can also be tax efficient.

What is an ETF?










An ETF (Exchange Traded Fund) is a diversified collection of assets (like a mutual fund) that trades on an exchange (like a stock). ETFs are an easy-to-use, low cost and tax efficient way to invest your money.








What are the benefits of ETFs?
 





iShares Core ETFs have outperformed more than 75% of their mutual fund peers on average over the past 5 years1


 




1/3 the price of atypical mutual fund2

1/2 the tax cost of theaverage active mutual fund3



 


Learn more about why to use ETFs.






 






Word on the street

We took to the streets of San Francisco and asked people, "What is an exchange traded fund?" In their words, here's what they had to say.





What is an exchange traded fund






 







Comparing ETFs and mutual funds
Many investors are familiar with mutual funds. How are ETFs similar? And what makes them different?
Hover over the icons to learn more.


Learn more about the differences in investment strategy, fees,and tax implications of ETFs vs mutual funds.







Similarities




Diversification
You get a diversified collection of stocks and/or bonds, which can potentially help reduce risk compared to individual securities.





Professionally managed
The funds are overseen by professional managers.





Risk and reward
The risk profile of an ETF is derived from its underlying holdings, as with mutual funds.



Differences




Cost
ETFs typically cost less than comparable mutual funds (⅓ the cost, on average), and there are no hidden loads or fees. (Your broker may charge a transaction fee, though many iShares ETFs are available commission-free at providers like Fidelity⁴). What’s more, your taxes may be significantly lower: tax costs for iShares ETFs on average are less than ½ those of the average mutual fund³.





Fund performance
Most ETFs seek to closely match the performance of an established stock or bond index, such as the S&P 500 or the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index. Actively managed mutual funds try to beat the index, which can be hard to do, especially after fees and taxes. iShares Core ETFs have outperformed more than 75% of their mutual fund peers on average over the past five years¹.





Buying and selling
As with stocks, you can buy and sell ETFs at the market price whenever the market is open. Mutual fund shares are purchased directly from the fund at Net Asset Value (NAV) and priced once a day after the market closes.





Knowing what you own
Because ETFs usually aim to track an index, their holdings change relatively little over time – without the “style drift” that may surprise mutual fund investors.

1Morningstar, as of 12/31/2016. Post-tax comparison between the 1, 3 and 5 year returns at NAV of the iShares Core ETFs and the oldest share class of active open-end mutual funds within the same Morningstar categories as the iShares Core ETFs. Mutual funds are generally more tax inefficient than ETFs and, as a result, are typically more negatively impacted than ETFs when comparing performance based on post-tax returns rather than total returns. The number of ETFs and mutual funds used for each period varies based on the inception date of the iShares Core ETFs. iShares Core ETFs included in this comparison vary based on the time period analyzed: 1 year (19 Core ETFs existed for the full 1-year period ended 1/31/15); 3 year (15 Core ETFs existed for the full 3-year period ended 1/31/13); and 5 year (9 Core ETFs existed for the full 5-year period ended 1/31/11). iShares Core ETFs outperformed 77.5% (1955/2426), 84.6% (1804/2157), and 79.9% (1330/1515) of their active mutual fund peers over the 1, 3, and 5 year periods ended 12/31/16, respectively. Performance was averaged for Morningstar categories containing more than one iShares fund, and may be different for other time periods. Returns are calculated after taxes on distributions, including capital gains and dividends, assuming the highest federal tax rate for each type of distribution in effect at the time of the distribution. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. For more information on the differences between iShares ETFs and mutual funds, click here.
2Morningstar, as of 12/31/16. Comparison is between the average Prospectus Net Expense Ratio for the iShares ETFs (0.38%) and the oldest share class of active open-end mutual funds (1.22%) with 10-year track records that were available in the U.S. between 1/1/2007 and 12/31/2016.
3Morningstar, as of 12/31/16. "Tax Cost Ratio" is a Morningstar measure of the impact of taxes on capital gains and income distributions on performance. The average 10-year Tax Cost Ratio of iShares ETFs and the oldest share class of all actively managed open-end mutual funds available in the U.S. between 1/1/2007 and 12/31/2016 (excluding municipal bond and money market funds) included in the comparison is 0.51% and 1.20%, respectively.
4ETFs are subject to a short-term trading fee by Fidelity, if held less than 30 days. Other conditions and fees may apply. See Fidelity.com/commissions for details.  BlackRock is not affiliated with Fidelity or any of their affiliates.





 
Carefully consider the Funds' investment objectives, risk factors, and charges and expenses before investing. This and other information can be found in the Funds' prospectuses or, if available, the summary prospectuses, which may be obtained by visiting the iShares Fund and BlackRock Fund prospectus pages. Read the prospectus carefully before investing.
Investing involves risk, including possible loss of principal.







Fixed income risks include interest-rate and credit risk. Typically, when interest rates rise, there is a corresponding decline in bond values. Credit risk refers to the possibility that the bond issuer will not be able to make principal and interest payments.






International investing involves risks, including risks related to foreign currency, limited liquidity, less government regulation and the possibility of substantial volatility due to adverse political, economic or other developments. These risks often are heightened for investments in emerging/ developing markets or in concentrations of single countries.

ETF Performance










When low cost funds post solid performance, investors keep more of what they earn.






 






Want to keep more of what you earn?

Investment fees and taxes matter. See how much you could save if you invest with iShares ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds) versus a typical mutual fund.





Want to keep more of what you earn?








Potential savings
When you combine the impact of lower fees, potential tax savings, and performance that seeks to match an index, ETFs may potentially earn you nearly $56,000 over 10 years.







Chart reflects the hypothetical growth of a fictional investment of $250,000 with an 8% return and assumes the reinvestment of dividends and capital gains. Fund expenses, including management fees and other expenses have been deducted. The graph is for illustrative purposes only and is not indicative of the performance of any actual fund or investment portfolio.






 




How iShares ETFs can help you keep more





1/3 the cost of a typical mutual fund1:
Most ETFs aim to match the performance of a benchmark index. This strategy generally requires less frequent turnover of holdings within the fund, so fund fees tend to be lower.



1/2 the tax cost of the average active mutual fund2:
When you sell your mutual fund or ETF at a gain, you will have to pay taxes on that gain. But capital gains taxes can be incurred even if you don’t sell your shares, due to trading activity within your fund. Active mutual funds that frequently buy and sell securities are often subject to higher capital gains distributions. Because most ETFs track an index, they tend to generate fewer undesirable capital gains distributions.



Only 18% of active managers beat their benchmarks after fees over the last five years3:
Because of the more frequent trading and complex strategies in actively-managed funds, fund expenses are higher – so performance has to be good enough to compensate for those higher fees.















Percent of comparable mutual funds that iShares Core ETFs outperformed







Morningstar, as of 12/31/2016. Post-tax comparison between the 1, 3 and 5 year returns at NAV of the iShares Core ETFs and the oldest share class of active open-end mutual funds within the same Morningstar categories as the iShares Core ETFs. Mutual funds are generally more tax inefficient than ETFs and, as a result, are typically more negatively impacted than ETFs when comparing performance based on post-tax returns rather than total returns.

 The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost; current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance for one year and under are cumulative, not annualized. Short term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. For additional information, see the fund(s) prospectus.
Each Direxion Fund share price is calculated as of the close of regular trading, usually as of 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time, each day the New York Stock Exchange is open for business. Each fund seeks to meet its investment objective relative to the value of the target index or benchmark as of 4:00 p.m.
Shares of Direxion Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Market Price returns are based upon the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 PM Eastern time (when NAV is normally determined), and do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times. Fund returns assume that dividends and capital gains distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at NAV. Some performance results reflect expense subsidies and waivers in effect during certain periods shown. Absent these waivers, results would have been less favorable.
After-Tax and After-Tax, Post Sales Returns
Tax-adjusted returns and tax cost ratio are estimates of the impact taxes have had on a fund. We assume the highest tax rate in calculating these figures. These returns follow the SEC guidelines for calculating returns before sale of shares. Tax-adjusted returns show a fund’s annualized after tax total return for the one, three and five year periods, excluding any capital-gains effects that would result from selling the fund at the end of the period. To determine this figure, all income and short-term capital gains distributions are taxed at the maximum federal rate at the time of distribution. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a 15% rate. The after tax portion is then assumed to be reinvested in the fund. State and local taxes are not included in our calculations. For more information, please consult your tax consultant.
Distribution Dates

Payable and Ex-Date – With regard to mutual funds, this is the day on which declared distributions (dividends or capital gains) are deducted from the fund’s assets before it calculates its net asset value (NAV). The NAV per share will drop by the amount of the distribution per share.
Record Date – Date by which a shareholder must officially own shares in order to be entitled to a dividend.

Types of Distributions

Income Dividend – A portion of a company’s profit paid to common and preferred shareholders.
Long Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for more than one year.
Short Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for less than one year

What is an ETF?



The simplest definition of an exchange-traded fund, or ETF, is that it's an investment that's built like a mutual fund but trades like an individual stock.The most common ETFs are designed to track the performance of a market benchmark, or "index."

Enjoy the same built-in benefits of mutual funds








Diversification
One fund can hold potentially hundreds—sometimes thousands—of individual stocks and bonds, which helps spread out risk.
 




Professional management
You don't have to keep track of every single investment your ETF owns. The fund is managed by fund experts who take care of that for you.
 

Get more control with ETFs—at lower costs








While ETFs are in many ways the same as mutual funds, there are some features that make them unique.Trading flexibility
ETFs offer you the same intraday pricing you get when trading stocks and bonds through a broker on a major stock exchange.Lower cost
Funds that track an index, like ETFs and index mutual funds, generally offer lower expense ratios than conventional mutual funds.Tax savings
Like index mutual funds, ETFs are typically more tax-efficient, which could translate into tax savings for you.Lower minimums
You can buy an ETF for as low as the cost of one share—giving you the opportunity to start investing in a diversified investment with less money.

          1. Strategic Insight Simfund/FI Desktop, data as of 7/31/2013. Based on a comparison of total expense ratios for U.S. sector level ETFs with similar holdings and investment objectives (using the MSCI and S&P Global Industry Classification System — GICS) within the universe of 298 ETFs Morningstar has classified as the Sector Stock asset class.

          3. The BlackRock Diversified Income Portfolio is composed of exchange-traded products (ETPs)—primarily exchange-traded funds (ETFs)—but may contain other investment vehicles, such as mutual funds.
	
    

          ETFs are subject to market fluctuation and the risks of their underlying investments. ETFs are subject to management fees and other expenses. Unlike mutual funds, ETF shares are bought and sold at market price, which may be higher or lower than their NAV, and are not individually redeemed from the fund.
	
    

Exchange-traded products (ETPs) are subject to market volatility and the risks of their underlying securities, which may include the risks associated with investing in smaller companies, foreign securities, commodities, and fixed income investments. Foreign securities are subject to interest rate, currency exchange rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets. ETPs that target a small universe of securities, such as a specific region or market sector, are generally subject to greater market volatility, as well as to the specific risks associated with that sector, region, or other focus. ETPs that use derivatives, leverage, or complex investment strategies are subject to additional risks. The return of an index ETP is usually different from that of the index it tracks because of fees, expenses, and tracking error. An ETP may trade at a premium or discount to its net asset value (NAV) (or indicative value in the case of exchange-traded notes). The degree of liquidity can vary significantly from one ETP to another and losses may be magnified if no liquid market exists for the ETP's shares when attempting to sell them. Each ETP has a unique risk profile, detailed in its prospectus, offering circular, or similar material, which should be considered carefully when making investment decisions.

All ratings and reviews are provided to Fidelity on a voluntarily basis and are screened in accordance with the guidelines set forth in our Customer Ratings and Reviews Terms of Use.

Offer Rules:


         
	
	
	       This offer is valid for new or existing Fidelity customers. In order to receive the commission-free trades, you must designate an existing eligible Fidelity IRA or brokerage account or open and fund a new eligible Fidelity IRA or brokerage account with net new assets. Deposits of $50,000-$99,999 will receive 300 free trades, and deposits of $100,000 or more will receive 500 free trades. Trades must be used within 2 years of being credited to the customer’s account. Commission-free trades must be designated to the one account receiving the qualifying assets or amount and are limited to online domestic equities and options trades. Options trades are limited to 20 contracts or less per trade; for orders beyond these limitations, standard commission rates apply. No cash compensation will be given for any unused commission-free trades. Offer is nontransferable, limited to one per individual per rolling 12 months and may not be combined with other offers. Fidelity reserves the right to modify these terms and conditions or terminate this offer at any time. Other terms and conditions, or eligibility criteria may apply.


To be eligible, customers must register online at www.fidelity.com/ATP500free or through a representative. New accounts or designated eligible accounts must be funded within 60 days ("qualification period"). Cash, eligible securities, and/or margin debit balance transfers from multiple sources will be aggregated to determine total account funding; assets will be valued at the time Fidelity receives them. Allow up to seven business days for assets to be registered in the system. Funding must come from an external, non-Fidelity source via any standard monetary transfer method (a standard Transfer of Assets form, check, Electronic Funds Transfer, ADM deposit, etc.); rollovers from a former employer’s Fidelity record kept workplace savings plan are treated as coming from an external source for purposes of this offer. Net new assets mean external new money in minus money out, including distributions and transfers, during the qualification period.


Account holders must maintain a minimum account balance of $50,000 of net new assets for this free trade offer (minus any losses related to trading or market volatility) for at least nine months from the date on which the trades are credited to the account, otherwise commission charges may be incurred retroactively on free trade executions based on the applicable commission rate under Fidelity's Commission & Fee Schedule.


Eligible accounts include non-retirement (Individual or Joint) or Fidelity IRA (Rollover IRA, Traditional IRA, Inherited IRA, Roth IRA, SEP-IRA) accounts in which individual security trading is not prohibited and which meet the minimum account opening or funding requirements.


The promotion is not available for the following account types/products: business accounts (including those opened by union officials); trust accounts; fiduciary accounts (including custodial accounts, estate accounts); non-prototype accounts; college investment trust accounts; 529 college savings plan accounts; Fidelity accounts managed by Strategic Advisers, Inc. (i.e., Portfolio Advisory Services); Institutional Wealth Services (IWS) clients; clients of registered investment advisors working with Fidelity Investments; annuities; and Stock Plan Services accounts. Offer is not valid for non-U.S. residents; persons employed by FINRA or a securities organization in a regulatory capacity; employees of Fidelity, its affiliates, and members of their immediate families and households, or the media who cover financial services. Certain states and local jurisdictions have laws that limit or restrict public employees from accepting items of value from vendors such as Fidelity that provide services to public institutions. Some public entities such as governments, state universities, health care organizations, etc., also have internal policies that may contain similar restrictions. If you are a public official or employee, you should determine if one of these laws or internal policies applies to you. By accepting this incentive, we assume that you are in compliance with your jurisdiction’s laws and institution’s internal policies.

                    The funds may not be suitable for all investors. Certain funds may be affected by risks that include those associated
                    with sector concentration, international investing, investing in small and/or medium size companies, and/or the Funds'
                    possible use of investment techniques and strategies such as leverage, derivatives and short sales of securities and
                    alternative or nontraditional asset classes and strategies such as absolute return, long/short, commodities, currencies
                    and managed futures. Investments in fixed-income securities are subject to the possibility that interest rates could rise,
                    causing the value of the Funds' securities and share price to decline. Please see the Funds' prospectus for more information.
                    Shares of the Funds are not deposits of,
                    or guaranteed or endorsed by, any financial institution; are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC),
                    the Federal Reserve Board, or any other agency; and involve risk, including the possible loss of the principal amount
                    invested. Diversification neither assures a profit nor eliminates the risk of experiencing investment losses.
                

                    The Alternative Funds may not be suitable for all investors because of the sophisticated and aggressive investment
                    techniques the funds employ, such as leverage, derivatives and short selling. Click a fund name above or see a prospectus
                    for additional details on these and other risks.
                


                        Inverse and leveraged Funds are not suitable for all investors. •These Funds should be utilized only by investors who (a)
                        understand the risks associated with the use of leverage, (b) understand the consequences of seeking daily
                        leveraged investment results, (c) understand the risk of shorting, and (d) intend to actively monitor and manage their investments.
                    
                    •The more a Fund invests in leveraged instruments, the more the leverage will magnify any gains or losses on those investments.
                    •Inverse Funds involve certain risks, which include increased volatility due to the Funds' possible use of short sales of
                    securities and derivatives, such as options and futures. •The Funds' use of derivatives, such as futures, options and swap
                    agreements, may expose the Funds' shareholders to additional risks that they would not be subject to if they invested
                    directly in the securities underlying those derivatives. •Short-selling involves increased risks and costs. You risk
                    paying more for a security than you received from its sale. •Leveraged and inverse Funds seek to provide investment
                    results that match the performance of a specific benchmark, before fees and expenses, on a daily basis. Because the
                    Funds seek to track the performance of their benchmark on a daily basis, mathematical compounding, especially with
                    respect to those Funds that use leverage as part of their investment strategy, may prevent a fund from correlating
                    with the monthly, quarterly, annual or other period performance of its benchmark.Due to the compounding of daily returns,
                    leveraged and inverse Funds' returns over periods other than one day will likely differ in amount and possibly direction from
                    the benchmark return for the same period. For those Funds that consistently apply leverage, the value of the fund's shares
                    will tend to increase or decrease more than the value of any increase or decrease in its benchmark index. The Funds rebalance their
                    portfolios on a daily basis, increasing exposure in response to that day's gains or reducing exposure in response to that day's
                    losses. Daily rebalancing will impair a fund's performance if the benchmark experiences volatility. Investors should
                    monitor their leveraged and inverse Funds' holdings consistent with their strategies, as frequently as daily.
                    •For more on these and other risks, please read the prospectus.
                



                            An investment in the U.S. Government Money Market Fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
                            or any other government agency. Although the fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share,
                            it is possible to lose money by investing in the fund.

Summary







 


Overall Rating

4 out of 5 Stars

Morningstar has awarded this fund 4 stars based on its risk-adjusted performance compared to the 24 funds within its Morningstar Category.



How is it determined?


The Overall Morningstar RatingTM for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics, which are based on risk-adjusted returns, as of the date stated.

What does it mean?


A fund's Morningstar Rating is a quantitative assessment of a fund's past performance that accounts for both risk and return, with funds earning between 1 and 5 stars. As always, this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process. A high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision.











 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Average


This fund scores Average because it delivered returns that were in the middle 35% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category:� top 10% - High� next 22.5% - Above Average� middle 35% - Average� next 22.5% - Below Average� bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Expenses


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Average


This fund's expenses are rated as Average because they fall between the 40th and 60th percentiles when compared with other funds in the category.





How is it calculated?


This Morningstar data point compares the fund's net expense ratio to the net expense ratio of all the other funds within its Morningstar Category grouping.





What does it mean?


Excessive expenses can detract from overall returns and can be a drain on performance. While you should not base any investment decision entirely on expenses or expense ratios, a fund's expense structure may be one factor to consider.











 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.






How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

Fund Overview




Objective



The investment seeks capital appreciation.




Strategy



Under normal circumstances, the fund invests substantially all (at least 80%) of its net assets in equity securities of Consumer Products Companies that are traded in the United States and in derivatives, which primarily consist of futures contracts and options on securities, futures contracts, and stock indices. It may invest to a significant extent in the securities of Consumer Products Companies that have small to mid-sized capitalizations. The fund is non-diversified.


Risk



The consumer defensive industries can be significantly affected by demographic and product trends, competitive pricing, food fads, marketing campaigns, environmental factors, government regulation, the performance of the overall economy, interest rates, and consumer confidence. Sector funds can be more volatile because of their narrow concentration in a specific industry. Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, economic or other developments. These risks may be magnified in foreign markets. Additional risk information for this product may be found in the prospectus or other product materials, if available.

Risk


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Below Average

This fund scores Below Average because Morningstar has rated its risk between the 20th and 40th percentiles when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.




How is it calculated?


Risk is calculated using the Sharpe ratio, which compares portfolio returns to a rate comparable to U.S. Treasury bonds, relative to the fund's overall volatility. For this measure, Morningstar has compared the Sharpe ratio of this fund against all other funds that invest in it's Morningstar Category.




What does it mean?


A higher Sharpe implies better risk-adjusted returns. Therefore, if a fund has a Sharpe ratio higher than its category average, it's returns relative to it's risk were better than other similar funds. If its Sharpe ratio is lower, that's usually a sign that the risk-adjusted returns were lower than other similar funds.










 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Average


This fund scores Average because it delivered returns that were in the middle 35% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category:� top 10% - High� next 22.5% - Above Average� middle 35% - Average� next 22.5% - Below Average� bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.






How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

Risk



The consumer defensive industries can be significantly affected by demographic and product trends, competitive pricing, food fads, marketing campaigns, environmental factors, government regulation, the performance of the overall economy, interest rates, and consumer confidence. Sector funds can be more volatile because of their narrow concentration in a specific industry. Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, economic or other developments. These risks may be magnified in foreign markets. Additional risk information for this product may be found in the prospectus or other product materials, if available.

The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. (Exchange-traded funds and open-end mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes.) It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of  funds in each fund category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information. Fidelity does not review the Morningstar data and, for fund performance, you should check the fund's current prospectus or other product materials for the most up-to-date information concerning applicable loads, fees and expenses.

The "Mutual Funds" area at the top of each page allows access to mutual fund holdings with individual and joint Fidelity non-retirement accounts. Individual stock positions, ETFs and 529 funds are not available through this view. For the full list of your holdings visit Portfolio Summary.Mutual Funds are priced as of the previous business day's market close when the market is open. Mutual fund positions are priced as of the official market close (typically 4p.m.) and prices are generally available between 5 p.m. and 6p.m.

The performance data featured represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results.  Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate; therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.  Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.











1. No Transaction Fee funds are available without paying a transaction fee. No Transaction Fee funds will also be offered without a load or on a load waived basis. However, the fund may charge a short term trading fee or a redemption fee. Other fees and expenses, including those which apply to a continued investment in the fund, are described in the fund's current prospectus. Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC ("FBS"), or its affiliates, receives compensation in connection with (i) access to, purchase or redemption of, and/or maintenance of positions in mutual funds and other investment products ("funds"), (ii) infrastructure needed to support such funds as well as additional compensation for shareholder services, start-up fees, infrastructure support and maintenance, and other programs and/or (iii) a fund's attendance at events for FBS's clients and/or representatives, and opportunities for the fund to promote its products and services. This compensation may take the form of sales loads and 12b-1 fees described in the prospectus and/or additional compensation paid by the fund, its investment adviser or an affiliate. Additional information about the source(s) and amount(s) of this compensation as well as any other remuneration received by FBS or its affiliates will be furnished upon request.
2. The funds on the Fund Picks From Fidelity� list are selected based on certain selection criteria. Fund Picks From Fidelity is not a personalized recommendation or endorsement of any fund for an investor's individual circumstances.
3. Total returns are historical and include change in share value and reinvestment of dividends and capital gains, if any. Cumulative total returns are reported as of the period indicated.  Life of fund figures are reported as of the commencement date to the period indicated and are cumulative if the fund is less than one year old. Total returns do not reflect the fund's [%] sales charge. If sales charges were included, total returns would have been lower.
4. The Morningstar Category Average is the average return for the peer group based on the returns of each individual fund within the group, for the period shown. This average assumes reinvestment of dividends.
5. This chart illustrates the performance of a hypothetical $10,000 investment made in this investment product (and a benchmark or category average, if shown) from the beginning date shown or on the inception date of the product (whichever is later).  The inception date used for products with underlying funds, or multiple shares classes, or are offered as a separate account, strategy or sub account, may be the inception date of the underlying fund, the earliest share class of the product, or the date composite performance for the product was first made available. The product's returns may not reflect all its expenses. Any fees not reflected would lower the returns. Benchmark returns include reinvestment of capital gains and dividends, if any, but do not reflect any fees or expenses. It is not possible to invest in an index. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. This chart is not intended to imply any future performance of the investment product.
6. Initial minimum investments into group retirement accounts such as Fidelity Simplified Employee Pension-IRA, Keogh, Self-Employed 401(k), and Non-Fidelity Prototype Retirement accounts are $500 or higher. Additional investments into Regular, IRA, and Group accounts are $250 or higher.
7. The current yield reflects the current earnings of the fund, while the total return refers to a specific past holding period. The 7-Day Yield is the average income return over the previous seven days, assuming the rate stays the same for one year and that dividends are reinvested. It is the Fund's total income net of expenses, divided by the total number of outstanding shares and includes any applicable waiver or reimbursement.
8. Any holdings, asset allocation, diversification breakdowns or other composition data shown are as of the date indicated and are subject to change at any time. They may not be representative of the fund's current or future investments. Some breakdowns may be intentionally limited to a particular asset class or other subset of the fund's entire portfolio, particularly in multi-asset class funds where the attributes of the equity and fixed income portions are different. Under the asset allocation section, international (or foreign) assets may be reported differently depending on how an investment options reports its holdings.  Some do not report international (or foreign) holdings here, but instead report them in a "Regional Diversification" section.  Some report them in this section as an to the equity, bond and other allocation shown.  Others report international (or foreign) holding as a subset of the equity and bond allocations shown.  If the allocation without the foreign component (or round to) 100%, then international (or foreign) is a subset of the equity and bond percentage shown.
9. Percent Rank in Category is the fund's total-return percentile rank relative to all funds that have the same Morningstar Category.  The highest (or most favorable) percentile rank is 1 and the lowest (or least favorable) percentile rank is 100. The top-performing fund in a category will always receive a rank of 1. % Rank in Category is based on total returns which include reinvested dividends and capital gains, if any, and exclude sales charges.
10. StyleMap� depictions of mutual fund characteristics are produced using data and calculations provided by Morningstar, Inc. StyleMapsSM estimate characteristics of a fund's equity holdings over two dimensions: market capitalization and valuation. The percentage of fund assets represented by these holdings is indicated beside each StyleMap. Current StyleMap characteristics are calculated each time Morningstar receives updated portfolio holdings from a fund and are denoted with a dot. Historical StyleMap characteristics are calculated for the shorter of either the past 3 years or the life of the fund, and are represented by the shading of the box(es) previously occupied by the dot. StyleMap characteristics represent an approximate profile of the fund's equity holdings (e.g., domestic stocks, foreign stocks, and American Depositary Receipts), are based on historical data, and are not predictive of the fund's future investments. Although the data are gathered from reliable sources, accuracy and completeness cannot be guaranteed.
11. Please note Regional Diversification information is based on the equity components only.


Generally, data on Fidelity mutual funds is provided by FMR, LLC, Morningstar ratings and data on non-Fidelity mutual funds is provided by Morningstar, Inc. and data on non-mutual fund products is provided by the product's investment manager, trustee or issuer or the plan sponsor whose plan is offering the product to  participants.  Although Fidelity believes the data gathered from these third-party sources is reliable, it does not review such information and cannot warrant it to be accurate, complete or timely.  Fidelity is not responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this third-party information.

ACTION:
Notice of an application for an order under section 6(c) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “Act”) for an exemption from sections 2(a)(32), 5(a)(1), 22(d) and 24(d) of the Act and rule 22c-1 under the Act, and under sections 6(c) and 17(b) of the Act for an exemption from sections 17(a)(1) and (a)(2) of the Act.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee at the Commission's Public Reference Desk, 100 F Street, NE., Washington, DC 20549-0102 (tel. 202-551-5850).
Applicants' Representations
1. The Trust is an open-end management investment company registered under the Act and organized as a Delaware statutory trust. The Trust is authorized to offer an unlimited number of series (the “Funds”). The Advisor is registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (“Advisers Act”). Each Fund will be advised by the Advisor or an entity controlled by or under common control with the Advisor. The Advisor may enter into subadvisory agreements with additional investment advisers to act as subadviser to the Trust and any of its Funds. Any subadviser to the Trust or a Fund will be registered under the Advisers Act. The Distributor is registered as a broker-dealer under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) and will act as the distributor and principal underwriter for each Fund's shares (“Shares”).
2. The Trust currently offers eight series that seek to match the performance of equity securities indices pursuant to the Prior Order. Applicants seek relief to offer additional series with different types of investment objectives (each such series, a “New Fund”). The New Funds will seek daily investment results that correspond, before fees and expenses, to: (a) 125%, 150% or 200% of the return of equity securities indices (“Leveraged Funds”); or (b) move in the opposite direction of the performance of equity securities indices in multiples of 100%, 125%, 150% or 200% (“Inverse Funds”). Applicants propose to initially offer ninety-six New Funds.[2] 

3. In addition to equity securities, the New Funds may invest in short-term debt instruments that meet the definition of “Eligible Security” in rule 2a-7 under the Act (“Money Market Instruments”), and in futures contracts, options, equity caps, collars and floors, swap agreements, forward contracts, and reverse repurchase agreements (collectively, “Financial Instruments”) in order to meet their investment objectives. Leveraged Funds will invest 80% or more of their total assets in equity securities contained in the relevant Underlying Index and up to 20% of their total assets in Financial Instruments and Money Market Instruments. The Inverse Funds will only invest in Financial Instruments and Money Market Instruments; they will not invest in equity securities.
4. The Advisor will seek to achieve the investment objectives of the New Funds by using a mathematical model that takes into account a variety of specified criteria, the most important of which are: (a) The net assets in each New Fund's portfolio at the end of each trading day; (b) the amount of required exposure to the Underlying Index; and (c) the positions in equity securities, Financial Instruments and Money Market Instruments at the beginning of each trading day. On each day that a New Fund is open for business (“Business Day”), including as required by section 22(e) of the Act, the full portfolio holdings of each New Fund will be disclosed on the Web site of the Trust and/or the Exchange where the Shares are primarily listed (“Primary Listing Exchange”). The portfolio holdings information disclosed each Business Day will form the basis for that New Fund's net asset value (“NAV”) calculation as of 4 p.m. that day and will reflect portfolio trades made on the immediately preceding Business Day. Intra-day values of each Underlying Index will be disseminated every 15 seconds throughout the trading day.
5. For the New Funds, applicants expect a daily tracking error of less than 5% (excluding the impact of expenses and interest, if any) to the specified multiple, inverse or inverse multiple, respectively, of the performance of the relevant Underlying Index.
6. Each New Fund will issue Shares in aggregations of 25,000 to 100,000 Shares (each, a “Creation Unit”). Applicants expect the price of a Creation Unit to be a minimum of $1 million. Creation Units may be purchased only by or through the Distributor or a party that has entered into a participant agreement with the Distributor (an “Authorized Participant”). An Authorized Participant must be either (a) a broker-dealer or other participant in the continuous net settlement system of the National Securities Clearing Corporation, a clearing agency that is registered with the Commission, or (b) a participant in the Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) system.
7. Creation Units of Leveraged Funds generally will be purchased and redeemed in exchange for an “in-kind” transfer of securities and cash (“In-Kind Payment”). Inverse Funds will generally be purchased and redeemed entirely for cash because of the limited transferability of Financial Instruments.[3] 
           An investor making an In-Kind Payment will be required to transfer to the Trust a “Deposit Basket” consisting of: (a) A basket of equity securities consisting of some or all of the securities in the relevant Underlying Index or equivalent equity securities selected by the Advisor to correspond to the performance of the Underlying Index (the “Deposit List”); [4] 
           and (b) a cash amount equal to the differential, if any, between the market value of the equity securities in the Deposit Basket and the NAV per Creation Unit (“Balancing Amount”).[5] 
           An investor purchasing a Creation Unit from a New Fund will be charged a fee (“Transaction Fee”) to prevent the dilution of the interests of the remaining shareholders resulting from the New Fund incurring costs in connection with the purchase of the Creation Units.[6] 
           The Start Printed Page 8812maximum Transaction Fee and any variations or waivers of the Transaction Fee will be disclosed in the current prospectus (“Prospectus”) and the method of determining the Transaction Fees will be disclosed in the Prospectus and/or statement of additional information (“SAI”).
8. All orders to purchase Creation Units must be placed on a Business Day with the Distributor. The Distributor also will be responsible for delivering the Prospectus to those persons purchasing Creation Units and for maintaining records of the orders and acknowledgements of acceptance for orders.
9. Persons purchasing Creation Units from a New Fund may hold the Shares or sell some or all of them in the secondary market. Shares of the New Funds will be listed on an Exchange and trade in the secondary market in the same manner as other exchange-traded funds. It is expected that one or more Exchange members will act as a specialist or market maker and maintain a market on the listing Exchange for Shares.[7] 
           The price of Shares traded on an Exchange will be based on a current bid/offer market. The initial trading price for each Share of each New Fund will fall in the range of $50 to $250. Transactions involving the sale of Shares in the secondary market will be subject to customary brokerage commissions and charges.
10. Applicants expect that purchasers of Creation Units will include institutional and retail investors, arbitrageurs, traders, financial advisors, portfolio managers and other market participants.[8] 
           An Exchange specialist or market maker, in providing for a fair and orderly secondary market for Shares, also may purchase or redeem Creation Units for use in its market-making activities. Applicants expect that the market price of Shares will be disciplined by arbitrage opportunities created by the ability to purchase or redeem Creation Units at their NAV, which should ensure that the market price of Shares at or close to 4 p.m. stays close to the NAV on that Business Day.
11. Shares will not be individually redeemable. Shares will only be redeemable in Creation Units through the Distributor, which will act as the Trust's agent for redemption. To redeem, an investor must accumulate enough Shares to constitute a Creation Unit. An investor redeeming a Creation Unit of a Leveraged Fund generally will receive an “in-kind” payment comprised of equity securities published by the Trust's index receipt agent (the “Redemption List”) plus a Balancing Amount equal to the difference between the market value of the equity securities on the Redemption List and the NAV of the Shares being redeemed. Redemptions of Creation Units for Inverse Funds will occur entirely in cash. A redeeming investor will pay a Transaction Fee to offset the transactional expenses associated with redeeming Creation Units.
12. Applicants state that neither the Trust nor any New Fund will be advertised, marketed or otherwise held out as a “mutual fund.” The term “mutual fund” will not be used in the Prospectus except to compare and contrast the Trust or a New Fund with conventional mutual funds. In all marketing materials where the features or methods of obtaining, buying, or selling Creation Units are described or where there is reference to redeemability, applicants will include a prominent statement to the effect that individual Shares are not redeemable except in Creation Units. The same approach will be followed in connection with reports and other communications to shareholders, as well as any other investor education materials issued or circulated in connection with Shares. The Trust will provide copies of its annual and semi-annual shareholder reports to DTC participants for distribution to beneficial holders of Shares.
Applicants' Legal Analysis
1. Applicants request an order under section 6(c) of the Act granting an exemption from sections 2(a)(32), 5(a)(1), 22(d) and 24(d) of the Act and rule 22c-1 under the Act, and under sections 6(c) and 17(b) of the Act granting an exemption from sections 17(a)(1) and 17(a)(2) of the Act.
2. Section 6(c) of the Act provides that the Commission may exempt any person, security or transaction, or any class of persons, securities or transactions, from any provision of the Act, if and to the extent that such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act.
Sections 5(a)(1) and 2(a)(32) of the Act
3. Section 5(a)(1) of the Act defines an “open-end company” as a management investment company that is offering for sale or has outstanding any redeemable security of which it is the issuer. Section 2(a)(32) of the Act defines a redeemable security as any security, other than short-term paper, under the terms of which the holder, upon its presentation to the issuer, is entitled to receive approximately his proportionate share of the issuer's current net assets, or the cash equivalent. Because Shares will not be individually redeemable, applicants request an order that would permit the Trust, which is registered as an open-end management investment company, to issue Shares of New Funds that are redeemable in Creation Units only. Applicants state that investors may always redeem Shares in Creation Units from the Trust. Applicants further state that because the market price of Shares will be disciplined by arbitrage opportunities, investors should be able to sell Shares in the secondary market at or close to 4 p.m. on a Business Day at prices that do not vary substantially from the NAV on that Business Day.
Section 22(d) of the Act and Rule 22c-1 Under the Act
4. Section 22(d) of the Act, among other things, prohibits a dealer from selling a redeemable security, which is currently being offered to the public by or through a principal underwriter, except at a current public offering price described in the prospectus. Rule 22c-1 under the Act generally requires that a dealer selling, redeeming, or repurchasing a redeemable security do so only at a price based on its NAV. Applicants state that secondary market trading in Shares will take place at negotiated prices, not at a current offering price described in the Prospectus as required by section 22(d) of the Act, and not at a price based on NAV as required by rule 22c-1 under the Act. Applicants request an exemption under section 6(c) from these provisions.
5. Applicants assert that the concerns sought to be addressed by section 22(d) of the Act and rule 22c-1 under the Act with respect to pricing are equally satisfied by the proposed method of pricing Shares. Applicants maintain that while there is little legislative history regarding section 22(d), its provisions, as well as those of rule 22c-1, appear to have been intended to (a) prevent dilution caused by certain riskless-Start Printed Page 8813trading schemes by principal underwriters and contract dealers, (b) prevent unjust discrimination or preferential treatment among buyers, and (c) ensure an orderly distribution of shares by eliminating price competition from dealers offering shares at less than the published sales price and repurchasing shares at more than the published redemption price.
6. Applicants believe that none of these purposes will be thwarted by permitting Shares to trade in the secondary market at negotiated prices. Applicants state that (a) secondary market trading in Shares does not involve the Trust's assets and cannot result in dilution of an investment in Shares, and (b) to the extent different prices exist during a given trading day, or from day to day, such variances occur as a result of third-party market forces, such as supply and demand, not as a result of unjust or discriminatory manipulation. Therefore, applicants assert that secondary market transactions in Shares will not lead to discrimination or preferential treatment among purchasers. Finally, applicants contend that the proposed distribution system will be orderly because competitive forces in the marketplace will ensure that the difference between the market price of Shares and their NAV remains narrow.
Section 24(d) of the Act
7. Section 24(d) of the Act provides, in relevant part, that the prospectus delivery exemption provided to dealer transactions by section 4(3) of the Securities Act does not apply to any transaction in a redeemable security issued by an open-end investment company. Applicants request an exemption from section 24(d) to permit dealers selling Shares to rely on the prospectus delivery exemption provided by section 4(3) of the Securities Act.[9] 

8. Applicants state that secondary market investors will regard Shares in a manner similar to other securities, including closed-end fund shares that are listed, bought and sold on an Exchange. Applicants note that shares of closed-end fund investment companies are sold in the secondary market unaccompanied by a prospectus.
9. Applicants contend that Shares, as a listed security, merit a reduction in the compliance costs and regulatory burdens resulting from the imposition of prospectus delivery obligations in the secondary market. Because Shares will be exchange-listed, prospective investors will have access to several types of market information about Shares. Applicants state that information regarding market price and volume will be continually available on a real-time basis throughout the day from the relevant Exchange, automated quotation systems, published or other public sources or on-line information services. Applicants expect that the previous day's closing price and volume information for Shares also will be published daily in the financial section of newspapers. In addition, the Trust expects to maintain a website that includes quantitative information updated on a daily basis, including, for each New Fund, daily trading volume, the NAV and the reported closing price (or in the alternative, the mid-point of the bid-ask spread at the time of calculation of such NAV (the “Bid/Ask Price”)).[10] 
           The Web site will also include, for each New Fund, closing price (or Bid/Ask Price) and data in chart format displaying the frequency distribution of discounts and premiums of the closing price (or Bid/Ask Price) against the NAV, within appropriate ranges, for each of the four previous calendar quarters.
10. Investors also will receive a product description (“Product Description”) describing the Trust, the New Funds and the Shares. Applicants state that, while not intended as a substitute for a Prospectus, the Product Description will contain information about Shares that is tailored to meet the needs of investors purchasing Shares in the secondary market.
Sections 17(a)(1) and (2) of the Act
11. Section 17(a) of the Act generally prohibits an affiliated person of a registered investment company, or an affiliated person of such a person, from selling any security to or purchasing any security from the company. Section 2(a)(3) of the Act defines “affiliated person” to include any person directly or indirectly owning, controlling, or holding with power to vote 5% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the other person and any person directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by, or under common control with, the other person. Section 2(a)(9) of the Act provides that a control relationship will be presumed where one person owns 25% or more of another person's voting securities. Applicants state that one or more holders of Creation Units could own more than 5% of a New Fund, or in excess of 25% of that New Fund, and could be deemed affiliated with the Trust or such New Fund under section 2(a)(3)(A) or 2(a)(3)(C) of the Act. Also, an Exchange specialist or market maker for Shares of any New Fund might accumulate, from time to time, more than 5% or in excess of 25% of that New Fund's Shares. Applicants request an exemption from section 17(a) of the Act under sections 6(c) and 17(b) of the Act, to permit persons that are affiliated persons of the New Funds solely by virtue of a 5% or 25% ownership interest (or affiliated persons of such affiliated persons that are not otherwise affiliated with the New Fund) to purchase and redeem Creation Units through “in-kind” transactions.
12. Section 17(b) of the Act authorizes the Commission to exempt a proposed transaction from section 17(a) of the Act if evidence establishes that the terms of the transaction, including the consideration to be paid or received, are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned, and the proposed transaction is consistent with the policies of the registered investment company and the general provisions of the Act. Applicants contend that no useful purpose would be served by prohibiting the affiliated persons of a New Fund described above from purchasing or redeeming Creation Units through “in-kind” transactions. The deposit and redemption procedures for “in-kind” purchases and redemptions of Creations Units will be effected in exactly the same manner for all purchases and redemptions. The securities contained in the “in-kind” transactions will be valued in the same manner and according to the same standards as the securities held by the Start Printed Page 8814relevant New Fund. Therefore, applicants state that “in-kind” purchases and redemptions will afford no opportunity for the affiliated persons described above to effect a transaction detrimental to the other holders of its Shares. Applicants also believe that “in-kind” purchases and redemptions will not result in abusive self-dealing or overreaching by affiliated persons of the New Funds.
Applicants' Conditions
Applicants agree that any order granting the requested relief will be subject to the following conditions:
1. Applicants will not register a series of the Trust not identified in the application, by means of filing a post-effective amendment to the Trust's registration statement or by any other means, unless applicants have requested and received with respect to such series, either (a) exemptive relief from the Commission, or (b) a no-action letter from the Division of Investment Management of the Commission.
2. The Prospectus and the Product Description will clearly disclose that, for purposes of the Act, Shares are issued by the New Funds and that the acquisition of Shares by investment companies is subject to the restrictions of section 12(d)(1) of the Act, except as permitted by an exemptive order that permits registered investment companies to invest in a New Fund beyond the limits in section 12(d)(1), subject to certain terms and conditions, including that the registered investment company enter into an agreement with the New Fund regarding the terms of the investment.
3. As long as the Trust operates in reliance on the requested order, the Shares will be listed on an Exchange.
4. Neither the Trust nor any New Fund will be advertised or marketed as an open-end fund or a mutual fund. The Prospectus will prominently disclose that Shares are not individually redeemable shares and will disclose that the owners of the Shares may acquire those Shares from the Trust and tender those Shares for redemption to the Trust in Creation Units only. Any advertising material that describes the purchase or sale of Creation Units or refers to redeemability will prominently disclose that Shares are not individually redeemable and that owners of Shares may acquire those Shares from the Trust and tender those Shares for redemption to the Trust in Creation Units only.
5. Before a New Fund may rely on the order, the Commission will have approved, pursuant to rule 19b-4 under the Exchange Act, an Exchange rule or an amendment thereto, requiring Exchange members and member organizations effecting transactions in Shares to deliver a Product Description to purchasers of Shares.
6. The Web site for the Trust, which will be publicly accessible at no charge, will contain the following information, on a per Share basis, for each New Fund: (a) The prior Business Day's NAV and the closing price (or the mid-point of the bid-ask spread at the time of calculation of such NAV (the Bid/Ask Price)), and a calculation of the premium or discount of such closing price (or Bid/Ask Price) against such NAV; and (b) data in chart format displaying the frequency distribution of discounts and premiums of the closing price (or Bid/Ask Price) against the NAV, within appropriate ranges, for each of the four previous calendar quarters (or the life of the New Fund, if shorter). In addition, the Product Description for each New Fund will state that the website for the Trust has information about the premiums and discounts at which the Shares have been traded.
7. The Prospectus and annual report for each New Fund will also include: (a) The information listed in condition 6(b), (i) in the case of the Prospectus, for the most recently completed year (and the most recently completed quarter or quarters, as applicable), and (ii) in the case of the annual report, for the immediately preceding five years (or the life of the New Fund, if shorter); and (b) the following data, calculated on a per Share basis for one, five and ten year periods (or life of the New Fund, if shorter), (i) the cumulative total return and the average annual total return based on NAV and closing price (or Bid/Ask Price), and (ii) the cumulative total return of the relevant Underlying Index.

9.
     Applicants do not seek relief from the prospectus delivery requirement for non-secondary market transactions, such as transactions in which an investor purchases Shares in Creation Units from the issuer or an underwriter. Applicants state that persons purchasing Creation Units will be cautioned in the Prospectus that some activities on their part may, depending on the circumstances, result in their being deemed statutory underwriters and subject them to the prospectus delivery and liability provisions of the Securities Act. The Prospectus will state that whether a person is an underwriter depends upon all the facts and circumstances pertaining to that person's activities. For example, a broker-dealer firm and/or its client may be deemed a statutory underwriter if it takes Creation Units after placing an order with the Distributor, breaks them down into the constituent Shares, and sells Shares directly to its customers, or if it chooses to couple the purchase of a supply of new Shares with an active selling effort involving solicitation of secondary market demand for Shares. The Prospectus also will state that dealers who are not “underwriters” but are participating in a distribution (as contrasted to ordinary secondary market trading transactions), and thus dealing with Shares that are part of an “unsold allotment” within the meaning of section 4(3)(C) of the Securities Act, would be unable to take advantage of the prospectus delivery exemption provided by section 4(3) of the Securities Act.

Another China Yuan ETF: Rydex Launches FXCHHomeMailFlickrTumblrNewsSportsFinanceCelebrityAnswersGroupsMobileMoreYahooSearchSearchSkip to NavigationSkip to Main ContentSkip to Related Content0Another China Yuan ETF: Rydex Launches FXCHMichael JohnstonETF DatabaseOctober 5, 2011ReblogShareTweetShareRydex, the firm behind the CurrencyShares suite of exchange-traded products, made a splash with the latest addition to its product lineup on Tuesday. The recently-launched CurrencyShares Chinese Renminbi Trust (FXCH) will offer exposure to the official currency of the People’s Republic of China, bringing the total number of currency products offered by the company up to ten. “The renminbi has become an important currency in the world, and the China growth story is expected to continue long-term,” said Jim King, an ETF portfolio manager at Rydex|SGI. “The Chinese Renminbi Trust offers investors a way to participate in China’s burgeoning economy, as well as diversify their portfolio with currency exposure,” he said.The value of the Chinese currency, often known as the yuan, has been a hot topic for the last several years. The international community, including Treasury Secretary Geithner, has regularly implied that China has kept the official value of its currency depressed in order to boost exports. Beijing has gradually moved to allow the currency to appreciate, though perhaps at a much slower pace than many would suggest as optimal.The U.S. Senate recently passed a bill that would impose tariffs on exports from countries with undervalued currencies, a list that would presumably be headlined by China. Though the outcome of that legislation in the House is uncertain, the move appeared to frustrate China; the People’s Bank of China issued a statement saying that the bill could “seriously affect” exchange rate reform or potentially lead to a trade war.The general expectation is that the Chinese currency will gradually appreciate against the dollar and other currencies in coming years; FXCH allows investors to participate in that price appreciation. Few expect a rapid acceleration of the renminbi’s valuation; as such, FXCH can be seen as an opportunity for slow, steady growth as opposed to quick appreciation.Under The HoodLike all CurrencyShares products, FXCH is not a “true” 1940 Act exchange-traded fund; rather, it is structured as a grantor trust.  The underlying assets of the fund will consist of Chinese Renminbi-denominated deposits, which allows FXCH to respond to changes in the U.S. dollar price of the Chinese currency. If the renminbi appreciates relative to the greenback, FXCH can be expected to appreciate as well.As part of China’s movement towards a more flexible currency, the government has introduced two versions of the renminbi: an onshore version (CNY) and an offshore version (CNH). That arrangement was set up in order to allow an orderly introduction of the Chinese currency to international trade while still protecting Chinese banks from external shocks.Generally, the offshore version trades at a premium to the onshore renminbi, because it is freely convertible in Hong Kong. Recently, however, that relationship flipped as the value of the offshore currency sank on concerns about the global economy.The currency held by the new trust is the CNH version.China Yuan ETFs ComparedFXCH becomes the third exchange-traded product to offer pure play exposure to the Chinese currency; the two existing products have aggregate assets of close to $600 million. Those include: WisdomTree Dreyfus Chinese Yuan Fund (CYB):   This fund is an actively-managed ETF that seeks returns reflective of both changes in the exchange rate and money market rates available in China. Unlike FXCH, CYB is a true 1940 Act ETF, a distinction that potentially results in more favorable tax treatment. Market Vectors Chinese Renminbi / USD ETN (CNY): This product is an ETN that offers exposure to exchange rate fluctuations. Generally, gains in currency ETNs are taxed as ordinary income.Recent weeks have also seen the introduction of two China bond ETFs that offer exposure to the local currency; Guggenheim debuted its Yuan Bond ETF (RMB) last month, and was immediately followed by the Chinese Yuan Dim Sum Bond Portfolio (DSUM) from PowerShares. Both of those products offer exposure to bonds traded in Hong Kong that are denominated in the local currency.The new CurrencyShares product charges an annual expense ratio of 0.40%, making it cheaper than both CYB (0.45%) and CNY (0.55%).[For more on FXCH, see the official fact sheet or Analyst Take.

Question 1
What do you consider your investment style to be?

Pause and reflect

What is an ETF?










An ETF (Exchange Traded Fund) is a diversified collection of assets (like a mutual fund) that trades on an exchange (like a stock). ETFs are an easy-to-use, low cost and tax efficient way to invest your money.








What are the benefits of ETFs?
 





iShares Core ETFs have outperformed more than 75% of their mutual fund peers on average over the past 5 years1


 




1/3 the price of atypical mutual fund2

1/2 the tax cost of theaverage active mutual fund3

Word on the street

We took to the streets of San Francisco and asked people, "What is an exchange traded fund?" In their words, here's what they had to say.





What is an exchange traded fund






 







Comparing ETFs and mutual funds
Many investors are familiar with mutual funds. How are ETFs similar? And what makes them different?
Hover over the icons to learn more.


Learn more about the differences in investment strategy, fees,and tax implications of ETFs vs mutual funds.







Similarities




Diversification
You get a diversified collection of stocks and/or bonds, which can potentially help reduce risk compared to individual securities.





Professionally managed
The funds are overseen by professional managers.





Risk and reward
The risk profile of an ETF is derived from its underlying holdings, as with mutual funds.



Differences




Cost
ETFs typically cost less than comparable mutual funds (⅓ the cost, on average), and there are no hidden loads or fees. (Your broker may charge a transaction fee, though many iShares ETFs are available commission-free at providers like Fidelity⁴). What’s more, your taxes may be significantly lower: tax costs for iShares ETFs on average are less than ½ those of the average mutual fund³.





Fund performance
Most ETFs seek to closely match the performance of an established stock or bond index, such as the S&P 500 or the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index. Actively managed mutual funds try to beat the index, which can be hard to do, especially after fees and taxes. iShares Core ETFs have outperformed more than 75% of their mutual fund peers on average over the past five years¹.





Buying and selling
As with stocks, you can buy and sell ETFs at the market price whenever the market is open. Mutual fund shares are purchased directly from the fund at Net Asset Value (NAV) and priced once a day after the market closes.





Knowing what you own
Because ETFs usually aim to track an index, their holdings change relatively little over time – without the “style drift” that may surprise mutual fund investors.

1Morningstar, as of 12/31/2016. Post-tax comparison between the 1, 3 and 5 year returns at NAV of the iShares Core ETFs and the oldest share class of active open-end mutual funds within the same Morningstar categories as the iShares Core ETFs. Mutual funds are generally more tax inefficient than ETFs and, as a result, are typically more negatively impacted than ETFs when comparing performance based on post-tax returns rather than total returns. The number of ETFs and mutual funds used for each period varies based on the inception date of the iShares Core ETFs. iShares Core ETFs included in this comparison vary based on the time period analyzed: 1 year (19 Core ETFs existed for the full 1-year period ended 1/31/15); 3 year (15 Core ETFs existed for the full 3-year period ended 1/31/13); and 5 year (9 Core ETFs existed for the full 5-year period ended 1/31/11). iShares Core ETFs outperformed 77.5% (1955/2426), 84.6% (1804/2157), and 79.9% (1330/1515) of their active mutual fund peers over the 1, 3, and 5 year periods ended 12/31/16, respectively. Performance was averaged for Morningstar categories containing more than one iShares fund, and may be different for other time periods. Returns are calculated after taxes on distributions, including capital gains and dividends, assuming the highest federal tax rate for each type of distribution in effect at the time of the distribution. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. For more information on the differences between iShares ETFs and mutual funds, click here.
2Morningstar, as of 12/31/16. Comparison is between the average Prospectus Net Expense Ratio for the iShares ETFs (0.38%) and the oldest share class of active open-end mutual funds (1.22%) with 10-year track records that were available in the U.S. between 1/1/2007 and 12/31/2016.
3Morningstar, as of 12/31/16. "Tax Cost Ratio" is a Morningstar measure of the impact of taxes on capital gains and income distributions on performance. The average 10-year Tax Cost Ratio of iShares ETFs and the oldest share class of all actively managed open-end mutual funds available in the U.S. between 1/1/2007 and 12/31/2016 (excluding municipal bond and money market funds) included in the comparison is 0.51% and 1.20%, respectively.
4ETFs are subject to a short-term trading fee by Fidelity, if held less than 30 days. Other conditions and fees may apply. See Fidelity.com/commissions for details.  BlackRock is not affiliated with Fidelity or any of their affiliates.





 
Carefully consider the Funds' investment objectives, risk factors, and charges and expenses before investing. This and other information can be found in the Funds' prospectuses or, if available, the summary prospectuses, which may be obtained by visiting the iShares Fund and BlackRock Fund prospectus pages. Read the prospectus carefully before investing.
Investing involves risk, including possible loss of principal.







Fixed income risks include interest-rate and credit risk. Typically, when interest rates rise, there is a corresponding decline in bond values. Credit risk refers to the possibility that the bond issuer will not be able to make principal and interest payments.






International investing involves risks, including risks related to foreign currency, limited liquidity, less government regulation and the possibility of substantial volatility due to adverse political, economic or other developments. These risks often are heightened for investments in emerging/ developing markets or in concentrations of single countries.






There is no guarantee that dividends will be paid.






Transactions in shares of ETFs will result in brokerage commissions and will generate tax consequences. All regulated investment companies are obliged to distribute portfolio gains to shareholders.






Certain traditional mutual funds can also be tax efficient.






Investment comparisons are for illustrative purposes only. To better understand the similarities and differences between investments, including investment objectives, risks, fees and expenses, it is important to read the products' prospectuses.






The strategies discussed are strictly for illustrative and educational purposes and are not a recommendation, offer or solicitation to buy or sell any securities or to adopt any investment strategy. There is no guarantee that any strategies discussed will be effective.

ETF Performance










When low cost funds post solid performance, investors keep more of what they earn.






 






Want to keep more of what you earn?

Investment fees and taxes matter. See how much you could save if you invest with iShares ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds) versus a typical mutual fund.





Want to keep more of what you earn?








Potential savings
When you combine the impact of lower fees, potential tax savings, and performance that seeks to match an index, ETFs may potentially earn you nearly $56,000 over 10 years.







Chart reflects the hypothetical growth of a fictional investment of $250,000 with an 8% return and assumes the reinvestment of dividends and capital gains. Fund expenses, including management fees and other expenses have been deducted. The graph is for illustrative purposes only and is not indicative of the performance of any actual fund or investment portfolio.






 




How iShares ETFs can help you keep more





1/3 the cost of a typical mutual fund1:
Most ETFs aim to match the performance of a benchmark index. This strategy generally requires less frequent turnover of holdings within the fund, so fund fees tend to be lower.



1/2 the tax cost of the average active mutual fund2:
When you sell your mutual fund or ETF at a gain, you will have to pay taxes on that gain. But capital gains taxes can be incurred even if you don’t sell your shares, due to trading activity within your fund. Active mutual funds that frequently buy and sell securities are often subject to higher capital gains distributions. Because most ETFs track an index, they tend to generate fewer undesirable capital gains distributions.



Only 18% of active managers beat their benchmarks after fees over the last five years3:
Because of the more frequent trading and complex strategies in actively-managed funds, fund expenses are higher – so performance has to be good enough to compensate for those higher fees.















Percent of comparable mutual funds that iShares Core ETFs outperformed







Morningstar, as of 12/31/2016. Post-tax comparison between the 1, 3 and 5 year returns at NAV of the iShares Core ETFs and the oldest share class of active open-end mutual funds within the same Morningstar categories as the iShares Core ETFs.

 The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost; current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance for one year and under are cumulative, not annualized. Short term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. For additional information, see the fund(s) prospectus.
Each Direxion Fund share price is calculated as of the close of regular trading, usually as of 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time, each day the New York Stock Exchange is open for business. Each fund seeks to meet its investment objective relative to the value of the target index or benchmark as of 4:00 p.m.
Shares of Direxion Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Market Price returns are based upon the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 PM Eastern time (when NAV is normally determined), and do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times. Fund returns assume that dividends and capital gains distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at NAV. Some performance results reflect expense subsidies and waivers in effect during certain periods shown. Absent these waivers, results would have been less favorable.
After-Tax and After-Tax, Post Sales Returns
Tax-adjusted returns and tax cost ratio are estimates of the impact taxes have had on a fund. We assume the highest tax rate in calculating these figures. These returns follow the SEC guidelines for calculating returns before sale of shares. Tax-adjusted returns show a fund’s annualized after tax total return for the one, three and five year periods, excluding any capital-gains effects that would result from selling the fund at the end of the period. To determine this figure, all income and short-term capital gains distributions are taxed at the maximum federal rate at the time of distribution. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a 15% rate. The after tax portion is then assumed to be reinvested in the fund. State and local taxes are not included in our calculations. For more information, please consult your tax consultant.
Distribution Dates

Payable and Ex-Date – With regard to mutual funds, this is the day on which declared distributions (dividends or capital gains) are deducted from the fund’s assets before it calculates its net asset value (NAV). The NAV per share will drop by the amount of the distribution per share.
Record Date – Date by which a shareholder must officially own shares in order to be entitled to a dividend.

Types of Distributions

Income Dividend – A portion of a company’s profit paid to common and preferred shareholders.
Long Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for more than one year.
Short Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for less than one year

What is an ETF?



The simplest definition of an exchange-traded fund, or ETF, is that it's an investment that's built like a mutual fund but trades like an individual stock.The most common ETFs are designed to track the performance of a market benchmark, or "index."

Enjoy the same built-in benefits of mutual funds








Diversification
One fund can hold potentially hundreds—sometimes thousands—of individual stocks and bonds, which helps spread out risk.
 




Professional management
You don't have to keep track of every single investment your ETF owns. The fund is managed by fund experts who take care of that for you.
 

Get more control with ETFs—at lower costs








While ETFs are in many ways the same as mutual funds, there are some features that make them unique.Trading flexibility
ETFs offer you the same intraday pricing you get when trading stocks and bonds through a broker on a major stock exchange.Lower cost
Funds that track an index, like ETFs and index mutual funds, generally offer lower expense ratios than conventional mutual funds.Tax savings
Like index mutual funds, ETFs are typically more tax-efficient, which could translate into tax savings for you.Lower minimums
You can buy an ETF for as low as the cost of one share—giving you the opportunity to start investing in a diversified investment with less money.
See how low-cost, commission-free ETFs are just the start

What is an ETF?



The simplest definition of an exchange-traded fund, or ETF, is that it's an investment that's built like a mutual fund but trades like an individual stock.The most common ETFs are designed to track the performance of a market benchmark, or "index."

Enjoy the same built-in benefits of mutual funds








Diversification
One fund can hold potentially hundreds—sometimes thousands—of individual stocks and bonds, which helps spread out risk.
 




Professional management
You don't have to keep track of every single investment your ETF owns. The fund is managed by fund experts who take care of that for you.
 

Get more control with ETFs—at lower costs








While ETFs are in many ways the same as mutual funds, there are some features that make them unique.Trading flexibility
ETFs offer you the same intraday pricing you get when trading stocks and bonds through a broker on a major stock exchange.Lower cost
Funds that track an index, like ETFs and index mutual funds, generally offer lower expense ratios than conventional mutual funds.Tax savings
Like index mutual funds, ETFs are typically more tax-efficient, which could translate into tax savings for you.Lower minimums
You can buy an ETF for as low as the cost of one share—giving you the opportunity to start investing in a diversified investment with less money.
See how low-cost, commission-free ETFs are just the start

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
