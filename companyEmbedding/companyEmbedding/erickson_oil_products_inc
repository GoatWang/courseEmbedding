FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

Press Releases 



Matrix Announces the Successful Sale of Erickson Oil Products, Inc.
RICHMOND, VA – February 20, 2015 – Matrix Capital Markets Group, Inc. (“Matrix”) announces the successful closing on the sale of one hundred percent of the equity securities of Erickson Oil Products, Inc. and select assets of Team Investments LLC (“Erickson” or the “Company”) to CrossAmerica Partners LP (NYSE: CAPL).  Erickson, headquartered in Hudson, WI, directly operated sixty-four (64) petroleum marketing and retail convenience stores.  Of the sixty-four (64) stores, fifty-nine (59) were owned fee simple with the remaining five (5) sites being leaseholds.  The stores were located in Wisconsin, Minnesota, South Dakota and Michigan.
Freedom Valu Centers, Inc., the retail operating company of Erickson, has a long history in the retail business with continuous ownership and management by the Erickson Family spanning four (4) generations.  The operation evolved from gas stations to gasoline-convenience stores with Claire Erickson and his son David Erickson working side-by-side developing the chain of stores.  In the early 1980s, they re-branded the stores, thus creating the Freedom Valu Centers brand.  David took the helm from his father in 1993, being named the President and CEO.  In 2009, the Company began an aggressive reinvestment into technology, modern pumps, and most noticeably the re-imaging of its stores with the stars & stripes logo.  In the midst of this re-birth of the Freedom brand, David tragically lost his life in a motorcycle accident in July 2010.  Survived by his wife, Debra Erickson, the Company had been owned by trusts of the David Erickson Family and managed by senior executives of the Company, led by Gary Vander Vorst, President and CEO.
Matrix provided merger and acquisition advisory services to Erickson, which included valuation advisory, marketing of the Company through a customized, confidential, structured sale process, and negotiation of the transaction.  The transaction was co-managed by Thomas Kelso, Managing Director and Head of the Downstream Energy & Retail Team and Spencer Cavalier, Managing Director.  Sean Dooley, Senior Associate and Andrew LoPresti, Senior Analyst also advised on the transaction.
Mr. Vander Vorst said, “Matrix did a great job representing the best interests of both our shareholders and employees. We were looking for the right buyer that would be the best fit for our employee culture and also achieve the desired price and transaction structure.  Selling the stock of a 65 year legacy company was a complicated transaction and Matrix provided a high level of professional guidance and support throughout the entire process.  It was more than just a “deal” to Matrix – they sincerely guided us through the financial complexity and emotions involved with the transaction.”
Debi Erickson added, “It was a bittersweet decision for us to sell the company.  But having met Tom, Spencer and Tod over the years and knowing that they knew David and were sensitive to our situation, Matrix felt like the right fit in guiding us through the complex process of finding the right buyer for our company.  Our employees are family and it was important for us to find the perfect fit to preserve our family culture.  Matrix’s professionalism and compassion exceeded our expectations.”
Mr. Cavalier commented, “We know this was a very difficult decision and it was a special honor to be selected by the Erickson family and Mr. Vander Vorst to advise them on the sale of the Company, and we enjoyed working with them and their entire team to successfully accomplish this transaction.  We appreciate the confidence that they had in us, and we are pleased to have helped the Erickson Family achieve their goals.”
Mark Johnson, Noreen Sedgemen, and Tammera Diehm of Winthrop & Weinstine served as legal counsel for Erickson.  James Redpath, CPA, of Redpath & Company, provided tax, accounting and structuring advice.
