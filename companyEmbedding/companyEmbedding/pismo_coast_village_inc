ITEM 2.
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

STATEMENT
ON FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION 
 Certain information included herein contains statements that
may be considered forward-looking statements, such as statements
relating to anticipated expenses, capital spending and financing
sources. Such forward-looking information involves important risks
and uncertainties that could significantly affect anticipated
results in the future and, accordingly, such results may differ
from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made herein.
These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to,
those relating to competitive industry conditions, California
tourism and weather conditions, dependence on existing management,
leverage and debt service, the regulation of the recreational
vehicle industry, domestic or global economic conditions and
changes in federal or state tax laws or the administration of such
laws.

OVERVIEW

 The Company continues to promote and depend upon recreational
vehicle camping as the primary source of revenue. The rental of
campsites to the general public provides income to cover expenses,
complete capital improvements, and allow shareholders up to
forty-five free nights camping annually. Additional revenues come
from RV storage and spotting, RV service and repair, on-site
convenience store, and other ancillary activities such as
laundromat, arcade, and bike rental.

The
Company has been fortunate not to have significant impact due to
the current economy. The RVing public actively seeks accommodations
on the Central Coast despite volatile fuel prices and personal
financial uncertainties. RVing offers an affordable outdoor
recreational experience, and the Company provides quality
facilities and services in a highly popular location. Total site
occupancy is down 2.4% compared to this time last year due to
Spring weather conditions and the current economy. Occupancy
projections look equal to last year throughout the remainder of the
fiscal year. Revenues from ancillary operations such as the store,
arcade, laundromat, and bike rental are flat to slightly down
year-to-date, and management feels this is directly related to the
economy, and this trend will continue throughout the remainder of
the fiscal year.

RV storage
continues to be a major source of income for the Company. Demand is
strong as the new storage property is accepting new customers. RV
storage provides numerous benefits to the customer including: no
stress of towing, no need to own a tow vehicle, use of RV by
multiple family members, and convenience.

After
years with no debt, the Board of Directors approved expansion of
the RV storage program and understood this investment would require
substantial financing. Management has made it a high priority to
effect timely construction and successful marketing in order to
maximize return on this investment.

Ongoing
investment in resort improvements has assured resort guests and
shareholders a top quality up-to-date facility. This quality and
pride of ownership was evident when the National Association of RV
Parks and Campgrounds Park of the Year was awarded to the resort
for 2007-08. In addition, in 2008 the resort was the only industry
rated "A" park in California for customer satisfaction.

The
Company's commitment to quality, value, and enjoyment, is
underscored by the business's success due to word of mouth and
referrals from guests. In addition, investment for online
marketing, ads in the two leading national directories, and trade
magazine advertising formulates most of the business marketing
plan.

RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS 
 The Company develops its income from two sources: (a) Resort
Operations, consisting of revenues generated from RV site rentals,
from RV storage space operations, and from lease revenues from
laundry and arcade operations by third party lessees; and (b)
Retail Operations, consisting of revenues from General Store
operations and from RV parts and service operations.

Income
from Resort Operations for the three-month period ended June 30,
2010, decreased $26,356, or 1.9%, below the same period in 2009.
Resort Income for the nine months ended June 30, 2010, decreased
$65,169, or 2.0%, from the same period ended June 30, 2009. This
decrease in the quarter ending June 30, 2010, is due primarily to a
2.7% decrease in paid site occupancy, and therefore, a $31,880, or
3.1%, decrease in site rental revenue. The decrease in Resort
Operations Income for the nine-month period reflects decreases in
site rental of $11,880, storage and spotting of $49,799, and
recreation of $2,212. Management feels these decreases in revenue
reflect the current economy and year to date decrease in paid site
occupancy of 4.4%.

Seasonal
fluctuations within this industry are expected, and management
projects that income for the fourth quarter will be approximately
40% of its annual revenue. This approximation is based on
historical information.

Income
from Retail Operations for the three-month period ended June 30,
2010, decreased $17,348, or 5.5%, below the same period in 2009.
The General Store decreased revenue by $27,507, or 12.8%, and RV
Service revenue increased $10,161, or 10.3%. Decreased income in
the General Store reflects the business due to decreased site
occupancy and the current economy. The RV Service business is
accessible to the public and fortunate to not be dependant upon the
resort's occupancy. Income from Retail Operations for the
nine-month period ending June 30, 2010, decreased by $41,515, or
5.6%, below the same period ended June 30, 2009. This reflects a
$43,282, or 9.8%, decrease in General Store income and a $1,768, or
0.6%,increase in RV Service income. Management feels this decrease
in revenue from retail operations is a symptom of the economy and
customer's reluctance to spend. The Company anticipates similar
activity in both income from resort operations and retail
operations through the remainder of Fiscal Year 2010.

Operating
Expenses for the quarter ended June 30, 2010, decreased $7,287, or
0.8%, from the same period in 2009. This decrease in expense is
primarily a result of management's effort to reduce labor.
Operating Expenses for the nine-month period ended June 30, 2010,
increased $104,629, or 4.0%, from the same period in 2009. This
increase is primarily due to labor and labor related expenses,
property taxes, utilities, custodial supplies, and vehicle
expense.

Cost of
Goods Sold for 2010 are within projected levels at 51.6% of retail
sales for the quarter and 50.3% year-to-date. Cost of Goods Sold
for 2009 were 44.7% and 46.2% respectively.

Interest
Expense for the three-month and nine-month periods ended June 30,
2010, is $67,880 and $198,103 respectively, compared to $67,122 and
$198,045 the previous year. This expense reflects the financing due
to acquiring new RV storage properties which closed escrow January
11, 2006, April 6, 2006, and May 9, 2008.

Net Income
for the quarter ending June 30, 2010, decreased by $32,983, or
11.9%, compared with the same period ending June 30, 2009. This
quarterly decrease in Net Income is primarily due to decreased
income in resort and retail operations, and increased cost of goods
and depreciation. Net Income for the nine months ending June
30,2010, decreased by $134,704, or 37.0%, compared with the same
period ending June 30, 2009. This decrease in Net Income is a
result of decreased resort and retail income, an increase in
operating expenses, cost of goods, and depreciation. The last
quarter of 2010 is expected to provide adequate resources for
continuing business and provide for planned capital
expenditures.

Management
has introduced various marketing promotions with reduced rates to
increase revenues during low occupancy periods. However, due to the
nature of business and economic cycles and trends, rates may be
adjusted accordingly, if deemed necessary. Although the
supply-demand balance generally remains favorable, future operating
results could be adversely impacted by weak demand. This condition
could limit the Company's ability to pass through inflationary
increases in operating costs as higher rates. Increases in
transportation and fuel costs or sustained recessionary periods
could also unfavorably impact future results. However, the Company
believes that its financial strength and market presence will
enable it to remain extremely competitive.

LIQUIDITY

 The Company planned capital expenditures of approximately
$767,000 in Fiscal Year 2010 to further enhance the resort
facilities and services. Projects include: development of RV
storage property for 900 units, road paving, resort WiFi upgrade,
and new trailer tow vehicle. Road paving was postponed until fiscal
year 2011 and the other projects were completed at a year- to-date
cost of $592,724. Funding for these projects is expected to be from
normal operating cash flows and, if necessary, supplemented with
outside financing. These capital expenditures are expected to
increase the resort's value to its shareholders and the general
public.

Due to the
success of the Company's RV storage program, and the fact that the
storage lots have operated at full capacity, the Board of Directors
elected to purchase additional property. On January 11, 2006, the
Company closed escrow on a 6-acre property already developed as an
RV storage facility. The purchase price was $2.1 million and
included approximately 80 existing storage customers.

On April
6, 2006, the Company purchased a 2.2 acre property the Company had
been renting and using as RV storage. The purchase price for this
property was $925,000. Funding for these acquisitions was obtained
through a local lending institution.

On May 9,
2008, the Company closed escrow on a 19.55 acre property in Arroyo
Grande to be developed for RV storage. The purchase price was
$3,100,000 for the undeveloped land, and permanent financing was
secured from Santa Lucia Bank. This property began taking new
storage units in May of 2010.

The
Company understands the demand for RV storage and feels offering RV
storage compliments the primary business of renting
campsites.

The
Company's current cash position as of June 30, 2010, is $1,697,089
which is 0.9% less than the previous year. This decrease in cash
reflects less net income due to lower occupancy and less retail
revenue. The present level of cash is being maintained in
anticipation of large capital expenditures.

Capital
projects are designed to enhance the marketability of the camping
sites and enhance support facilities. Recognizing the age of the
Resort and increased demands resulting from modern recreational
vehicles, the Board has directed management to provide plans to
update and improve accommodations of the Resort. Future renovation
would include new utilities, larger sites, improved site access,
new restroom facilities, and additional amenities.

Accounts
Receivable for the period ending June 30, 2010 increased $5,698
above June 30, 2009, and reflects additional business from new
storage customers.

Rental
Deposits increased $41,778, or 3.2%, compared to the same period
last year due to site rental rate increases effective October 1,
2009.

Accounts
Payable and accrued liabilities increased $6,306 to an amount of
$140,778 for June 30, 2010, compared to the same period ending
2009. This increase was primarily due to timing of payment of
monthly liabilities. All undisputed payables have been paid in full
according to the Company's policy.

The
Company has consistently demonstrated an ability to optimize
revenues developed from Resort and Retail Operations during the
summer season. During other less revenue producing periods, RV
storage space and site rentals are paid for in advance and used for
Resort improvements and cash reserves. The Company has a revolving
line of credit for $500,000 to augment operating or capital
expenditure cash needs during off season periods. The Company
considers its financial position sufficient to meet its anticipated
future financial requirements. The foregoing information is
forward-looking, based upon certain assumptions of future
performance which may not come to fruition.

REPORT OF
INDEPENDENT REGISTERED
PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the
Board of Directors
Pismo Coast Village, Inc.
Pismo Beach, California

We have
reviewed the accompanying balance sheet of Pismo Coast Village,
Inc. as of June 30, 2010 and 2009, and the related statements of
income and retained earnings and cash flows for the three month and
nine month periods ended June 30, 2010 and 2009. These interim
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's
management.

We
conducted our review in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). A review of
interim financial information consists principally of applying
analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible
for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in
scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of
the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, the objective of
which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial
statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an
opinion.

Based on
our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that
should be made to the accompanying interim financial statements for
them to be in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America.

Top Hotel Deals





































Compare Prices






























Get the Scoop: Here's the Truth About Those 80% Off Sales
Now that we have your attention, are you ready to find out why you shouldn't believe those overhyped advertisements?
First off, those enticing "65% Off!", "70% Off!", and "80% Off!" ads generally refer to "discounts" off the highest-priced, most-restricted ticket classes (refundable, etc.). What the carriers are really saying is that there are cheaper flights out there than the most expensive tickets. News flash! In most cases, they're providing absolutely no support that any of those discounts exist under any circumstances.
Here's the bottom line: Most leisure travelers never actually buy the costliest, most-restricted tickets. Those are generally picked up by business travelers shopping on the company dime. With low-cost airlines, online travel agents, and flexible date searches all factoring in to your price hunting, it's rare that you'd ever pay the highest possible price anyway. So that 80% off "discount" doesn't apply to any flight you're likely to book.
For the best strategy, search flights from a wide variety of providers. Comparing rates is the only way to ensure you're getting a competitive price. It's the closest thing you've got to a foolproof strategy for booking flights. Here are our top tips:

Most domestic airlines release sales on Tuesdays, with the majority of competitors matching these deals within 24 hours. To take advantage of these airfare sales and have the largest amount of seats to choose from, search for fares on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. Historically, Saturdays have also proved fair prices for domestic travel.
When heading to a destination serviced by multiple airports, be sure to check them all to ensure you're getting the best fare. For example, if you're flying to New York City, search for the major airports (JFK, LaGuardia, and Newark), as well as smaller options (Long Island/Islip and White Plains).
Be flexible with your dates. Searching a range of dates gives you a good ballpark budget for what you can expect to spend on airfare.
Search, then search again. Frequently checking fares for your preferred route over a fixed period of time (e.g., once or twice per day over a week or two) gives you an in-depth, realistic understanding of what your airfare costs should be. Then, when you see a price you think is fair, book with confidence, knowing you've locked in the best fare for your route and budget.

BookingBuddy allows you to search various partner sites at once so you can compare the prices and options offered. Offers and savings are based on information available on these sites. There is no guarantee that these prices, savings, hotels, or dates will be available at the time of booking. Please check the site for the most recent details. When you book travel, your booking is handled by one of those sites directly, not by BookingBuddy. Transactions, and all subsequent customer care, are directly handled by the site where you booked your travel. BookingBuddy does not control the price, rules, regulations, or restrictions surrounding the price. Please read all rules and regulations before booking.


Get the Scoop: Here's the Truth About Those 70% Off Hotel Deals
You may have seen an enticing ad boasting huge discounts on hotel rooms. Though it got your attention, the deal's unlikely to hold up when subject to scrutiny. Here, we detail why:

That discount is likely "subtracted" from the room's rack rate (the highest price for the room on specific days during the peak booking season). Since it's unlikely that you'll ever be charged that price, the discount isn't really a discount at all.
Advertisers also like to add "extras" to the room rate to artificially inflate that "70% off" and sometimes even "80% off" claim. This "value" often includes daily breakfast, internet access, and other surcharge-carrying services in the nightly rate. The discount, therefore, isn't based on just the room but is based on all the related services that might not be of use to you.
Hotel rates are constantly changing. If an event is coming to town, room rates will skyrocket since demand is at a premium. Conversely, if there are extended periods of lower vacancy (hurricane season in the Caribbean, for example), room prices plummet. Attempting to determine the value of a percentage savings from such volatile price points is, at best, an inexact science.

Here are our top tips for getting the best hotel deals every time:

Don't only check one site and call it a day. By comparing prices across several providers, major online travel agencies, and your favorite hotel brand's site, you may find that one price point undercuts the rest-or offers a little something extra for the same price.
Go for it, go opaque. You'll see the room class, neighborhood, amenities, price, and reviews before you book, but if you're willing to take a chance with the hotel brand, opaque sites such as our partners Hotwire and Priceline are great ways to save big.
Forget the oranges, only compare apples to apples. Make sure you're comparing the same offerings across providers. And to ensure you're getting an even better deal, you'll want to compare prices for similar room types at all hotels.
Look for discounts. Oftentimes, hotels offer additional savings for AAA and AARP members, students, military personnel and their families, teachers, and other groups.
Join a private sale site. Sign up for a luxury discount-hotels site, such as JetSetter, which offers exclusive, members-only discounts at the finest properties throughout the world.

BookingBuddy allows you to search various partner sites at once so you can compare the prices and options offered. Offers and savings are based on information available on these sites. There is no guarantee that these prices, savings, hotels, or dates will be available at the time of booking. Please check the site for the most recent details. When you book travel, your booking is handled by one of those sites directly, not by BookingBuddy. Transactions, and all subsequent customer care, are directly handled by the site where you booked your travel. BookingBuddy does not control the price, rules, regulations, or restrictions surrounding the price. Please read all rules and regulations before booking.
Always Get Low-Price Guarantees!
You may have seen low- or best-price guarantees for hotel rooms. But what does that low-price guarantee for hotels actually mean? The answer, as you'll see below, is a little complicated. Best-price guarantees for hotels promise the following:

The price you pay for your hotel room is the lowest available. You won't find a cheaper rate for that hotel room during your preferred travel dates anywhere else.
If you find a lower price for your hotel room after booking, you can get that cheaper rate, a refund in the amount of the difference, or a fixed-guarantee payout.

But how can competing hotel providers all guarantee to have the best price for the same hotel room, you ask? The answer is simple: They all have plenty of "out" built in to their "guarantees" to get around those promises. For example:

Most hotel providers only honor identical "apples to apples" claims (e.g. same-class room for the same travel period, etc.), with absolutely no room for deviation. Maybe you're staying two nights; someone else could be getting a better price for one or three nights.
The refund process for hotel price guarantees is typically lengthy and confusing. You might be able to get a refund for said hotel room, but you'll have to work hard for it.

So, how do you know that you're truly getting the lowest price for your hotel room? By comparing hotel prices across several providers, that's how. Shopping around is the closest there is to a foolproof strategy for booking the best hotel rate. Here are our top tips:

Be as flexible as possible.
Know the destination.
Keep in mind seasonality.
Search, and search often.

Get the Scoop: Here's the Truth About Those 70% Off Sales
Now that we have your attention, are you ready to find out why you should be skeptical of such claims - or any other advertisements like it, for that matter?
First and foremost, those enticing "65% Off!", "70% Off!", and "80% Off!" ads often may refer to "discounts" off the highest-priced car rental during peak times, which may not even apply to your needs. It's difficult to pinpoint the actual value in savings you're getting at any given time. Additionally, those advertised prices might just be the base rates, which don't include taxes, fees, or mileage. 
When comparing your ultimate car rental price, keep in mind the following: 

Daily, weekly, and weekend rates typically vary.
Car rental companies charge fees beyond the time and mileage charges of the rental (e.g., taxes, concession recovery fees, vehicle license recovery fees, and customer facility charges).
Some special offers only apply to specific vehicle categories.
There may be holiday, weekend, or other blackout windows for advertised discounts.
Drivers must meet age and other requirements, which may vary by location.

But don't worry, start your rate comparison by checking out the latest deals through BookingBuddy.com.
Here are some examples we found on July 17, 2017:

Hotwire.com: Location - Orlando, FL, from $8/day

Always Get Low-Price Guarantees!You may have seen low- or best-price guarantees for hotel rooms on sites such as Hotels.com, Hilton Hotels, and Travelocity, among countless others. But what does that low-price guarantee for hotels actually mean? The answer, as you'll see below, is a little complicated. 
Best-price guarantees for hotels promise the following:
The price you pay for your hotel room is the lowest available. You won't find a cheaper rate for that hotel room during your preferred travel dates anywhere else.
If you find a lower price for your hotel room after booking, you can get that cheaper rate, a refund in the amount of the difference, or a fixed-guarantee payout.
But how can competing hotel providers all guarantee to have the best price for the same hotel room, you ask? The answer is simple: They all have plenty of "out" built in to their "guarantees" to get around those promises.
For example:  
Most hotel providers only honor identical "apples to apples" claims (e.g. same-class room for the same travel period, etc.), with absolutely no room for deviation. Maybe you're staying two nights; someone else could be getting a better price for one or three nights.
The refund process for hotel price guarantees is typically lengthy and confusing. You might be able to get a refund for said hotel room, but you'll have to work hard for it. 
So, how do you know that you're truly getting the lowest price for your hotel room? By comparing hotel prices across several providers, that's how. Shopping around is the closest there is to a foolproof strategy for booking the best hotel rate. Here are our top tips: 

Be as flexible as possible.
Know the destination. 
Keep in mind seasonality. 
Search, and search often.

Compare Prices






























Get the Scoop: Here's the Truth About Those 80% Off Sales
Now that we have your attention, are you ready to find out why you shouldn't believe those overhyped advertisements?
First off, those enticing "65% Off!", "70% Off!", and "80% Off!" ads generally refer to "discounts" off the highest-priced, most-restricted ticket classes (refundable, etc.). What the carriers are really saying is that there are cheaper flights out there than the most expensive tickets. News flash! In most cases, they're providing absolutely no support that any of those discounts exist under any circumstances.
Here's the bottom line: Most leisure travelers never actually buy the costliest, most-restricted tickets. Those are generally picked up by business travelers shopping on the company dime. With low-cost airlines, online travel agents, and flexible date searches all factoring in to your price hunting, it's rare that you'd ever pay the highest possible price anyway. So that 80% off "discount" doesn't apply to any flight you're likely to book.
For the best strategy, search flights from a wide variety of providers. Comparing rates is the only way to ensure you're getting a competitive price. It's the closest thing you've got to a foolproof strategy for booking flights. Here are our top tips:

Most domestic airlines release sales on Tuesdays, with the majority of competitors matching these deals within 24 hours. To take advantage of these airfare sales and have the largest amount of seats to choose from, search for fares on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. Historically, Saturdays have also proved fair prices for domestic travel.
When heading to a destination serviced by multiple airports, be sure to check them all to ensure you're getting the best fare. For example, if you're flying to New York City, search for the major airports (JFK, LaGuardia, and Newark), as well as smaller options (Long Island/Islip and White Plains).
Be flexible with your dates. Searching a range of dates gives you a good ballpark budget for what you can expect to spend on airfare.
Search, then search again. Frequently checking fares for your preferred route over a fixed period of time (e.g., once or twice per day over a week or two) gives you an in-depth, realistic understanding of what your airfare costs should be. Then, when you see a price you think is fair, book with confidence, knowing you've locked in the best fare for your route and budget.

BookingBuddy allows you to search various partner sites at once so you can compare the prices and options offered. Offers and savings are based on information available on these sites. There is no guarantee that these prices, savings, hotels, or dates will be available at the time of booking. Please check the site for the most recent details.

Get the Scoop: Here's the Truth About Those 70% Off Hotel Deals
You may have seen an enticing ad boasting huge discounts on hotel rooms. Though it got your attention, the deal's unlikely to hold up when subject to scrutiny. Here, we detail why:

That discount is likely "subtracted" from the room's rack rate (the highest price for the room on specific days during the peak booking season). Since it's unlikely that you'll ever be charged that price, the discount isn't really a discount at all.
Advertisers also like to add "extras" to the room rate to artificially inflate that "70% off" and sometimes even "80% off" claim. This "value" often includes daily breakfast, internet access, and other surcharge-carrying services in the nightly rate. The discount, therefore, isn't based on just the room but is based on all the related services that might not be of use to you.
Hotel rates are constantly changing. If an event is coming to town, room rates will skyrocket since demand is at a premium. Conversely, if there are extended periods of lower vacancy (hurricane season in the Caribbean, for example), room prices plummet. Attempting to determine the value of a percentage savings from such volatile price points is, at best, an inexact science.

Here are our top tips for getting the best hotel deals every time:

Don't only check one site and call it a day. By comparing prices across several providers, major online travel agencies, and your favorite hotel brand's site, you may find that one price point undercuts the rest-or offers a little something extra for the same price.
Go for it, go opaque. You'll see the room class, neighborhood, amenities, price, and reviews before you book, but if you're willing to take a chance with the hotel brand, opaque sites such as our partners Hotwire and Priceline are great ways to save big.
Forget the oranges, only compare apples to apples. Make sure you're comparing the same offerings across providers. And to ensure you're getting an even better deal, you'll want to compare prices for similar room types at all hotels.
Look for discounts. Oftentimes, hotels offer additional savings for AAA and AARP members, students, military personnel and their families, teachers, and other groups.
Join a private sale site. Sign up for a luxury discount-hotels site, such as JetSetter, which offers exclusive, members-only discounts at the finest properties throughout the world.

Get the Scoop: Here's the Truth About Those 70% Off Sales
Now that we have your attention, are you ready to find out why you should be skeptical of such claims - or any other advertisements like it, for that matter?
First and foremost, those enticing "65% Off!", "70% Off!", and "80% Off!" ads often may refer to "discounts" off the highest-priced car rental during peak times, which may not even apply to your needs. It's difficult to pinpoint the actual value in savings you're getting at any given time. Additionally, those advertised prices might just be the base rates, which don't include taxes, fees, or mileage. 
When comparing your ultimate car rental price, keep in mind the following: 

Daily, weekly, and weekend rates typically vary.
Car rental companies charge fees beyond the time and mileage charges of the rental (e.g., taxes, concession recovery fees, vehicle license recovery fees, and customer facility charges).
Some special offers only apply to specific vehicle categories.
There may be holiday, weekend, or other blackout windows for advertised discounts.
Drivers must meet age and other requirements, which may vary by location.

But don't worry, start your rate comparison by checking out the latest deals through BookingBuddy.com.

Then, when you see a price you think is fair, book with confidence, knowing you've locked in the best fare for your route and budget.

Get the Scoop: Here's the Truth About Those 70% Off Hotel Deals
You may have seen an enticing ad boasting huge discounts on hotel rooms. Though it got your attention, the deal's unlikely to hold up when subject to scrutiny. Here, we detail why:

That discount is likely "subtracted" from the room's rack rate (the highest price for the room on specific days during the peak booking season). Since it's unlikely that you'll ever be charged that price, the discount isn't really a discount at all.
Advertisers also like to add "extras" to the room rate to artificially inflate that "70% off" and sometimes even "80% off" claim. This "value" often includes daily breakfast, internet access, and other surcharge-carrying services in the nightly rate. The discount, therefore, isn't based on just the room but is based on all the related services that might not be of use to you.
Hotel rates are constantly changing. If an event is coming to town, room rates will skyrocket since demand is at a premium. Conversely, if there are extended periods of lower vacancy (hurricane season in the Caribbean, for example), room prices plummet. Attempting to determine the value of a percentage savings from such volatile price points is, at best, an inexact science.

Here are our top tips for getting the best hotel deals every time:

Don't only check one site and call it a day. By comparing prices across several providers, major online travel agencies, and your favorite hotel brand's site, you may find that one price point undercuts the rest-or offers a little something extra for the same price.
Go for it, go opaque. You'll see the room class, neighborhood, amenities, price, and reviews before you book, but if you're willing to take a chance with the hotel brand, opaque sites such as our partners Hotwire and Priceline are great ways to save big.
Forget the oranges, only compare apples to apples. Make sure you're comparing the same offerings across providers. And to ensure you're getting an even better deal, you'll want to compare prices for similar room types at all hotels.
Look for discounts. Oftentimes, hotels offer additional savings for AAA and AARP members, students, military personnel and their families, teachers, and other groups.
Join a private sale site. Sign up for a luxury discount-hotels site, such as JetSetter, which offers exclusive, members-only discounts at the finest properties throughout the world.

BookingBuddy does not control the price, rules, regulations, or restrictions surrounding the price. Please read all rules and regulations before booking.
Always Get Low-Price Guarantees!
You may have seen low- or best-price guarantees for hotel rooms. But what does that low-price guarantee for hotels actually mean? The answer, as you'll see below, is a little complicated. Best-price guarantees for hotels promise the following:

The price you pay for your hotel room is the lowest available. You won't find a cheaper rate for that hotel room during your preferred travel dates anywhere else.
If you find a lower price for your hotel room after booking, you can get that cheaper rate, a refund in the amount of the difference, or a fixed-guarantee payout.

But how can competing hotel providers all guarantee to have the best price for the same hotel room, you ask? The answer is simple: They all have plenty of "out" built in to their "guarantees" to get around those promises. For example:

Most hotel providers only honor identical "apples to apples" claims (e.g. same-class room for the same travel period, etc.), with absolutely no room for deviation. Maybe you're staying two nights; someone else could be getting a better price for one or three nights.
The refund process for hotel price guarantees is typically lengthy and confusing. You might be able to get a refund for said hotel room, but you'll have to work hard for it.

So, how do you know that you're truly getting the lowest price for your hotel room? By comparing hotel prices across several providers, that's how. Shopping around is the closest there is to a foolproof strategy for booking the best hotel rate. Here are our top tips:

Be as flexible as possible.
Know the destination.
Keep in mind seasonality.
Search, and search often.

Get the Scoop: Here's the Truth About Those 70% Off Sales
Now that we have your attention, are you ready to find out why you should be skeptical of such claims - or any other advertisements like it, for that matter?
First and foremost, those enticing "65% Off!", "70% Off!", and "80% Off!" ads often may refer to "discounts" off the highest-priced car rental during peak times, which may not even apply to your needs. It's difficult to pinpoint the actual value in savings you're getting at any given time. Additionally, those advertised prices might just be the base rates, which don't include taxes, fees, or mileage. 
When comparing your ultimate car rental price, keep in mind the following: 

Daily, weekly, and weekend rates typically vary.
Car rental companies charge fees beyond the time and mileage charges of the rental (e.g., taxes, concession recovery fees, vehicle license recovery fees, and customer facility charges).
Some special offers only apply to specific vehicle categories.
There may be holiday, weekend, or other blackout windows for advertised discounts.
Drivers must meet age and other requirements, which may vary by location.

But don't worry, start your rate comparison by checking out the latest deals through BookingBuddy.com.
