     State Bar of Georgia Honors Allan J. Tanenbaum for Service as ABA Delegate
January 17, 2013
Contact: Sarah I. Coole or sarahc@gabar.org
Atlanta – At its Midyear Meeting on Jan. 12, the State Bar of Georgia approved a resolution honoring Allan J. Tanenbaum, general counsel and managing partner of Equicorp Partners in Atlanta, for his 13 years of service while representing Georgia in the House of Delegates of the American Bar Association (ABA).
Tanenbaum recently retired from his position in the ABA House of Delegates, where he demonstrated his commitment to charitable giving and community service through the Truancy Intervention Project and as a tremendous fund raiser for the ABA, having served as chairman of the Fund for Justice & Education Council, the charitable arm of the ABA, which funds a variety of public service projects and provides scholarships for minority students to attend law school.
He also developed the first white paper on an expanded Fund for Justice & Education Council, which as a result is now conducting an extensive study to evaluate the opportunities for increasing revenue from outside sources to support ABA programs, including the establishment of a fully operational ABA Resource Development Office. Among other ABA leadership roles, Tanenbaum chaired its Division on Public Education and Commission on Partnership Programs.
“Georgia has been well represented in the ABA House of Delegates by Allan Tanenbaum for the past 13 years,” State Bar President Robin Frazer Clark said. “We are grateful for all he has done to promote the cause of justice, uphold the rule of law and protect the rights of all citizens during his exceptional service and representation.”
