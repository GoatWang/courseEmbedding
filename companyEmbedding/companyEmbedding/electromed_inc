About Electromed




 
Leading innovation in airway clearance
Electromed, Inc., is dedicated to designing, manufacturing and marketing innovative airway clearance technologies that help people around the world breathe better, stay healthier, and lead active and fulfilling lives.
We were the first to develop a truly portable system for high frequency chest wall oscillation (HFCWO), making it possible for patients and their families to travel and take HFCWO therapy along. Electromed also pioneered the first programmable and first multi-positional HFCWO generator.
Known as the “Innovation Leader in Airway Clearance,” Electromed holds 23 U.S. patents, 12 foreign patents, and has more than 25 U.S. and foreign patent applications pending. These innovations mean our SmartVest® Airway Clearance System is uniquely designed for ergonomic comfort and lifestyle convenience to promote consistent therapy adherence, so patients are more likely to gain maximum therapeutic benefit.
Patient-first culture
Electromed focuses intently on serving patients with impaired airway clearance. More than 30 percent of our full-time employees — including all of the Patient Services team and half of our sales representatives (known as “clinical area managers”) — are licensed respiratory therapists. Our network of more than 300 health care professionals, 85 percent of them licensed respiratory therapists, educate and train patients and clinicians on using the SmartVest system.
Electromed understands how chronically compromised airway clearance affects people’s health and quality of life, while adding substantially to the systemic cost of health care. We embrace the absolute therapeutic imperative of clearing excess respiratory mucus from patients’ lungs. We listen intently to customers — patients, caregivers, health care professionals, payers — to gain insights and inspiration for future product and service innovations.
On behalf of patients, caregivers, clinicians and hospitals, Electromed advocates for public awareness of impaired airway clearance and HFCWO, and for insurance acceptance of HFCWO. We’re valued by customers for an unrivalled commitment to helping them manage insurance authorization and reimbursement.
A tradition of quality and care
Founded in 1992 in New Prague, Minn., Electromed is committed to innovative engineering and design, world-class quality, ethical business practices, and outstanding customer service.
Electromed has received clearance to market for the SmartVest Airway Clearance System from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to promote airway clearance and improve bronchial drainage. In addition, Electromed is:

ISO 13485 and ISO 9001 certified
Certified to apply the CE Mark for HFCWO device sales in all European Union countries
Approved for HFCWO device sales in Canada, the Pacific Rim, Mexico, Australia and other countries
The only HFCWO device manufacturer to earn home-care accreditation from The Joint Commission

Electromed completed an initial public offering in 2010. Our company’s stock now trades on the NYSE MKT under the ticker symbol ELMD.
We’re always on the lookout for talented professionals to join our team and advance our patient-centered mission. For more information about Electromed products, services or career opportunities, please contact us.

When breathing becomes a challenge
When certain diseases and medical conditions make it difficult to cough up mucus from your lungs, breathing becomes hard work. You can’t do many of the activities you enjoy. Your overall health and quality of life suffer. Left untreated, retained mucus can lead to pneumonia and lung scarring, diminished respiratory function and, in some cases, repeat hospitalizations. Fortunately, if you or a loved one suffers from chronic impaired airway clearance, there are effective treatment options.
Airway clearance treatment options
Physicians typically prescribe a combination of prescription drugs, chest physiotherapy (CPT), coughing techniques and cough-assist accessories. If that regimen fails to provide adequate, ongoing relief, there’s another option: high frequency chest wall oscillation (HFCWO).
With HFCWO, you wear a vestlike device that administers high-speed “hugs” to the upper body. Gentle yet powerful “mini coughs” loosen, thin and propel mucus toward major airways, where it can be more readily coughed or suctioned away. Clinical research shows HFCWO to be highly effective at clearing airways of excess mucus, helping reduce infections and hospitalizations that can result when impaired airway clearance is inadequately treated.
A clear difference among HFCWO devices
With a number of high-quality HFCWO devices on the market, you and your medical team will have a choice to make. The SmartVest® Airway Clearance System by Electromed is designed to quickly get you back to the life you enjoy by making HFCWO therapy comfortable, convenient and effective. Patented features help you integrate HFCWO into your daily routine. And the system is so easy to operate, most young children can use it with minimal adult supervision. Read about the clear difference the SmartVest System is making in people’s lives.
Is HFCWO right for you?
Health care coverage for HFCWO therapy varies. Your health plan might specify certain clinical conditions for the use of HFCWO, which can include a requirement that other therapies (e.g., prescription drugs, CPT, coughing techniques) be tried first. Talk to your physician about if and when HFCWO — and the SmartVest System — might be medically appropriate for you or your loved one.
Financial concerns? We are here to help.
At Electromed we understand that healthcare can be costly, and many of our patients have mounting medical bills. It is our goal to take the stress off of you and work with your insurance provider on your behalf. We never want a financial situation to be a barrier for patients who need SmartVest therapy. Our reimbursement specialists act as an advocate to gain reimbursement from your insurance provider and work diligently with your physician(s) to complete all necessary forms.
If you qualify, to help ease the financial burden, we offer financial assistance programs. We will work with you to determine which plan best suits your situation. It is our goal to provide you with comfortable, convenient airway clearance therapy and improve your quality of life.
With the only lifetime warranty among leading HFCWO devices, Electromed ensures that you will have a SmartVest System for as long as you need your difference-making therapy.

Electromed, Inc. Key Developments

Electromed, Inc. Launches SmartVest Connect Wireless Technology for SmartVest® SQL®
Jul 19 17
Electromed, Inc. announced the late June launch of the SmartVest® SQL® with SmartVest Connect™ wireless technology, a personalized high frequency chest wall oscillation (HFCWO) therapy management portal for patients with compromised pulmonary function. The SmartVest SQL with wireless technology features built-in cellular connectivity, offering healthcare teams and patients access to treatment information to better collaborate in making patient-centered care decisions. SmartVest Connect is available online at https://connect.smartvest.com to pediatric and cystic fibrosis patients using a wirelessly enabled SmartVest SQL system. SmartVest Connect enables patients to track progress of their therapy plan and includes a real-time SmartVest Score and easy-to-read goal reports that provide an in-depth look at performance. Created to encourage patient engagement, SmartVest Connect provides feedback for patients to take an active role in their HFCWO therapy, fostering improved therapy adherence. SmartVest SQL with SmartVest Connect is simple, intuitive, and designed to automatically update following completion of a therapy session: just plug it in. The SmartVest System uses HFCWO, a proven therapy that helps clear the lungs of excess secretions, reducing the risk of respiratory infections and hospitalizations. HFCWO produces an alternating flow of air into a garment that rapidly compresses and releases the chest wall at a variety of selectable frequencies and pressures, resulting in an oscillation in airflow within the airways that act to loosen, thin, and propel mucus toward the major airways where it can be expectorated or suctioned away.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score

Growth Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

In addition to all of the proprietary analysis in the Snapshot, the report also visually displays the four components of the Zacks Rank (Agreement, Magnitude, Upside and Surprise); provides a comprehensive overview of the company business drivers, complete with earnings and sales charts; a recap of their last earnings report; and a bulleted list of reasons to buy or sell the stock. It also includes an industry comparison table to see how your stock compares to its expanded industry, and the S&P 500.
Researching stocks has never been so easy or insightful as with the ZER Analyst and Snapshot reports.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

About Electromed




 
Leading innovation in airway clearance
Electromed, Inc., is dedicated to designing, manufacturing and marketing innovative airway clearance technologies that help people around the world breathe better, stay healthier, and lead active and fulfilling lives.
We were the first to develop a truly portable system for high frequency chest wall oscillation (HFCWO), making it possible for patients and their families to travel and take HFCWO therapy along. Electromed also pioneered the first programmable and first multi-positional HFCWO generator.
Known as the “Innovation Leader in Airway Clearance,” Electromed holds 23 U.S. patents, 12 foreign patents, and has more than 25 U.S. and foreign patent applications pending. These innovations mean our SmartVest® Airway Clearance System is uniquely designed for ergonomic comfort and lifestyle convenience to promote consistent therapy adherence, so patients are more likely to gain maximum therapeutic benefit.
Patient-first culture
Electromed focuses intently on serving patients with impaired airway clearance. More than 30 percent of our full-time employees — including all of the Patient Services team and half of our sales representatives (known as “clinical area managers”) — are licensed respiratory therapists. Our network of more than 300 health care professionals, 85 percent of them licensed respiratory therapists, educate and train patients and clinicians on using the SmartVest system.
Electromed understands how chronically compromised airway clearance affects people’s health and quality of life, while adding substantially to the systemic cost of health care. We embrace the absolute therapeutic imperative of clearing excess respiratory mucus from patients’ lungs. We listen intently to customers — patients, caregivers, health care professionals, payers — to gain insights and inspiration for future product and service innovations.
On behalf of patients, caregivers, clinicians and hospitals, Electromed advocates for public awareness of impaired airway clearance and HFCWO, and for insurance acceptance of HFCWO.

NEW PRAGUE, Minn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Electromed, Inc. (NYSE MKT:ELMD) today announced the expansion of its 
      SmartVest SQL Airway Clearance System product line to include new 
      SmartVest garment and SQL generator colors, offering patients with 
      chronic impaired airway clearance more opportunities to personalize 
      their HFCWO therapy experience. The expanded SmartVest garment and SQL 
      generator colors will debut at the North American Cystic Fibrosis 
      Conference in Orlando, Florida, October 27 – 29, 2016.
    



SmartVest garment. Now in seven designs, including green 
        camouflage, pink camouflage, and black, the SmartVest features 
        Velcro-like closures, soft-touch fabric, and a single-hose design to 
        make treatment easy and comfortable.
      

SmartVest SQL generator. The lightest HFCWO generator on the 
        market is now available in four unique colors to fit a patient’s 
        personal style: blue, red, bright blue, and gray.
      


      “The SmartVest and SQL color expansion provides greater customization of 
      one’s HFCWO therapy to promote patient satisfaction, which ultimately 
      encourages therapy adherence,” commented Kathleen Skarvan, President and 
      Chief Executive Officer of Electromed. “We’re proud to stand by our 
      commitment to continued innovation by delivering market-driven HFCWO 
      therapy solutions.”
    

      With the expansion to seven garment colors and four generator enclosure 
      colors, patients receive a greater opportunity to uniquely customize 
      their SmartVest system. Higher personalization can positively influence 
      satisfaction with therapy and may improve adherence, along with the 
      SmartVest’s ease of use, ergonomic comfort, and lifestyle convenience. 
      The new color selection is marketed for domestic homecare use only. The 
      SmartVest system is designed to promote airway clearance and enhance 
      bronchial drainage through high frequency chest wall oscillation 
      (HFCWO), a proven clinical therapy that helps clear the lungs of excess 
      secretions, reducing the risk of respiratory infections and 
      hospitalizations. Airway clearance therapies must be consistently 
      followed to have their intended benefit, and as with any treatment, poor 
      adherence can compromise its effectiveness.
