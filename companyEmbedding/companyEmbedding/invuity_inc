Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score
A


Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

The Zacks Equity Research reports, or ZER for short, are our in-house, independently produced research reports.
The ever popular one-page Snapshot reports are generated for virtually every single Zacks Ranked stock. It's packed with all of the company's key stats and salient decision making information. Including the Zacks Rank, Zacks Industry Rank, Style Scores, the Price, Consensus & Surprise chart, graphical estimate analysis and how a stocks stacks up to its peers.
The detailed multi-page Analyst report does an even deeper dive on the company's vital statistics. In addition to all of the proprietary analysis in the Snapshot, the report also visually displays the four components of the Zacks Rank (Agreement, Magnitude, Upside and Surprise); provides a comprehensive overview of the company business drivers, complete with earnings and sales charts; a recap of their last earnings report; and a bulleted list of reasons to buy or sell the stock. It also includes an industry comparison table to see how your stock compares to its expanded industry, and the S&P 500.
Researching stocks has never been so easy or insightful as with the ZER Analyst and Snapshot reports.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/29/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.

Testimonials








“Invuity has effectively married two critical technologies and addressed a pressing clinical need of visualization. The PhotonSaber™ Y is one of the most significant technological advancements in orthopaedic surgery this year.”




                                Herrick J. Siegel, MD                            

                                Professor of Surgery and
Head of Orthopaedic Oncology
UAB Medical Center, Birmingham, AL                            





“I operate with greater efficiency and surgical precision because I can direct the light where I need it – the light follows me instead of me following the light. I have reduced my surgical time by an average of 15% and experience less operative blood loss. This challenging surgical approach is now easier, quicker and safer when using the Saber with Yankauer – it makes my life easier.”

“Invuity’s Saber handheld illuminator with Frazier suction enables me to more efficiently achieve rapid hemostasis during cervical and lumbar spine surgery. I’m able to direct its light precisely where it is needed to quickly locate and control bleeders especially in far lateral recesses and deep surgical cavities. Since using the Eigr Saber I have seen a significant decrease in blood loss due to its superior illumination within the incision.”

Invuity Inc. Showcased PhotonBlade at Premier Inc.’s Annual Breakthroughs Conference
BY GlobeNewswire— 4:01 PM ET 07/12/2017


SAN FRANCISCO, July  12, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Invuity’s PhotonBlade, precision illuminator with next-generation enhanced energy, is one of the medical innovations that was showcased in front of thousands of healthcare providers at Premier Inc.’s 2017 Breakthroughs Conference and Exhibition on June 27. 
PhotonBlade was debuted during the conference’s annual Innovation Celebration. The event recognizes advances in healthcare while highlighting industry suppliers committed to innovation and improving patient outcomes. “Invuity shares Premier’s commitment to providing valuable products to our alliance members that are safe, high-quality and cost-effective,” said Durral R. Gilbert, president of supply chain services, Premier. “We believe these innovations can benefit providers as they work to transform healthcare.” Clinicians and other health system members of Premier selected PhotonBlade to be showcased at the Innovation Celebration due to its uniqueness, ability to have an impact on unmet clinical needs and potential to improve patient care.

Further, PhotonBlade’s novel energy platform consists of a proprietary coated blade for precise cutting and coagulation of tissue, with minimal collateral effect.

PhotonBlade provides exceptional visualization within the surgical cavity, for precision and safety. “We are honored to have received this recognition from Premier,” stated President and CEO of Invuity Philip Sawyer. “It demonstrates the consistent goals of both Invuity (IVTY) and Premier in constantly striving to provide the best possible care for patients.
