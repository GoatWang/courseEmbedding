Diversification does not assure a profit nor does it protect against loss of principal.





Certificates of deposit (CDs) offered through American Century Brokerage are issued by Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)-insured institutions, and are subject to change and availability. There is a $55 early termination fee and possible market value adjustments. Brokered CDs will fluctuate in market value between purchase date and maturity date due to their ability to be sold on the secondary market. Because the secondary market for CDs is generally illiquid, a significant loss of principal could result if your CD is sold prior to maturity. American Century Brokerage makes no judgment as to the creditworthiness of the issuing institution and does not endorse or recommend the CDs in any way.





Brokerage Services are provided by American Century Brokerage, a division of American Century Investment Services, Inc., registered broker/dealer, member FINRA, SIPC.

Overview
Literature & Resources










Overview


Investment approach
The team seeks to deliver long-term, risk-adjusted capital appreciation and current income by investing in large capitalization equity securities with a history of growing their dividends at an above-average rate. In addition, the team seeks to outperform value peer strategies and rank solidly in the top quartile over a full market cycle. The investment process focuses on companies that have the potential to generate strong and sustainable free cash flow from operations with management teams willing to reward shareholders through increased dividend payments over time.


Distinguishing Features

Seasoned, stable investment team with extensive experience managing dividend value strategies
Focus on strong and sustainable free cash flow from operations as a sign of strong business fundamentals that potentially lead to higher share price and growing dividend income over time
Low-beta approach helps reduce portfolio volatility





Investment Process


Define and evaluate investable universe

Universe is the Russell 1000 Index, S&P 500 Index and large ADRs on NYSE
Prioritize candidates for further research by focusing on the top two quintiles of free cash flow
Rank candidates using proprietary factor analysis identifying valuation, capital discipline and total yield to shareholders
Incorporate analysis, including fundamental and valuation analysis, Columbia Threadneedle Investments central research and company meetings



Conduct research and valuation analysis

Identify approximately 125 companies that have the potential to generate strong and sustainable free cash flow from operations that create strong dividend opportunities
Focus on free cash flow yield (FCF/P) vs. traditional value metrics such as P/E, P/B
Reliability of cash accounting vs. accrual accounting
Cash flow analytics used to appraise businesses and forecast dividend actions





Construct portfolio and manage risk

Target 70 to 100 stocks to be included in the portfolio
Determine risk budget and allocate risk to maximize alpha
Seek to construct a portfolio with low relative volatility and leverage, low-earnings volatility, dividend yield exposure
Eliminate unintended bets and ensure style integrity

Disclosures
There is no guarantee the objective will be achieved or that any return expectations will be met. 
The Russell 1000 Index tracks the performance of 1,000 of the largest U.S. companies, based on market capitalization. The Standard and Poor’s (S&P) 500 Index is an unmanaged index that tracks the performance of 500 widely held, large-capitalization U.S. stocks. It is not possible to invest directly in an index.
Investment risks — Market risk may affect a single issuer, sector of the economy, industry or the market as a whole. Value securities may be unprofitable if the market fails to recognize their intrinsic worth or the portfolio manager misgauged that worth. Foreign investments subject the strategy to risks, including political, economic, market, social and others within a particular country, as well as to currency instabilities and less stringent financial and accounting standards generally applicable to U.S. issuers. Dividend payments are not guaranteed and the amount, if any, can vary over time. These risks may be heightened for longer maturity and duration securities. The strategy may invest significantly in issuers within a particular sector, which may be negatively affected by market, economic or other conditions, making the strategy more vulnerable to unfavorable developments in the sector.
Advisory services provided by Columbia Management Capital Advisers, an operating division of Columbia Management Investment Advisers, LLC (“CMIA”) an SEC-registered investment adviser that offers investment management and related services to clients participating in various types of wrap programs.
Columbia Management Investment Advisers, LLC and its affiliates do not offer tax advice. Investors should consult with their tax advisor regarding their specific situation.

2Source: ICI as of December 31, 2016 for Columbia Management Investment Advisers, LLC.
3The Overall Morningstar Rating is as of December 31, 2016 and for Class Z shares. Out of 101 Z-share Columbia funds rated by Morningstar, 18 funds received a 5-star Overall Rating and 33 funds received a 4-star Overall Rating. Class Z shares are sold at net asset value and have limited eligibility. Columbia Management Investment Distributors, Inc. offers multiple share classes, not all necessarily available through all firms, and the share class ratings may vary. Contact us for details. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a retail mutual fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its 3-, 5- and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. For share classes that do not have a 3-, 5- or 10-year actual performance history, the fund’s independent Morningstar Rating metric is then compared against the retail mutual fund universe breakpoints to determine its hypothetical rating.
For each fund with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating™ used to rank the fund against other funds in the same category. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly excess performance, without any adjustments for loads (front-end, deferred, or redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star (each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages).
The Morningstar RatingTM is for Class Z shares only; other classes may have different performance characteristics and may have different ratings.
