How cash-out refinancing works



The cash out refinance is designed to accomplish two goals — to improve on the terms of an existing home loan and deliver additional funds at a low interest rate. Other types of mortgage refinance include the rate and term refinance, in which the new loan amount is equal to the remaining balance on the old mortgage, and the limited cash out refinance, in which the closing costs are added wrapped into the new loan, increasing its balance.It only makes sense to undertake a cash-out refinance if the new loan comes with a better refinance rate or more favorable terms (replacing an adjustable rate home loan with a fixed rate mortgage, for example).

Refinance with cash out: conforming loans
It is important to note that cash out refinancing generally costs more than rate and term or limited cash out refinancing. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, for example, require lenders to collect surcharges for these loans (called “conforming” mortgages) because they are considered riskier.
The added costs of cash out refinancing can be substantial and should be considered carefully. If, for example, a homeowner wishes to refinance a $200,000 mortgage and take an additional $10,000 cash out, there may be no extra costs (the new loan amount is less than 60 percent of the home’s value and the borrower has a 700 FICO score, for example). On the other hand, if the homeowner has a 650 FICO and the new loan amount is 83 percent of the property value, it would cost an extra $6,300 to borrow $10,000!
In general, cash out refinancing is likely to be the lowest cost option when the amount of additional cash is relatively high. In the above example, the added costs come to 63 percent of the amount borrowed. If the homeowner were to take $100,000 cash out, however, the added costs come to nine percent of the amount borrowed — a considerably lower figure. The chart below shows the added costs, which depend on the borrower’s credit score and the loan-to-value ratio. Notice cash out is limited to 85 percent of the property value.




What is cash-out refinancing?
A refinance in which the new loan amount exceeds the total needed to pay off the existing mortgage. The difference goes to the borrower and can be used for any purpose.

Glossary Terms
​ Cash-Out Refinancing

A refinance in which the new loan amount exceeds the total needed to pay off the existing mortgage. The difference goes to the borrower and can be used for any purpose.

​ Equity

The difference between the fair market value of an asset (like a home) and the amount of debt against that asset (like a mortgage balance).

​  Rate and Term Refinancing

A mortgage refinance that replaces the existing mortgage with a new one but does not disburse cash to the borrower. Rate and term refinancing is undertaken simply to improve on the terms of the old loan – reducing the interest rate is a popular goal.

​  Refinance 

Refinancing means replacing one loan with a new, better loan. Improving the terms of a loan can mean obtaining a lower interest rate, a lower monthly payment, replacing an adjustable or variable rate loan with a fixed-rate loan or increasing the size of the loan and taking the difference in cash.

Cash-Out Refinance Pros
Cash out refinancing offers a few advantages over other sources of funds:

Because it’s secured by real estate, the interest rate is lower than rates for unsecured financing.
Because it’s a first mortgage, the interest rate is lower than rates for home equity loans, which are usually second mortgages.
The interest may be tax-deductible. Check with a tax pro.



Cash-Out Refinance Cons

Underwriting guidelines are stricter than for rate and term refinancing.
Costs are higher because surcharges are assessed against the entire refinance, not just the amount of cash out.
Cash out refinancing takes longer than setting up a home equity loan or personal (unsecured) loan.
Increasing the loan-to-value to over 80 percent requires mortgage insurance.







 



Alternatives to cash-out refinancing
Homeowners considering a cash out refinance should compare the costs of all available options:

Rate and term refinance plus a home equity loan (if terms of existing loan can be bettered)
Adding just a home equity loan (if existing loan cannot be improved)
Taking a personal loan (if credit rating is good and costs are low)
Consolidating debt with a debt management plan or balance transfer card

Cash out refinancing is a valid strategy for financing anything from college tuition to debt consolidation to home improvements. However, homeowners should run the numbers and consider the total cost of borrowing — lender fees, interest rates and third party costs — before committing.

Will you save money by refinancing your current loan?
A mortgage refinance can mean big savings, but it may come at a price in the short term. The decision to refinance generally comes down to whether you'll be in your home long enough for your monthly savings to outweigh the upfront refinancing costs. Our Refinance Calculator can help you determine the amount of time you'll need to stay in your home after refinancing your mortgage to breakeven and cover your costs.

Breakeven Analysis







                                    Monthly Payment
                                    ?
There are several ways to calculate your refinance breakeven. The "quick and dirty" method involves dividing the difference in your monthly payment by the refinancing costs. That isn't necessarily the most accurate method, and the longer you've been paying your current loan, the less accurate that breakeven calculation is. In addition, this method won't help you if your refinancing from a 30-year mortgage to a 15-year loan.










                                    Interest Expense
                                    ?
The next method is based on the difference in  interest expense between your current loan and a refinance mortgage. Your breakeven is that point in which the total interest savings equals the cost of refinancing. This method allows you to compare loans with different terms.










                                    Mortgage Tax Deduction
                                    ?
If you itemize your deductions when you file your taxes, it affects your breakeven point. Higher interest rates mean higher mortgage deductions. Refinancing to a lower rate decreases your mortgage interest deduction.










                                    Pay Down Existing Mortgage
                                    ?
You can choose to refinance or leave your mortgage alone, but you have another option -- use your cash to pay down your mortgage balance instead of spending it on refinancing. You can reamortize your loan to reduce your payment or accelerate your repayment. This breakeven method measures how long it would take for your refinance payment less the reamortized payment on your current mortgage to cover the costs of refinancing.

Fitch Affirms COMM 2014-CCRE20 Mortgage Trust | Business Wire


























































      Fitch Affirms COMM 2014-CCRE20 Mortgage Trust
    





October 14, 2016 04:41 PM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has affirmed 15 classes of Deutsche Bank Securities, 
      Inc.'s COMM 2014-CCRE20 commercial mortgage trust pass-through 
      certificates. A detailed list of rating actions follows at the end of 
      this press release.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      The affirmations are based on the stable performance of the underlying 
      collateral pool. As of the September 2016 distribution date, the pool's 
      aggregate principal balance has been paid down by 1.5% to $1.17 billion 
      from $1.18 billion at issuance. The pool has experienced no losses to 
      date. De minimis interest shortfalls are currently affecting the 
      non-rated class H. There are no delinquent or specially serviced loans. 
      There are five loans on the servicer's watch list (5.7%). Two loans 
      (7.5% of the pool) have been identified as Fitch Loans of Concern 
      (FLOC's). The 10 largest loans represent 54.1% of the total pool 
      balance, and the top three loans represent 27.2% of the total pool 
      balance. In addition, nine loans secured by hotel properties account for 
      27.9% of the pool including five (24.5%) of the top-15 loans.
    

      The largest FLOC is the Harwood Center loan (5.1% of the pool), the 
      fourth largest loan in the pool. The loan is collateralized by a 
      36-story, 723,963-sf office building and a nine- story parking garage 
      located in Dallas, TX. Per the year end (YE) 2015 OSAR, the property net 
      operating income (NOI) has declined 21.5% compared to the issuer's 
      underwritten NOI. According to the servicer, the decline is due to a 21% 
      increase in operating expenses, driven by both general & administrative 
      costs and janitorial expenses which that were not accounted for in the 
      issuer's underwriting.
    

      The loan is structured with a 10-year term and is interest only for the 
      first three years. The NOI debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) reported 
      at 1.61x for year to date (YTD) March 2016 and 1.54x for YE 2015, on an 
      interest only basis. Amortization payments are scheduled to begin in 
      August 2017. Based on amortized payments and the YE 2015 NOI, DSCR 
      calculates to 1.18x, compared to 1.50x at issuance. The loan remains 
      current as of the September 2016 payment date.
    

      The second FLOC is the DoubleTree Beachwood loan (2.4%), which is 
      collateralized by a 404-key full service hotel located in Beachwood, OH, 
      approximately 10 miles east of Cleveland. The loan is on the servicer's 
      watch-list due to low DSCR. According to the servicer, property 
      performance has significantly declined since issuance due to increased 
      competition from newer properties or recently renovated hotels. As a 
      result occupancy, ADR, and RevPAR have all declined. Per the STR report 
      for TTM June 2016, occupancy was 54%, with ADR at $105.85, and RevPAR at 
      $57.14, compared to 61.7%, $105.11, and $64.85 at issuance. The property 
      is well below the competitive set, which reported 70% occupancy, $116.27 
      ADR, and $81.34 RevPAR for TTM June 2016.
    

      Per the servicers OSAR, the YE 2015 NOI was $1.2 million (or 39.5%) 
      below the issuer's underwritten NOI. The decline is directly attributed 
      to lower room revenues, as well as lower food & beverage for YE 2015. 
      The NOI DSCR was 0.93x for YE 2015, compared to 1.53x at issuance. The 
      interim YTD June 2016 DSCR was 1.02x. The loan remains current as of the 
      September 2016 payment date.
    

      The largest loan of the pool (10.3%) is secured by Gateway Center Phase 
      II, a 602,164-sf retail power canter located in Brooklyn, NY. Per the 
      March 2016 rent roll, the property is 100% occupied with a diverse mix 
      of tenants with long- term leases. Leases for only 16.5% of the property 
      net rentable area (NRA) expire prior to the loan's maturity in September 
      2024, with the majority rolling in 2024 (15.3% NRA). The largest 
      tenants, JC Penney (20.3% NRA of the net rentable area [NRA]) and Shop 
      Rite (14.9% NRA), have leases that mature in August 2034 - 10 years 
      after the subject loan's maturity. At issuance, the property also had a 
      13-year lease with Sports Authority through January 2027. Sports 
      Authority had filed for bankruptcy, and as a result vacated the 
      property. In 2016, PC Richards purchased and assumed the subject lease 
      through bankruptcy court and is expected to be open in the fourth 
      quarter.
    

      The property's revenues had improved 7.6% from the issuers underwriting, 
      primarily due to higher reimbursement income and burning of rent 
      concessions. The revenue improvement was offset
    

      by higher real estate taxes for YE 2015 ($2.7 million) compared to 
      issuance ($1.4 million). The real estate taxes at issuance were based on 
      the borrower's budget and factored in a 15-year tax abatement. The 
      servicer indicated that the filing for the exemption was completed in 
      2016, and should be reflected going forward. The NOI DSCR is stable, 
      reporting at 1.75x for YE 2015, compared to 1.81x at issuance.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      The Rating Outlook for all classes remains Stable. Due to the recent 
      issuance of the transaction and stable performance, Fitch does not 
      foresee positive or negative ratings migration until a material economic 
      or asset-level event changes the transaction's portfolio-level metrics.
    

      USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10

      Copyright © 2016 by Fitch Ratings, Inc., Fitch Ratings Ltd. and its 
      subsidiaries. 33 Whitehall Street, NY, NY 10004. Telephone: 
      1-800-753-4824, (212) 908-0500. Fax: (212) 480-4435. Reproduction or 
      retransmission in whole or in part is prohibited except by permission. 
      All rights reserved. In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in 
      making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on 
      factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from 
      other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable 
      investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance 
      with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of 
      that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources 
      are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The 
      manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party 
      verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated 
      security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the 
      jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the 
      issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public 
      information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, 
      the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit 
      reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, 
      engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third 
      parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party 
      verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the 
      particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. 
      Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an 
      enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can 
      ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a 
      rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer 
      and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information 
      they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other 
      reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the 
      work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to 
      financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax 
      matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other 
      information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and 
      predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified 
      as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, 
      ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions 
      that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or 
      affirmed.
    

      The information in this report is provided "as is" without any 
      representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or 
      warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the 
      requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion 
      as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made 
      by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch 
      is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports 
      are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of 
      individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating 
      does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, 
      unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the 
      offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. 
      Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not 
      solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are 
      named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is 
      neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, 
      verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in 
      connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or 
      withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. 
      Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a 
      recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not 
      comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security 
      for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of 
      payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from 
      issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for 
      rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 
      (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, 
      Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, 
      or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a 
      single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to 
      US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, 
      publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute 
      a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any 
      registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, 
      the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or 
      the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative 
      efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may 
      be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to 
      print subscribers.

Fitch Affirms COMM 2014-CCRE20 Mortgage Trust | Business Wire


























































      Fitch Affirms COMM 2014-CCRE20 Mortgage Trust
    





October 21, 2015 03:31 PM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has affirmed 15 classes of Deutsche Bank Securities, 
      Inc.'s COMM 2014-CCRE20 commercial mortgage trust pass-through 
      certificates. A detailed list of rating actions follows at the end of 
      this press release.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      The affirmations are based on the stable performance of the underlying 
      collateral pool. As of the October 2015 distribution date, the pool has 
      had no delinquent or specially serviced loans. The pool's aggregate 
      principal balance has been paid down by 0.73% to $1.17 billion from 
      $1.18 billion at issuance.
    

      The largest loan of the pool (10.2% of the pool) is secured by Gateway 
      Center Phase II, a 602,164-sf retail power canter located in Brooklyn, 
      NY. As of June 2015, the property was 100% occupied by 32 tenants, 
      including JC Penney (20.6% NRA), Shoprite (14.9% NRA), and Burlington 
      Coat Factory (12.3% NRA).
    

      The second largest loan (9.8% of the pool) is secured by The 
      Intercontinental Miami, a 641-key full service hotel located within the 
      Miami CBD, adjacent to Miami's Bayfront Park. The property was 
      constructed in 1982 and is comprised of a 36-story building and a lower 
      level parking garage. The property recently completed an extensive 
      renovation between 2011 and 2013 for a total cost of $31.5 million 
      ($49,136/key). According to the August 2015 STR report, the subject's 
      trailing 12 month occupancy, ADR and RevPAR for the 12 months ended July 
      2015 was 84.7%, $202, and $171, respectively.
    

      The third largest loan (7.1% of the pool) is secured by a 403-key full 
      service hotel located adjacent to the Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta 
      International Airport. The property was constructed in 2010 and has LEED 
      Silver certification. The property was 84% occupied as of June 2015.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      The Rating Outlook for all classes remains Stable. Due to the recent 
      issuance of the transaction and stable performance, Fitch does not 
      foresee positive or negative ratings migration until a material economic 
      or asset-level event changes the transaction's portfolio-level metrics.
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      No third party due diligence was provided or reviewed in relation to 
      this rating action.
    

      Fitch has affirmed the following classes:
    

      --$48.4 million class A-1 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$99 million class A-2 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$79.1 million class A-SB at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$275 million class A-3 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$317.7 million class A-4 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$882.7 million interest-only class X-A at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$63.6 million class A-M at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$57.7 million class B at 'AA+sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$199.6 million class PEZ at 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$78.3 million class C at 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$136 million interest-only class X-B at 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$60.6 million class D at 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$60.6 million interest-only class X-C at 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$26.6 million class E at 'BB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$11.8 million class F at 'B-sf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      Fitch does not rate class G, class H, interest only class X-D, interest 
      only class X-E, interest only class X-F and the interest-only class X-G 
      certificates.
    

      Class A-M, B and C certificates may be exchanged for class PEZ 
      certificates, and class PEZ certificates may be exchanged for class A-M, 
      B, and C certificates.

How cash-out refinancing works



The cash out refinance is designed to accomplish two goals — to improve on the terms of an existing home loan and deliver additional funds at a low interest rate. Other types of mortgage refinance include the rate and term refinance, in which the new loan amount is equal to the remaining balance on the old mortgage, and the limited cash out refinance, in which the closing costs are added wrapped into the new loan, increasing its balance.It only makes sense to undertake a cash-out refinance if the new loan comes with a better refinance rate or more favorable terms (replacing an adjustable rate home loan with a fixed rate mortgage, for example).

Refinance with cash out: conforming loans
It is important to note that cash out refinancing generally costs more than rate and term or limited cash out refinancing. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, for example, require lenders to collect surcharges for these loans (called “conforming” mortgages) because they are considered riskier.
The added costs of cash out refinancing can be substantial and should be considered carefully. If, for example, a homeowner wishes to refinance a $200,000 mortgage and take an additional $10,000 cash out, there may be no extra costs (the new loan amount is less than 60 percent of the home’s value and the borrower has a 700 FICO score, for example). On the other hand, if the homeowner has a 650 FICO and the new loan amount is 83 percent of the property value, it would cost an extra $6,300 to borrow $10,000!
In general, cash out refinancing is likely to be the lowest cost option when the amount of additional cash is relatively high. In the above example, the added costs come to 63 percent of the amount borrowed. If the homeowner were to take $100,000 cash out, however, the added costs come to nine percent of the amount borrowed — a considerably lower figure. The chart below shows the added costs, which depend on the borrower’s credit score and the loan-to-value ratio. Notice cash out is limited to 85 percent of the property value.




What is cash-out refinancing?
A refinance in which the new loan amount exceeds the total needed to pay off the existing mortgage. The difference goes to the borrower and can be used for any purpose.

Glossary Terms
​ Cash-Out Refinancing

A refinance in which the new loan amount exceeds the total needed to pay off the existing mortgage. The difference goes to the borrower and can be used for any purpose.

​ Equity

The difference between the fair market value of an asset (like a home) and the amount of debt against that asset (like a mortgage balance).

​  Rate and Term Refinancing

A mortgage refinance that replaces the existing mortgage with a new one but does not disburse cash to the borrower. Rate and term refinancing is undertaken simply to improve on the terms of the old loan – reducing the interest rate is a popular goal.

​  Refinance 

Refinancing means replacing one loan with a new, better loan. Improving the terms of a loan can mean obtaining a lower interest rate, a lower monthly payment, replacing an adjustable or variable rate loan with a fixed-rate loan or increasing the size of the loan and taking the difference in cash.

Cash-Out Refinance Pros
Cash out refinancing offers a few advantages over other sources of funds:

Because it’s secured by real estate, the interest rate is lower than rates for unsecured financing.
Because it’s a first mortgage, the interest rate is lower than rates for home equity loans, which are usually second mortgages.
The interest may be tax-deductible. Check with a tax pro.



Cash-Out Refinance Cons

Underwriting guidelines are stricter than for rate and term refinancing.
Costs are higher because surcharges are assessed against the entire refinance, not just the amount of cash out.
Cash out refinancing takes longer than setting up a home equity loan or personal (unsecured) loan.
Increasing the loan-to-value to over 80 percent requires mortgage insurance.







 



Alternatives to cash-out refinancing
Homeowners considering a cash out refinance should compare the costs of all available options:

Rate and term refinance plus a home equity loan (if terms of existing loan can be bettered)
Adding just a home equity loan (if existing loan cannot be improved)
Taking a personal loan (if credit rating is good and costs are low)
Consolidating debt with a debt management plan or balance transfer card

Cash out refinancing is a valid strategy for financing anything from college tuition to debt consolidation to home improvements. However, homeowners should run the numbers and consider the total cost of borrowing — lender fees, interest rates and third party costs — before committing.

Will you save money by refinancing your current loan?
A mortgage refinance can mean big savings, but it may come at a price in the short term. The decision to refinance generally comes down to whether you'll be in your home long enough for your monthly savings to outweigh the upfront refinancing costs. Our Refinance Calculator can help you determine the amount of time you'll need to stay in your home after refinancing your mortgage to breakeven and cover your costs.

Breakeven Analysis







                                    Monthly Payment
                                    ?
There are several ways to calculate your refinance breakeven. The "quick and dirty" method involves dividing the difference in your monthly payment by the refinancing costs. That isn't necessarily the most accurate method, and the longer you've been paying your current loan, the less accurate that breakeven calculation is. In addition, this method won't help you if your refinancing from a 30-year mortgage to a 15-year loan.










                                    Interest Expense
                                    ?
The next method is based on the difference in  interest expense between your current loan and a refinance mortgage. Your breakeven is that point in which the total interest savings equals the cost of refinancing. This method allows you to compare loans with different terms.










                                    Mortgage Tax Deduction
                                    ?
If you itemize your deductions when you file your taxes, it affects your breakeven point. Higher interest rates mean higher mortgage deductions. Refinancing to a lower rate decreases your mortgage interest deduction.










                                    Pay Down Existing Mortgage
                                    ?
You can choose to refinance or leave your mortgage alone, but you have another option -- use your cash to pay down your mortgage balance instead of spending it on refinancing. You can reamortize your loan to reduce your payment or accelerate your repayment. This breakeven method measures how long it would take for your refinance payment less the reamortized payment on your current mortgage to cover the costs of refinancing.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
