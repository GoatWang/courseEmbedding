What Will Be the Lasting Impact of Brexit on US Mortgages?
Steve Cook
 Although Britain will not actually implement June’s Brexit referendum to leave the European Union until next March at the earliest, it has already made a major impact on US mortgage rates. Will the long term impact of Brexit be as significant?
Within days of the referendum, uncertainty about the potential impact of Brexit on European economies caused investors to sell riskier global stocks and buy safer...

Are you considering purchasing a new home? Are you thinking about selling your current home? Or, maybe you're just eager to refinance while interest rates are low?
Whatever the case may be, you'll need to know the value of the property in question. Our home value search can provide you with a wealth of information, and unlike a costly appraisal, it's completely free.
Our home prices are calculated using a proprietary algorithm that takes recent comparable sales, neighborhood data, and specific property information into account when creating a broad property value estimate.
We're not suggesting that you use our home value estimate in lieu of an appraisal from a trained professional when selling, purchasing, or refinancing, but it's the perfect source when you just need a reasonable estimate and you don't want to wait.
In addition to a ballpark value figure, you'll have access to valuable data, incuding transaction histories, home features, mortgage insurance and property tax estimates, and recent local sales.
And if you're looking for mortgage or refinance rates, you'll find them right there, right where you need them: on our price estimate page.
Whether you're just daydreaming or you've started hunting for a home in earnest, we hope you'll find our free home pricing page to be a valuable research tool.

                    The History of North Port  from North Port County Government

Incorporated in 1959, the City of North Port, Florida occupies 103 square miles of southeast Sarasota County midway between the cities of Sarasota and Fort Myers, near the Gulf of Mexico. North Port is one of the largest Florida cities in land area but is only 10 percent populated. The City began with a population of 178 and was originally known as North Port Charlotte. The name was later shortened to North Port, which helped to create an individual city identity. Since 1980, North Port's population has grown 120%, making it one of the fastest growing cities in Florida. According to the Bureau of Economic and Business Research, as of 2007 the city's population was 53,732. 

Why is North Port, Florida attracting families and business from all over at such an accelerated pace? Its beauty, convenience, economic development, job opportunities, some of the lowest property taxes in the southwest Florida region and a top notch public education infrastructure including a state of the art high school and middle school as well as a community college less than 5 miles away and 3 four-year institutions within a 60-mile radius. 

North Port has an unspoiled natural environment where wildlife flourishes among 95 miles of freshwater canals. It is also the only city in Florida that contains a state forest (Myakka State Forest) within its corporate boundaries. North Port offers a multitude of recreational opportunities such as golfing, fishing, horseback riding, canoeing and more. North Port encompasses fourteen miles of Interstate I-75 within its boundaries. It has two international airports within 45 minutes making, the City accessible to most major markets. Although, North Port is inland, its weather is influenced by the Gulf of Mexico. The average annual temperature of 76 degrees makes year-round living a pleasure, and the City is host to many seasonal residents as well.
