History[edit]
Riverstone was founded by Pierre F. Lapeyre, Jr.[1] and David M. Leuschen, who had been instrumental in the formation of the Goldman Sachs Global Energy & Power Group in the mid 1980s.[2]
The firm is based in New York and has offices in Houston, London, and Mexico City. Riverstone and Carlyle closed on their first fund with $222 million of commitments in 2001. In June 2004, the firms completed fundraising for Carlyle/Riverstone Global Energy & Power Fund II, with $1.1 billion of investor commitments, almost five times the size of the first fund. In 2006, Riverstone and Carlyle raised a pair of funds, including the third in its series of main funds, Carlyle/Riverstone Global Energy and Power III, which raised $3.8 billion of capital. The two firms also raised their first renewable energy focused fund, Carlyle/Riverstone Renewable Energy Infrastructure Fund I, with $685 Million.[3]

Also in 2006, Riverstone was a member of a consortium of private equity firms including Goldman Sachs Capital Partners and Carlyle Group that completed the $27.5 billion (including assumed debt) acquisition of Kinder Morgan, one of the largest pipeline operators in the US. The buyout was backed by Richard Kinder, a former president of Enron.[4]
In 2008, Riverstone and Carlyle raised $6 billion for their fourth main energy fund, Riverstone/Carlyle Global Power & Energy Fund IV. Additionally in 2008, the firms raised a $3.4 billion Riverstone/Carlyle Renewable Energy Infrastructure Fund II as a successor to the $685 million fund raised in 2006 to focus on renewable energy investments.[5][6]
Operations[edit]
In 2016, Riverstone and Carlyle have six main funds focused on buyouts in energy[7] with approximately $36 billion of raised capital.[8]
Controversies[edit]
In 2009 the New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo ordered Riverstone Holdings LLC to pay $30 million in restitution after Riverstone Holdings employed fixers to get them business from pension funds controlled by "corrupt" state officials.[9]
Green/Environmental initiatives[edit]
In March 2010, Riverstone/Carlyle made an investment in Enviva Partners LP. Enviva is one of the largest suppliers of sustainably sourced wood pellets and other processed woody biomass in the world. These products are used by industrial customers seeking to decrease their dependence on foreign fuel and their carbon footprint.[10] The AES Corporation and Riverstone Holdings LLC announced on March 25 that they have committed up to 1 billion as a part of a new joint venture to develop a global platform of utility-scale solar photovoltaic projects. Together, these firms have provided $500 million of capital over five years to invest in PV solar projects around the world. This jointly owned entity is known as AES Solar, they seek to be the leading global developer and operator of utility-scale solar installations that will be connected to power grids that supply and businesses. These installations consist of land based solar PV panels that capture sunlight and convert it to electricity in order to feed the power grid.[11]

History[edit]
Riverstone was founded by Pierre F. Lapeyre, Jr.[1] and David M. Leuschen, who had been instrumental in the formation of the Goldman Sachs Global Energy & Power Group in the mid 1980s.[2]
The firm is based in New York and has offices in Houston, London, and Mexico City. Riverstone and Carlyle closed on their first fund with $222 million of commitments in 2001. In June 2004, the firms completed fundraising for Carlyle/Riverstone Global Energy & Power Fund II, with $1.1 billion of investor commitments, almost five times the size of the first fund. In 2006, Riverstone and Carlyle raised a pair of funds, including the third in its series of main funds, Carlyle/Riverstone Global Energy and Power III, which raised $3.8 billion of capital. The two firms also raised their first renewable energy focused fund, Carlyle/Riverstone Renewable Energy Infrastructure Fund I, with $685 Million.[3]

Also in 2006, Riverstone was a member of a consortium of private equity firms including Goldman Sachs Capital Partners and Carlyle Group that completed the $27.5 billion (including assumed debt) acquisition of Kinder Morgan, one of the largest pipeline operators in the US. The buyout was backed by Richard Kinder, a former president of Enron.[4]
In 2008, Riverstone and Carlyle raised $6 billion for their fourth main energy fund, Riverstone/Carlyle Global Power & Energy Fund IV. Additionally in 2008, the firms raised a $3.4 billion Riverstone/Carlyle Renewable Energy Infrastructure Fund II as a successor to the $685 million fund raised in 2006 to focus on renewable energy investments.[5][6]
Operations[edit]
In 2016, Riverstone and Carlyle have six main funds focused on buyouts in energy[7] with approximately $36 billion of raised capital.[8]
Controversies[edit]
In 2009 the New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo ordered Riverstone Holdings LLC to pay $30 million in restitution after Riverstone Holdings employed fixers to get them business from pension funds controlled by "corrupt" state officials.[9]
Green/Environmental initiatives[edit]
In March 2010, Riverstone/Carlyle made an investment in Enviva Partners LP. Enviva is one of the largest suppliers of sustainably sourced wood pellets and other processed woody biomass in the world. These products are used by industrial customers seeking to decrease their dependence on foreign fuel and their carbon footprint.[10] The AES Corporation and Riverstone Holdings LLC announced on March 25 that they have committed up to 1 billion as a part of a new joint venture to develop a global platform of utility-scale solar photovoltaic projects. Together, these firms have provided $500 million of capital over five years to invest in PV solar projects around the world. This jointly owned entity is known as AES Solar, they seek to be the leading global developer and operator of utility-scale solar installations that will be connected to power grids that supply and businesses. These installations consist of land based solar PV panels that capture sunlight and convert it to electricity in order to feed the power grid.[11]

David M.Leuschen David Leuschen is the Co-Founder and Senior Managing Director of Riverstone Holdings, a private equity firm focusing on growth capital investments in the energy and power sectors. Prior to founding Riverstone, Mr. Leuschen was a Partner at Goldman Sachs and founder and head of the Goldman Sachs Global Energy and Power Group. Mr. Leuschen joined Goldman Sachs in 1977, became head of the Global Energy and Power Group in 1985, became a Partner of the firm in 1986 and remained with the firm until leaving to found Riverstone in 2000. Mr. Leuschen has extensive M&A, financing and investing experience in the energy and power industry. In 2013, David Leuschen was named to the Forbes list of Top 50 Dealmakers, along with Riverstone co-founder Pierre Lapeyre, for the second consecutive year.
Outside of his business endeavors, Mr. Leuschen, as a third generation Montana native, spends as much time as possible with his family on Switchback Ranch, his ranching business centered in the northern Rocky Mountains of Montana and Wyoming near the northeast corner of Yellowstone Park. On the ranch there are two primary businesses: one of the area’s top commercial beef businesses and an outfitting and dude ranching company that provides interested parties with the opportunity to hunt some of the country’s top big game animals and enjoy traditional dude ranching activities. David is also a dedicated philanthropist. In 1998 he founded the David M. Leuschen Charitable Foundation to support local ranching communities and open space preservation in Montana and Wyoming and is an active supporter of his alma mater, Dartmouth College. Over the years, David has dedicated both his time and knowledge to the arts, supporting music and public radio and serving as a contributor and funder to a number of films and documentaries.

Skiing has historically played an important role in David’s life, having learned the sport at an early age in his home state of Montana. The skiing programs were one of the major reasons David chose Dartmouth for his undergraduate work; more recently, Mr. Leuschen has become a co-owner of The Red Lodge International Summer Ski Race Camp, providing summer race instruction to high school, college, and national team level skiers high in the Beartooth mountains near Switchback Ranch.  Additionally, he is one of the owners of Big Sky Investment Holdings, the major owner of real estate within the 4 mountain ski area complex of Big Sky, Moonlight Basin, Spanish Peaks, and the Yellowstone Club, comprising the largest combined skiing complex in North America.  Mr. Leuschen is a member of the executive committee and board of the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Foundation, which seeks to contribute to the fundraising success of the U.S. Olympic Team.

About David
David M. Leuschen was born and raised in Montana, a third-generation native of the state. During his first 18 years, prior to heading to Dartmouth College, David was exposed to many of the best things about Montana – ranching, skiing, the love of the outdoors and nature, and an appreciation for the hard-working ways of the West. David always knew he would return to the West at some point – ideally in the area around Yellowstone Park he calls home, to continue the commitment to ranching. As part of that dream, over the past 24 years he has been building and developing the business of Switchback Ranch, his ranching operation located near Yellowstone just outside the towns of Cody, Whyoming and Roscoe and Big Timber, Montana.
Following graduation from Dartmouth, David spent a year teaching school at the public high school in Malta, Montana, then enrolled in business school at Dartmouth’s Amos Tuck School. After receiving his MBA, David spent the next 22 years at Goldman Sachs, the last 14 as a partner and head of the firm’s energy and power business. In 2000, he left Goldman to form his own energy investment firm, Riverstone Holdings. Riverstone provides growth capital to primarily new energy companies, 80% based in North America, and the bulk of which are in the upstream and midstream sectors of that business.
Though Riverstone is based primarily in New York, David spends much of his time based at Switchback. Under his supervisions, the Ranch has grown to be one of the larger commercial cattle operations in the Northern Rockies. In addition to the cattle operations, the Ranch today operates an outfitting business for hunters in the Fall, and includes a very historic dude ranching operation based out of the Big Timber unit of the Ranch. Through the David M. Leuschen Charitable Foundation, David is committed to supporting worthy causes, mostly but not entirely Montana- and Wyoming-based, where the principals demonstrate outstanding qualities of determination, hard work, and charity.

Equity Firm Pays $30 Million in Pension Fund Case

The private equity firm Riverstone Holdings agreed on Thursday to pay $30 million to resolve its role in a widening public pension fund investigation by the New York attorney general, Andrew M. Cuomo.In making a settlement, Riverstone follows its joint venture partner, the politically connected Carlyle Group, which paid a $20 million settlement earlier this month in connection with dealings between the New York State pension fund and investment funds sold under the Carlyle/Riverstone name.David M. Leuschen, who founded Riverstone and managed Carlyle/Riverstone funds, was not covered by the settlement and remains under investigation, the attorney general’s office said. Under terms of the earlier settlement, executives at Carlyle and the firm itself faced no further actions, including criminal prosecution.Both Carlyle and Riverstone have agreed to broad changes that will bar them from using intermediaries, known as placement agents, to gain public pension fund business in New York and throughout the United States.

In a conference call, Mr. Cuomo described the $30 million payment as a “significant amount of money” and praised Riverstone for adopting a code of behavior intended to end “pay to play” practices. Continue reading the main story

“If you knew and paid the right people, you could do business in New York,” Mr. Cuomo said. “Hundreds of millions of dollars in taxpayer money went to people who were politically connected. That’s not going to be allowed any more.”For two years, Mr. Cuomo has been conducting an investigation into the millions of dollars and other favors that friends, relatives and aides of the former state comptroller, Alan G. Hevesi, gained for helping steer business to Mr. Hevesi while he was the sole trustee of the state’s $122 billion pension fund. Since then, the investigation has widened to include pension funds in other states.Mr. Cuomo said that his investigation was only in the “fourth inning” and that “new developments will be coming down the road.” Mr. Hevesi has not been charged, but charges have been brought against six people who did business with him.As for Carlyle/Riverstone, the Cuomo investigation looked into payments made by Riverstone and Mr. Leuschen to a number of politically connected intermediaries as the Carlyle/Riverstone joint venture sought  —  and obtained  —  $530 million in business from the New York State pension fund between 2003 and 2005.Before making these payments, according to the attorney general, Carlyle/Riverstone had only limited success in obtaining business from the New York State pension fund. But the joint venture’s fortunes changed after the payments were made.In a statement, Michael Freitag, a Riverstone spokesman, said, “For our investors and the firm, we believe we have reached the right decision through this resolution.”

David Snow, executive editor at Private Equity International, a research firm, said that the $30 million settlement was a wise course of action by Riverstone.

“If your choice is paying a $30 million fine or doing a perp walk, it is money well spent,” Mr. Snow said. He added, however, that should charges be brought against Mr. Leuschen, it could have serious consequences for the Riverstone funds because limited partners might want to pull their money out.“Leuschen is a key man, and if he is removed from the firm, that will be big trouble for the franchise,” Mr. Snow added.

Carlyle/Riverstone funds were founded in 2000 when Mr. Leuschen, an oil and energy specialist at Goldman Sachs at the time, teamed up with Carlyle to invest in the energy sector. Over the years, the joint venture raised billions of dollars from state pension funds.Riverstone now has $17 billion in assets under management, while Carlyle is the world’s second-largest private equity firm, with assets of nearly $80 billion.Riverstone paid $10 million more than Carlyle, which a person in the attorney general’s office said reflected that Riverstone — and not Carlyle — was the focus of the activities that Mr. Cuomo was trying to root out.The person, who asked not to be identified because the investigation was still in progress, said that the $30 million payment was equal to the amount of fees that Riverstone gained from the pension fund, the New York State Common Retirement Fund.The Cuomo investigation looked into several types of payments between Riverstone and a number of well-placed political intermediaries.Mr. Leuschen made a personal investment of $100,000 in a low-budget movie named “Chooch” that was produced by the brother of a state official, David J. Loglisci. Mr. Loglisci, the former chief investment officer of the New York State pension fund, has since been indicted on corruption-related fraud charges.In addition, Riverstone paid $10 million in fees to an influential placement agent, Hank Morris, who also has been charged.Another person receiving the placement fees, Barrett Wissman, is a former business partner of Mr. Leuschen and a neighbor of his in Montana, where the two men have adjoining ranches.

Mr. Wissman, who has since pleaded guilty and paid a $12 million fine, first alerted Mr. Leuschen to the fact that the New York State pension fund might be interested in making investments in the energy sector.
