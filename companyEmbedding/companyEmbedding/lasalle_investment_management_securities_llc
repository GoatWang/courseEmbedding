LaSalle St. Investment Advisors, LLC


Managed Account Programs continue to be one of the fastest growing investment areas. Clients and the advisors have begun to recognize the many advantages of fee-based compensation programs over commission driven transactions.
While Reps have been attracted to the idea of fee-based business, they have not been interested in turning over their client’s discretion an outside manager. LaSalle created the LaSalle Asset Management Program (LAMP) product to specifically address this key concern.
LAMP is a fee-based program that leaves you and your client in control. It offers you the opportunity to continue to work with clients in the same manner many of you are quite accustomed to:

solicited or unsolicited trades;
no discretionary authority-the client remains in control; and,
purchase in a brokerage account a wide variety of securities-stocks, bonds, options, no load and load waived mutual funds.

LAMP is simply a different way to charge customers-using an on-going asset based fee instead of commissions. It does not employ outside money managers.

Investment Strategy Annual
In the 2017 edition, we distinguish between cyclical, secular and structural changes. During periods of market turbulence, real estate income streams play an important, stabilizing role in an investment portfolio. In 2017, we believe that the principal drivers of value will shift from yield compression to income stability and growth.

												LaSalle Real Estate Securities Programs
							        



Page ContentGlobal Real Estate Securities Program
Offering the opportunity to invest globally in real estate securities. With less than 10% of commercial real estate across the globe currently held by publicly-traded real estate companies, there is significant growth potential within the sector as the REIT structure (now available in more than twenty countries) spreads around the globe.
Key Features Attractive income yields and long term capital growth in tax transparent structures 
Regional, country, currency and sector diversification 
LaSalle’s solid track record of managing global real estate securities portfolios since 2002
LaSalle Core Global Real Estate Securities Program
Offering investors exposure to attributes of core real estate ownership along with liquidity offered by tradable securities, providing less downside risk than the investment universe, providing lower volatility over the long term and providing attractive risk-adjusted returns over a business cycle. In LaSalle Core GRES program, we actively pursue a lower risk profile than the investment universe in order to seek to reduce downside risk (the risk of material relative loss of value in an economic, real estate and/or capital market downturn). We do not employ strategies to reduce short term volatility. 
Key Features Focus on real estate securities that have lower leverage, lower business risk and/or lower risk property types when compared to the broader universe of global real estate securities. 
Regional, country, currency and sector diversification.
Less downside risk than the investment universe, lower volatility over the long term and attractive risk-adjusted returns over a business cycle.
International Real Estate Securities Program
Investing in real estate securities outside an investor’s home markets. We believe that most of the growth in the real estate securities sector will occur in Asia Pacific and Europe, which will provide both institutional and retail investors an opportunity to own some of the best commercial real estate around the globe.
Key Features Attractive income yields and long term capital growth in a tax transparent way 
Regional, country, currency and sector diversification 
Customized real estate securities programs to fit the investment style and objectives of our clients around the globe
U.S. Real Estate Securities Program
LaSalle’s U.S. REIT Program offers the opportunity to invest in portfolios comprised almost entirely of REITs within the U.S., the largest market in terms of investable companies and total market value.
Key Features Attractive income yields and long term capital growth in a tax transparent way 
Diversification by property type and regional allocation 
LaSalle has one of the longest investment management track records within the U.S., managing the U.S. real estate securities portfolios since 1985
 
European and Asia-Pacific Real Estate Securities Program
We believe that most of the growth in the real estate securities sector will occur in Asia Pacific and Europe. This program offers institutional and retail investors an opportunity to own some of the best commercial real estate, operated by some of the most experienced real estate professionals in these regions.
Key Features Attractive income yields and long term capital growth in a tax transparent way 
Regional, country, currency and sector diversification 
Solid track record for investment in real estate securities in Europe since 1997 and Asia since 2002

Here Yesterday. Here Tomorrow.
1974 – LaSalle St. Securities Incorporated
1980 – President Jack McDermott becomes owner of LaSalle St. Securities
1991 – LaSalle St. expands to include financial institutions, insurance companies, other broker dealers, RIA’s and registered reps from throughout the country
Today – Growing strong. With offices throughout the US and over $8 billion in customer assets our family of independent broker dealers has expanded to over 300.
LaSalle St. has been able to expand and leverage opportunities and product offerings with clearing and custody agent, National Financial Services. As a Fidelity-owned organization they bring a strong financial security which customers are looking for–especially in today’s environment.
With a bootstrap mentality, many of our core beliefs as a firm resulted from adapting to challenges:

We dislike debt. We have none.
We are fiscally responsible. Never an unprofitable quarter.
We dislike having to report to anyone but the regulators. No outside shareholders or lenders.

As a result, we have the luxury of being able to do the right things for the right reasons, such as:


Paying out a meaningful percentage of our real profits to our employees
Investing in long term projects that make sense for the firm over time
Owning the building which houses the firm

We understand what it takes to build your business. Now is the right time to join LaSalle St. and become part of our success story.

The Right Choice 
Building your business, your way—for more than 30 years.
A leading mid-size broker/dealer with extraordinarily deep experience, LaSalle St. Securities is agile enough to support your specific business model and resourceful enough to help you serve your unique customer base. Based in the Midwest and registered in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, our team of seasoned professionals is dedicated to your long-term success and eager to meet your needs. We deliver the highest level service along with technology and direct access to the expertise you need in a supportive family business corporate culture. • Over 300 Reps Throughout the U.S. • Over Eight Billion in Customer Assets • We Support Banks, Insurance Brokers, Advisory Firms and Other Broker Dealers
 

Managed Account Programs continue to be one of the fastest growing investment areas. Clients and the advisors have begun to recognize the many advantages of fee-based compensation programs over commission driven transactions. While Reps have been attracted to the idea of fee-based business, they have not been interested in turning over their client’s discretion an outside manager. LaSalle created the LaSalle Asset Management Program (LAMP) product to specifically address this key concern. LAMP is a fee-based program that leaves you and your client in control. It offers you the opportunity to continue to work with clients in the same manner many of you are quite accustomed to:

solicited or unsolicited trades;
no discretionary authority-the client remains in control; and,
purchase in a brokerage account a wide variety of securities-stocks, bonds, options, no load and load waived mutual funds.

LAMP is simply a different way to charge customers-using an on-going asset based fee instead of commissions. It does not employ outside money managers.
 



We provide independent registered and non-registered advisors/agents a comprehensive annuity platform to help with the insurance needs of their clients.  We constantly aim to provide advisors throughout the nation with a dedicated insurance agency working independently, but closely with LaSalle St. Securities, LLC to obtain the best current products in the marketplace and making them available to our reps as quickly as possible at the best possible price.

Frequently Asked Questions
 

Will I be able to provide my clients with the best products and services?

At LaSalle St. Securities, LLC you will have access to an extensive array of financial products and services including all asset class, mutual funds, annuities, ETF’s, managed accounts, and more. Clearing through National Financial (A Fidelity Company) you no longer will experience the type of product limitations and proprietor offerings that exist in the traditional wirehouse model. Independence means just that, “the freedom to choose what products and services best fit your client’s needs.”
 
 
When I change firms, will my clients transfer with me?

Our brokers who choose independence with LaSalle St. are retaining on average over 80% of their client base. As an added value in the transfer, the broker gets the opportunity to choose the select clients that he feels best meet his business goals. Statistically the 80% retention is more a result of the Broker’s selection process than the client’s unwillingness to change firms. Client/Broker relationships have never been stronger; clients want people whom they know and trust now more than ever over a “brand name”.
 
 
Can I afford to cover the expenses associated with my business?

Expenses are a reality of independence but that’s why you receive a payout upwards of a 90% compared to 40%. LaSalle St. Securities, LLC offers an aggressive customized transition package to all prospective representatives which specifically addresses the areas in most need: upfront transition assistance; office support; acat fee impact, etc. The true advantage of being in control of your own expenses is that as your business grows, you’re the one who benefits exponentially from the higher gross because you control the costs.
 
 
Will not being associated with a big name hurt me?

Gone are the days when big names made a difference. Clients are looking for objectivity, independence from proprietor products and autonomy in providing advice. LaSalle St. Securities’ relationship with National Financial (A Fidelity Company) provides the type of institutional backbone necessary to service any client’s need. Big names mean big control. Independence provides for an open platform in serving your clients needs.
 
 
Will I have enough support from my broker dealer?

LaSalle St. Securities has a proven track record of supporting its reps, which has resulted in over 98% broker retention rate for its advisors. That doesn’t happen without service. Our staff-to-rep ratio is also one of the strongest in the industry. Our service team’s annual compensation is also directly linked to broker satisfaction through the use of our quarterly survey to maximize performance.

History[edit]
Jones Lang LaSalle was formed by the merger of Jones Lang Wootton, a British firm with origins dating back to 1783, and LaSalle Partners, an American company formed from a predecessor launched in 1968, in 1999.[2] The respective fund management divisions merged to form LaSalle Investment Management. LaSalle is headquartered in the Nuveen Building in Chicago, Illinois, where Jones Lang LaSalle also serves as building manager. Co-headquarters operate in London (covering Europe and the Middle East) and Singapore (covering Asia Pacific).
Awards[edit]
LaSalle was named the Best Property Manager of the Year at the European Pensions Awards 2011.[5]
In 2011, for the fourth consecutive year, Jones Lang LaSalle has been named to the "World's Most Ethical Companies" list by Ethisphere Institute – a think tank dedicated to the sharing of best practices in business ethics, corporate social responsibility and sustainability.[6]
LaSalle won a 'Performance Award' at the Investment Property Databank / Investment Property Forum Property Investment Awards 2011 in London.[7]
FORTUNE magazine's list of "World's Most Admired Companies" recognizes companies for leadership in corporate reputations. Jones Lang LaSalle has been on the real estate industry list in 2008, 2009 and 2011. The list regularly rotates industry categories and the real estate category was suspended in 2010.[8]
Sustainability in real estate[edit]
LaSalle Investment Management has stated that they recognize buildings have a major impact on the environment. LaSalle has made a commitment to playing a role in addressing global environmental challenges through the investments it makes on behalf of clients, as well as the firm’s day-to-day operations.[9]
In July 2009, LaSalle became a signatory as an Investment Manager to the United Nations-backed Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI).[10]
LaSalle is a charter member and the largest pilot participant in a project to create a standardized metric for carbon measurement by commercial real estate. The Greenprint Foundation is a consortium of leading firms in commercial real estate and is at the forefront of creating metrics to determine the environmental impact of commercial real estate.

History[edit]
Jones Lang LaSalle was formed by the merger of Jones Lang Wootton, a British firm with origins dating back to 1783, and LaSalle Partners, an American company formed from a predecessor launched in 1968, in 1999.[2] The respective fund management divisions merged to form LaSalle Investment Management. LaSalle is headquartered in the Nuveen Building in Chicago, Illinois, where Jones Lang LaSalle also serves as building manager. Co-headquarters operate in London (covering Europe and the Middle East) and Singapore (covering Asia Pacific).
Awards[edit]
LaSalle was named the Best Property Manager of the Year at the European Pensions Awards 2011.[5]
In 2011, for the fourth consecutive year, Jones Lang LaSalle has been named to the "World's Most Ethical Companies" list by Ethisphere Institute – a think tank dedicated to the sharing of best practices in business ethics, corporate social responsibility and sustainability.[6]
LaSalle won a 'Performance Award' at the Investment Property Databank / Investment Property Forum Property Investment Awards 2011 in London.[7]
FORTUNE magazine's list of "World's Most Admired Companies" recognizes companies for leadership in corporate reputations. Jones Lang LaSalle has been on the real estate industry list in 2008, 2009 and 2011. The list regularly rotates industry categories and the real estate category was suspended in 2010.[8]
Sustainability in real estate[edit]
LaSalle Investment Management has stated that they recognize buildings have a major impact on the environment. LaSalle has made a commitment to playing a role in addressing global environmental challenges through the investments it makes on behalf of clients, as well as the firm’s day-to-day operations.[9]
In July 2009, LaSalle became a signatory as an Investment Manager to the United Nations-backed Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI).[10]
LaSalle is a charter member and the largest pilot participant in a project to create a standardized metric for carbon measurement by commercial real estate. The Greenprint Foundation is a consortium of leading firms in commercial real estate and is at the forefront of creating metrics to determine the environmental impact of commercial real estate.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
