It’s not just safety, it’s how we do business.
As the leading provider of silica sand, it is crucial that we hold quality close and safety closer. As a company, we take proactive steps to ensure that our practices and product are consistently impeccable. 
















Self-audits keep us sharp.
Each location receives multiple (scheduled and random) audits to ensure all policies, procedures and best practices are adhered to and effective. Audit results are shared with our employees, and improvements made where necessary. Mississippi Sand welcomes regulatory agencies on our properties and utilizes them as a resource to ensure we maintain compliance with the abundant and ever-changing regulations.







Training is key.
Mississippi Sand believes knowledge is power and gives each employee the opportunity to be an active part of the solution. Every employee receives Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) 24-hour New Miner Training, New Task Training, Hazard Awareness Training and eight hours of Annual Refresher Training. In addition, our employees attend weekly safety meetings led by on-site safety managers and/or on-site plant managers. The subject of the weekly safety meetings is site-specific and varies from safety and health regulations, industry best practices, safe equipment use, safe preventative maintenance procedures, and so forth. Additional training is provided “as needed” when it is determined our employees would benefit from such training.





Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) certification
Annual safe practice refresher courses
Manager-led weekly safety meetings 
Safety tours for local police, fire and EMS personnel to familiarize them with our facility and working practices















Managers don't just manage.
Another key component of our safety and health program is our on-site managers. Our managers are selected not only for their production expertise, but also for their ability to lead by example. Our managers are “active listeners”, a skill that fosters a culture of employee participation and pride in our company’s accomplishments. With a pool of educated, empowered employees, who take pride in their work and the work of the organization, a safe and healthy environment is a natural byproduct.

					McLanahan Hydrosizer Positioned for Frac Sand Explosion					


 

 


Details


			Published: Tuesday, 02 August 2011 16:57		
















McLanahan Corp. has been an equipment manufacturer for more than 175 years, so it’s no surprise to find them on the cutting edge of construction-materials trends. The company is a leading supplier in the design and supply of wet-processing plants for producing “frac sand,” which is gaining popularity among the nation’s producers.
Frac sand and/or proppant consists of naturally round, unconsolidated, high-silica sands typically within the size range of 20 and 140 mesh. Production of this sand involves washing, scrubbing, classifying, dewatering, drying, screening, and packaging and shipping.
The increased demand for oil and natural gas has driven oil and gas companies to increase production by both stimulating older wells and drilling new wells. One important method for maximizing the production of each well is through the process of hydraulic fracturing during which frac sand is combined with a viscous gel and forced down the wells at high pressure to prop open the fractures.
Millions of dollars are being spent on the production of this sand. The reason is that the average construction sand used in concrete and asphalt sells for around $6 per ton. Frac sand sells for $80 to $110 per ton.
“For most wet-processing equipment companies, frac sand production has been the one saving grace in a tough couple of years, due to the comparatively high price of frac sand, which can be 15 times that of some construction sands,” said John Best, general manager, Aggregates Processing Division for McLanahan Corp. “Many of the major companies are looking to see if their resources are viable and investors outside the industry are falling over themselves to get new plants into production to ride the oil/gas exploration and production wave.”
When extremely precise classification is needed to separate granular material by size, the McLanahan Hydrosizer is comparable to screening but at the fraction of the footprint and cost. For specific gravity separation, the Hydrosizer, or the FB (LitesOut) Classifier, offers the best, most efficient and cost-effective solution, according to the company.
Features Include:

Extremely sharp, high efficiency size classification 	between 100 and 600 micron.
Effective separation of minerals of different specific 		gravity.
Low operating cost.
Rapid payback on investment.

Producer FocusMississippi Sand, LLC is one producer committed to the manufacturing and distribution of high-quality frac sand for use in the oil and gas service industry. With a significant reserve located in the St. Peter Sandstone formation, Mississippi Sand owns a premium product source. These reserves meet all API specifications for proppant.
Located just south of St. Louis in Festus, Mo., the Mississippi Sand production facility is conveniently positioned to serve all markets. This state-of-the-art facility has the capability to safely produce year ‘round, 24 hours a day, and the ability to utilize a multi-modal distribution network.
The Mississippi Sand production facility was constructed in early 2008 and the first sales took place in July of that same year. Since then the company have consistently produced a high-quality frac sand product mix with a capacity of approximately 200 tph.
Mississippi Sand, LLC carefully selected the equipment to be used in processing sand into API-specified frac sand. Significant research and consulting was conducted with vendors and industry specialists in order to ensure that they utilized the best equipment available.
Product quality and efficiency were the focus when making equipment selections. A McLanahan Hydrosizer was chosen for the washing and initial sizing process. A Ventilex fluid bed dryer was chosen to dry the washed and pre-sized sand. In the final stage of production, four Rotex Mineralizers were selected to screen the dried sand. These quality components ensure that all of the company’s products meet API specifications. McLanahan Corp., www.mclanahan.com Related Articles   KPI-JCI Cascade Incline Screen...
