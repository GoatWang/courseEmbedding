Creating future-proof superior returns







 About Summa Equity
Summa Equity was founded in 2016 by an experienced group of people that have a long track record from investing in successful companies. The group was brought together by a shared view of the world and the economy, and a passion for developing companies that can outperform through providing products and services needed to meet the increasing demands and complexities our societies face.
We are thematically oriented investors with extensive experience from the markets that we focus on. We target proven companies where we see a significant potential to achieve strong growth through investments in technology, development of the organisation, new products and services, consolidation, or through internationalisation of the business. We focus on companies with strong niche positions operating in sectors that benefit from strong underlying megatrends. We are active in assisting our companies in creating strong financial value, whilst acting responsibly and contributing to a broader set of stakeholders.
Our team aims to be transparent and develop trust-based relationships, are passionate about continuous improvement and seek to disrupt, challenge and innovate, as well as strive to be fun and inspiring to work with. We care not only for our colleagues and portfolio companies, but also for our business partners, the environment, and for the communities we are a part of.
Investment focus




Growth in western economies has been, and is expected to continue to be, weak. Yet we are experiencing strong increase in asset prices due to financial stimuli by central banks and from rising debt levels. At the same time, we face disruption occurring due to technology change, climate change and demographic shifts.
Even in such a volatile and low growth environment there are attractive “pockets of growth” which are more resilient and supported by strong megatrends, such as global population growth, resource scarcity, aging demographics, movement of people, energy efficiency and technology disruption. Summa Equity’s investment strategy is therefore focused around specific sectors that are experiencing tailwind growth due to these megatrends.
Summa Equity’s main focus is investing in growing companies with significant business relations in the Nordic region that require equity investments from Summa Equity of EUR 10-50 million and whereby we can get significant governance rights. We prefer companies where we can partner with existing founders and management to assist in accelerating growth through add-on acquisitions, internationalisation, technology development or organisational enhancements.

Changing demographics 
Technology-enabled businesses 


Resource scarcity
The global population is expected to reach around 10 billion people in 2050. This fact, coupled with a trend of rising living standards in a large part of the world is causing scarcity of certain resources and rising prices for a broad range of commodities and products. These trends create attractive business opportunities in sectors such as waste and recycling, aquaculture/salmon farming, urban farming and agricultural improvements, in technologies and services that increase asset utilisation and their life time, in water treatment, in biomaterials, as well as in circular economy business models.

Back to Investment focus 


Energy efficiency
Concerns around energy security and climate change is driving both consumer behavior and regulatory and political decision making, such as the Paris Agreement. Innovation and big data are also enabling improved energy efficiency. There are attractive opportunities for businesses that facilitate improvements in energy consumption and/or production, that lower costs in energy production and delivery, insulate against weather volatility, or that curb carbon emissions.

Changing demographics 
Technology-enabled businesses 
Back to Investment focus 


Changing demographics
The global population is ageing, life expectancies increasing, and we are facing higher costs of elderly care and a decreasing working population relative to the total population to support this. Simultaneously, we experience continuing urbanisation as well as a rise in the movement of people across countries. These trends will impact our society and economies in significant ways, and there will be growth in companies catering to these changes. Health related products and services will be in high demand, there will be an increasing need for education, training and re-education, and business models that enable improved quality and productivity or lower the cost for products and services in these markets are likely to flourish.

Technology-enabled businesses
The trends towards digitalisation, big data and “internet of things” will continue to disrupt businesses at an increasingly rapid pace. Every industry will be affected in the coming years, and no company can be complacent about these trends. At the heart of these trends lie not only business risks, but also business opportunities. Companies with a willingness to invest to be part of, or even stay in the forefront of, the new paradigm will be positioned to prosper while others will be at risk of extinction. Companies that enable more ubiquitous access to information, products and services, knowledge sharing, or that lower the cost in interactions and transactions, are likely to see strong growth going forward.
