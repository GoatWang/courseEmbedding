Hedge Funds See MiFID Win in EU Warning to Trading Platforms

                High-speed traders praise ESMA guidance on access policies
            



                Traders said rules should lead to greater access to venues
            



Hedge funds and high-speed traders have been fighting for years to level the playing field with banks on derivatives trading. They just won a round in Europe.The European Securities and Markets Authority said earlier this month that trading platforms should ensure access to a broad array of firms and warned against discriminatory policies that would favor some traders over others. ESMA published the guidance to help the European Union’s overhaul of trading rules known as MiFID II live up to its promise of making markets more open, competitive and transparent.Stuart Kaswell, general counsel for the Washington-based Managed Funds Association, said the guidance was a “smart regulatory development” and welcome news to investors.




“ESMA’s decision will help improve transparency, increase liquidity, promote competition and provide greater access to trading platforms for many market participants,” Kaswell said in a statement. The association’s membership includes many of the world’s biggest hedge funds.The potential for access limits and discriminatory policies has been a key concern for proprietary trading firms, which wager their own funds often by using computerized or high-speed technology, according to Piebe Teeboom, secretary general of the European Principal Traders Association. The guidance “will help ensure that MiFID II succeeds in dismantling existing access barriers, increasing competition and pre-trade transparency for all market participants,” he said.The publication shows that while MiFID II has been years in the making, fine details and rules still being laid out by regulators months before it goes live in January are being watched closely by the industry. These adjustments may go a long way toward determining how much MiFID II will change a market currently dominated by banks.




‘Discriminatory’ PracticesIn its release, ESMA spelled out types of policies that trading platforms shouldn’t have because they would be considered “non-objective and discriminatory” and “place unreasonable restraints” on certain firms’ access to trading.Trading venues were told they shouldn’t require their members to also be direct members of clearinghouses, which guarantee transactions after they occur on the venues. Banks and brokerages, rather than asset managers, make up the vast majority of direct clearinghouse members.




Another warning was that platforms shouldn’t impose limits on the number of price quotes a trader can solicit on a venue because that might favor large dealers over other participants, according to ESMA, which sets standards across the 28-nation bloc. The concern is that, facing a cap on quote requests, a trader might feel the need to rush to ask banks for prices because they’re seen as having the capacity to fill orders most easily.Reemt Seibel, a spokesman for ESMA, said the guidance was issued “to address potential practices head-on before MiFID II even applies.” The regulator is working out the scope and timing of the rules that require derivatives to be traded on platforms.Open AccessThe hedge fund and proprietary trading lobbies, alongside others representing traditional buyers of derivatives, already successfully pushed for similar treatment in the U.S. In 2013, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the top swaps cop, told trading platforms not to violate the spirit of open access under the Dodd-Frank Act. The groups continued to push U.S. regulators to pursue additional policies to open access.

The campaign also moved to Europe, where lobbying groups pressed for prohibitions against a “two-tier” system of trading: one tier in which a small and exclusive group of dealers trade with one another on inter-dealer venues, and a second for hedge funds and asset managers to trade with banks either bilaterally or on different platforms. Allowing more traders on the inter-dealer platforms, the funds argued, would make markets more competitive, improve prices and cut costs for firms that use derivatives to hedge risks.Rule BooksAlexander McDonald, chief executive of the London-based Wholesale Market Brokers’ Association, said the points raised by ESMA about discrimination are not practices the association understands its members currently have in their rule books for multilateral trading facilities, “nor in their rule books awaiting publication under MiFID II.” The WMBA represents the biggest inter-dealer brokers.McDonald said he sees a difference between platforms’ “eligibility criteria” and discriminatory practices between market participants. Eligibility criteria may be used to ensure venues meet “requirements for fair and orderly markets by setting certain thresholds on the capabilities of all market participants,” while discrimination between the participants is banned under MiFID, he said.Christophe Roupie, head Europe and Asia at MarketAxess Holdings Inc., said the platform operator decided in 2015 to give traders more choice about how to execute transactions by lifting a restriction on the number of counterparties that can be put in competition for prices for European products.The ESMA guidance “should be taken very seriously,” Roupie said by email. “I would certainly expect the industry to make every attempt to make the necessary adjustments to their trading models ahead of MiFID II.”Bloomberg LP, the parent of Bloomberg News, operates a multilateral trading facility for swaps and has also received approval to handle trades in other products.— With assistance by Alexander Weber

Will OJ Simpson Be Granted Parole This Week?
Ebony Scott
July 19, 2017

Darden will then participate in NBC News' coverage of the parole hearing throughout the remainder of the day.O.J. Simpson looks over at his lawyer Tom Pitaro during an evidentiary hearing in Clark County District Court on May 17, 2013 in Las Vegas.Simpson (70), who earned the nickname "The Juice" during his playing days, claimed he was just trying to recover mementos from his career which he said the dealers had stolen.The ex-footballer and entertainment personality is now being held in the Lovelock Correctional Facility in Nevada, where he has been incarcerated since 2008 after being sentenced to nine to 33 years in prison for the aforementioned crimes.Simpson, 70, could be released from Lovelock Correctional Center by October 1 if the state Parole Board rules favorably on his release request following a Thursday hearing.Since 2008, Simpson has been at Lovelock Correctional Facility in Nevada, according to CNN.SI.com writer Jimmy Traina says: "My personal handicapping opinion would be to parlay Simpson being denied parole with Michael Phelps beating a shark".

				Former Buffalo Bills running back O.J. Simpson has been in jail since 2008 on armed robbery and kidnapping charges, but he has a parole hearing on Thursday, July 20."My crime was trying to retrieve for my family my own property that was stolen from me", he said.Back in July of 2013 he appeared in front of a two member parole board panel. In case you've forgotten, Simpson was acquitted of the murders of his ex-wife and her friend in 1995.Simpson was subsequently found liable for the deaths in a 1997 civil suit and was ordered to pay damages totaling $33.5 million to the families of the victims.The sentences that are aggregated for purposes of the hearing include four concurrent sentences for use of a deadly weapon and two consecutive sentences for assault with a deadly weapon. The board will consider confidential information, including a pre-sentence investigation, a parole hearing report, a risk assessment and letters of support or opposition, if any."Simpson's age, the fact that he was given parole on the first sentencing batch, weigh in his favor", Hill said. In 2013, Simpson won parole on several other charges, though he remained in prison on six weapons-related counts. "I expect he'll probably be paroled". They said it was a dose of payback for his 1995 acquittal.Simpson said he has missed seeing his two younger children go through high school and missed his sister's funeral.

CDS Indices SEF Platform



CDS Trading  l  SEF  l  Index Options  l  Single-Names

Wide-reaching regulations have reshaped the way global market participants execute over-the-counter (OTC) derivative instruments. In the U.S. the majority of rules under the Dodd-Frank Act have been implemented, and in Europe European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR) will be finalized in the coming year.
MarketAxess has developed a flexible credit derivatives platform for our global clients whether they are a U.S. Person who must trade Required Transactions on a Swap Execution Facility (SEF), or a non U.S. Person who chooses to transact voluntarily on the SEF.
CDS Indices SEF Trading Execution
After being granted temporary registration from the CFTC, MarketAxess has been operating as a SEF since October 2, 2013. MarketAxess SEF offers market participants the ability to trade U.S. indices (CDX), European indices (iTraxx), and CDS options leveraging our unique range of compliant protocols:

Anonymous or Disclosed ‘Request-for-Quote’ (RFQ) – an anonymous inquiry to all participants, or a disclosed participant-to-multi participant inquiry; and ‘Request-for-Market’ (RFM) – request a two sided market
SEF Central Limit Order Book (CLOB) - anonymous all-to-all trading
Click-to-Trade (CTT) - a client-to-multi-dealer inquiry

Market participants are able to execute block trades easily and efficiently. While exempt from the minimum execution requirements, block trades in MAT swaps must be executed pursuant to the SEF rules of a SEF or DCM.
Reporting & Connectivity
MarketAxess has direct connectivity to Derivatives Clearing Organizations (DCOs), ICE Clear Credit and CME, to clear eligible clearable and made available to trade (MAT) swaps.
MarketAxess provides post-trade efficiency through Straight-Through-Processing (STP) connectivity to view trade blotter and complete electronic audit trails.
Reporting and live intra-day data for CDS indices can be accessed through MarketAxess BondTicker™.
MarketAxess SEF was named 'SEF of the Year' at the 2015 Risk Awards.

					Full Description



MarketAxess Holdings Inc., incorporated on April 11, 2000, operates an electronic trading platform that enables fixed-income market participants to trade corporate bonds and other types of fixed-income instruments using its trading technology. Institutional investor and broker-dealer firms are the users of its trading platform, accessing global liquidity in the United States corporate bonds, emerging markets and high-yield bonds, European bonds, the United States agency bonds, municipal bonds, credit default swaps and other fixed-income securities. Through its Open Trading protocols, the Company executes trades in certain bonds between and among institutional investor and broker-dealer clients in an all-to-all trading environment on a matched principal basis. The Company also offers trading-related products and services, including market data to assist clients with trading decisions; connectivity solutions that facilitate straight-through processing; technology services to optimize trading environments, and execution services for exchange-traded fund managers and other clients. Through its Trax division, the Company also offers a range of pre- and post-trade services, including trade matching, regulatory transaction reporting, and market and reference data across a range of fixed-income and other products.The Company's platform also provides its broker-dealer clients a solution that enables them to reach its institutional investor clients for the distribution and trading of bonds. Its disclosed multi-dealer Request For Quote (RFQ) trading functionality addresses remaining shortcomings that result from trading bonds over the telephone or via e-mail. Its services relating to trade execution include single and multiple-dealer inquiries; list trading, which is the ability to request bids and offers on multiple bonds at the same time, and swap trading, which is the ability to request an offer to purchase one bond and a bid to sell another bond, in a manner such that the two trades will be executed simultaneously, with payment based on the price differential of the bonds.Through its Trax brand, the Company provides trade matching and regulatory transaction reporting services for European securities and market and reference data across a range of fixed-income products. Trax provides the Company with a set of technology solutions ahead of incoming pre-and post-trade transparency mandates from the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) II in Europe. Its electronic trading platform provides solutions to shortcomings of traditional bond trading methods. Its electronic trading platform provides access to the liquidity provided through the participation on its platform of active institutional investor and broker-dealer clients, including broker-dealers in global fixed-income trading. Its Open Trading protocols allow its institutional investor clients to maintain their anonymity from trade initiation through to settlement without limiting their number of potential trading counterparties. In addition, its Private Axes protocol allows participants to negotiate bilaterally on an anonymous basis.The Company's BondTicker service provides access to real-time and historical price, yield and MarketAxess estimated spread-to-Treasuries for publicly disseminated Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine (TRACE)-eligible bonds.
