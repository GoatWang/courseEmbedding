Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/24/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

                                                    Mexico sugar deal hard to swallow for last U.S. candy cane maker
                                                


                                                    Reuters – 
                                                    1:00 AM ET 06/09/2017
                                                


For the last U.S.-based manufacturer of the red and white striped candy cane that is a ubiquitous North American holiday season treat, the sugar supply deal struck between Mexico and Washington is anything but sweet. The competitors of Ohio-based Spangler Candy Co have, over the years, moved their plants south to Mexico and beyond to gain unfettered access to the cheaper sugar supplies there.

J M Smucker (SJM). * CEO- "brands used to be seen as a status symbol of what one could afford. * CEO- were able to deliver near-term earnings growth by accelerating synergy delivery and managing budgets and costs effectively. * CEO- our plans call for 5% of net sales to come from e-commerce in fiscal 2020, pet food and coffee will lead in this area.

















                                                    J.M. Smucker beats profit estimates as cost cuts help

Folgers coffee maker J.M. Smucker Co (SJM) reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit on Thursday, helped by cost-cutting, and said it would slash $100 million more in annual costs. Smucker has resorted to cost cuts amid slowing demand for its coffee products and stiff competition in its pet foods business.
