O'Connell, Carol, Blind Sight





Default Title - $27.00










The thrilling new Mallory novel from the New York Times–bestselling author and one of the most acclaimed crime writers in America. The nun was dead. Her body lay on the lawn outside Gracie Mansion, the home of New York City’s mayor, and it wasn’t alone. There were four of them altogether. They’d been killed at different times, in different places, and dumped there. There should have been five—but the boy was missing.Jonah Quill, blind since birth, sat in a car driven by a killer and wondered where they were going. Though he was blind, Jonah saw more than most people did. It was his secret, and he was counting on that to save his life.Detective Kathy Mallory was counting on herself to save his life. It took her a while to realize that the missing-person case she was pursuing was so intimately connected to the massacre on the mayor’s lawn. But there was something about the boy she was searching for that reminded her of herself, all those years ago, when she was an orphan adrift in a world over which she had little control and determined never to let that happen again.She would find him—she just hoped it’d be in time.

                      The nun was dead. Her body lay on the lawn outside Gracie Mansion, the home of New York City's mayor, and it wasn't alone. There were four of them altogether. They'd been killed at different times, in different places, and dumped there. There should have been five - but the boy was missing. Jonah Quill, blind since birth, sat in a car driven by a killer and wondered where they were going. Though he was blind, Jonah saw more than most people did. It was his secret, and he was counting on that to save his life.

                      Police detective Kathleen Mallory recognized the dead call girl. It was someone from her past, a woman who protected her on the streets of New York - and who betrayed her. Mallory also recognized the crime scene: victim hanging, hair in mouth, fire burning. It happened 21 years ago, when Mallory was a child. Now - whether it's the work of a copycat killer or a serial murderer - it has happened again. Kathleen Mallory's past has finally caught up with her.

                      Never has Mallory faced as many surprises as in the case before her now. It seems cut-and-dried at first: a burglar has been caught in the act and killed by an ice pick-wielding homeowner. Except that the homeowner turns out to be the most famous lost child in NYPD history, missing for almost 60 years, thought to have been kidnapped following the massacre of her family: five siblings, father, stepmother, nanny, and housekeeper, nearly the entire household wiped out...with an ice pick.

                      NYPD sergeant Kathleen Mallory is drawn to place far away from home. In a small town in Louisiana, she steps off the train. Within the hour, one man has been assaulted, another has had a heart attack, a third has been murdered, and Mallory is in jail, though she nothing to do with any of these three events. She is there for an entirely different purpose. Seventeen years earlier, Mallory's mother died in this town, stoned to death by a mob, and the six-year-old Mallory had disappeared, to reappear on the streets of New York.

                      NYPD sergeant Kathleen Mallory - computer genius, street fighter, provocative waif, peerless investigator, manipulative beauty - is the gorgeous, near-sociopathic heroine of this knife-edged suspense novel. Along with old pals, Ricker, Coffey, and faithful admirer Charles Butler, Mallory is determined to solve the brutal "art as death" murder of an untalented but highly touted artist-critic.

                      In Chicago, an FBI agent is killed in a psychiatrist's waiting room. In New York, the jurors from a controversial trial are murdered one by one. The only connections between the two: a flamboyant shock-jock, whose on-air comments seem to be taking him dangerously close to the edge; and a woman, her body misshapen since childhood, whose job it is to clean up crime scenes, and maybe create them as well. This is a federal case, and Mallory's been told that the FBI wants no part of her.

                      The reviews called it "A Play to Die For" after the woman was found dead in the front row. It didn't seem so funny the next night, when another body was found - this time the playwright's, his throat slashed. Detective Kathy Mallory takes over, but no matter what she asks, no one seems to be giving her a straight answer. The only person - if "person" is the right word - who seems to be clear is the ghostwriter. Every night, an unseen backstage hand chalks up line changes and messages on a blackboard. And the ghostwriter is now writing Mallory into the play itself, a play about a long-ago massacre that may not be at all fictional.

                      In the northern California town of Coventry, two teenage brothers go into the woods one day, but only one comes back. No one knows what happened to the younger brother, Josh, until 20 years later, when the older brother, Oren, now an ex-investigator for the Army CID, returns to Coventry for the first time in many years. His first morning back, he hears a thump on the front porch. Lying in front of the door is a human jawbone, the teeth still intact. And it is not the first such object, his father tells him.

                      It is three days before Christmas, and two young girls have disappeared from the local academy. This hasn't happened for 15 years, since Rouge Kendall's twin sister was murdered. The killer was found, but now Rouge, 25 and a policeman, is forced to wonder: was he really the one? Also wondering is a former classmate named Ali Cray, a forensic psychologist with scars of her own. The pattern is the same, she says: a child called out to meet a friend.

They are the parents of missing children, all brought together by word that children's grave sites are being discovered along the road. Kathy Mallory drives with them. The child she seeks, though, is herself. During the next few days, she will find herself hunting a killer like no one she has ever known, and will undergo a series of revelations of stunning intensity and effect.

                      In this astonishing new mystery by New York Times best-selling author Carol O'Connell, mad-genius NYPD detective Kathy Mallory comes up against a ghostly Broadway murderer. The reviews called it 'A Play to Die For' after the woman was found dead in the front row. The next night, there's another front-row death. Detective Kathy Mallory takes over, but no matter what she asks, no one seems to be giving her a straight answer. The only person - if 'person' is the right word - who seems to be clear is the ghostwriter.

                      The little girl appeared in Central Park: red-haired, blue-eyed, smiling, perfect - except for the blood on her shoulder. It fell from the sky, she said, while she was looking for her uncle, who turned into a tree. Poor child, people thought. And then they found the body in the tree. For NYPD detective, Kathy Mallory, there is something about the girl that she understands. Mallory is damaged, they say, but she can tell a kindred spirit.

                      A mutilated body is found lying on the ground in Chicago, a dead hand pointing down Adams Street, also known as Route 66, a road of many names. And now of many deaths. A silent caravan of cars, dozens of them, drives down the road, each passenger bearing a photograph, but none of them the same. They are the parents of missing children, some recently disappeared, some gone a decade or more.
