DelMar Pharmaceuticals and Accurexa to Collaborate in the Development of a Novel Combination Chemotherapy for the Local Treatment of Brain CancerHomeMailFlickrTumblrNewsSportsFinanceCelebrityAnswersGroupsMobileMoreTry Yahoo Finance on Firefox »YahooSearchSearchSign inU.S. Markets closedS&P 5002,477.13+7.22 (+0.29%)Dow 3021,613.43+100.26 (+0.47%)Nasdaq6,412.17+1.37 (+0.02%)DelMar Pharmaceuticals and Accurexa to Collaborate in the Development of a Novel Combination Chemotherapy for the Local Treatment of Brain CancerPR NewswireSeptember 7, 2016ReblogShareTweetShareVANCOUVER, British Columbia and WALNUT CREEK, Calif., Sept. 7, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- DelMar Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (DMPI) ("DelMar"), a company focused on developing and commercializing proven cancer therapies in new orphan drug indications, and Accurexa Inc. (ACXA) ("Accurexa"), a company focused on the development of novel neurological therapies to be directly delivered into the brain, announced today a collaboration to develop a novel formulation for the local delivery of combination chemotherapy for the treatment of brain cancer and other solid tumors. DelMar Pharmaceuticals LogoMoreUnder the terms of the collaboration agreement DelMar will supply VAL-083 (dianhydrogalactitol) to be formulated within Accurexa's proprietary ACX-31 implantable polymer wafer to locally deliver VAL-083 in combination with temozolomide and/or BCNU for the treatment of brain cancer.  DelMar has been granted an exclusive option to license or acquire and commercialize product candidates and intellectual property resulting from the research. DelMar will host a teleconference for shareholders and investors on Wednesday, September 7, 2016 at 5PM EDT. Interested parties can access the call by dialing toll free 1-800-862-9098 or via the internet at:  https://engage.vevent.com/rt/delmar_ao~73915172Mr. Bacha and DelMar management will discuss the Accurexa collaboration and outline the Company's plans for the remainder of 2016, including steps to advance VAL-083 into a pivotal Phase III and two additional Phase II clinical trials for the treatment of refractory glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most common and aggressive form of brain cancer.Accurexa's ACX-31 program has been developed in collaboration with Prof. Henry Brem who built one of the largest brain tumor research and treatment centers in the world at Johns Hopkins University and Prof. Robert Langer, who is the David H. Koch Institute Professor at MIT and the most cited engineer in history.  Professor Avi Domb at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem will lead the formulation development efforts for the collaboration.  Prof. Brem, Prof. Langer and Prof. Domb are pioneers in the development of local drug delivery treatments, and invented and developed Gliadel® (carmustine implant) which is a FDA approved, local chemotherapy for the treatment of GBM.  Drs. Brem and Langer will serve as advisors for the collaboration."Working together with Accurexa will allow DelMar to explore a promising new product opportunity that is complementary to our existing portfolio of systemic drug development programs established around VAL-083 without significant cash outlay or impact on our near-term cash burn rate," said Jeffrey Bacha, Chairman and CEO of DelMar Pharmaceuticals.  "This research collaboration will take advantage of our knowledge regarding the unique cytotoxic mechanism of VAL-083 to deliver combination chemotherapy directly to patients' cancer.  Combining drugs with distinct mechanisms for local delivery provides an opportunity to overcome chemoresistance while minimizing potential systemic toxicity.""We are very pleased to collaborate with DelMar's experienced team allowing us to leverage their strong development capabilities.  They have recently completed a Phase I/II clinical trial of VAL-083 in brain cancer patients and had a successful end-of-Phase II meeting with the FDA while we recently had a positive pre-IND meeting with the FDA for our ACX-31 wafer program.  Looking forward to the future development pathway, we believe that the local delivery of VAL-083 as a component of our ACX-31 wafer could potentially provide a new and exciting treatment option for brain cancer patients," said George Yu, MD, Accurexa's President & CEO.Read MoreDelMar and Accurexa believe that combining VAL-083 with temozolomide and/or BCNU within Accurexa's proprietary drug delivery system may provide treatment advantages while limiting systemic toxicity. VAL-083 is a "first-in-class", small-molecule chemotherapeutic. In more than 40 Phase I and II clinical studies sponsored by the U.S. National Cancer Institute, VAL-083 demonstrated safety and efficacy in treating a number of cancers including lung, brain, cervical, ovarian tumors and leukemia. VAL-083 is approved in China for the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia and lung cancer and has received orphan drug designation in the U.S. for the treatment of gliomas, medulloblastoma and ovarian cancer as well as in Europe for the treatment of glioma.VAL-083 exhibits its anti-tumor affect by forming DNA cross-links at the N7 position of guanine whereas temozolomide and BCNU primarily target the O6 position of guanine as their site of anti-cancer function. VAL-083's mechanism of action appears to be unaffected by the expression of MGMT, a DNA repair enzyme that causes chemotherapy resistance to chemotherapies targeting the O6 position of guanine.  DelMar has also demonstrated that the combination of VAL-083 and temozolomide was highly effective against brain tumor stem cells in vitro.DelMar and Accurexa will seek to establish a novel formulation which incorporates VAL-083 into the ACX-31 polymer wafer and to establish non-clinical proof of concept regarding the proposed advantages of the combination therapy.  DelMar will supply Accurexa with VAL-083 and the companies will share certain limited costs associated with the research.  DelMar has been granted an exclusive option to license or acquire and commercialize product candidates and intellectual property resulting from the research for a defined period after the completion of the research.  DelMar's option to negotiate a license or acquire the technology includes any and all results, research materials, related information and product candidates, including without limitation ACX-31 and related intellectual property and all rights thereto on an exclusive world-wide basis or other such terms as the parties may agree, in order to further develop and commercialize products based on the research project.  "Both of our companies have already made significant investments into the IP, mechanism of action and formulation of VAL-083 and ACX-31, respectively.  Therefore, developing a combined formulation is not expected to require significant cash expenditures.  This collaboration is a highly cost-effective approach to expand our product development portfolio by leveraging our companies' respective capabilities and assets," stated Mr. Bacha.About DelMar Pharmaceuticals, Inc.DelMar Pharmaceuticals, Inc. was founded to develop and commercialize proven cancer therapies in new orphan drug indications where patients are failing or have become intolerable to modern targeted or biologic treatments. The Company's drug in development, VAL-083, is currently undergoing clinical trials in the U.S. as a potential treatment for refractory glioblastoma multiforme. VAL-083 has been extensively studied by U.S. National Cancer Institute, and is currently approved for the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and lung cancer in China. Published pre-clinical and clinical data suggest that VAL-083 may be active against a range of tumor types via a novel mechanism of action that could provide improved treatment options for patients.For further information, please visit http://delmarpharma.com/; or contact DelMar Pharmaceuticals Investor Relations:ir@delmarpharma.com / (604) 629-5989. Follow us on Twitter @DelMarPharma or Facebook.com/delmarpharma.About Accurexa, Inc.Accurexa is focused on developing novel neurological therapies to be directly delivered into specific regions of the brain. It is developing its ACX-31 program for the local delivery of temozolomide as adjunctive therapy to BCNU, both chemotherapeutics, to brain tumor sites.  Oral temozolomide is a generic, FDA approved, first-line chemotherapy drug that is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme concomitantly with radiotherapy and then as maintenance treatment. Before oral temozolomide became generic, it generated 2012 US sales of approximately $420 million and global sales of approximately $910 million under its brand name Temodar®. However, current standard of care of delivering temozolomide to tumor sites through oral administration is limited by the blood-brain-barrier and oral temozolomide only increases median overall survival from 12.1 to 14.6 months.

Accurexa Initiates Development of Chemotherapy Product for Brain CancerHomeMailFlickrTumblrNewsSportsFinanceCelebrityAnswersGroupsMobileMoreTry Yahoo Finance on Firefox »YahooSearchSearchSign inU.S. Markets closedS&P 5002,477.13+7.22 (+0.29%)Dow 3021,613.43+100.26 (+0.47%)Nasdaq6,412.17+1.37 (+0.02%)Accurexa Initiates Development of Chemotherapy Product for Brain CancerAccesswireFebruary 4, 2015ReblogShareTweetShareSAN FRANCISCO,CA / ACCESSWIRE / February 4, 2015 / Accurexa Inc. (the "Company") (ACXA), a biotechnology company focused on developing and commercializing novel neurological therapies, announced today that it initiated the development of ACX-31 for the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme, a malignant primary brain tumor. ACX-31 is a chemotherapy product that delivers temozolomide directly to the tumor site with the Company's BranchPoint device. Temozolomide is a generic, approved chemotherapy drug that is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme concomitantly with radiotherapy and then as maintenance treatment. The Company's BrainPoint device has been developed for the delivery of therapeutics directly into specific regions of the brain and is expected to obtain FDA regulatory approval through a 510(k) submission process."ACX-31 is an important product for Accurexa because it could demonstrate how our BranchPoint device can open up new approaches in the treatment of tumors and other disorders that affect the human brain. We believe that delivering a generic, approved drug with our device can significantly shorten the development timeline of new products and bring novel therapies faster to the patients," said George Yu, the Company's President & CEO.About Glioblastoma MultiformeGlioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and most aggressive malignant primary brain tumor in humans. Approximately 16,000 new patients are diagnosed with GBM in the US each year. Median survival without treatment is 4.5 months. With treatment, concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide chemotherapy with radiation significantly improves, from 12.1 months to 14.6 months, progression free survival and overall survival in GBM patients, as demonstrated in recent randomized clinical trials. Before temozolomide became generic, it generated US sales of $420 million and global sales of $910 million under its brand name Temodar.About Accurexa, Inc.The Company is focused on developing and commercializing novel neurological therapies based on its proprietary BranchPoint technology delivering therapeutics directly into specific regions of the brain. The BranchPoint device delivers therapeutics through the radial deployment of a flexible delivery catheter to large and anatomically complex brain targets through a single initial brain penetration. Clinicians can "tailor" therapeutic delivery to individual patient anatomy and specific disease targets, which may enhance the efficacy of therapies. The BranchPoint device also gives physicians more precise control of the volume of therapeutics delivered and ensures that therapeutics delivered into the brain stay in the brain, avoiding the problem of reflux out to the brain surface. This modern and "easy to use" technology allows "real-time" monitoring of therapeutic delivery under interventional MRI guidance (iMRI), which can improve the accuracy of therapeutic delivery, reduce the risk of complications, and increase patient safety.The BranchPoint device was developed at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) with $1.8 million in funding from the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM). It is based on a neurosurgical delivery platform which the Company exclusively licensed from UCSF. It can enable new approaches to neurological therapy and be modified for the delivery of a wide range of novel therapeutics, such as stem cells to treat neurodegenerative diseases, chemotherapeutics to brain tumors or gene therapy.

Dr. Daniel Lim was frustrated.
A neurosurgeon and assistant professor at the University of California, San Francisco, Lim regularly uses a surgical device to deliver potentially life-changing treatments into patients' brains. But he thought the crude syringe invented in 1986 could be better.

For one, every time Parkinson's disease patients, for example, need cells transplanted into the brain, some must endure upwards of 10 injections because implanted cells don't spread through brain tissue. Every penetration, however, risks setting off bleeding in the brain.
Secondly, Lim said, as experimental stem cell treatments progress, it only makes sense to use a tool built to deliver those cells rather than one designed nearly three decades ago. That could cut down on clinical trial failures at a critical time for scientists developing those treatments.
"It seems mundane, but it's likely very important," Lim said. "Targeted deliveries are going to be essential."




After using the standard device during a study of an experimental stem cell therapy at UCSF, Lim knew there must be a better way.
Lim sketched his new device and turned it over to a group of UC Berkeley engineering students, who created a prototype. Then he won a $1.8 million grant in 2010 from the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine, the state's stem cell research funding organization, to push it through preclinical testing.
Now Lim and Accurexa Inc., the tiny San Francisco company that hopes to sell the device, are on the cusp of asking the Food and Drug Administration for marketing clearance.
Not unlike the current device, Lim's instrument sits in a massive frame that is mounted on the head of a patient. A hole is drilled in the skull and doctors deliver cells or direct brain stimulation or other treatments to the brain.




 


But instead of drilling multiple holes in the skull, the Accurexa device allows doctors to use a single entry point. They then can insert the hollowed, drug-bearing "plunger" — the diameter of heavy thread — multiple times to multiple locations.

The device hasn't yet been used in living humans — only cadavers, and none of them complained as the device delivered treatments to six locations in an hour.
In fact, that's part of the beauty of the device: It could deliver cells, an electrode and gene therapy in a single session.
"As a clinician, I tried to think it all the way through," Lim said.
Ultimately, he said, the device could convince some drug developers to look anew at experimental treatments that had been developed as oral drugs but which may be hundreds of times more effective when delivered directly into the brain.
Accurexa, which recently changed its name from Cyto Wave Technologies (OTC BB: CWAV), plans to submit an application to the FDA next month for marketing clearance, said George Yu, Accurexa's president and CEO.
The two-year-old company in December 2012 licensed laser technology from the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences focused on detecting metastatic cancer cells. That technology could take another three or four years to win FDA approval, Yu said.
At some point, Accurexa will look for a larger partner to sell Lim's device as it works with the doctor to develop it for other applications, Yu said.

VANCOUVER, British Columbia and WALNUT CREEK, Calif., Sept. 7, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- DelMar Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:    DMPI) ("DelMar"), a company focused on developing and commercializing proven cancer therapies in new orphan drug indications, and Accurexa Inc. (OTCQB: ACXA) ("Accurexa"), a company focused on the development of novel neurological therapies to be directly delivered into the brain, announced today a collaboration to develop a novel formulation for the local delivery of combination chemotherapy for the treatment of brain cancer and other solid tumors.  








Under the terms of the collaboration agreement DelMar will supply VAL-083 (dianhydrogalactitol) to be formulated within Accurexa's proprietary ACX-31 implantable polymer wafer to locally deliver VAL-083 in combination with temozolomide and/or BCNU for the treatment of brain cancer.  DelMar has been granted an exclusive option to license or acquire and commercialize product candidates and intellectual property resulting from the research.  
DelMar will host a teleconference for shareholders and investors on Wednesday, September 7, 2016 at 5PM EDT. Interested parties can access the call by dialing toll free 1-800-862-9098 or via the internet at:  https://engage.vevent.com/rt/delmar_ao~73915172
Mr. Bacha and DelMar management will discuss the Accurexa collaboration and outline the Company's plans for the remainder of 2016, including steps to advance VAL-083 into a pivotal Phase III and two additional Phase II clinical trials for the treatment of refractory glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most common and aggressive form of brain cancer. 
Accurexa's ACX-31 program has been developed in collaboration with Prof. Henry Brem who built one of the largest brain tumor research and treatment centers in the world at Johns Hopkins University and Prof. Robert Langer, who is the David H. Koch Institute Professor at MIT and the most cited engineer in history.  Professor Avi Domb at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem will lead the formulation development efforts for the collaboration.  Prof. Brem, Prof. Langer and Prof. Domb are pioneers in the development of local drug delivery treatments, and invented and developed Gliadel® (carmustine implant) which is a FDA approved, local chemotherapy for the treatment of GBM.  Drs. Brem and Langer will serve as advisors for the collaboration.
"Working together with Accurexa will allow DelMar to explore a promising new product opportunity that is complementary to our existing portfolio of systemic drug development programs established around VAL-083 without significant cash outlay or impact on our near-term cash burn rate," said Jeffrey Bacha, Chairman and CEO of DelMar Pharmaceuticals.  "This research collaboration will take advantage of our knowledge regarding the unique cytotoxic mechanism of VAL-083 to deliver combination chemotherapy directly to patients' cancer.  Combining drugs with distinct mechanisms for local delivery provides an opportunity to overcome chemoresistance while minimizing potential systemic toxicity."
"We are very pleased to collaborate with DelMar's experienced team allowing us to leverage their strong development capabilities.  They have recently completed a Phase I/II clinical trial of VAL-083 in brain cancer patients and had a successful end-of-Phase II meeting with the FDA while we recently had a positive pre-IND meeting with the FDA for our ACX-31 wafer program.  Looking forward to the future development pathway, we believe that the local delivery of VAL-083 as a component of our ACX-31 wafer could potentially provide a new and exciting treatment option for brain cancer patients," said George Yu, MD, Accurexa's President & CEO.
DelMar and Accurexa believe that combining VAL-083 with temozolomide and/or BCNU within Accurexa's proprietary drug delivery system may provide treatment advantages while limiting systemic toxicity.  
VAL-083 is a "first-in-class", small-molecule chemotherapeutic. In more than 40 Phase I and II clinical studies sponsored by the U.S. National Cancer Institute, VAL-083 demonstrated safety and efficacy in treating a number of cancers including lung, brain, cervical, ovarian tumors and leukemia. VAL-083 is approved in China for the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia and lung cancer and has received orphan drug designation in the U.S. for the treatment of gliomas, medulloblastoma and ovarian cancer as well as in Europe for the treatment of glioma.
VAL-083 exhibits its anti-tumor affect by forming DNA cross-links at the N7 position of guanine whereas temozolomide and BCNU primarily target the O6 position of guanine as their site of anti-cancer function.  
VAL-083's mechanism of action appears to be unaffected by the expression of MGMT, a DNA repair enzyme that causes chemotherapy resistance to chemotherapies targeting the O6 position of guanine.  DelMar has also demonstrated that the combination of VAL-083 and temozolomide was highly effective against brain tumor stem cells in vitro.
DelMar and Accurexa will seek to establish a novel formulation which incorporates VAL-083 into the ACX-31 polymer wafer and to establish non-clinical proof of concept regarding the proposed advantages of the combination therapy.  DelMar will supply Accurexa with VAL-083 and the companies will share certain limited costs associated with the research.  DelMar has been granted an exclusive option to license or acquire and commercialize product candidates and intellectual property resulting from the research for a defined period after the completion of the research.  DelMar's option to negotiate a license or acquire the technology includes any and all results, research materials, related information and product candidates, including without limitation ACX-31 and related intellectual property and all rights thereto on an exclusive world-wide basis or other such terms as the parties may agree, in order to further develop and commercialize products based on the research project.  
"Both of our companies have already made significant investments into the IP, mechanism of action and formulation of VAL-083 and ACX-31, respectively.  Therefore, developing a combined formulation is not expected to require significant cash expenditures.  This collaboration is a highly cost-effective approach to expand our product development portfolio by leveraging our companies' respective capabilities and assets," stated Mr. Bacha.
About DelMar Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
DelMar Pharmaceuticals, Inc. was founded to develop and commercialize proven cancer therapies in new orphan drug indications where patients are failing or have become intolerable to modern targeted or biologic treatments. The Company's drug in development, VAL-083, is currently undergoing clinical trials in the U.S. as a potential treatment for refractory glioblastoma multiforme. VAL-083 has been extensively studied by U.S. National Cancer Institute, and is currently approved for the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and lung cancer in China. Published pre-clinical and clinical data suggest that VAL-083 may be active against a range of tumor types via a novel mechanism of action that could provide improved treatment options for patients.

About Accurexa, Inc.
Accurexa is focused on developing novel neurological therapies to be directly delivered into specific regions of the brain. It is developing its ACX-31 program for the local delivery of temozolomide as adjunctive therapy to BCNU, both chemotherapeutics, to brain tumor sites.  Oral temozolomide is a generic, FDA approved, first-line chemotherapy drug that is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme concomitantly with radiotherapy and then as maintenance treatment. Before oral temozolomide became generic, it generated 2012 US sales of approximately $420 million and global sales of approximately $910 million under its brand name Temodar®. However, current standard of care of delivering temozolomide to tumor sites through oral administration is limited by the blood-brain-barrier and oral temozolomide only increases median overall survival from 12.1 to 14.6 months. Additional information about Accurexa may be found on its website, www.accurexa.com.

NEW YORK, June 17, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Accurexa Inc. (OTCQB: ACXA) a biotechnology company focused on developing and commercializing novel neurological therapies, announced on Monday that it has filed a submission with the U.S. FDA for 510(k) clearance to market its BranchPoint device. The Company's BranchPoint device was invented to deliver therapeutics, such as stem cells, through the radial deployment of a flexible catheter to specific brain target areas through a single brain penetration. The current standard of care is the use of straight, rigid needles which increase the risk of bleeding, stroke or reflux of therapeutics. Accurexa's system helps minimize this risk.
From the financial standpoint, the company is counting on the approval of this product.

ACCUREXA, INC. (ACXA) and Other Medical Device Companies Add Value for Patients and Investors
























Nov 28, 2016 (Marketwired via COMTEX) --
NEW YORK, NY--(Marketwired - November 28, 2016) - Accurexa, Inc. (otcqb:ACXA), a small-cap biotech focused on chemotherapy and immunology, is an up-and-coming leader in the neurological therapy space. Currently, Accurexa is working on the targeted delivery of such therapies, specifically the direct delivery of chemotherapeutics that effectively and safely cross the blood-brain barrier,         www.accurexa.com
.


                                        








According to Allied Market Research, the market opportunity for oncology treatments is forecast to reach $111.9 billion by 2020, achieving a compound annual growth rate of 7.1 percent. In 2015, the global cancer drugs market reached $78.24 billion, largely driven by increased demand for biological and targeted drug therapies for various cancers.


                                        








Leading the market are immunotherapy drugs, which offer a desirable risk-reward profile. The past few years have seen a tremendous boost in sentiment toward targeted cancer therapies due to their ability to protect healthy cells from toxic side effects common in other treatments.


                                        








The medical device market has many up and coming investment opportunities targeting a wide variety of health conditions and diseases. Consider Integra Lifesciences Holdings Corp.

, a company which has a range of products targeting neurosurgery and implants, helping doctors deliver the best surgery by providing the right tools for each operation. With a market cap of $2.93 billion and 26 percent growth on share price, this company offers strong growth potential for investors.


                                        








Cardiovascular Systems (CSII) has developed heart implants and devices. With heart disease the leading cause of death worldwide, the potential market is tremendous. In 2012 alone, 17.5 million people died due to cardiovascular events. CSII has a range of products all designed to target coronary artery disease. By offering catheter delivery of stents, this company helps patients get rapid treatment with minimal recovery times. A market cap of $797.13 million gives investors plenty to look at when considering this company. CSII has realized gains of 65 percent, even with the uncertainty currently plaguing the market.


                                        








ACXA, however, is developing multiple therapies in conjunction with several biotech companies and universities. ACX-31, for example, is a local chemotherapy wafer designed to treat brain cancer. It is being developed with Johns Hopkins University and DelMar Pharmaceuticals

.


                                        








Further, Accurexa is collaborating with StemImmune in the development of stem cell-mediated immunotherapy for the treatment of cancer and with University of California San Francisco (UCSF) in the treatment of Parkinson's disease through ACXA's "BranchPoint" delivery device. This device delivers therapeutics through a delivery catheter by way of a single brain penetration to treat neurodegenerative diseases and more.


                                        








ACXA stock is currently trading for 0.55 cents and is down 1.25 percent year to date. However, a solid market cap of $4.45 million makes this company a startup opportunity, given that it dramatically outperforms the market. For comparison, the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index (IBB) is down 24 percent in 2016.
