Publisher's Description▼▲
A radical new interpretation of the political and intellectual history of Puritan Massachusetts, The Making of an American Thinking Class envisions the Bay colony as a seventeenth century one-party state, where congregations served as ideological 'cells' and authority was restricted to an educated elite of ministers and magistrates. From there Staloff offers a broadened conception of the interstices of political, social, and intellectual authority in Puritan Massachusetts and beyond, arguing that ideologies, as well as ideological politics, are produced by self-conscious, and often class-conscious, thinkers.


Author Bio▼▲
 Darren Staloff is Assistant Professor of History at City College of New York.


Editorial Reviews▼▲
"An invigorating contribution to the scholarly literature on Puritan New England--original in perspective, forceful in argument, and graceful in presentation. In Staloff's sophisticated retelling, the emergence to authority in Massachusetts of certain intellectuals (clergymen) and intelligentsia (magistrates) as a 'thinking class' shaped the Puritan stronghold's politics and cultural life until 1686. By reading the sources with an uncommonly keen eye for the nuances of power, Staloff sheds new light on many heretofore slighted aspects of Massachusetts history as well as such old chestnuts as the banishing of Roger Williams, the squelching the Quakers, and the jousting over the Halfway Covenant. [Staloff] also offers perceptive new assessments of the Bay Colony's major personalities, including John Cotton, Thomas Hooker, and Increase Mather. Old hands at Puritan studies as well as newcomers to the field will profit immensely from this insightful book."--Alden T. Vaughan, Columbia University"In all probability, [Staloff's book] will quickly become the one book that everyone will read and assign to get into the mind and culture of Puritan New England."--John M. Murrin, Princeton University"Darren Staloff's analytical categories of class and power provide the structure for what is both an excellent social history of political conflicts and a useful political history of religious events. His account gives new, provocative twists to old stories like the Hutchinson trial, disputes over the charter, and the Halfway Covenant...Staloff's dramatic and nuanced narrative reveals not only the interplay of class and power but also the considerable influence of personalities and ideas."--illiam and Mary Quarterly"It offers a genuinely ironical way to understand the New England Puritans' lurch into modernity, a topic of neverending interest to scholars in this field."--Reviews in American History"Staloff presents a provocative argument. It is a thoughtful, intelligent work, one that considers the Puritan elite as dynamic and self-interested. The book is certain to rekindle interest (if it ever died out) in the intellectual history of the Puritans in New England and show us how we can use innovations from other fields, such as sociology, to refine our thinking about history."--The New England Quarterly"Darren Staloff's compact, closely reasoned book provides the best account to date of the institutional means by which the values of Protestant Christianity, whether contained in the Calvinist Federal Theology or the biblicism of the primitive churches, grew to power in Massachusetts, became pervasive, and then waned...To Staloff's great credit, one finishes his book convinced that such notoriously slippery yet monolithic terms as 'the intelligentsia' or 'thinking class' were, in the instance of the seventeenth-century Massachusetts, both identifiable and accurate."--Early American Literature

About


I am a UX architect in MSR Special Projects at Microsoft Research Cambridge. My work aims to transform the human side of data analytics, particularly how user interfaces enriched with AI can guide the discovery and sharing of analytic insights.
From 2008-2016,  I was a researcher in the Human-Computer Interaction group at Microsoft Research Asia, where my work explored the use of assisted preparation for talks and presentations, mobile microlearning for second language acquisition, exertion gaming for social health and fitness, and tangible, haptic, and augmented-reality interaction for desk work.
From 2000-2007, I read Computer Science and Management Studies at the University of Cambridge (BA 2004) before continuing as a doctoral candidate at the Computer Laboratory (PhD 2008). My dissertation was the first work to explore the concept of "peripheral interaction" with digitally-augmented objects on the boundary of a user's attention.

TestimonialsWhat others are saying.

" Darren Barker is hands down the most talented creative professional I have ever had the pleasure of working with. There is nothing this man cannot do! I never cease to be amazed at the diversity of creative and artful mediums he has mastered.
He is a true team player and takes the time to mentor his colleagues and subordinates with patience and encouragement. I learned so much during the years I worked along side him. He definitely helped shape my career in an incredibly positive way. His vision is nothing short of brilliant!
I would absolutely welcome and be honored by an opportunity to work with Darren again. "Stephanie Kreitner - Executive Vice President at Group Mobile
" Darren knows his stuff and can put it in gear to make impossible deadlines. On top of that, he’s got a great personality and is easy to work with. "Stephen Chai - Design Director at Dinng

" Darren would be a great asset for any creative business or a company. He has proven that by being a part of our creative team. As a small business each individual has to wear many hats, not only did Darren take an initiative and make it look easy, he inspires others to do the same. He is self-motivating, extremely talented, and highly adoptable to any situation or workload. I haven’t met many others that could take a project from concept to completion, plow through deadlines, obstacles, and impossible tasks while being a major player in each department. His creativity and voodoo magic in
I haven’t met many others that could take a project from concept to completion, plow through deadlines, obstacles, and impossible tasks while being a major player in each department. His creativity and voodoo magic in post has saved ruined footage, and bad audio many times over. He can grab a potato and make end credits out of it (true story). From sketches, design in photoshop/illustrator, to motion graphics, and editing, he would be valuable in any part of a creative department, actually now that think about it, he is the creative department. "Alexey Krapivin - Technical Director, Managing Partner at Xpression Media Group

" Darren is extremely competent and incredibly creative. He knows how to handle several projects at a time and gets things done when they need to be. He really knows his stuff! I would recommend Darren for anything related to audio visuals or graphics. "Chris Luker - Manager Media Services at Salt Lake Community College

" Darren has been an absolute pleasure to work with. His experience, ability and creativeness really set him apart from many and think of him as someone who can do it all. From film animation and graphics to creation and execution of a brand new design concept to picking up a camera and editing it to a create a unique, eye catching, professional piece to share with consumers. I would highly recommend Darren not only because of his extensive experience and knowledge but because of his ambitious personality, professionalism and team-player attitude. "Kandice Davis - Public Relations Specialist at PRMI
" Darren and I have worked together on multiple video projects and I hope to work with him on more in the future. I have seen him direct, edit, and film. He is very creative, hard working, and results driven. Not only is the quality of his work amazing, but working with him and his personality is a pleasure. He is always bettering himself and those around him. I would highly recommend Darren for any position. "Kyle Jacobson - Senior Web Designer at Red Ventures
" Darren Barker is creativity personified. He has an almost psychic ability to discover exactly what you want to convey with graphics — then executes it flawlessly. "Cinzi Lavin - Professional Composer in Hull, MA.
" Darren worked for me at my acting studio and helped me to take my business to the next level. He was able to brand my company with a logo that was professional and balanced and helped to get my business tools ready for student enrollment.
He helped with our student films in pre-production through design, sound, editing, graphics and post-production. Darren Barker has the most amazing skills in design and composition. I have high expectations when it comes to production design and so far with everyone I have worked with in the industry Darren was able to pull out the concept I would describe. Darren was a pleasure to work with and always had the most current information about programs we were using and would study endlessly until he found solutions to any issues that arose.
He taught me a very important lesson that I have carried with me and will never forget and has been extremely helpful in running my business. He taught me patients and to never respond to an adverse situation until you have taken time to cool down and think about it.  This has saved my reputation and has kept me in good standings with clients and students. "Sue Rowe - Owner at SR Studios
" I have known Darren for the past 14 years.  He is a professional in every sense. He has the technical skills, experience, creativity, and artistic talents to produce high quality, original work. He is consistently good-natured to work with and gets along well with the various individuals on production teams, even under deadlines and through difficult situations.
I also have been able to get to know Darren on a more personal level over the years, and have found him to be a kind person and loving, dedicated father. "Blair Kunz - Owner at Blair Kunz & Associates Photography, LLC
" I have had the opportunity to work with Darren Barker as an employee and most recently as a subcontractor.
While working at QSI Corporation, Darren taught me many things in our ten years together. He taught me the elements of good design and what makes a print or digital piece appealing to the user. Over the years we have spent many hours on a whiteboard brainstorming about different marketing campaigns. Darren has the ability to take a very complex concept to explain in words and to present it simply and effectively.
Recently I started my own marketing firm and am creating print and digital assets for my clients. Darren has worked with many of my clients as the sole graphic designer and is praised for his designs.
I recommend Darren Barker as a graphic designer, teacher and integral member of any marketing team. "Todd Christensen - Owner at Stumark, Digital Marketing Specialists

Social Media ManagementGrowing your business through social media marketing
WHAT IS SOCIAL MEDIA MANAGEMENT?
Social media management is the process of marketing your business through various media channels in the social networking realm of the internet, and managing your online presence with regularity and consistency.
WHY IS SOCIAL MEDIA MANAGEMENT IMPORTANT?
Companies are competing for attention not only through traditional advertising outlets, but also through a sea of personal social information, which is prevalent on the internet. The social networking sites are monitored constantly by potential customers. This creates the opportunity to reach people through their own surfing habits. However, reaching them is not enough. You need to reach them regularly, and you need to stand out in sea of competing information with concise words, compelling images, and marketing techniques that generate interest.
Studies suggest on average one must see an advertisement at least seven times before they act. A regular presence in various social media sites achieves this exposure, and encourages individuals to act, and those who act, to share their activities with family and friends who may be interested in your product or service. This becomes word-of-mouth advertising with your message and branding attached.
As a small business owner myself, I understand how important it is to stretch every dollar. That’s why I offer two packages designed to help small businesses succeed through social media channels.

VIDEO PRODUCTION
 
(fee varies by project)
Video is the fastest growing content on the internet. Mark Zuckerberg, CEO and founder of Facebook, has estimated that by 2019 video will become the majority type of content found online. If you struggle to rank in search engines, video can help boost your presence. Video has become one of the best methods for relaying your message in a cohesive way by utilizing video imagery, audio, text, graphics, and motion.
