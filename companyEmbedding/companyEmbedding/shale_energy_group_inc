Shale Energy Limited - Dorothy Well Completed and Producing 
July 22nd, 2014
Dorothy 3-27  Completion
The Dorothy Well under the operation of S.M Energy, a NYSE listed oil and gas developer, has been completed, oil and gas sales have begun. The Dorothy is the first Williston Basin Three Forks formation well Shale Energy Limited has participated in. The location still holds reserve potential for Middle Bakken as well as further Three Forks completions. Initial oil flows have been encouraging with sales above 300 boed and rising as fluids are lifted off the formation. The results are in line with Shale Energy expectations in consideration of the far lower completion costs of Three Forks well in comparison to a Middle Bakken.
Yauch 03-04  Production Update
Since production began on the 28th of June daily flows have risen to over 1500 boed which has beaten Shale Energy's initial expectations.
Bakken - Position Update
Shale Energy Limited now has interests in 3 units in the Bakken/Three Forks each containing a producing well and therefore all Held By Production. Within these units there are; 14 permitted well locations; 14 well applications pending and at least 6 PUD locations that Shale Energy anticipates permitting and development in the future. Shale Energy Chairman Richard Pritchard stated 'the level of development in the Bakken is accelerating due to infill drilling, and we are looking at further means including a listing so as to maintain our capital expenditure program'.

Shale Energy Limited - Yauch 03-04 Comes Online with 1000 Barrels Oil
June 30th, 2014
Yauch 03-04 - Mckenzie County N.D
The well known as the Yauch 03-04-1H was set to production on the 28th June with initial 18 hour flow producing over 1000 barrels of oil. Shale Energy's Chairman Mr Richard Pritchard stated 'the flow rate indicates an initial production of approximately 1500 bo/d  which is in line with our expectations'. The Operator will continue production and frac fluid recovery. Engineering suggests reserves sufficient for three more wells in the Bakken formation, Shale Energy will be able to participate in each well up to its acreage share.
Dorothy 3-27  Completion Update
The Dorothy 3-27HS under the operator S.M Energy, a NYSE listed oil and gas developer is nearing completion. SM Energy have stated they expect first oil flow in approximately one week. Engineering suggests reserves sufficient for three more wells in the Upper 3 Forks formation, Shale Energy will be able to participate in each well up to its acreage share.
Bakken - Position Update
Shale Energy Limited now has interests in 3 units in the Bakken/Three Forks containing two producing wells and one near completed, 14 permitted well locations, 14 further applications pending and at least 6 PUD locations that Shale Energy anticipates permitting and development in the future, all of which Shale Energy intends to participate in. The Chairman stated 'the level of development in the Bakken is tremendous, and we are seriously looking at means including a listing so as to maintain our capital expenditure program'.

Shale Energy Limited - Initial Gas Sales
May 15th, 2014
Bakken - Gas and NGL's Sales Contract
The Hawkeye 3-24H well was completed in May 2013 and has since produced over 300,000 Barrels of oil and 460,000 Mcf of gas to March 2014. 
With the completion of a gas pipeline Shale Energy has signed a gas and gas liquids sales contract with EOG the operator. 
Until April all gas was flared, this will add between 7-10% additional revenue from the existing well and will pave the way for the development of the further 14 wells to which Shale Energy can participate with EOG on this section. Shale Energy has a 3% interest.

Bakken - Dorothy 3-27HS Well
SM Energy has continued the development of the Dorothy 3-27HS well, having completed drilling earlier this month the well is now being lined and cemented, Shale Energy anticipates first production in late June. Shale Energy has a 1.5% interest.

SAN ANTONIO, Oct. 13, 2011 /PRNewswire/ -- Gulfmark Energy Group, Inc. (OTCBB: GMEI) ("Gulfmark", the "Company") is pleased to announce it has signed a non-binding letter of intent (LOI) with Notre-Dame Capital, Inc. ("NDC") of Montreal, Quebec, Canada, to assist Gulfmark Energy with the development of their Eagleford Shale assets. Specifically, Gulfmark intends to drill vertically through the Escondido, Olmos, San Miguel, Austin Chalk and Eagleford Shale formations, inclusive of horizontal drilling of approximately 3,000 to 4,000 feet upon reaching this impressive shale play. 
"This financing will propel Gulfmark's footprint in the Eagleford Shale play and provide the flexibility to execute on its business plans while affording it the development opportunities which currently exist in this prolific play. We have yet to assess all of the undeveloped potential opportunities to expand our operations utilizing horizontal wells with multi-stage fracturing technologies. Multiple targets have been identified; however, several other opportunities are currently under evaluation and analysis.  This financing will allow us to explore all resources available in our current asset base," stated Michael Ward, President and CEO of Gulfmark Energy.
Additional information will be forthcoming as developments unfold.

L.P. Brown, IIIbhaynes2017-04-30T22:53:32+00:00 
L.P Brown III
Shale Energy Group, Inc. operations are guided by LP Brown, III. Mr. Brown has worked with major oil companies such as Exxon, Chevron, Amoco and smaller independents such as Ross Perot Jr.’s Hillwood Energy, Denbury Resources and others. Mr. Brown has owned or co-owned independent oil companies with holdings in numerous, successful producing wells and extensive lease blocks. In 2006, he purchased a drilling rig and completed a successful, multi-well drilling program. In 2007, T&F Oil Company, Shale’s sister company, of which Mr. Brown was CEO, was ranked as the 15th largest oil producer in the Monroe District of Louisiana.
Third generation in the oil business, Mr. Brown’s career began in 1976 as a roughneck on drilling rigs during the summers while attending high school and college. He later worked as a landman, acquiring leases and running title for his own prospects. Thereafter, he rose through the ranks to become an independent oil producer and operator.
Mr. Brown’s background includes extensive experience in structuring oil and gas programs and petroleum financial management. As a knowledgeable veteran of the petroleum industry, he has been instrumental in several field discoveries, resulting in the acquisition of tens of thousands of acres of mineral leases with numerous producing wells.
Mr. Brown’s involvement with each prospect begins with the acquisition and development of the lease. He works closely with the landman, geologist(s), geophysicist(s), engineer(s), sales agent(s), banks and bond companies to complete a project. He creates budgets, negotiates contracts with geologist(s), drilling contractors and other key personnel.
Once oil/gas production is established, Mr. Brown’s involvement continues through the entire productive life of the well or field. Hi s involvement further extends throughout the production process, ending with the delivery of the oil/gas to the refiner/purchaser, resulting in the payment of monthly production checks to the co-owner/investors.
Mr. Brown is currently focusing on the acquisition of production, viable development and exploratory prospects both onshore and in the Gulf of Mexico. His acquisitions and sales in recent years have netted generous returns to the co-owners/investors.
