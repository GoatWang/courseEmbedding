Going Beyond Antibiotics®
Developing Anti-Infective Compounds Effective Against Bacteria, Viruses and Fungi.
NovaBay Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company developing products for the eye care market. We are currently focused primarily on commercializing prescription Avenova® for managing hygiene of the eyelids and lashes in the United States.
Avenova is the only eye care product formulated with a proprietary, stable and pure form of hypochlorous acid called Neutrox®. By replicating the anti-microbial chemicals used by white blood cells to fight infection, Neutrox has proven in laboratory testing to have broad antimicrobial properties. Avenova with Neutrox removes debris from the skin on eyelids and lashes without burning or stinging.
We have developed additional commercial products containing Neutrox, including our NeutroPhase® Skin and Wound Cleanser for wound care and CelleRx® for the dermatology market. We have partnerships for NeutroPhase in the U.S. as well as select overseas markets, most notably China.
In addition to our Neutrox family of products, we have also synthesized and developed a second category of novel compounds aimed at harnessing the power of white blood cell chemistry to address the global, topical anti-infective market. This second product category includes auriclosene, our lead clinical-stage Aganocide® compound, which is a patented, synthetic molecule with a broad spectrum of activity against bacteria, viruses and fungi.

Neutrox®


  





Neutrox — a pure form of hypochlorous acid (HOCl) produced by NovaBay’s proprietary and patented manufacturing process. Neutrox-containing products have been cleared by the Food & Drug Administration to clean skin and wounds. Labs tests show that Neutrox, identical to a naturally occurring substance produced by white blood cells as a first line of defense against microbial invaders, has potent antimicrobial activity, yet is non-toxic to mammalian cells. Moreover, Neutrox also neutralizes bacterial toxins and breaks up biofilms.

Neutrox (as a preservative in solution) demonstrates:*

Broad spectrum antimicrobial activity
Anti-inflammatory activity blocking both inflammatory toxins from pathogens and the body’s inflammatory mediators


* In vitro testing

NovaBay Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is an Emeryville, California based clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company, focused on developing novel, fast-acting, synthetic anti-infectives compounds. These compounds are designed to mimic the body's defense system against infection. The company is currently focused on products for the eye care market. Major products include Avenova, cleared by FDA for lid and lash cleansing as part of a regimen for Blepharitis.[1] and NeutroPhase, used in treatment of Necrotizing Fasciitis[2][3]

History[edit]
NovaBay Pharmaceuticals, Inc. was founded by Ron Najafi, an organic chemist who had previously worked for several pharmaceutical, chemical and biotech companies in the U.S. Najafi became intrigued by HOCl, hypochlorous acid, an antimicrobial substance produced by White Blood Cells while investigating the chemical reaction of White Blood Cells during oxidative burst cycle. HOCl and other chlorine-containing chemicals fight invading microbes. These natural substances rapidly oxidize the cell walls of bacteria and the protein coats of viruses, rendering them inactive.
Najafi started NovaBay Pharmaceuticals in 2000 to create a stable version of HOCl.[4][citation needed]
Najafi, chemistry Nobel Laureate Herbert C. Brown, and Purdue University Professor Dale Margerum recruited Dr. Lu Wang to NovaBay, where she is now Director of Product Development. She was able to develop the stable version of pure hypochlorous acid, without bleach impurities, which became NovaBay’s first product, NeutroPhase[5]"Hypochlorous Acid as a Potential Wound Care Agent Part II" (PDF).  "NeutroPhase® in chronic non-healing wounds" (PDF).  "Treatment of Acute Necrotizing Fasciitis Using Negative Pressure Wound Therapy and Adjunctive NeutroPhase Irrigation Under the Foam". [not in citation given] and cleared by the Food and Drug Administration in 2010. The product successfully treats a variety of chronic non-healing wounds without the use of standard antibiotics. NovaBay announced two new products named CelleRx™ for Plastic Surgery and i-Lid™ Cleanser (Now Avenova) that was cleared by FDA for lid and lash cleansing as part of a regimen for Blepharitis. "NovaBay Avenova has a low toxicity but kills eyelid bacteria in dry eye or blepharitis patients.". 
Corporate Governance[edit]
As of April 1, 2016[update], the members of the board of directors of NovaBay Pharmaceuticals were: Paul E. Freiman, Xinzhou LI (Paul Li), Gail Maderis, T. Alex McPherson, M.D., Ph.D., Massimo Radaelli, Ph.D., Mark Sieczkarek, Mijia WU (Bob Wu) and Xiaoyan LIU (Henry Liu).
Products[edit]
Products on the market[edit]
Avenova (formerly known as i-Lid Cleanser) [6] NeutroPhase [7] CelleRx, for Plastic Surgery
Products under development[edit]
NovaBay developed a method for making a stable pure form of hypochlorous acid (HOCl), a substance produced by the immune system as an effective first defense against microbial invaders. The company calls their proprietary formulation Neutrox. The company's chemists also created a related family of compounds which the company calls Aganocides.
The company is currently developing compounds with anti-bacterial and anti-viral action. Potential applications include flesh-eating disease, problems related to in-dwelling urinary catheters, and common eye conditions. Compounds are also being developed for the veterinary market.[8]

History[edit]
NovaBay Pharmaceuticals, Inc. was founded by Ron Najafi, an organic chemist who had previously worked for several pharmaceutical, chemical and biotech companies in the U.S. Najafi became intrigued by HOCl, hypochlorous acid, an antimicrobial substance produced by White Blood Cells while investigating the chemical reaction of White Blood Cells during oxidative burst cycle. HOCl and other chlorine-containing chemicals fight invading microbes. These natural substances rapidly oxidize the cell walls of bacteria and the protein coats of viruses, rendering them inactive.
Najafi started NovaBay Pharmaceuticals in 2000 to create a stable version of HOCl.[4][citation needed]
Najafi, chemistry Nobel Laureate Herbert C. Brown, and Purdue University Professor Dale Margerum recruited Dr. Lu Wang to NovaBay, where she is now Director of Product Development. She was able to develop the stable version of pure hypochlorous acid, without bleach impurities, which became NovaBay’s first product, NeutroPhase[5]"Hypochlorous Acid as a Potential Wound Care Agent Part II" (PDF).  "NeutroPhase® in chronic non-healing wounds" (PDF).  "Treatment of Acute Necrotizing Fasciitis Using Negative Pressure Wound Therapy and Adjunctive NeutroPhase Irrigation Under the Foam". [not in citation given] and cleared by the Food and Drug Administration in 2010. The product successfully treats a variety of chronic non-healing wounds without the use of standard antibiotics. NovaBay announced two new products named CelleRx™ for Plastic Surgery and i-Lid™ Cleanser (Now Avenova) that was cleared by FDA for lid and lash cleansing as part of a regimen for Blepharitis. "NovaBay Avenova has a low toxicity but kills eyelid bacteria in dry eye or blepharitis patients.". 
Corporate Governance[edit]
As of April 1, 2016[update], the members of the board of directors of NovaBay Pharmaceuticals were: Paul E. Freiman, Xinzhou LI (Paul Li), Gail Maderis, T. Alex McPherson, M.D., Ph.D., Massimo Radaelli, Ph.D., Mark Sieczkarek, Mijia WU (Bob Wu) and Xiaoyan LIU (Henry Liu).
Products[edit]
Products on the market[edit]
Avenova (formerly known as i-Lid Cleanser) [6] NeutroPhase [7] CelleRx, for Plastic Surgery
Products under development[edit]
NovaBay developed a method for making a stable pure form of hypochlorous acid (HOCl), a substance produced by the immune system as an effective first defense against microbial invaders. The company calls their proprietary formulation Neutrox. The company's chemists also created a related family of compounds which the company calls Aganocides.
The company is currently developing compounds with anti-bacterial and anti-viral action. Potential applications include flesh-eating disease, problems related to in-dwelling urinary catheters, and common eye conditions. Compounds are also being developed for the veterinary market.[8]

(NYSE MKT: NBY), a biopharmaceutical company focusing on commercializing prescription Avenova® lid and lash hygiene in the domestic eye care market, announces that its Neutrox® product line has received the CE mark, clearing the way for this product to be sold in European Union and certain other countries, and ISO 13485 certification, satisfying a critical step in European approval process.“It’s gratifying to report that our Neutrox product line, which includes Avenova, has met the rigorous quality and safety standards to successfully complete the applications for both the CE mark and ISO certification,” said Mark M. Sieczkarek, NovaBay’s Chairman, President and CEO. “While we are committed to accelerating sales in the largely untapped U.S. market, these authorizations provide future opportunities to expand into significant new markets either through distributors or with our own sales organization.“Avenova’s distinct advantages in managing chronic blepharitis are increasingly gaining recognition by eye care specialists both in the U.S. and abroad,” he added. “Avenova is the only eye care product based on our unique formulation of hypochlorous acid with no bleach impurities, and is the only commercial eye care product proven in a multicenter clinical study to substantially reduce bacteria that can cause blepharitis.”About NovaBay Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: Going Beyond AntibioticsNovaBay Pharmaceuticals is a biopharmaceutical company focusing on the commercialization of prescription Avenova® lid and lash hygiene for the eye care market. Avenova is formulated with Neutrox™, which is cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a 510(k) medical device. Neutrox is NovaBay’s pure hypochlorous acid. Laboratory tests show that hypochlorous acid has potent antimicrobial activity in solution yet is non-toxic to mammalian cells and it also neutralizes bacterial toxins. Data from a multicenter clinical study show that Avenova reduced bacterial load, the underlying cause of blepharitis, on ocular skin surface by more than 90%. Avenova is marketed to optometrists and ophthalmologists throughout the U.S. by NovaBay’s direct medical salesforce. It is accessible from more than 90% of retail pharmacies in the U.S. through agreements with McKesson Corporation, Cardinal Health and AmeriSource Bergen.Forward-Looking StatementsThis release contains forward-looking statements, which are based upon management's current expectations, assumptions, estimates, projections and beliefs. These statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding the implied impact of obtaining the CE Mark and ISO certification on the Company’s future financial results.

NovaBay Pharmaceuticals’ Neutrox® Product Line Receives CE Mark and ISO Certification for the European Union | Business Wire


























































NovaBay Pharmaceuticals’ Neutrox® Product 
      Line Receives CE Mark and ISO Certification for the European Union




Opens market opportunities outside the U.S. for Avenova and 
      demonstrates compliance with stringent safety and quality standards






September 12, 2016 06:50 AM Eastern Daylight Time



EMERYVILLE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--NovaBay® 
      Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NYSE MKT: NBY), a biopharmaceutical 
      company focusing on commercializing prescription Avenova® lid 
      and lash hygiene in the domestic eye care market, announces that its 
      Neutrox® product line has received the CE mark, clearing the 
      way for this product to be sold in European Union and certain other 
      countries, and ISO 13485 certification, satisfying a critical step in 
      European approval process.
    


      “It’s gratifying to report that our Neutrox product line, which includes 
      Avenova, has met the rigorous quality and safety standards to 
      successfully complete the applications for both the CE mark and ISO 
      certification,” said Mark M. Sieczkarek, NovaBay’s Chairman, President 
      and CEO. “While we are committed to accelerating sales in the largely 
      untapped U.S. market, these authorizations provide future opportunities 
      to expand into significant new markets either through distributors or 
      with our own sales organization.
    

      “Avenova’s distinct advantages in managing chronic blepharitis are 
      increasingly gaining recognition by eye care specialists both in the 
      U.S. and abroad,” he added. “Avenova is the only eye care product based 
      on our unique formulation of hypochlorous acid with no bleach 
      impurities, and is the only commercial eye care product proven in a 
      multicenter clinical study to substantially reduce bacteria that can 
      cause blepharitis.”

A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER 

















A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER

It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer. But what was once the fruit of a wild imagination is today a reality.
Rather than killing cancer cells directly with traditional approaches like radiation or chemotherapy, immunotherapy harnesses the immune system’s power to eliminate the cancer or slow its growth and ability to spread. Research shows immunotherapy is improving outcomes and survival rates for some patients, including kidney and lung cancer. In fact, research from the American Association for Cancer Research shows that for advanced-melanoma patients, survival rates are improving thanks in part to these new treatment options.
"It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer." Tweet
Biopharmaceutical researchers are urgently working to gain new insights into the complex interactions between patients’ immune systems and the cancer cells growing in their bodies with the goal of markedly improving outcomes in more tumor types.
With 836 medicines and vaccines in development for cancer, 80 percent of which have the potential to be first-in-class treatments, millions of Americans living with cancer have hope for a brighter future.
Welcome to the new era of medicine.
For all of us.

HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

















HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

Diabetes is a serious condition that effects more than 30 million Americans. While complications of the disease can be dire, there is hope. Biopharmaceutical researchers are helping patients manage the condition today and envision a bright outlook for future treatments.
Diabetes: the patient perspective
Diabetes is a general term for a chronic condition where there is too much glucose (sugar) in the blood. Normally, the pancreas makes insulin to help convert glucose into energy. With diabetes, the body either does not make enough insulin (type 1 diabetes) or does not use it properly (type 2 diabetes), leading to high blood glucose levels. Uncontrolled diabetes can lead to serious health complications, such as heart attack, lower-limb amputation, vision impairment and blindness.
Endocrinologist Dr. William "Bill" Chin has experience treating endocrine disorders, including diabetes. As chief medical officer at PhRMA, he works to ensure that patient voices are heard, drawing on his dual experience as a physician and as the parent of a child with diabetes. When Dr. Chin's son, Danny, was 15, he began experiencing telltale symptoms like excessive thirst. Dr. Chin diagnosed his son himself with type 1 diabetes.
He says, "I don’t think any parent is ever prepared to learn that one of our kids has developed a disease, particularly one that will be chronic. In many ways it’s forever, but the good news is we have great therapies that actually will allow a patient with diabetes to live a full and completely normal life if it’s well managed."
The changing landscape of diabetes treatment
The medications that Danny relies on have come a long way in the last ten years. A decade ago, a number of insulin options were available to patients, as well as oral and injected medications. Successful management of diabetes required constant and diligent monitoring of glucose levels. To control their glucose, patients needed multiple daily injections and/or multiple oral medicines.
In recent years, researchers have focused on making treatments much easier for patients, from fewer pills to less frequent injections. Careful monitoring and treatment are still needed, but current medicines in development offer a promising future.
There are 171 medicines currently in development for type 1 and type 2 diabetes and diabetes-related conditions. A new wave of treatments is offering patients better or more sustained control over their glucose levels. Other medicines in the pipeline may address diabetes-related complications that affect the kidneys, blood vessels and eyes. All of the medicines are in clinical trials or awaiting review by the FDA.
While these advances have improved patient quality of life and increased lifespans for type 1 diabetes, ongoing research remains critical. In fact, diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the United States in 2013.
Dr. Chin says, "Collaboration is incredibly important in the understanding and development of new treatments for diabetes ... we are continually seeking to advance our understanding of the disease. This can only be achieved by having academic scientists and physician scientists working closely with scientists in the biopharmaceutical industry."

We cannot take progress for granted

















We cannot take progress for granted





 Share

We are in a new era of medical discovery and have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of costly and debilitating diseases. But we must not take this progress for granted.  To ensure medical innovation continues for the benefit of patients we need public policies that reward the investment and time it takes to develop life-saving treatments and cures.
In order to enhance competition and improve affordability for patients, our country must:
1)    Make medicines more affordable by rewarding value
 Today, America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies are partnering with health insurers to improve how we pay for medicines. Prices for medicines may vary based on how well an individual responds to treatment, or agreements may lower co-pays if patients achieve better health outcomes. While these partnerships will vary, they are helping to ensure we get the right medicine to the right patient at the right time – improving care and lowering costs across the health care system.
Yet, outdated regulations prevent wider use of these new payment arrangements.  Government rules and regulations should not prevent the private sector from developing better ways to pay for medicines. Rather, we must ensure health plans can cover more of the newest medicines and give patients more choices – improving care and lowering health care costs for Americans.
2)    Ensure patients get the best deal on medicines
America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies often negotiate large rebates for prescription medicines with insurers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs). Those rebates are growing every year and now exceed $100 billion per year – helping to hold down health care costs for patients and taxpayers.
But we can do more to ensure patients benefit directly from these negotiated savings, and put an end to an unfair practice that requires patients to buy medicines at full price, even when their insurers get a rebate. In fact, patients with large deductibles can end up paying more than their insurer pays for their medicine.  That’s wrong. Health insurance companies should share with patients the discounts they receive. This could lower out-of-pocket costs for some patients by hundreds – if not thousands – of dollars every year.
3)    Make new breakthroughs accessible, and promote competition
We need to make it make it easier for patients to get access to breakthrough medicines. It simply takes too long to get new medicines approved – over 10 years and over one billion dollars, on average.  Outdated regulations and approaches for evaluating drugs can slow things down even more. To get medicines approved faster, while ensuring safety, we need to modernize the FDA with new technologies and expertise to keep up with 21st century science. Modernizing the FDA will bring down the time and cost of developing new medicines, which will bring medicines to patients faster, and enhance competition in the market.
We also need to reduce the backlog of applications for generic medicines at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  This will ensure that patients benefit as less expensive generic medicines replace higher cost treatments that have lost patent protection. 
At the same time, we must avoid policies that deter risk-taking or siphon funding away from the research and development of new medicines for patients. Learn more about our plan to build a sustainable, science-based health care system that harnesses today’s hopes to discover tomorrow’s cures here.

9 Ways We Assure the High Quality of Our Nutraceuticals & Nutritional Supplements9 Ways We Assure the High Quality of Our Nutraceuticals & Nutritional Supplements














9 Ways We Assure the High Quality of  Our Nutraceuticals & Nutritional Supplements
I'm sure you've heard of vitamins, herbs, and other nutritional products that flunked lab tests. Here at Advanced Bionutritionals, we strive to make sure that does not happen.
In fact, our manufacturing process assures purity, potency and quality 9 different ways:

"You Get An A+"
"Thank you. I did receive the credit back on my credit card. You often promote your "money back guarantee" with your literature. Well, you certainly deliver on your promise!!!.
I judge a company on Quality, Price and Service (you pass on all three) but the ultimate test comes when you have a "problem". Your company scored an "A+"!!!!!! You have earned my business forever. Thank you for your outstanding service and problem resolution!"
Patrick M., Colorado



We use suppliers and growers that we've known for years. 


We use ingredients that are shown to be effective in scientific studies.


We use no artificial colors, artificial binders, artificial fillers, or artificial preservatives, and non-GMO sources whenever available. 


Every supplier is qualified by testing multiple lots of material. The material is assayed for purity and screened for pathogens like mold, yeast, staph, and salmonella.


The batches of our ingredients are tested using FTIR spectrometers and compared to a purity index.


Our products are manufactured in a facility that is GMP (Good Manufacturing Practices) certified.


Batches of our product undergo rigorous disintegration tests in conformance with USP guidelines to ensure proper breakdown in the stomach and absorption in the intestines.


Our manufacturing process has multiple checks in place, and our batches are signed off by a quality control officer to ensure accuracy, purity, and potency.


Our bottles are safety sealed for lasting freshness and potency. And each bottle is marked with a manufactured date and/or an expiration date.





For you, that means the best quality possible. In fact, we promise it. If you are ever dissatisfied with one of our products for any reason whatsoever, simply return the unused portion within 90 days of purchase. We will refund every penny you paid, including shipping and handling. You only pay return shipping.
