Comcast Cable Chief Promises Customer Service Will “Be Our Best Product.” Really.
By Ashlee Kieler@akieler January 8, 2015 Comcast CEO Neil Smit told a panel at the International CES conference that customer service would soon be the company’s best product.
Comcast is reigning Worst Company in America champion for a reason: we’ve seen story after story after story where consumers have struggled just to get basic service from the company. But Comcast cable head Neil Smit was confident (or delusional) when he told a panel at the International CES that customer service would soon be the best product to come from the company.
Smit told the audience at a “Fast Innovation” panel Wednesday afternoon that Comcast is on the way to a complete customer service turnaround.
“We do need to transform our customer experience, and I think we have a lot of work to do,” Smit said, in what might be the understatement of the century. “It will take time, but we’ll get it done.”
Customer satisfaction surveys have consistently found Comcast lagging behind pretty much everyone. The most recent customer satisfaction surveys, released at the end of December, found Comcast scoring well below average in “overall satisfaction” in every area. In the 2014 American Customer Satisfaction Index, Comcast doesn’t just score in the bottom for pay-TV and broadband companies, but lowest among all companies, beaten only by their acquisition target Time Warner Cable.
To address customer satisfaction issues, Smit said, the company has already been hard at work by moving their “top product person” and putting him in charge of customer service. He was referring to senior vice president of customer experience Charlie Herrin, who the company promised in September would be on hand to fix customers’ cable experiences.
“We expect that customer service will soon be one of our best products,” Smit concluded optimistically, while we all rolled our eyes.

(Getty)
Neil Smit, Comcast’s CEO, is in the headlines after The Hollywood Reporter pegged him to “become the most powerful and scrutinized executive in pay television.” Here’s what you should know about this Comcast exec.

1. Neil Smit Isn’t Comcast’s Only CEO

The corporate chain of command at a company like Comcast can be a bit confusing. The Comcast Executive Biographies page lists Neil Smit as “President and Chief Executive Officer, Comcast Cable” as well as “Executive Vice President, Comcast Corporation.”
Brian L. Roberts, another Comcast bigwig, is listed on the same page as “Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Comcast Corporation.” 

2. Neil Smit Makes Over $1.5 Million Annually

Pretty smart of Neil Smit, head of merged Comcast/TWC, to sell 11,000 shares of $CMCSA last week for $585,200… stock is down today
— marcus baram (@mbaram) February 13, 2014


According to a profile on Forbes, Neil Smit has an annual salary of $1.5 million, as of 2012. That same year, he made an additional $1 million in bonuses. 
On top of all that, he also earned stock awards, option awards, and other income. In summation, Forbes estimates his 2012 earnings at $18,264,217.

3. Neil Smit Was a Navy Seal

Comcast cable president and CEO Neil Smit on MSO’s ongoing metered broadband tests: “nothing conclusive there yet”
— Jeff Baumgartner (@thebauminator) February 13, 2014

 

 

The Los Angeles Times has reported that Smit served as a Navy SEAL for nearly six years. At the time of his retirement from the Navy, Smit was a lieutenant commander.
The LA Times adds that this former SEAL is positioned to oversee Comcast as it moves forward:

“Neil Smit, Comcast Cable chief executive and a former Navy SEAL, this week was named Comcast’s go-to guy: the executive who would closely oversee the integration of at least 8 million Time Warner Cable customers into Comcast, which already has nearly 22 million video subscribers.
That means Smit also would be the point man overseeing upgrades to Time Warner Cable’s systems in New York and Los Angeles, where 1.5 million homes have Time Warner Cable service.”


4. Smit Loves New Technology
 

 

In the Hollywood Reporter‘s analysis of Smit, they cite a source who refers to Smit at “a hands-on technophile.” That seems like a fair assessment, given the fact that Comcast has launched 40 products in just the past two years.

5. Neil Smit Is Cool Under Pressure

Comcast's Neil Smit says getting NFLX on set top box is not "high priority" but still "open to putting apps on X1" set top box
— Shalini Ramachandran (@ShaliniWSJ) October 30, 2013


 

 
Back when he was working for Charter Communications, Smit gave an interview with St. Louis Commerce Magazine. In the interview, Smit talked about one of his early jobs, working for a crisis management firm.
“Their primary business was kidnapping negotiations,” Smit says. “You know, as a Navy SEAL when you parachute into a situation, you’ve got to figure it out pretty fast. This was no different. I had to make a quick assessment of a situation, plan action and communicate it to everyone involved. I did this until we had our first child. Then, my wife said I needed to find a new career.”
Whatever Smit is asked to do for Comcast in the future, it is likely that he will be able to keep his cool even in the most pressure-filled of business situations.

Comcast CEO Neil Smit Says Improving Customer Service Is His Top Priority

TruckTrack Aims To Capture A Trucking Sector Still Running On Old Tech












Comcast Cable President and CEO Neil Smit spoke at Disrupt New York today, discussing his company’s recent deal with Netflix, his thoughts on Aereo, and more.
“I think if there’s one thing to disrupt in our business, it’s customer service,” Smit said in response to TechCrunch writer Ryan Lawler mentioning that Comcast was recently voted the worst company in America.
“It’s my top priority,” he added, explaining that customers should know the exact time a technician is coming to their home, among other changes.
Smit mentioned Netflix, Amazon, Google, and Apple as new competitors in delivering content to viewers. When pressed specifically on Comcast’s recent direct access deal with Netflix, Smit chuckled and noted, “Reed’s full of surprises,” alluding to Netflix CEO Reed Hastings.
“We feel it was a good outcome for all parties,” he said. Smit refused to go into greater depth regarding Netflix, and ducked questions about what Apple and Comcast are working on together.



Discussing cord-cutting and customers sharing their passwords, Smit touted Comcast’s new packages and college partnerships as ways to win over millennials. While he said he believes multiple approaches, from over the top to more traditional cable, will win in the space, he referred to the cost of content multiple times during his talk.
“We pay $9 billion a year for content,” Smit said. “One of the things that I question in the Aereo solution is: are they paying for content? The spend for that content has to come from somewhere.”

 News Articles  Oct 28, 2013 12:01 AM ET Neil Smit President & CEO, Comcast Cable Communications • Executive VP, ComcastBy Jon Lafayette   jlafayette Even in a tough business like cable, not many executives have had Navy Seal training like Comcast Cable CEO Neil Smit has. Smit’s unit, Seal Team Six, is the one that took down Osama bin Laden on May 2, 2011.Smit doesn’t talk much about his own service with the secretive Seals, simply confirming that he saw combat. “He doesn’t wear it on his sleeve,” says Matt Bond, who was in charge of programming at Comcast before moving to NBCUniversal as executive VP of content distribution. “I’ve got to believe he’s got a lot to brag about that he’s not bragging about.”Nevertheless, Smit’s military background is part of his reputation. “I know I would not want to get into a knife fight with him in an alley,” says Bill Goodwyn, president/CEO of strategic distribution and Discovery Education at Discovery Communications. “The good thing about Neil is he doesn’t need to go there because intellectually he’s as sound as he is physically. That’s good news for people on the other side of the table.”Abbe Raven, chairman of A+E Networks, has worked closely with Smit on National Cable and Telecommunications Association committees. “I have enormous respect for him,” Raven says. “He was a Navy Seal and he’s been very supportive of the industry’s efforts surrounding hiring veterans in the industry. Everyone knows he was a hostage negotiator.”Raven says she has negotiated with Smit, and “what’s interesting is, he does like to win, but he really does have an uncanny ability to make you feel like you’re winning too, and I think that’s something that comes from his background.”Smit grew up on a farm in Suffield, Conn., where he woke early to feed the animals, but knew he didn’t want to be a farmer or construction worker like his dad. He went to Duke on a Navy scholarship and signed up for Seal training upon graduation. After retiring as a lieutenant commander, Smit earned a master’s degree from Tufts’ Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. He took a job with a company in the business of negotiating with kidnappers, but with a growing family, decided to pursue a different profession.He joined Pillsbury and was assigned to fix ailing operations. He became head of Pillsbury Mexico and moved to Argentina when Pillsbury made a big acquisition there. Nabisco hired him away from Pillsbury and put him in charge of its Latin American business. Then AOL called, and he wound up running its subscription business. “It was exciting because we were bringing the Internet to people,” Smit says.Paul Allen came calling next, asking Smit to join Charter, which he ran for four years before Comcast chairman and CEO Brian Roberts recruited him to the nation’s biggest cable operator.Roberts says he had admired Smit’s unique set of experiences, but “you never know someone really well till you’re working together in the pressure cooker.” Now, after four years, he says, “I can’t imagine anyone doing a better job taking Comcast to the next phase of where we want it to go, deploying new products, nurturing people and setting a tone from the top of ethics, hard work and yet, humility.”In addition to his experience in marketing and technology, Smit says, his Seal training has in fact helped him in his civilian career. “The first thing you learn in Seal team training is, it’s all about the team; it’s not about the individual,” Smit says. “You learn that you play to win, there’s no alternative. You make decisions in the situation. You make a call, you go left or you go right, you can adjust later, but get out of the line of fire. You’ve always got to be developing your skills and your team capabilities. You’ve got to be better.”He says he also learned lessons about communications: “Everybody’s got to know what the plan is. There’s no room for miscommunications.”The theory works in practice. Despite the natural tension between programmers and operators, there’s been none between Smit and his predecessor, Stephen Burke, who now runs NBCUniversal for Comcast, Roberts says. “Neil has a point of view of getting problems solved, and I think he’s used to being on a team,” Roberts explains. “Neil is comfortable as just one of the guys, but he can lead. I’ve never seen anybody rev up a company and a business with the intensity and the success that Neil has had with the Xfinity product.”Things were already running pretty well when he arrived at Comcast, Smit notes. “Brian and Stephen had done a lot of the heavy lifting in getting the platforms in place,” he says. “I was able to leverage that and innovate at a faster rate. We put out almost 40 new products in the last two years.” One of those is the cloud-based entertainment platform X1, designed to help customers access more content more easily.At a time when containing programming costs is imperative for distributors, Smit says it’s also important to acquire broader rights to content. Some of Comcast’s products, like VOD, can help drive ratings, and one of the benefits of having NBCU under the Comcast umbrella is an ability to experiment. “I think we work pretty collaboratively with our network partners to bring consumers what I would describe as the future of entertainment,” Smit says.“The definition of a true leader is one who is willing to take risks by searching for solutions that serve the entire industry, not just their individual business,” says Chase Carey, president and COO of 21st Century Fox. “This is the compass by which Neil operates and what has made Comcast a true driving force for bringing consumers better television experiences.”That makes cable an exciting place to Smit. “It’s an especially dynamic time in the industry, and I look forward to applying the functionality of the Internet to the television and advertising and overall entertainment viewing for the customers,” he says.
