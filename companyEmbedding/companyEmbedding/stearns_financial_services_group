Revolutionizing the Home Loan Experience



Buying a home is a really big deal. We get that. Whether you’re in search of your first home – or you’ve been down this path before – you’ll have questions and concerns. You may even hit some dead ends and bumps in the road.

But that’s okay. We’re well-equipped to go through the journey with you. For more than 28 years, we’ve been helping customers like you navigate the home-buying and refinancing processes.

We’ve been making the American dream of homeownership come true for families throughout the United States since Glenn Stearns founded our company in 1989. 

Today, Stearns Lending has revolutionized home financing to make the process faster, simpler and more secure. Harnessing the power of technology and the passion of our people, we’ll give you a personalized mortgage experience.





Our Culture














Our Mission Statement

When we say, “I Can Help You!” we are making a commitment to helping people reach their goals and achieve their dreams.  That’s true in every interaction we have with customers and with each other. 
 
“I Can Help You!” means we view colleagues, employees, customers and clients as individuals – not as transactions. It places the focus on them, emphasizing a willingness to give as much as receive. 
 
We make a commitment to get the job done correctly and on time – with integrity, responsibility and accountability. We will do what we said we will do, and deliver on promises made.
          
      









Lending Hands 

The "I Can Help You!" culture at Stearns is about assisting others, including giving back and making a difference in the communities where we live and work. In 2016, we partnered with HomeAid America to provide toiletry CareKits for the homeless. Our team members went all out and collected more than 30,000 Care Kit items during the month of November.

Our goal was to provide 2,300 Care Kits, and we succeeded in producing nearly double that number. In addition, hundreds of Stearns employees donated items and volunteered their time. It was a powerful demonstration that the "I can help you" culture at Stearns includes making a positive difference in the lives of others.
    
     










Employee Testimonials















 



							Rather than being a question, like most people say,  " I can help you" is a statement.  An assurance of help.  That kind of statement can make a customer or colleague feel a little more secure that you are on their side, and will go the extra mile with confidence.

BBB Accreditation





                BBB Accredited Since 06/01/2008
            

                BBB has determined that Stearns Financial Services Group, Inc. meets Standards of BBB Accreditation, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            

                BBB accreditation does not mean that the business's products or services have been evaluated or endorsed by BBB, or that BBB has made a determination as to the business's product quality or competency in performing services.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

                            2. cooperate with BBB's activities and efforts to promote voluntary self- regulation within the business' industry
                        
3. honor any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process

                    1. Follow federal, state/provincial and local advertising laws.
                

                    2. Abide by the BBB Code of Advertising. Supply, upon request, substantiation for advertising and selling claims. Correct advertising and selling practices, when recommended by BBB.

4. Cooperate with BBB self-regulatory programs for the resolution of advertising disputes.
5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

                    6. Avoid misleading customers by creating the false impression of sponsorship, endorsement, popularity, trustworthiness, product quality or business size through the misuse of logos, trustmarks, pictures, testimonials, or other means
                







Tell the Truth









            Honestly represent products and services, including clear and adequate disclosures of all material terms.

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Upon request, provide BBB with all information required to evaluate compliance with BBB standards.

5. the business' return/refund policy

                            6. any recurring commitment into which the customer may be entering, including information on how future billing will occur

Be Responsive









            Address marketplace disputes quickly, professionally, and in good faith.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Promptly respond to all complaints forwarded by BBB by: 
1. Resolving the complaint directly with the complainant and notifying BBB, or

                            2. Providing BBB with a response that BBB determines: 

                                    1. is professional,
                                
2. addresses all of the issues raised by the complainant,
3. includes appropriate evidence and documents supporting the business' position, and

                    2. Make a good faith effort to resolve disputes, which includes mediation if requested by BBB. Other dispute resolution options, including arbitration, may be recommended by BBB when other efforts to resolve a dispute have failed. BBB may consider a business' willingness to participate in recommended dispute resolution options in determining compliance with these standards.
                

                    3. Comply with any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process.
                

                    4. Cooperate with BBB in efforts to eliminate the underlying cause of patterns of customer complaints that are identified by BBB.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.
