AECOM appoints Randall A. Wotring as president of technical and operational services



2016-09-29 10:56:04









LOS ANGELES--AECOM (NYSE:ACM), a premier, fully integrated global infrastructure firm, has announced that Randall A. Wotring has been named president of technical and operational services, effective immediately.


The newly expanded role includes continued leadership of AECOM’s management services organization, as well as the added responsibility of leading key strategic initiatives. These include the expansion of the Company’s presence in the commercial sector and with global governments, and progressing its expertise in resilience on large-scale critical infrastructure projects. In addition, Mr. Wotring will oversee government affairs.
With more than 30 years of experience in the engineering and construction industry, Mr. Wotring joined AECOM from URS Corporation, where he previously served as President of Federal Services. Under his leadership since 2004, the Federal Services business grew significantly with major programs for the U.S. Departments of Defense, Homeland Security, and Energy; NASA; and the United Kingdom's Ministry of Defence and Nuclear Decommissioning Authority.
John C. Vollmer, previously executive vice president and chief operating officer for management services, will assume the role of president of management services, reporting to Mr. Wotring. Mr. Vollmer will lead AECOM’s work providing a broad array of technical and management services to the U.S. federal government, including the Department of Defense, the Department of Energy and other federal agencies.
“Randy and John’s appointments are exciting steps forward that further our design, build, finance and operate vision and enable greater collaboration across our expanding set of capabilities,” said AECOM Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Michael S. Burke. “Both leaders bring successful track records of evolving business growth strategies for our organization, as well as profound experience in operations management, which position AECOM well for long-term success worldwide.”
