This breaks the recent trend of the company, as the stock is now trading above the volatile price range of $3.2 to $3.7 in the past one-month time frame.) Although the company has seen one negative estimate revision in the past one month, its Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter has moved higher over the same time frame, suggesting that more solid trading could be ahead for Fang Holdings. So make sure to keep an eye on this stock going forward to see if this recent jump can turn into more strength down the road. Fang Holdings currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) while its Earnings ESP  is 0.00%.

Why Fang Holdings Ltd. Stock Dropped Today
The Chinese internet real estate specialist's stock fell after a disappointing quarter.











                Steve Symington
            

                (TMFSymington)



            
            Jun 20, 2017 at 3:40PM
            
            





What happened
Shares of Fang Holdings Ltd. (NYSE:SFUN) were down 9.6% as of 3:00 p.m. EDT Tuesday after the company announced weaker-than-expected first-quarter 2017 results.
So what
Quarterly revenue fell 46.3% year over year to $109.8 million, which translated to an adjusted net loss of $10.5 million, or $0.03 per American depositary share. Analysts, on average, were expecting a narrower net loss of $0.01 per share on higher revenue of $120.5 million.

Within Fang Holdings' top line, revenue from e-commerce services declined 69.5% to $39.9 million, driven by lower transaction volume thanks to a downsized self-owned and operated brokerage team. Marketing services revenue also declined 10.2% to $27.3 million, driven by tightened government policies in the real estate market. Finally, listing services' revenue climbed 41.3% to $34 million, thanks to an increased number of paying members.





Now what
Fang Holdings opted not to provide specific forward financial guidance, primarily as it's "undergoing adjustments to its transformations and is returning to open-platform strategy." Recall shares skyrocketed earlier this year after the company initially made its shift in strategy known.
In the end, given Fang Holdings' disappointing performance and no evidence yet of success from its transformations, it's no surprise to see investors taking a step back today.

Why Fang Holdings Ltd. Stock Plunged Today
The leading Chinese real estate portal had a rough quarter amid government regulations.











                Steve Symington
            

                (TMFSymington)



            
            Nov 28, 2016 at 4:18PM

What happened
Shares of Fang Holdings Ltd. (NYSE:SFUN) were down 12.2% as of 2:47 p.m. EST, after the Chinese online real estate portal released weaker-than-expected third-quarter 2016 results.
So what
Quarterly revenue rose 1% year over year, to $250.1 million, as growth in e-commerce services revenue was partially offset by declines from marketing services. Analysts, on average, were anticipating significantly higher revenue of $296.5 million.
On the bottom line, that translated to adjusted operating income of $2.4 million, and an adjusted net loss attributable to Fang shareholders of $14.2 million, or $0.03 per American depositary share (ADS). By comparison, in last year's third quarter Fang incurred an adjusted operating loss of $30.6 million, and an adjusted net loss of $31.9 million, or $0.08 per share.
Fang chairman and CEO Vincent Mo explained:

This quarter was one of the toughest quarters in Fang's history. Our transformation coupled with the market regulations by the government was very challenging. Transformation is not easy but we are determined and optimizing the operations details. The company achieved operational profitability and we are confident to turn around the company.






Now what
For the full year 2016, Fang now anticipates revenue of almost $928 million, representing year-over-year growth of roughly 5%. Previously, Fang expected full-year revenue of nearly $1.149 billion.
In the end, Fang might well be on track with its continued transformation, and it's encouraging to see the company turn an operating profit. But given its significant top-line shortfall and regulatory headwinds from the Chinese government, it's no surprise to see investors taking a big step back from Fang stock today.
