HybriDIMM™
​Storage at Memory Speeds, Memory at Storage Capacities.




















Overview
Resources





Using an industry standard DDR4 LRDIMM interface, HybriDIMM is the first SCM product to operate in current Intel® x86 servers without BIOS and hardware changes, and the first unified DRAM-NAND solution that scales memory to terabyte storage capacities and accelerates storage to nanosecond memory speeds.







 As the creation and velocity of data increases the strain between memory and the CPU increases. Memory while fast, has limited capacity and at those high densities is expensive. NAND flash has revolutionized storage, it has great capacity and while much faster than hard drives it is a 1000x slower than memory access.
In this chasm between the price, capacity, performance difference between DRAM and NAND lies a new growing memory tier, Storage Class Memory.
Storage Class Memory, is defined as being persistent, near Memory speed and have 100’s of gigabytes of capacity. Not having all three characteristics would mean a module is not storage class memory.
Just like many technical challenges there is more than one way to solve the issue. Netlist, with years of leading the Non Volatile Memory industry has devised an combination of DRAM and NAND harnessed by “PreSight Technology” to produce the world’s first true SCM module.
HybriDIMM is a breakthrough in computing that is part of the Storage Class Memory revolution that will change computing forever.

PresightTM Technology









PreSightTM Technology is the breakthrough that allows for data that lives on a slower media such as NAND to coexist on the memory channel without breaking the deterministic nature of the memory channel. It achieves by prefetching data into DRAM before an application needs it. If for some reason it can’t do this before the applications starts to read the data, it ensures the memory channels integrity is maintained while moving the data on DIMM

FAQ






Why



Applications are limited by the economic cost of system memory. The
latency gap between volatile and non-volatile technologies is growing.The next wave of business success comes from being able to study data, derive an insight that was hard to find, and to do it faster than the
competition.
HybriDIMM allows terabytes of system memory to be addressed by
applications and persist data in a simpler manner than available today.
HybriDIMM unlocks new application possibilities and
helps businesses gain even more value from their CPU's.





What



HybriDIMM technology is an all new architecture that combines the
proven raw materials of DRAM and NAND into a single persistent memory space. It has the same Load / Store model as DRAM, runs at near DRAM speed but with capacities usually associated with traditional storage. It can do all of this at a greatly reduced cost compared to DRAM and without system modification.HybriDIMM uses a Storage Coprocessor onboard the DIMM to intelligently manage the transfer of data between DRAM and NAND on the same DIMM. It is this Coprocessor intelligence that is the result of many years of design, engineering at Netlist. This IP and DIMM architecture is fully protected. By placing the focus on the intelligence in the coprocessor Netlist enables existing proven materials to perform at a higher level than before in the memory channel, without the need for a new memory material. 
HybriDIMM can be integrated seamlessly into a number of different CPU
architecture like Intel, Sparc, ARM and others.

FAQ




What is HybriDIMM?

HybriDIMM uses a standard DDR4 LRDIMM form factor, does not required special BIOS changes. It's plug n play for modern servers.
HybriDIMM is a Storage Class Memory Module providing storage at memory speeds and memory at storage capacities.
HybriDIMM has a block device presentation layer that applications can use without needing any changes.
HybriDIMM has a persistent memory namespace that is byte addressable and is accessed as both memory and storage by applications through an API
What size is HybriDIMM?
HybriDIMM will initially be demonstrated in 256GB capacity. Version 1 is planned for 512GB at production and for 1024GB in later versions. 

Why is it called HybriDIMM?
The HybriDIMM is the hybrid combination of DRAM and NAND, proven raw materials combined with Netlist IP. It is a persistent memory module that to an application, with the user-level, is storage or memory or both.
What servers does it work in?
HybriDIMM only requires LRDIMM support so will work in any servers that support DDR4 LRDIMM.
What applications does it accelerate?
HybriDIMM provides storage at memory speeds and memory at storage capacities while keeping the data safe in a power loss scenario. Many applications in both enterprise and hyperscale need this sort of capability. Examples include big data analytics, data warehouses, on-line data analytics (OLAP), in memory computing, data capture/compliance check, geophysical sciences, simulation and industrial design, bioscience in particularly areas such as genomics, post production and special effects, storage appliances, gaming and more. The PreSight Technology that underlies the HybriDIMM DIMM is directly applicable to more areas than just LRDIMM’s and even DRAM and NAND.
How does HybriDIMM Work?
HybriDIMM utilizes Netlist invented a method known as “PreSight Technology”. PreSight is what copies the data that the application needs to be in the DRAM portion of the HybriDIMM DIMM. An important element of this for overall system performance is that all transfers between the two different materials occur on the DIMM rather than locking the memory bus and the penalty associated with that. 
How does PreSight know what data to move?
By monitoring the application use of RAM and the data being requested by the application Netlist has determined a methodology that allows for the data to be prefetched into the RAM portion of the HybriDIMM. This can actually take place while the DRAM is being accessed as well. In the unlikely event that the data hasn’t been prefetched the transfer is still on a dedicated bus on the DIMM itself and is faster than a traditional storage fetch vis the CPU PCH.

Overview


Netlist’s Vault product line ensures that enterprise-level cache data is reliably protected and provides the near instantaneous data recovery required by demanding business environments.


Revenue and productivity
are negatively impacted if mission critical data is lost or cannot be restored in a near zero or zero time-frame.


Cache Data protection
is imperative for business survival.


Extended periods
of system downtime cannot be tolerated (e.g. field servicing, battery maintenance & disposal cause such extended downtime).

IRVINE, Calif., Aug. 9, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Netlist, Inc. (NASDAQ:   NLST), today announced the first public demonstration of its HybriDIMM™ Storage Class Memory (SCM) product at the Flash Memory Summit. Using an industry standard DDR4 LRDIMM interface, HybriDIMM is the first SCM product to operate in current Intel® x86 servers without BIOS and hardware changes, and the first unified DRAM-NAND solution that scales memory to terabyte storage capacities and accelerates storage to nanosecond memory speeds.








HybriDIMM's breakthrough architecture combines an on-DIMM co-processor with Netlist's PreSight™ technology ─ predictive software-defined data management – to unify memory and storage at near-DRAM speeds. HybriDIMM dramatically improves application performance by reducing data access latency by up to 1,000 times1 versus the fastest existing storage solution and provides up to 80% cost reduction2 compared to the highest existing memory density for in-memory applications. HybriDIMM's robust feature-set encompasses the NVDIMM functionalities adopted by the industry.
"In today's data-saturated world, the challenge is in turning Big Data into actionable insight. By delivering the industry's first plug and play SCM solution, Netlist is enabling customers to process Big Data cost-effectively in memory and get to insights faster," said C.K. Hong, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Netlist. "We are excited to be working closely with global partners to promote an ecosystem for the rapid adoption of HybriDIMM by a broad user base."
"At Samsung, we are actively investing in the future," said Dong-su Kim, Ph.D., Vice President, Samsung Ventures America. "We are pleased to partner with Netlist, a company with a long-history of innovative memory technology solutions and intellectual property, to productize and drive broad market adoption." Samsung and Netlist signed a 5 year joint development agreement in November 2015.
"Integrated Device Technology (IDT) is excited to partner with Netlist as its preferred DDR4 LRDIMM chipset supplier for their trailblazing HybriDIMM for storage class memory. The convergence of memory and storage subsystems is enabling a whole new class of applications that will adopt IDT's DDR4 LRDIMM chipset to maximize performance and bandwidth," said Rami Sethi, Vice President and General Manager, Memory Interface Products at IDT. "HybriDIMM is an exciting and important example of such an application and expands IDT's addressable market for memory interface beyond traditional DRAM based modules into high capacity storage solutions." 
"Today's data centers require flexibility to meet the ever-increasing demand for access to data," said Manoj Roge, Director, Data Center Strategy and Marketing at Xilinx. "HybriDIMM is a great example of how Xilinx's software-defined and hardware optimized approach brings value to key partners, such as Netlist, who are creating innovative high performance memory solutions to accelerate data in the data center."  
"Carnegie Mellon Database Group is committed to actively working with leading industry partners like Netlist to develop the next generation of in-memory database management systems," said Andy Pavlo, Assistant Professor, Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University. "The Netlist Storage Class Memory solution is a promising medium that will enable 'real-time' analytical database applications that go beyond what existing hardware can support today. We are excited to collaborate with Netlist and the Storage Class Memory ecosystem partners in our database research projects."                                                                                                           
"The promise of SCM is to bridge the price-performance gap between DRAM and NAND. Others are attempting to cross this chasm with new proprietary materials. By combining the best attributes of widely available, proven technologies – DRAM's speed and durability with NAND's capacity, persistence and low cost – Netlist is able to deliver a cost-effective SCM product today," said Jim Handy, principal analyst, Objective Analysis. "The SCM market could exceed $2 billion by 2020."
At the Flash Memory Summit, Netlist will be demonstrating its HybriDIMM SCM solutions through a live demo showcasing:

The industry's first SCM product with plug and play DDR4 LRDIMM interface on an Intel x86 server without a BIOS change 
The industry's first SCM product concurrently presenting both block storage and byte addressable persistent memory, while running at near memory speeds 
Netlist plans to provide samples of HybriDIMM to select customers starting later this year with volume production planned for the second quarter of 2017.
Netlist is a technology partner and official member of the Red Hat Connect for Technology Partners, SAP® PartnerEdge® open ecosystem, Cloudera Connect, Hortonworks Partnerworks, and MapR Converge programs, and is working closely with leading HybriDIMM ecosystem hardware and software partners. 
Technical Summary of DDR4 HybriDIMM:

Unifies memory and storage into one module (DIMM), breaking the decades-long limitations of the Von Neumann computing architecture 
Applies the predictive algorithms of the PreSight technology to pre-fetch and stage required data to scale memory to storage capacities 
Accelerates storage access time to near memory speeds using advanced buffering technology 
Allows multi-terabytes of persistent memory to run real-time in-memory applications on existing Intel-based servers at speeds an order of magnitude faster than NAND

(NLST), today announced it has filed legal proceedings for patent infringement against SK hynix in the courts of Germany and China based on the infringement of Netlist patents in those countries by SK hynix LRDIMM enterprise memory products. Netlist also recently filed a new lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California asserting two recently issued U.S. patents against SK hynix RDIMM and LRDIMM products. The lawsuits in Germany and China are based on SK hynix's infringement of Netlist's patented distributed buffer architecture which was adopted as the industry standard for DDR4 LRDIMM. The German lawsuit, filed in Munich, targets the sale of SK hynix LRDIMM either alone or installed in enterprise servers. The lawsuit filed in Beijing, China targets the sale of SK hynix LRDIMM to enterprise customers in that country, and also the sale of the same products to server manufacturers that integrate SK hynix LRDIMM into servers for worldwide export. "We filed new lawsuits in Germany, China and the U.S. in order to broaden our legal efforts to prevent SK hynix from continuing its pervasive and unauthorized use of Netlist's intellectual property," said Netlist Chief Executive Officer, C.K. Hong. "Despite our earnest and repeated efforts over the past year and a half to negotiate an equitable resolution, SK hynix refuses to fairly compensate Netlist and its shareholders for our valuable intellectual property." Mr. Hong added, "We remain open to negotiating a fair and reasonable license but absent a satisfactory resolution, we will take all measures necessary to defend our intellectual property rights."Netlist previously filed suits last year in the United States International Trade Commission (ITC) and the Central District of California to address SK hynix's unauthorized use of Netlist's IP. In the ITC investigation, an Initial Final Determination from the Administrative Law Judge is expected no later than October 10, 2017. In the Central District, the court is scheduled to conduct a claim construction hearing on July 27, 2017, for the Netlist patents asserted last year. SK hynix recently filed a motion in the Central District asking the court for a partial stay of those proceedings pending completion of Inter Partes Review of the patents asserted in that action. Any stay granted by the Central District, however, would only affect the proceedings in that court and would have no effect on the ITC or delay the issuance of the Judge's ruling in October.About Netlist, Inc.Netlist is a leading provider of high-performance modular memory subsystems serving customers in diverse industries that require superior memory performance to empower critical business decisions.

Netlist, Inc is changing the speed with which data is turned into information. We aim to be an integral part of the acceleration of business insight, digital social interaction and the Internet of Things.
We achieve this today by designing, manufacturing and selling Non Volatile Memory DIMMs (NVDIMM-N). We will grow by introducing a Storage Class Memory (SCM) DIMM, using proven raw materials with embedded intelligence in a way that provides terabytes of persistent memory in industry standard servers that can be used today. Storage Class Memory will enable a new level of application acceleration for both Enterprise and Hyperscale in the 21st Century.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
