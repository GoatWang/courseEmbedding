OBITUARY -- Anne and Charlie Keenan


Joel Pimsleur


        Published 4:00 am, Wednesday, August 14, 1996
    

































































A memorial mass will be held tomorrow in Menlo Park for Anne and Charlie Keenan, prominent California developers and growers, who were married for 52 years and died in the San Joaquin Valley within two days of each other. 
Mr. Keenan, who died on Saturday, was 80; Mrs. Keenan died on Monday at age 78. They died after a sudden illness. 
Charlie Keenan was a second generation San Franciscan, born in 1916 into a home-builder family descended from the original Italian-Swiss Colony in Asti. He attended St. Ignatius High School and graduated from the University of San Francisco at the age of 19. 
Multiple and widely varied careers followed. His first vocation was as an actor in New York, where leading-man looks and a deep baritone voice helped him land an early role opposite Kitty Carlisle on Broadway. 
During World War II, Mr. Keenan was an artillery training officer at Camp Roberts. He married Southern California-born Anne Mitchell in 1943 and they moved to Palo Alto after the war.

After several businesses, including an ornamental horticulture nursery and a Kaiser-Frazer auto dealership, he started a real estate career on the Peninsula with Fox & Carskadon. This was interrupted when he was recalled to duty in the Korean War. 
In 1952 he began a 25-year partnership with Pat Carey at Cornish & Carey Real Estate in Palo Alto. In addition to building a successful real estate brokerage business, he co-developed the Westridge Community in Portola Valley and one of the original research and development parks located at the corner of Bayshore Highway and San Antonio Road, where Philco/Ford and Tektronix were the early anchor tenants. 
While working and raising a family in Palo Alto, Mr. Keenan was also active in community affairs. He served as president of the Palo Alto Real Estate Board, the Palo Alto Chamber of Commerce, the Irwin Memorial Blood Bank and the Menlo Circus Club, and was a member of the Palo Alto Club and the St. Claire Club in San Jose. 
The past 20 years were spent in the San Joaquin Valley community of Avenal where Mr. Keenan and his son, Bob, founded Keenan Farms, a grower and processor of pistachio nuts. Mr. and Mrs. Keenan spent the past two decades traveling the world selling pistachios from Keenan Farms. 
Mrs. Keenan was born Anne Mitchell in 1916 in Los Angeles. She graduated from Marlborough School in 1935 and attended the University of California at Los Angeles. Prior to World War II she moved to San Francisco, where she started as a teller with the American Bank & Trust Co. In 1943, she met Mr. Keenan and they were wed that December at Camp Roberts. At the end of the war they moved to Palo Alto, where they lived for the next 30 years. 
Mrs. Keenan was active in volunteer work, including the Veteran's Hospital, and spent more than 30 years in the service of the Palo Alto Junior League. An accomplished artist, she was also an expert gardener, interior designer and procurer of period piece furniture. 
Mr. Keenan predeceased his wife of 52 years by two days. The couple are survived by son Charles J. (Chop) Keenan and daughter-in- law Annette Keenan of Woodside, son Bob and daughter-in-law Theresa Keenan of Marin County, and four grandchildren: Carrie Flynn, Charles J. (Jamie) Keenan IV of Marin County, Ann-Marie Keenan and Elizabeth Keenan. 
A memorial mass will be held at 4 p.m. tomorrow at Nativity Church, 210 Oak Grove Ave., Menlo Park. The family prefers that donations be made to a favorite charity.
