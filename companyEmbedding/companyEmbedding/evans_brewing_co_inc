(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  The following discussion and analysis provides information which management of the Company believes to be relevant to an assessment and understanding of the Company's results of operations and financial condition. This discussion should be read together with the Company's financial statements and the notes to the financial statements, which are included in this report.  Forward-Looking Statements  This Report contains forward-looking statements that relate to future events or our future financial performance. Some discussions in this report may contain forward-looking statements that involve risk and uncertainty. A number of important factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by us in this Report. Forward-looking statements are often identified by words like "believe," "expect," "estimate," "anticipate," "intend," "project" and similar words or expressions that, by their nature, refer to future events.  In some cases, you can also identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as "may," "will," "should," "plans," "predicts," "potential," or "continue," or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. These statements are only predictions and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements.  Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, or achievements. You should not place undue certainty on these forward-looking statements, which apply only as of the date of this Report. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or our predictions. Except as required by applicable law, including the securities laws of the United States, we do not intend to update any of the forward-looking statements in an effort to conform these statements to actual results.  Business History of Company  Evans Brewing Company, Inc. (formerly ALPINE 3 Inc.) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on June 18, 2013. Alpine 3 Inc. was set up to serve as a vehicle to effect an asset acquisition, merger, exchange of capital stock or other business combination with a domestic or foreign business. ALPINE 3 did not undertake any effort to cause a market to develop in its securities, either debt or equity, before it successfully concluded a business combination. On April 4, 2014, The Michael J. Rapport Trust (the "Trust") purchased 10,000,000 shares of common stock which was all of the outstanding shares of Alpine 3, Inc., and subsequently changed the name to Evans Brewing Company Inc. ("EBC") on May 29, 2014. On October 9, 2014 the Trust agreed to the cancellation of 9,600,000 of the shares of common stock that it had acquired and retained 400,000 shares of common stock. From April 2014 through December 2015, EBC has been in the process of acquiring the Bayhawk brands and related assets, as discussed in more detail below.  On October 15, 2014, Bayhawk and EBC entered into an Asset Purchase and Share Exchange Agreement (the "Agreement"), subject to receiving approval of the independent Bayhawk shareholders who voted on the transaction. On September 17, 2015, the independent Bayhawk shareholders approved the agreement by a vote of 251,212 shares for and 1,600 shares against. As such, Bayhawk sold to EBC, and EBC purchased from Bayhawk, assets of Bayhawk, including but not limited to: (A) all assets, including personal property, intellectual property, inventory, contracts, websites, documents, and all other assets however delineated relating to the Bayhawk Ales label (as defined in the Agreement and discussed in more detail below); and (B) all assets, including personal property, intellectual property, inventory, contracts, websites, documents, and all other assets however delineated relating to the Evans Brands (as defined in the Agreement and discussed in more detail below) (collectively, the "Transferred Assets"). Bayhawk retained ownership of 100% of the stock in Evans Brewing Co. (CA) ("Evans Brewing California") which has the brewers license at City Brewery in Lacrosse, WI (where the non-craft brands will be brewed, with the balance of the craft brands being brewed in Irvine, California). Based on the affirmative vote by the independent Bayhawk shareholders to approve the Asset Purchase transaction, EBC proceeded with the share exchange and tender offer to the Bayhawk shareholders, pursuant to which EBC offered to exchange shares of EBC common stock for shares of Bayhawk common stock, on a one-for-one basis (the "Exchange Offer"). Bayhawk shareholders had until December 2, 2015, to tender their Bayhawk shares in the share exchange. Bayhawk shareholders also had until December 2, 2015, to rescind the exchange of shares. There was no minimum number of shares of Bayhawk common stock that must be tendered for the Exchange Offer to close. At the close of the share exchange on December 2, 2015, Premier Stock Transfer accepted on behalf of EBC 4,033,863 Bayhawk shares and issued 4,033,863 shares of EBC common stock upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Asset Purchase and Share Exchange Agreement by and between EBC and Bayhawk, dated October 15, 2014, as amended (the "Asset Purchase Agreement"). EBC filed a copy of the Asset Purchase Agreement as an annex to a combination registration statement and proxy statement on Form S-4. The Bayhawk shares were validly tendered pursuant to the Exchange Offer and not withdrawn. The asset purchase and share exchange has been treated as business combination as both companies are controlled by the same management.  Overview  The brewery continued to operate under the Bayhawk Ales, Inc. name as it transitioned the licensing and branding over to Evans Brewing Company, Inc. That process has been completed and all future activities will be under the Evans Brewing Company banner. Bayhawk Ales Inc. will be dissolved and all of its history will become that of Evans Brewing Company, Inc.  Evans Brewing Company is a craft brewery based on Orange County, California that produces and sells premium craft beers, including a variety of ales and lagers. EBC's beers are currently produced in its 17-barrel brewery in Irvine, California, the oldest continuously operating brewing facility in Orange County and one of the oldest in all of Southern California. This facility has been producing craft beers since January 1995. The brewery is located in a leased building in the McCormick & Schmick's Seafood Restaurant.  EBC products include four beers that are packaged year-round (Pollen Nation Honey Blonde Ale, The KrHOPen India Pale Ale, Oaklore Brown Ale, and Choc?Latte Chocolate Porter), various draft-only offerings (which include The Joaquin Dead Mexican Red Ale, OC Pale Ale, Son of a Beach Blonde Ale), and seasonal beers (which include Approachable Bastard Session IPA, Stout at the Devil Russian Imperial Stout, crHOP Dust Hefeweizen, and Oktoberfest). EBC's labels for its year round packaging were approved in 2016 and the beers are currently being sold with these labels. EBC has the exclusive rights to make, manufacture, produce, market, sell, and distribute original beers, lagers, and ales known as Evans Lager Original, Evans Lager Black, Evans Lager Light, Bad Kat Ice, and Dead Presidents. EBC also owns the assets of Pig's Eye Brewing Company, LLC, (the "EBC Malt Assets") including the intellectual property and trademarks relating to original beers, lagers, and ales, including Milwaukee Select and Pig's Eye (the "EBC Malt Brands"). EBC's products are distributed to restaurants and other retail outlets in nine states. EBC also produces and packages kegged beer on a private label basis for restaurants and other customers, with the names for such products determined collaboratively with such customer and each product co-branded with the phrase "by Evans Brewing Company".  In addition to manufacturing and selling the products above, EBC also produces and packages beers for other craft breweries in Southern California on a contract-basis. Further, in addition to beer production and sales generally, EBC also produces and offers for sale certain "Evans Brewing Company" branded merchandise including apparel, glassware and other beer accessories.  On September 29, 2016, Evans Brewing Company, Inc., closed the acquisition of a restaurant business located in the downtown SOCO District of Fullerton, California, through the acquisition of all the outstanding stock of EBC Public House, Inc., which the Company now operates as its first branded restaurant and taproom under the trade name "The Public House by Evans Brewing Company". The Public House features the Company's beers - as well as beers from other selected local Orange County, California breweries, -- food and, potentially, occasional entertainment.  In connection with such closing, the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of EBC Public House from Mr. Rapport and issued 1,000,000 shares of the Company's Series A Preferred Stock to Mr. Rapport. The asset purchase and share exchange have been treated as business combination as both companies are controlled by the same management.  In connection with the closing of the transactions, the Company and Michael J. Rapport also entered into an Indemnification Agreement for Closing Date Liabilities (the "Indemnification Agreement") pursuant to which Mr. Rapport agreed to indemnify the Company for liabilities accrued as of the closing.  Background  EBC and Bayhawk filed a registration statement on Form S-4 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Registration Statement"), which went effective on August 10, 2015. The Registration Statement included a proxy statement seeking the votes of the Bayhawk shareholders on the Asset Purchase Transaction by written consent. On September 17, 2015, the voting period closed, and EBC announced that approximately 99% of the shares that were voted had voted in favor of the Asset Purchase Transaction.  In connection with the Asset Purchase Transaction, EBC and Bayhawk entered into a General Assignment and Bill of Sale agreement (the "Bill of Sale") which outlined the specific assets purchased, as well as an Assignment and Assumption of Liabilities agreement (the "Assumption Agreement) which outlined the specific liabilities of Bayhawk assumed by EBC.  In connection with the closing of the Asset Purchase Transaction and the entry into the Bill of Sale and the Assumption Agreement, EBC acquired the assets (other than the ownership of Evans Brewing California), the liabilities, and the operations of Bayhawk. As such, on December 10, 2015, in connection with this acquisition, EBC ceased to be a shell company as defined in Rule 12b-2, in that it had assets consisting of more than cash and cash equivalents, and has a business plan and operations.  Bayhawk Ales  Bayhawk Ales, Inc. (formerly Orange County Brewing Company) ("Bayhawk") was formed in February 1994 for the purpose of developing and operating one or more breweries in California for the production of high quality, hand-crafted ales for sale in bottle and draft. The Company built a 17-barrel showcase brewery (the "Southern California Brewery") in a leased building in the McCormick & Schmick's Seafood Restaurant in Irvine, California. The Southern California Brewery, located in the central business district of Irvine near John Wayne International Airport, began brewing beer in January 1995. Irvine is south of Los Angeles and is adjacent to Newport Beach. It is a suburban city of the greater Los Angeles metropolitan area and the location of numerous businesses. At the time of the construction of the Southern California Brewery, the Los Angeles metropolitan area was the largest single market for beer in the United States. The products produced by Bayhawk are 90% private labeled. The business has only recently in the last few years become profitable.  Evans Brewing Company, Inc. (Formerly ALPINE 3, Inc.) was incorporated in Delaware in June 18th, 2013 with a fiscal year ending on December 31st.  Principal Products  EBC products include four packaged year-round beers: Pollen Nation Honey Blonde Ale, The KrHOPen India Pale Ale, Oaklore Brown Ale, and Choc?Latte Chocolate Porter; draft-only offerings include The Joaquin Dead Mexican Red Ale, OC Pale Ale, Son of a Beach Blonde Ale; and seasonals include Approachable Bastard Session IPA, Stout at the Devil Russian Imperial Stout, crHOP Dust Hefeweizen, and Oktoberfest.  EBC also produces malt liquor at a third party site in Lacrosse, Wisconsin. By way of background, in August 2013, Evans Brewing California had acquired from City Brewing Company, LLC ("City Brewing") the assets of Pig's Eye Brewing Company, LLC, (the "Pig's Eye Assets") including the intellectual property and trademarks relating to original beers, lagers, and ales, including Milwaukee Select and Pig's Eye (the "Pig's Eye Brands"). Additionally, Evans Brewing California had the exclusive rights to make, manufacture, produce, market, sell, and distribute original beers, lagers, and ales known as Evans Lager Original, Evans Lager Black, Evans Lager Light, Bad Kat Ice, and Dead Presidents.  RECENT DEVELOPMENTS  Closing of Asset Purchase Transaction  On December 10, 2015, EBC completed the previously announced acquisition of the assets and liabilities of Bayhawk, pursuant to an Asset Purchase and Share Exchange Agreement between EBC and Bayhawk, dated October 15, 2014 (subsequently amended and restated on August 6, 2015 (as amended, the "Agreement")).  Pursuant to the Agreement, Bayhawk had agreed to sell, and EBC had agreed to purchase, substantially all of Bayhawk's assets, as well as its liabilities (collectively, the "Asset Purchase Transaction"). The assets and liabilities of Bayhawk include personal property, intellectual property, inventory, selected distribution contracts, websites, documents, and all other assets however delineated relating to the Bayhawk Ales labels; and (B) all assets, including personal property, intellectual property, inventory, contracts, websites, documents, and all other assets however delineated relating to the Evans Brands (collectively, the "Transferred Assets"), and the assumption by EBC, pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in the Agreement, of all of the liabilities of Bayhawk (the "Assumed Liabilities"). (The "Evans Brands" include the former assets of Pig's Eye Brewing Company, including its original beers, lagers and ales ("Pig's Eye Brands"), as well as Evans Lager Original, Evans Lager Black, Evans Lager Light, Bad Kat Ice, and Dead Presidents.) Pursuant to the Agreement, EBC has the right to purchase from Bayhawk 100% ownership in Evans Brewing California.  Pursuant to the Agreement, EBC and Bayhawk agreed to seek approval of the shareholders of Bayhawk relating to the Asset Purchase Transaction. Because the principal majority stockholders of Bayhawk are also significant stockholders of EBC, Bayhawk and EBC agreed to proceed with the Asset Purchase Transaction if it was approved by the holders of at least a majority of the Independent Shares (i.e. shares not held by Bayhawk's majority shareholder, The Michael J. Rapport Trust, or by Evan Rapport, who is an officer of EBC and the son of Michael Rapport) that actually vote on the Asset Purchase Transaction proposal.  EBC and Bayhawk filed a registration statement on Form S-4 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Registration Statement"), which went effective on August 10, 2015. The Registration Statement included a proxy statement seeking the votes of the Bayhawk shareholders on the Asset Purchase Transaction by written consent. On September 17, 2015, the voting period closed, and EBC announced that approximately 99% of the shares that were voted had voted in favor of the Asset Purchase Transaction.  In connection with the Asset Purchase Transaction, EBC and Bayhawk entered into a General Assignment and Bill of Sale agreement (the "Bill of Sale") which outlined the specific assets purchased, as well as an Assignment and Assumption of Liabilities agreement (the "Assumption Agreement) which outlined the specific liabilities of Bayhawk assumed by EBC.  Equipment Lease to Bayhawk  Following the closing of the Asset Purchase Transaction, EBC entered into an equipment lease (the "Equipment Lease") with Bayhawk pursuant to which EBC leased the brewing equipment to Bayhawk. The Equipment Lease was effective as of December 1, 2015, and continues month to month. Bayhawk agreed to pay a minimum of $15,000 per month or net profits from operations, whichever is greater. The title to the leased equipment will remain with EBC, and EBC has the right to inspect the equipment and its usage.  The foregoing summaries of the terms and conditions of the Bill of Sale, the Assumption Agreement, and the Equipment Lease (collectively, the "Ancillary Agreements") do not purport to be complete, and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the specific Ancillary Agreement, each of which was attached as an exhibit to a Current Report on Form 8-K, filed by EBC on December 15, 2015.  Change in Shell Company Status  In connection with the closing of the Asset Purchase Transaction and the entry into the Bill of Sale and the Assumption Agreement, EBC acquired the assets (other than the ownership of Evans Brewing California), the liabilities, and the operations of Bayhawk. As such, on December 10, 2015, in connection with this acquisition, EBC ceased to be a shell company as defined in Rule 12b-2, in that it has assets consisting of more than cash and cash equivalents, and has a business plan and operations.  Share Exchange  As discussed in more detail above and below in this Annual Report, as partial consideration for the purchase of the Transferred Assets and the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities, EBC agreed to offer to exchange shares of EBC common stock for all shares of Bayhawk common stock that were tendered in connection with such offer, the transaction being referred to as the "Share Exchange." The ratio of the share exchange is one (1) share of EBC common stock for each one  Based on the affirmative vote by the independent Bayhawk shareholders to approve the Asset Purchase transaction, EBC proceeded with the share exchange and tender offer to the Bayhawk shareholders, pursuant to which EBC offered to exchange shares of EBC common stock for shares of Bayhawk common stock, on a one-for-one basis (the "Exchange Offer"). Bayhawk shareholders had until December 2, 2015, to tender their Bayhawk shares in the share exchange. Bayhawk shareholders also had until December 2, 2015, to rescind the exchange of shares. There was no minimum number of shares of Bayhawk common stock that must be tendered for the Exchange Offer to close. At the close of the share exchange on December 2, 2015, Premier Stock Transfer accepted on behalf of EBC 4,033,863 Bayhawk shares and issued 4,033,863 shares of EBC common stock upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Asset Purchase and Share Exchange Agreement by and between EBC and Bayhawk, dated October 15, 2014, as amended (the "Asset Purchase Agreement"). EBC filed a copy of the Asset Purchase Agreement as an annex to a combination registration statement and proxy statement on Form S-4. The Bayhawk shares were validly tendered pursuant to the Exchange Offer and not withdrawn. The asset purchase and share exchange will be treated as business combination as both companies are controlled by the same management.  No Change of Control  In connection with the Asset Purchase Transaction, there was no change in control of EBC. The officers and directors of EBC did not change, and the majority ownership of EBC did not change.  As noted, prior to the closing of the Share Exchange, there was no way to determine how many shares of Bayhawk common stock will be exchanged for shares of EBC common stock. Nevertheless, Michael J. Rapport owns, through The Michael J. Rapport Trust, a majority of the outstanding common stock of both EBC and Bayhawk. As such, following the closing of the Share Exchange, Mr. Rapport continued to own a majority of the common stock of EBC, and as such, there was no change in control of EBC.  Public House Stock Purchase Agreement  Additionally on December 10, 2015, EBC entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the "Public House SPA") with Michael J. Rapport, as the sole shareholder of EBC Public House, Inc., a California corporation ("Public House"), for the purchase by EBC of 100% of the outstanding shares of Public House from Mr. Rapport, with the transaction to be closed following completion of due diligence and certain other conditions outlined below.  By way of background, Mr. Rapport formed Public House to purchase a restaurant business located in Fullerton, California (previously operated as Steamers Jazz Club). Public House is working to renovate and remodel the restaurant, with plans to open in September of 2016. Mr. Rapport was the sole shareholder of Public House.  Pursuant to the Public House SPA, EBC agreed to issue 1,000,000 shares of its Series A Preferred Stock (see description below) in exchange for 100% of the outstanding stock of Public House (the "Public House Shares"). The parties anticipate the closing of the transaction once the following conditions, among others, have been met:  - Public House shall have received all food and beverage licenses, including California Alcoholic Beverage Control licenses, required for the operation of the business;  - The renovations and remodeling of the restaurant shall have been completed and the restaurant shall be open for business; and  - Other standard closing conditions.  The foregoing summary of the terms and conditions of the Public House SPA does not purport to be complete, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Public House SPA, was attached as an exhibit to a Current Report on Form 8-K, filed by EBC on December 15, 2015.  EBC has provided additional information relating to EBC Public House and the restaurant business, including disclosures required by SEC rules and regulations in this quarterly report based on the closing of the purchase of the Public House Shares.  Certificate of Designation - Series A Convertible Preferred Stock  In connection with the Public House SPA, on December 10, 2015, the Company's Board of Directors approved and adopted a Certificate of Designation of Rights and Preferences for Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (the "Certificate of Designation"). On December 11, 2015, the Company filed with the State of Delaware the Certificate of Designation, which became part of the Company's Certificate of Incorporation, as amended to date.  Pursuant to the Certificate of Designation, the Company is authorized to issue up to 2,000,000 shares of the Company's Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (the "Preferred Stock"). As noted above, the Company agreed to issue 1,000,000 shares of the Preferred Stock to Mr. Rapport upon the closing of the purchase of the Public House Shares. The rights and preferences of the Preferred Stock include the following:  - Stated Value: The Preferred Stock has a stated value (the "Stated Value") of $1.00 per share.  - Dividends: Holders of the Preferred Stock are entitled to receive dividends equal to five percent (5%) per annum, payable quarterly in arrears. The dividends may be paid in cash or shares of the Company's common stock, at the option of the holder.  - Voting Rights: The holder of the Preferred Stock has the right to one vote for each share of common stock into which the Preferred Stock could be converted.  - Conversion: The Preferred Stock is convertible at the option of the holder into shares of the Company's common stock. The number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion shall be determined by dividing the number of shares of Preferred Stock by the applicable Conversion Price, which is defined as follows:  ? If the Common Stock of the Company has been listed for trading on a public exchange or trading facility, the conversion price for each share of Preferred Stock on any conversion date shall be the lower of (I) seventy percent (70%) of the two (2) lowest closing bid prices over the sixty trading days prior to the conversion date, or (II) the Stated Value of the Preferred Stock.  ? If the Common Stock of the Company is not trading on the conversion date, the conversion price shall be the Stated Value of the Preferred Stock.  - Redemption: The Company has the obligation to redeem the unconverted shares of Preferred Stock from the holder as follows:  ? The Company shall have the obligation, as set forth herein, to redeem the unconverted shares of the Preferred Stock at a price equal to the Redemption Price (defined below) as follows:  ? The Company shall pay to the holder of the Preferred Stock, on a quarterly basis, within thirty (30) days of the end of each fiscal quarter, an amount equal to twenty percent (20%) of the excess revenues, as determined by the Board of Directors on a quarterly basis, to redeem shares of Preferred Stock.  ? The Company shall also pay to the holder of the Preferred Stock, an amount equal to 20% of any capital raised by the Company in connection with offerings of the Company's securities (whether private offerings or public offerings), within ten (10) days of the closing of each such offering, to redeem shares of Preferred Stock.  ? The "Redemption Price" shall be equal to the Stated Value of such shares of Preferred Stock, plus all accrued and unpaid dividends on the shares to be redeemed.  - Liquidation: Upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Company, whether voluntary or involuntary (a "Liquidation"), the holders of the Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive out of the assets of the Company, whether such assets are capital or surplus, for each share of Preferred Stock an amount equal to the Stated Value plus all accrued but unpaid dividends per share, and all other amounts in respect thereof then due and payable before any distribution or payment shall be made to the holders of any Junior Securities.  EBC has issued the shares of Preferred Stock in connection with the purchase of the Public House Shares, which occurred on September 29, 2016, in conjunction with the closing of that transaction. The shares will be issued without registration under the securities Act of 1933 (the "1933 Act") in reliance on  The foregoing summary of the terms and conditions of the Certificate of Designation does not purport to be complete, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Certificate of Designation, was attached as an exhibit to a Current Report on Form 8-K, filed by EBC on December 15, 2015.  Results of Operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and the nine months ended September 30, 2015  Our operating results are summarized as follows:   Nine Months Nine Months Ended Ended Sep 30, Sep 30, 2016 2015 Revenue $ 1,329,430 $ 1,514,259 Cost of sales $ 1,002,403 $ 1,066,363 Operating expenses $ 1,014,431 $ 615,464 . . .

IRVINE, Calif., July 26, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Evans Brewing Company (OTCQB: ALES), the oldest craft brewery in Orange County, CA and owner of The Public House by Evans Brewing Co. in DT Fullerton, CA and soon to open at the Bella Terra Mall in Huntington Beach, is set to release three new bottle offerings; Stout at the Devil Russian Imperial Stout, Approachable Bastard Session IPA and the award winning Black Pilsner, Breakfast Black.

"Our bottle sales have been a real bright spot since we introduced our new labels 15 months ago.  We went almost zero bottle sales to over 24% of our sales in bottles as of last month," stated an elated Mike Rapport, CEO of Evans Brewing Co.  "With this success, we are adding these heretofore keg-only beers to our regular lineup," continued Mr. Rapport.
"Evans Brewing Co. continues with its aggressive growth strategy in Orange County and now has added a Los Angeles County salesperson that will focus 50% of their time on off-premise sales.  The public has responded well to our brand image and we have plans for more offerings soon," concluded Mr. Rapport.
The construction of the new Public House in Huntington Beach is well underway with an anticipated opening in early September.  To see the full range of Evans branded products, including core year-round offerings, seasonal beers and special releases as well as The Public House menu, please visit http://www.evansbrewco.com.

How an old SoCal brewery was revived, rebranded as Evans Brewing Co.

The rebranding has begun in earnest with the Bayhawk labeling expected to be fully replaced by the more modern look of Evans Brewing Co. over the next several months.
Producing its ales in relative obscurity throughout most of its three-decade history, one of Southern California’s pioneering craft beer brands — Bayhawk Ales Inc. — is finally emerging from the shadows with a new name, a new management team and a renewed commitment to provide only the highest quality craft brews.
Bayhawk Ales was established in 1994 and produced its first products in early 1995, before craft giant Stone Brewing Co. and most other microbreweries in Southern California were producing beer. Bayhawk carved out a modest footprint supplying restaurants with house beers marketed to consumers under the restaurant’s name. As a result, most customers who drank Bayhawk beers in restaurants had no idea they were even consuming the company’s products.
Years later, another Southern California-based craft beer company was founded by Evans Rapport, and his line of Evans Lagers won a series of international beer awards. But as a new brand, Evans Brewing Co. needed a local brewery where its beers could be produced and a taproom where customers could taste its offerings.
Bayhawk Ales, with a 17-bbl brewery in Irvine, Calif., emerged as a potential partner for Evans Brewing Co. The brewery was contracted to produce some Evans beers, but the end result did not meet Rapport’s standards. At that time, Bayhawk was also seeking to bring in a majority investor and take the company private — it was “public,” but its stock had never traded on a public market and many of its shareholders had run out of patience.
The two beer brands could not agree on the details of an investment, so Evans Brewing Co. appealed directly to Bayhawk stockholders on a proposal to rebrand the company, make its products directly available to consumers, improve operations at the brewery and provide some value in exchange for their financial support of the company.
In December 2013, Bayhawk shareholders approved a new slate of directors, and the Evans team stepped in to run Bayhawk and implement the brand transition. Rapport began to manage the Bayhawk brewery housed in the McCormick & Schmick’s restaurant in Irvine and immediately made changes to improve operations. He improved the taste of the beers, increased the yield of the brewing process, increased distribution of the beers, decreased labor costs and turned it into a profitable operation.
Need some rebranding advice for your brewery? We have a ton of features that can help.
While the company has begun the rebranding in earnest with Bayhawk labeling expected to be fully replaced by the more modern look of Evans Brewing Co. over the next several months, the evolution doesn’t stop there.
Evans Brewing Co. is currently evaluating options for expanded brewing capacity. The McCormick & Schmick’s site does not have room for additional production — Bayhawk traditionally stated its capacity at 10,000 bbls per year, but Rapport believes he could maybe push to as much as 15,000 bbls and that would be the limit in its current location. Also, the lease with the restaurant’s owners is coming to an end in less than four years.
To meet anticipated demand, Rapport plans to build a new brewery in Southern California. With increased capacity, Rapport can expand existing distribution relationships with restaurants and retail locations — expected to be marketed under the Evans name — while increasing production of additional Evans craft beers.
“There is room for Evans Brewing Company to service different segments of the beer market, including restaurant supply, retail and craft beer,” Rapport said. “Each segment has its favorites, and there is no reason that a brewery has to lose its integrity to serve a variety of consumers. The key — as always — is to serve great tasting beer.”
Plans are moving forward for an Evans Brewing taproom, expected to be opening in the next six months, where beer drinkers can sample Evans beers and learn more about the company.
