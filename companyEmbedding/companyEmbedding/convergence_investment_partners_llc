The Theory
Ordinary income tax and short term capital gains rates approach 40% at the Federal level,ﾠand can be over 10% at the State level. Successful investing in the future will result in increased taxes. The impact could be significant. Historically, reducing the impact of taxes on your investment portfolio has meant looking for losses that can be realized near the end of each calendar year for most investors. In fact so much more can be done.
A significant body of research exists as to the impact of taxes on investor’s returns, and the benefit that an actively managed portfolio designed to minimize the impact of taxes can have on returns over time. Our research has shown that a systematic process that harvests tax losses throughout the entire year is more beneficial than the pedestrian year end scramble for losses. Althoughﾠactive management can help minimize tax drag, some active managers still struggle to outperform marketﾠindexes on an after tax basis. Even indexing, traditionally viewed as a tax-efficient alternative, has shown to suffer under the burden of taxes due to constituent changes, corporate reorganizations, and dividends. Mutual funds carry a further burden. By law, mutual funds are required to distribute 98% of their realized gains each year, but are not allowed to distribute any realized capital losses. By contrast, we blieve that actively managed tax efficient portfolios that incorporate an active tax loss harvesting strategy are able to have a significant impact on the portfolio over time.
The CIP Strategy
Since 1998, the Principals at CIP have managed an active tax management strategy which focuses on capturing market returns with minimal tracking error, while deferring the realization of capital gains and harvesting net tax losses to the extent possible. The Strategy is built on the simple notion that tax losses have economic value. Two portfolios of equal value, which realize the same rate of return, will have the same pre-tax value at the end of the year. If the first portfolio has realized taxable gains, while the other portfolio has been able to avoid realizing gains, the payment of taxes will cause the values to diverge. In addition, if net losses for tax purposes are realized, those losses can be used to offset capital gains realized in other portfolios the investor may have. The value of the tax losses is the ability to immediately offset gains realized elsewhere, resulting in immediate savings in taxes. This savings increases the investor’s net worth by increasing the after-tax return of their entire asset allocation.
CIP utilizes a sophisticated optimization program to invest the portfolios within our Active Tax Management Program. Each portfolio is managed individually by targeting the portfolio against a designated benchmark index, and regularly re-optimized to defer capital gains, seek out tax losses, and minimize tracking error to the benchmark. CIP manages portfolios that target domestic indexes such as the Russell 1000 or  S&P 500.
With over 10 years of experience maximizing after-tax value, we have found the Active Tax Management Strategy an essential tool to any taxable investor seeking to maximize the growth in their net worth.
Convergence makes no guarantee regarding tax consequences of a tax loss harvesting strategy.

The Theory
Academic and Street research has looked into dividend policy and the performance of stocks for many years. From a purely theoretical standpoint, the argument was that fast growing companies, in constant need of cash and unable to pay dividends, represented more attractive long term investments. Slower growing, more mature, companies paid out dividends because they lacked attractive investment alternatives, and therefore represented less attractive investments. The problem is that history does not bear this out.
Shown below is the cumulative performance since 1980 of stocks ranked by dividend yield. The chart breaks down the Russell 1000 universe of stocks into 10 buckets. Decile 1 represents the top 10% of stocks ranked by dividend yield. Decile 2 represents the stocks whose dividend yield is between the top 10% and the top 20%, and so on. Note that over the last 30 years, all top 5 deciles outperformed the lower paying stocks. Even decile 1, whose dividend yields are extremely high, typically because their stock price has fallen and the dividend is in trouble, outperformed their low or no paying dividend counterparts.

The undeniable fact that higher dividend paying stocks have outperformed has led to a body of research into the “signaling effect.” In short, much of the research has concluded that management adjusts their dividend policy based on the confidence that they have in the long term outlook for their company and the company’s ability to grow their earnings. The more confident management is in their ability to grow earnings into the future, the more comfortable they are in raising the dividend. In fact, studies have shown that management will typically raise their dividend if they feel that the increase in their earnings is “permanent in nature,” versus another shareholder friendly policy of buying back shares of stock if they think that the increase in earnings is more cycle in nature.
The CIP Strategy:
The CIP Dividend Growth Strategy starts by narrowing the universe of eligible securities for consideration to those companies in the top half of stocks ranked by dividend yield (top 5 deciles as illustrated in the chart above). We then apply our proprietary multifactor model to identify those companies that display attractive growth rates, but sell at a reasonable price. The portfolio is diversified using a risk model in an effort to obtain the highest return while assuming the lowest risk.
The final result is a well diversified portfolio of above average dividend paying stocks. The dividend yield has historically rivaled fixed income alternatives in terms of absolute yield, but has the added advantage of growth in dividends historically. That such a strategy is very competitive with the broader market on a total rate of return basis over time.

Status quo gets a surprise! - Convergence Q4 2016 Commentary
The year of 2016 has closed its chapter in history and will go down as a year full of upheavals,
surprises, and inflection points. From a market perspective, many predictions and expectations by
the “professional thinkers” proved to be completely wrong or opposite the expected result.

Party like its 1999! - Convergence Q3 2016 Commentary
Let’s reimagine the equity market is a large block party, and certain parts of the crowd are becoming obnoxious and “out of hand.” At the same time,
there are other partygoers who are behaving sensibly, but who are amused by the behavior of “that other crowd.”

It’s all about the Fundamentals - Convergence Q1 2016 Commentary

To everything turn, turn, turn.
  That opening line to the 1965 folk rock hit song by the Byrds seems appropriate in describing the two
back-to-back sharp corrections followed by sharp market recoveries in the past 6 months.

Investors Refocus on Fundamentals - Convergence Q4 2015 Commentary
The market was little changed for the calendar year, with the Russell 3000 Index up less than one half
of one percent. But as any bogie golfer will tell you, the score on the card rarely describes the game just
played. The market underwent a series of major changes, each important in its own right.

October 2013 Convergence Core Plus Strategy: The Persistency of Preferences
The Convergence Core Plus Strategy is a sharp departure from the traditional quantitative approach. Nearly all quantitative models are based on extensive back testing into the efficacy of various combinations of factors or metrics. These models can be very simple, consisting of a handful of metrics, applied across the universe of securities and used systematically to rank the relative attractiveness of prospective investments on a regular schedule; or complex, involving mathematical formulas that weight
metrics by industries and other sub groups, and set triggers for reevaluation.

October 2013 The Core Plus Trilogy
“Core Plus” often refers to the introduction of high yield and international fixed investments to an otherwise high quality domestic fixed income fund. Dissatisfied with low yields and meager total returns, investors expand their policy statements in an effort to capture alpha in a broader set of opportunities. This “broader mandate” recognizes the mathematical reality that the return potential in a narrowly defined universe is limited, and that active management is handcuffed in its attempt to capture alpha by a limited mandate.

October 2013 Convergence Core Plus Strategy: The Structural Impact on Alpha
After years of working with clients as both portfolio managers and as equity analysts, we concluded that the traditional model was simply not working. In 2005 we opened a small hedge fund and started managing long/short. This fund was where we tested our ideas. For 5 years we worked on the development of our long/short process, and our proprietary dynamic model. At the end of December 2009 we rolled out our Core Plus Strategy.

August 2012 A New Model for Improving Returns
In this paper, we examine the rise in correlations in the equity markets and its impact on traditional asset allocation models.  We then explore a new model that seeks out areas in which correlations continue to be low, and, therefore, the opportunity to generate alpha remains.  Finally, we examine a new approach to building the allocation that seeks to capture the alpha potential in equity markets.

June 2011 Commentary - Sourcing Alpha
From January 1st until the end of April, the Russell 3000 had risen 9.1%, and the Russell 2000 advanced 10.8%. Companies that reported solid earnings growth driven by top line sales growth were rewarded. Optimism abounded; then came May.

May 2011 Commentary - The Meaning of “Plus” in a Changing Market.
Since August of 2010, the stock market has been on a near uninterrupted advance. Large cap stocks as represented by the Russell 1000 are up 32.85% and small cap stocks are up 44.76% as represented by the Russell 2000 Index. In the past few days, however, new anxiety has returned. Economic growth shows signs of slowing, labor market statistics have reversed their previously tepid advance, and the stock market appears to have at least temporarily “rolled over.”

The Value of Persistency
Our investment process, form our core factor research to portfolio construction, is built on the concept that persistency has value in the marketplace. We judge our success on our ability to replicate the risk/return profile of each investment model in real time.
