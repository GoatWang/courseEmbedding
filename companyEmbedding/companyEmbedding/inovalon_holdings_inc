Inovalon is a technology company which provides cloud-based platforms to the healthcare industry.[1]
History[edit]
The company was initially founded in 1998 in Maryland as MedAssurant by Keith Dunleavy.[1]
In 2008, the company employed 1,900 clinicians and statisticians.[2]
In June 2012, the company changed its name to Inovalon.[3]
In 2012, Inovalon partnered with industry researchers to conduct a study on Hospital Readmission Rates in Medicare Advantage Plans to track readmission rates among patients enrolled in Medicare’s private comprehensive Medicare Advantage plans, and develop initial comparisons with fee-for-service (FFS) readmission rates. The study was published in The American Journal of Managed Care.[4]
In 2013, Inovalon partnered with Walgreens and electronic health record (EHR) companies such as Allscripts,[5][6] Greenway,[7][8] and NeoDeck to integrate analytics platforms into the point of care. Inovalon also examined the association of socioeconomic status and other factors with underlying poor quality performance of dual-eligible members in Medicare Advantage plans,[9][10] releasing a study on October 28, 2014 that was presented to Congressional representatives on October 21, 2014.[11]
In 2014, Inovalon expanded its partnership with Walgreens to implement its "ePASS" patient assessment tool and technology platform in clinics at Walgreens locations. [12][13]
On May 19, 2014, the company added Robert Wychulis as President. Mr. Wychulis formerly served as President of Anthem, Inc.[14]
The company publicly filed its registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on December 30, 2014 for a proposed initial public offering of its common stock and applied for listing on NASDAQ under the ticker "INOV".[15]
In May 2015, Inovalon released an analysis of dual eligible member data, which indicated that social and demographic factors affect health-related outcomes and measurements for health plan performance, independent of plan characteristics.[16]
On September 1, 2015, Inovalon acquired Avalere Health, a strategic advisory company providing solutions to the pharmaceutical industry, managed care companies and provider organizations.[17]
On September 29, 2015, Inovalon and Quest Diagnostics launched Data Diagnostics, a suite of real-time patient-specific data analyses.[18]
In September 2016, Inovalon announced the acquisition of Creehan Holding Co., Inc., the parent company of Creehan & Company, a provider of specialty pharmacy and specialty medications management software-as-a-service platforms. The acquisition closed on October 1, 2016.[19]

Inovalon is a technology company which provides cloud-based platforms to the healthcare industry.[1]
History[edit]
The company was initially founded in 1998 in Maryland as MedAssurant by Keith Dunleavy.[1]
In 2008, the company employed 1,900 clinicians and statisticians.[2]
In June 2012, the company changed its name to Inovalon.[3]
In 2012, Inovalon partnered with industry researchers to conduct a study on Hospital Readmission Rates in Medicare Advantage Plans to track readmission rates among patients enrolled in Medicare’s private comprehensive Medicare Advantage plans, and develop initial comparisons with fee-for-service (FFS) readmission rates. The study was published in The American Journal of Managed Care.[4]
In 2013, Inovalon partnered with Walgreens and electronic health record (EHR) companies such as Allscripts,[5][6] Greenway,[7][8] and NeoDeck to integrate analytics platforms into the point of care. Inovalon also examined the association of socioeconomic status and other factors with underlying poor quality performance of dual-eligible members in Medicare Advantage plans,[9][10] releasing a study on October 28, 2014 that was presented to Congressional representatives on October 21, 2014.[11]
In 2014, Inovalon expanded its partnership with Walgreens to implement its "ePASS" patient assessment tool and technology platform in clinics at Walgreens locations. [12][13]
On May 19, 2014, the company added Robert Wychulis as President. Mr. Wychulis formerly served as President of Anthem, Inc.[14]
The company publicly filed its registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on December 30, 2014 for a proposed initial public offering of its common stock and applied for listing on NASDAQ under the ticker "INOV".[15]
In May 2015, Inovalon released an analysis of dual eligible member data, which indicated that social and demographic factors affect health-related outcomes and measurements for health plan performance, independent of plan characteristics.[16]
On September 1, 2015, Inovalon acquired Avalere Health, a strategic advisory company providing solutions to the pharmaceutical industry, managed care companies and provider organizations.[17]
On September 29, 2015, Inovalon and Quest Diagnostics launched Data Diagnostics, a suite of real-time patient-specific data analyses.[18]
In September 2016, Inovalon announced the acquisition of Creehan Holding Co., Inc., the parent company of Creehan & Company, a provider of specialty pharmacy and specialty medications management software-as-a-service platforms. The acquisition closed on October 1, 2016.[19]

DATA-DRIVEN IMPROVEMENTS IN HEALTHCARE™















 


 



How We Help

Delivering Integrated Data-Driven Solutions
Inovalon ONE™ is an integrated cloud-based platform of more than 80 individual proprietary technology toolsets able to be rapidly configured to empower the operationalization of large-scale value-based healthcare initiatives. Each toolset is referred to as a Component, with each supporting critical healthcare ecosystem functionality needs. Components are configured into integrated sets identified as Modules, each of which share cohesive interoperability and common data management.
Each Component empowers differentiated capabilities within the Inovalon ONE™ Platform. Examples of Components include Inovalon’s big data integration engine, iPORT-HD™, which applies more than 1,100 data integrity analyses in real-time to enable massive-scale data ingestion streaming from thousands of disparate healthcare data sources; Inovalon’s predictive analytics engine, PCIS™, which leverages the Company’s datasets of more than 14 billion medical events to predict disease and comorbidity presence and progression in patients across more than 72,000 distinct clinical diagnoses and comorbidities; Inovalon’s non-structured clinical data optical character recognition (OCR) and natural language processing (NLP) engines honed on millions of medical record cases; Inovalon’s decision support toolset, ePASS®, which empowers clinicians to achieve significantly increased quality and value impact in the fraction of the traditional time to assess a patient; and Inovalon’s large-scale, real-time transactional compute engine, QSI-XL™ and its sister Component QSI®, which together power more than 60 percent of the country’s clinical quality outcomes measurement and analysis processes.
Components are configured into specialized Modules to address specific areas of focus. Examples include the Connectivity & Integration Module, the Data Visualization & Reporting Module, the Master Data Warehouse Module, the Analytical Algorithms & Engines Module, the Management & Administration Consoles Module, and the Real World Intervention & Point-of-Care Solutions Module.
Driving intelligence within the Inovalon ONE™ Platform is the application of insights garnered from the Company’s datasets. The MORE2 Registry® is Inovalon’s proprietary, primary source de-identified data warehouse consisting of data and insights from more than 14 billion medical events, 158 million patients, 856,000 physicians, and 375,000 clinical facilities ingested from thousands of healthcare ecosystem data sources. Ongoing analyses of this data informs thousands of considerations made across the Inovalon ONE™ Platform, ranging from the normalization and validation of data ingestion and clinical outcomes comparative performance analyses, to the determination of predicted patient disease progression and clinical protocols for the achievement of goals such as improved medication compliance, clinical outcomes, and utilization savings.
Example applications of the Inovalon ONE™ Platform are wide-ranging and highly customizable. The configuration of a number of Components within the Platform, for example, can provide a client with tools that enable dramatic reductions in post-acute care costs and readmission rates. The activation of additional Components can provide the same client the ability to achieve clinical quality outcomes improvement, increases in medication adherence, or improved risk score accuracy. Other Components enable patient data aggregation, monitoring, analysis, and data visualization on massive scale, empowering, for example, highly complex, nation-scale medication and medical device value-based and outcomes-based contracting initiatives. For these same clients, EHR interconnectivity, real-time decision support, and on-demand real-time analytic Components can be activated to empower highly targeted patient-specific physician clinical encounters to drive improved outcomes for the respective medication or device. Still other Components empower large-scale collaborations between payers and providers to achieve value-based care with real-time accuracy.
The modular, Component-driven design of the Inovalon ONE™ Platform results in it being highly extensible. Once a client is utilizing the Inovalon ONE™ Platform, bringing to bear additional capabilities enabled by the activation of additional Components, or additional instances of the same Component in different configurations, is readily undertaken making it highly efficient for clients to undertake an expanding number and scale of initiatives quickly and efficiently without the need for additional integrations or multi-vendor coordination. Further, the flexibility of the design allows for clients to more easily utilize elements of their existing capabilities in combination with the Inovalon ONE™ Platform, eliminating the need to make all-or-none monolithic Platform decisions.
The Inovalon ONE™ Platform is provided in a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) subscription engagement arrangement to support a wide range of high-impact value-based initiatives. Implementation of the Platform for a specific client engagement proceeds in a three-step process described as Discovery, Configuration, and Operation. During Discovery, the determination of client goals and needs are explored, tested and validated against the Company’s large-scale real-world datasets. In Configuration, the determinations garnered during Discovery are applied to relevant Components and Modules for activation of the Platform. Most implementations (defined as the time required for Discovery and Configuration) require only short periods of time measured in days to weeks, with more complex implementations potentially requiring six months.
Through the Inovalon ONE™ Platform, Inovalon brings to the marketplace a national-scale capability to interconnect with the healthcare ecosystem on massive scale, aggregate and analyze data in petabyte volumes, arrive at sophisticated insights in real-time, and drive impact wherever it is analytically identified best to intervene.

INOV: Insiders vs. Shorts
The most recent short interest data was recently released for the 05/31/2017 settlement date, and Inovalon Holdings Inc is one of the most shorted stocks of the Russell 3000, based on 25.16 "days to cover" versus the median component at 5.01. There are a number of ways to look at short data, but one metric that we find particularly useful is the "days to cover" because it considers both the total shares short and the average daily volume of shares typically traded.
