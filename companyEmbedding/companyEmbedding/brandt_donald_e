Donald E. Brandt



Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer
Pinnacle West Capital Corporation
Arizona Public Service Company
Chairman, Nuclear Energy Institute
Don Brandt is chairman of the board, president and chief executive officer for Pinnacle West Capital Corporation and Arizona Public Service Company (APS), Pinnacle West’s primary subsidiary. The companies are headquartered in Phoenix. APS serves 1.2 million customers across Arizona and is among the nation’s top-performing utilities for reliability and customer satisfaction.
Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station is part of APS’s generation fleet, and for 22 consecutive years has been the nation’s largest power producer.

Instead, it uses treated effluent from several area municipalities to meet its cooling water needs, recycling approximately 20 billion gallons of wastewater each year.
Prior to joining Pinnacle West in 2002, Brandt gained 20 years of power industry experience. He served as senior vice president and chief financial officer at Ameren Corporation, a St. Louis-based energy company. Prior
to Ameren, he was at Price Waterhouse & Co., where he provided audit and consulting services to Fortune 500 public companies.
A recognized industry and community leader, Brandt also serves
on the boards of the Institute of Nuclear Power Operations and Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited. In addition, he sits on the boards of the Edison Electric Institute, the McCain Institute, the Phoenix Art Museum and the Nature Conservancy in Arizona. 
A certified public accountant, Brandt earned his Bachelor of Science degree in business administration from St. Louis University.

              BRANDT RECORDS            	
Brandt Records are records containing information about people of Brandt. These records contain a huge range of information about people including, but not limited to, their address records, building records, land records and death records.

You are just required to write the first and last name of the person you are looking for and then you will get loads of valuable information about them in no time.
