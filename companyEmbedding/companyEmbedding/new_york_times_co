As The New York Times Company transforms for the digital age, it has moved more into lifestyle journalism, with online products like Cooking, Watching and Well. Now, it has made another bet on so-called service journalism, with the acquisition of the product recommendation site The Wirecutter and its sibling, The Sweethome.The all-cash transaction closed on Monday. The deal is worth slightly more than $30 million, according to a person with knowledge of the acquisition who spoke on condition of anonymity.“The practical approach that The Wirecutter and The Sweethome take to product recommendations embodies the same standards and values that are the pillars of our own newsroom,” Mark Thompson, the chief executive of the Times Company, said in a statement. “Their service-focused guides align with our commitment to creating products that are an indispensable part of our readers’ lives.”Founded in 2011 by Brian Lam, a technology journalist and former editor of Gawker Media’s technology site, Gizmodo, The Wirecutter provides recommendations for gadgets and electronics like televisions and headphones. (The Sweethome focuses mostly on products for the home.) The site started publishing as part of The Awl network, whose founders included Choire Sicha and Alex Balk, both formerly of Gawker Media, with the idea that it would delve deeply into categories of products rather than post more frequently.

When readers click through the site to buy the recommended products, the site earns affiliate commissions from retailers like Amazon, a revenue model that Mr. Thompson called “very attractive.”

The New York Times and The Wirecutter already have an editorial partnership, which began about a year ago. The companies have collaborated on stories about bad Wi-Fi, poor battery life and cord-cutting. Brian X. Chen, a consumer technology reporter for The Times who worked on those articles, helped Mr. Lam start The Wirecutter when he was between jobs in 2011. Continue reading the main story

Mr. Lam, who will stay with the company as an adviser, said in a statement, “We’re thrilled to have the chance to help Times readers find great gear that can improve their lives.”In a note to employees about the acquisition, Dean Baquet, the executive editor of The Times, said that acquisition discussions began earlier this year and that he “was one of the biggest proponents of the deal.” The Times already uses affiliate links in certain reviews and best-seller lists, Mr. Baquet said, adding that the deal was “a strong step toward a further embrace of this approach.” (He assured employees that The Times would do this “within the bounds of Times standards.”)The acquisition comes at a time of transition for The Times, which is attempting to reconstitute itself for the digital future, a process that has the newsroom bracing for layoffs early next year.

Publication Date: March 30, 2007

 The Sulzberger family owns 20% of the New York Times Co. (NYT) but controls 70% of the board through a dual-class share structure. At the company's April 2006 annual shareholder meeting, Morgan Stanley Investment Management (MSIM) and other investors, holding 28% of the company's stock altogether, withheld their votes for the 30% of directors that they could vote on as a sign of protest against the management of Arthur Sulzberger, Jr. and the dual-class structure that protects him. MSIM later submitted a proposal urging the NYT to subject the dual-class structure to a vote. In evaluating the proposal, Sulzberger feels torn by his responsibilities to three different constituencies: his readers, his family, and all other NYT shareholders.

Their Hair Fell Out. Should the F.D.A. Have the Power to Act?

Eliana Lawrence, 11, went bald three weeks after she started using a Wen cleansing conditioner in late 2014, her mother said. Last week, Eliana’s hair still showed some bald spots.

WASHINGTON — When the Los Angeles hairstylist Chaz Dean pitched his almond mint and lavender-scented hair care products — endorsed by celebrities like Brooke Shields and Alyssa Milano — he sold millions. But his formula got an unexpected result: itching, rashes, even hair loss in large clumps, in both adults and children.More than 21,000 complaints have been lodged against his Wen Hair Care, and  Mr. Dean, the blue-eyed, golden-haired stylist to the stars, has found himself at the center of a fierce debate over the government’s power to ensure the safety of a cosmetics industry with about $50 billion in annual sales.The Santa Monica, Calif.-based national distributor of Mr. Dean’s hair care line is part of a beauty care trade association that has been aggressively lobbying Congress to block the passage of tough new legislation that would give the Food and Drug Administration the authority to test ingredients used in cosmetics and issue mandatory recalls for products found to be unsafe.The fight has pitted smaller independent players against the giants of the beauty products industry, which back the proposed regulations, seeing them as an avenue toward regaining public trust, and have the size and muscle to comply with them.

Each side has its champions in Congress: Senators Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, and Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, for the larger companies, and Representative Pete Sessions, Republican of Texas, coming to the aid of his home-state company, Mary Kay, which joined the Independent Cosmetic Manufacturers and Distributors to fight the Feinstein-Collins legislation. Mr. Sessions has introduced competing legislation backed and largely drafted by Mary Kay and the independent companies. Continue reading the main story

“If you are in business and are not involved in politics, then politics will run your business,” explained a presentation prepared by Mary Kay last summer for sales representatives and obtained by The New York Times.The face-off comes amid growing consumer concern about the safety of beauty care products and follows a string of other scares, including the discovery of hair products and skin creams containing hazardous ingredients such as formaldehyde and mercury.

“People don’t realize there is effectively no regulation of cosmetics,” said Representative Frank Pallone Jr., Democrat of New Jersey. He, along with Ms. Feinstein and Ms. Collins, has pushed to strengthen a 1938 law that was passed to regulate the pharmaceutical industry but contained two pages that addressed cosmetics, leaving it essentially unregulated.Joe Hixson, a spokesman for Guthy-Renker, the distributor of Wen, said the company has “evidence and studies that we believe demonstrate Wen is safe and does not cause hair loss.”Mr. Dean’s hair care product does not actually lather. Instead, Mr. Dean promotes it as “a revolutionary way to cleanse” the hair without the use of traditional detergents or sulfates, chemicals some consumers have objected to.“In addition to it sounding like ‘Zen,’ the system is a completely reverse way of looking at cleansing the hair,” the product’s website boasts. “Thus, ‘Wen’ is ‘new’ spelled backwards.” The company also sells what it calls “unique formulations gentle for pediatric use.”Miriam Lawrence of Denver said she used Wen’s Sweet Almond Mint Cleansing Conditioner on the hair of her daughter, Eliana, then 9, about three times in late 2014. Within days, her daughter’s brush was full of hair. Three weeks later, Eliana was bald.

“It changed our life in just a couple shampoos. It’s ridiculous,” said Ms. Lawrence, whose daughter has grown back most of her hair and eyebrows. “It was marketed to be extra gentle, no harsh chemicals.”Mr. Pallone, in a letter to the F.D.A. and Guthy-Renker, has pressed for answers about the Wen case. And in an interview he cited it as an example of why current law is failing and more rigorous regulation is needed.For legal reasons, the government’s hands are tied.That is in part because unlike pharmaceutical companies, cosmetic companies are not required to notify the government of “adverse reaction” reports — even if someone dies.

The F.D.A. instead has had to depend on consumers stepping forward, and as of July 7, only 127 reports had been filed to the agency detailing problems with the Wen hair care line. But inspectors sent to the company’s facilities dating back to 2011 learned that complaints to the company and distributor total more than 21,000, the agency said last month.“You know how the stars were saying it was so good and it made your hair more manageable, more shinier?” said Bonnie Iqbal, 55, of Albany, who last year was among those who sued the company after her hair began falling out. “So I figured, you know, I’d try it.”Patricia J. Zettler, a health law and policy expert at Georgia State University and a former F.D.A. lawyer, said that under existing law, the agency could take action against the company only if it could prove a product had been mislabeled or contaminated. If the product turns out to be dangerous but legal, the government has no recourse.“The bottom line is, if the company has not violated the law, there isn’t really anything F.D.A. can do,” Ms. Zettler said.Even in the absence of federal action, Guthy-Renker, in a “business decision,” agreed in late June to a $26.25 million legal settlement — still not approved by a federal court judge — that would repay up to $25 to every person who has bought a bottle since Wen products were introduced and as much as $20,000 to individuals claiming hair loss or other injury. Yet the product is still being sold, and the F.D.A., other than issuing a notice saying it is looking at the matter, has taken no action.

The Feinstein-Collins bill is intended to eliminate such stalemates. It would, for the first time, require that cosmetics manufacturers report “serious adverse” reactions to their products to the F.D.A. as they come in, as well as create an annual report of all “adverse events.” It would also give the agency the power to order companies to recall products found to be dangerous.

The bill would collect about $20 million in fees annually from beauty care companies to help cover the cost of confirming the safety of about five ingredients each year that are suspected of causing problems, such as lead acetate, a color additive in hair dyes, and quaternium-15, a preservative used in certain shampoo and cosmetics.The legislation has won the endorsement of heavyweights including Estée Lauder, whose brands include Clinique, Origins, MAC, La Mer, and Bobbi Brown; Johnson & Johnson, maker of Neutrogena and Aveeno; and Procter & Gamble, whose brands include Pantene, Head & Shoulders, Herbal Essences and Olay. Industry officials said they decided to embrace the legislation after becoming increasingly concerned that a decline in consumer confidence could hurt their sales.

“The Feinstein-Collins bill is supported by a vast and diverse group of people and groups who all want the same thing — cosmetic regulations that best serve the public health and give consumers confidence in the products and ingredients they choose for their families,” Darrel Jodrey, a top federal lobbyist at Johnson & Johnson, said in a statement.Major national environmental, consumer and health nonprofits, such as the American Cancer Society, the Environmental Working Group and the Good Housekeeping Institute, have also backed the plan.But even before Ms. Feinstein formally introduced her legislation in April 2015, the Independent Cosmetic Manufacturers and Distributors, in which Guthy-Renker has been a dues-paying member for over a decade, moved to defeat it, internal documents obtained by The Times show.During a March 2015 strategy session in the New York law offices of a trade association legal adviser, Locke Lord, industry executives were briefed by their lobbying team, who explained that it had already approached the office of Representative Fred Upton of Michigan, the chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, with jurisdiction over the F.D.A.Michael Lunceford, a senior vice president at Mary Kay overseeing the company’s lobbying and public affairs divisions, had done groundwork through the Direct Selling Association, where he is on the board, to help Mr. Upton’s 2012 re-election effort. The organization bought billboard, radio and newspaper ads “to gain the attention of the candidate in order to cultivate a champion for the direct selling industry,” according to an industry newsletter.Guthy-Renker hired its own well-connected Washington help: William R. Nordwind, a lawyer and lobbyist who spent a dozen years working as a staff member and campaign aide to Mr. Upton. Mr. Hixson, the Guthy-Renker spokesman, said the company had not publicly taken a position on the Feinstein-Collins bill, although it financially supported the independent cosmetics industry association. Mr. Nordwind’s team, from the Venable lobbying firm, has contacted Capitol Hill on behalf of the company, Mr. Hixson said.

“They have got a bad story out there right now,” Robert Harmala, a former House aide who lobbies for the Independent Cosmetic Manufacturers and Distributors, said regarding Guthy-Renker and its Wen product line. “They don’t want to be the face of the industry for having done this.”Mary Kay claims credit for persuading Mr. Sessions, whose Dallas-area district is near its headquarters, to sponsor alternative legislation. Mr. Sessions’s proposal still would require beauty care companies to notify the F.D.A. of “serious cosmetic adverse events,” but it would not grant the agency the power to order a recall or collect industry fees to pay for new programs, such as the safety evaluation of cosmetics ingredients. Most important for direct sellers like Guthy-Renker, Mary Kay and other members of the independent cosmetics group, it would broadly and retroactively pre-empt any tougher state laws.

“We can’t just be out there saying, ‘No, we don’t like Feinstein’s bill,’” Mr. Harmala said in an interview.Mr. Sessions, after introducing the legislation, became a favorite of the cosmetics industry, campaign finance records show, emerging as the top recipient in Congress of donations from Mary Kay employees, and taking donations from at least 10 other industry executives, including Pam Busiek, the president of the Independent Cosmetic Manufacturers and Distributors. Executives at Guthy-Renker were not among the donors.More industry donations were sent to Representatives Eddie Bernice Johnson, Democrat of Texas, and Bill Flores, Republican of Texas, the only other two House lawmakers to help sponsor the bill.Crayton W. Webb, a spokesman for Mary Kay, said the company was committed to helping pass a law that increased the federal government’s oversight of the industry, but opposed Ms. Feinstein’s bill because “it falls short in providing one clear national and uniform safety standard.”Ms. Busiek added, “We want something that is not overreaching.” Mr. Dean declined to comment.The F.D.A. would not comment on the proposals. So far, the agency said, it has found no evidence of contamination or misbranding in Wen products, the only two product flaws it can use to press a company to agree to a voluntary recall. The agency has requested the results of safety tests and other manufacturing data, but it cannot compel the company to release any information.“That’s why it is so critical that we get information directly from consumers and their health care providers,” said Susan Mayne, the director of the F.D.A.’s Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition.

For consumers dealing with thinning hair, itchy scalps and other problems, the additional responsibility of bringing their case to the government can be a tall order — and certainly a confusing one. The government should be helping them, they say.

“I think it would be great for the F.D.A. to step in a little bit more,” said Melanie Guitzkow, a 20-year-old student, who said her hair began to fall out when she used Wen in high school. “Some things, like, shouldn’t be on the market because they’re damaging.”

The New York Times Company Names Kinsey Wilson Executive Vice President of Product and Technology
03/30/2015

Download this Press Release ()


David Perpich Named Senior Vice President for Product

 NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
The New York Times Company announced today that Kinsey Wilson, currently
The Times’s editor for strategy and innovation, has also been named
executive vice president, product and technology. Mr. Wilson will join
the company’s executive committee and expand his present role to assume
leadership of all company-wide digital product and technology
operations. He will report jointly to President and CEO
Mark Thompson
and Executive Editor
Dean Baquet
.


In making the announcement, Mr. Thompson and Mr. Baquet said, “The
company’s initial plan was to appoint an executive vice president who
would work as a partner to Kinsey in his newsroom role. Since early
February, though, as Kinsey has become a key contributor and grasped the
challenges and opportunities of our digital transformation, we have
become convinced that unifying these responsibilities under his
leadership makes better sense and offers us an opportunity to accelerate
the progress that is already underway. Kinsey is the ideal person for
this role. He is a digital visionary with deep roots in journalism and
he’s a dynamic leader with a keen understanding of digital products and
technology.”


Mr. Wilson said, “I’m thrilled to be taking on a broader role at The
Times and grateful to Mark and Dean for their confidence in me. This is
a very special place filled with immensely talented people. We all have
a common goal, to make sure that people's experience of The Times,
wherever they find us, continues to match the brilliance of our
journalism.”


Mr. Wilson joined The Times in February 2015. Previously, he oversaw
NPR’s global news-gathering, programming and digital operations as
executive vice president and chief content officer. He drove the
development of the NPR One mobile app, which pioneered a new
personalized digital listening experience, championed initiatives such
as Planet Money, NPR Music, and the Race Card Project and is widely
credited with positioning NPR as a digital leader.


Previously, Mr. Wilson was executive editor of USA Today, where he
oversaw digital strategy and daily news operations. He also led
Congressional Quarterly’s early web strategy and served as a reporter at
Newsday for 7 years.


David Perpich
has been named senior vice president, product, reporting
to Mr. Wilson. Since 2013, Mr. Perpich has been general manager of new
digital products, leading the business side team charged with the
creation of new digital products. He joined the company in 2010 as
executive director of paid products and played a key part in the rollout
of The Times’s digital subscription plan in 2011.


Mr. Perpich came to The Times from the management consulting firm Booz &
Company, where he was a member of their consumer, media and digital
industries practice, focusing on growth strategy. He previously founded
and ran two companies, both in the music industry, and he held roles in
product management and business development at About.com, a former New
York Times Company property. Mr. Perpich received a B.A. in economics
from Duke University and an M.B.A. from Harvard University.


The company also announced that
Paul Smurl
, who has been a central
player in the growth of The Times’s digital business, is leaving to
become COO and President of Some Spider LLC, a startup just launched by Diapers.com co-founder
Vinit Bharara.

The New York Times Restarts Its New Product Model, In Spanish - New York Times Co. (NYSE:NYT) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»The New York Times Restarts Its New Product Model, In SpanishFeb. 9.16 | About: New York (NYT) Ken Doctor NewsonomicsIf your image of Mexico comes only from election rhetoric, you might think of it as a land of drug-pushing, crime-committing illegals aiming to upset all Americans hold dear. Well, it turns out Mexico is a market, not only for American goods of many kinds, but also for journalism. This election season, it is refreshing to see Mexico, and Latin America, in the news as something more than a piñata for ill-tempered politicians (Net immigration is now back to Mexico from the U.S., says Pew Research).
Today, The New York Times (NYSE:NYT) does that news-making, launching an effort, a year in the making. Simply titled The New York Times en Español - based in Mexico City and reaching out to all of Spanish-speaking Latin America - the Times' initial effort is a modest one, but one intended both to be built out and to be used as a model for the Times in other parts of the world. It's NYT's intention to launch a second region in 2016 as well. So, as the year begins, we can see the Times is clearly back in the new product game, with international expansion just part of the game plan - the rest TBA.
The potential audience is a big one - estimated by the Times at 80 million, including those who combine certain education and income levels with digital savvy. That's out of about 500 million Spanish speakers worldwide, primarily in Latin America and Spain. While English is the de facto lingua franca worldwide, with 1 billion able to understand it, Spanish is not far behind.
NYT's immediate goal: get a little piece of that market to pay for a digital subscription. But it launches as a free product - no meter, no paywall, just ads from four launch sponsors.
"I want to stress that ultimately this is about a subscription model," Stephen Dunbar-Johnson, the Times' international president, told me Friday. That's consistent with what CEO Mark Thompson laid out in his five-year plan. Reader revenue - now running at 53 percent of total revenue - is the lead dog going forward. Readers like you and me are far more loyal to the Times than are advertisers, as the worlds of advertising continue to experience one upheaval after another (Just one example from last week's Times' Q4 financial report: Its print revenue month by month in that quarter was -9 percent, 0 percent and +7 percent).

Further, the Times is still on a digital subscription roll. It can claim almost 1.1 million digital-only subscribers, up 20 percent year over year and a net gain of 53,000 subscribers in the last quarter. Thompson said Thursday that the Times believes it will hit 1.25 million by the end of 2016.
Of that number, perhaps NYT en Español will contribute somewhere in the five figures - at some point. The Times now has sold more than 100,000 digital-only subscriptions (12-13 percent of its overall total) to those living outside the U.S. The Times won't break out that geography, but we can safely assume the great bulk are subscribers in Europe and Canada. Whatever the Times can eke out of its new market in 2017 - if it launches any metered paywall system by then - will be just a down payment on 2018-20 plans.
"We do not plan on having a pay system in 2016," says Dunbar-Johnson.
"We have a lot to learn from our Latin American readers, and we need to understand their needs and preferences. As we do, and over time, we will find the solutions to best engage them and, in turn, develop a subscription relationship. All to say, this is a long-term audience development road...In markets where we have yet to achieve significant penetration, we are focusing first on audience growth supported by advertising."
The Times hopes to cook up a new audience. Says Dunbar-Johnson:
"We want to take a bet on exposing larger numbers of people in this market in Spanish to New York Times journalism. Have them marinate in the brand."
Learning from the 2014 Times' paid experiments
In his comments, you can hear the lessons of 2014 at the Times. That spring, it announced plans for three subscription paid products. The millennial-oriented, lower-priced NYT Now launched, but couldn't land more than 20,000 subscribers; it remains today as a free product and a good learning lab for the Times. NYT Opinion launched, but it became immediately apparent that it, too, wouldn't find much of an additional paying market; it was closed within six months. NYT Cooking lives on, popular with readers but relying only on ads, the Times having decided against putting in a metered pay system, given what it had learned. Those echoes of product testing informed much of the Times' new product development work of 2015. So, with the new products - and NYT en Español will be only the first to launch this year, details to come - the model is develop the audience first, charge later.

The relative modesty of today's launch is a contrast to earlier efforts. Those 2014 launches were costly, as has been its foray in China. In this case, we see a total cost of probably $2 million or so to build out the first in-language regional product. Given, though, the newly built-out central team - which will lead development in the other non-U.S. regions - the marginal cost of new regions should come at less than $1 million each. That incremental cost will be driven by the size and experience of editorial staff needed to create a winning product.
We can see another reason for the Times' caution here: Expanding outside a publisher's home market is anything but easy.
"We're introducing the Times to a new group of people," says Paul Walborsky, the business head of the Times' new international product efforts and of NYT en Español. Walborsky, who serves as a strategic consultant to the Times, brings unusual experience to the company. He is an entrepreneur steeped in publishing, with broad and fundamental knowledge of Latin America. He was born and raised in Mexico City, leaving at age 19, but has kept up connections in the region. He brings to the Times a long background in both startups (selling the financial CRM World Street Corp. to Thomson Financial in 2002), and in finance and tech. In the digital news business, he's known as the guy who built Gigaom for seven years, leaving as its CEO 18 months ago, some nine months before the site collapsed.
Lydia Polgreen matches Walborsky's passion for the region. A highly regarded international correspondent, with wide-ranging experience in South Africa, South Asia and West Africa, her 14-year Times career has led to the development of NYT en Español ("I'm still working on my Spanish." How's it coming? "Muy bien," she laughs).
As part of her duties as deputy international editor, she will direct a team of six journalists, based in Mexico City and headed by Times editor (and native Venezuelan) Eli Lopez. Importantly, the first staff has broad geographic roots, including representation from Spain, Venezuela, and Colombia. They will produce original stories, aided by a half-dozen current Times correspondents in the region. In addition, the product will feature 10-15 daily Times stories (of the 150 produced daily in English) translated into Spanish. While based in Mexico City, the world's largest Spanish-speaking city, the intention is to serve everyone in Latin America (save those Portuguese-speaking Brazilians, who actually slightly outnumber all the continent's Spanish speakers).

Reader research showed a high interest in a Times-curated news product. That research has been multi-faceted, including street intercepts of would-be readers, use of Facebook as a platform, and even sending out test newsletter products. Importantly, the Times' initial product team includes one data scientist and one person dedicating to user design research, testimony to how important the new research and analytics are to contemporary product development.
It's a new circle of knowledge, as Walborsky describes it: "market research, user design research, and then we validate with data science."
He uses the word narrowcasting.
"By using fairly advanced data science, we can actually get to the right audience and get them engaged. At the end of the day, you can't just spend money, because you can't translate everything, and you cannot produce 500 pieces. You really need to narrowcast, or narrow-target, your content to the right audience."
Engagement is the key
Now it's out of the data and into the marketplace. Importantly, in this case, it isn't the top of the proverbial audience funnel that's most important. It's the middle - those that can be regularly engaged in Times content.
Says Polgreen:
"Our goal is to skip the mass audience step. If we get 50 million people coming to this website, that will be great, but I think our real target is to try and go out there to find who are the most engaged users who we think are going to want to come to use a couple of times a week, or every day, and really have a deeply engaged relationship with The New York Times."
Consequently, how many stories people read is one test here. I'd believe that paying subscribers would one day expect many more, but that's a decision for down the road.
In offering a once-a-week newsletter, Boletin, at launch, the Times applies a lesson from the mothership. Email newsletters, briefings, and alerts all increase engagement, and the Times is engaging more resources to work each format. By spring, Boletin is planned to go to five days a week.

NYT en Español is browser-only; no app is planned at this point. It looks much like the rest of the Times' site. Ultimately, the desired engagement may depend as much on the intangible of product feel, as its content. That's a question of la voz, the voice of this product that the Times hopes to make a friendly and comfortable daily companion of the most engaged (and eventually paying) readers.
The half-dozen editorial staffers are matched up with an equal number of those directing and aiding the product, including product manager, data scientist, user design researcher, and developer.
We can expect the Times to launch a variety of marketing programs over the year. I asked whether it has been able to secure any launch help from one of its major investors, Carlos Slim, who owns 16.8 percent of the Times after making a major investment in the depths of the Great Recession. Slim, edged out by $2 billion by Bill Gates for the No. 1 spot on Forbes' wealth list, owns América Móvil (NYSE:AMX), the largest mobile carrier in Latin America. I wondered if Slim could help the Times with product placement or preferences in ways similar to those that Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) has done with Axel Springer, as the German media company launches its mobile news aggregator product, Upday.
"No," says Polgreen. "As you know, Carlos Slim is an investor in the Times, just like any other. He's not involved in the project in any way."
Four launch sponsors defray the investment
While subscription may be the longer-term goal here, for now it's advertising that will help defray the cost of the 12-person investment the Times is making.
The New York Times en Español launches with four initial, three-month sponsors, a good representation. Interestingly, they're a mix of U.S. advertisers wanting to reach a broader market and Latin American-based corporations.
"If you look at Latin America, you certainly have a pool of potential advertisers of those that are pan-Latin," says Dunbar-Johnson. "These are companies that are multinationals that have significant interest in Latin America; there are a reasonable number of those." Those sponsors include a financial giant, Mexico's Banamex, Formula 1 Gran Premio de Mexico 2016, and Acciona (OTC:ACXIY), a large Spanish renewable energy company.

The Times begins this initiative with no staffed advertising sales offices in the region (it has long had New York Times Syndicate sales staff there), but it does have an agent in Mexico City, and plans to build out its own sales staff as the audience grows.
Will the Times' T Brand Studio, its big digital-ad growth engine, be spinning out branded content ads in the new product? Not yet, but its talent could kick in as the audience grows to scale.
As it enters the new marketplace, there's lot of competition. Primary, of course, is the contest for readers' time. Then, there are other publishers.
Latin American media revived itself after the dark years of dictatorship and censorship that marked much of the '80s and '90s. Mostly family-owned, the in-country press has more lately suffered from the same kinds of digital disruption that have affected North America and Europe. Their depth of non-national reporting varies, and only a few have any original global staffing. We'd also have to consider El País, the Madrid-based daily with extensive operations in Latin America, BBC Mundo, CNN en Español and The Wall Street Journal as competition.
Both the Times ("The newsonomics of The New York Times' expanding global strategy") and the Journal have had their share of stumbles abroad; the Times abandoned a Brazil edition when it ran into headwinds three years ago. Even as The Guardian, Quartz, BuzzFeed, and The Huffington Post build and plan sites far afield, it's clear not all of them will succeed. As both Bloomberg and the Financial Times, both more highly experienced in global publishing, have found, it's a long slog of building ad relationships, relevance, and readership. The Times' investment here, then, can be seen as a relatively small one that can be sustained and allowed time to find traction. That's the hope, anyway, for a new product that stands as one of the first of 2016.About this article:ExpandTagged: Services, Publishing - NewspapersWant to share your opinion on this article?

The New York Times Co., which owns the Boston Globe, has been trying to trim $20 million dollars in cost reductions in order to minimize their losses. It has been reported that last year the Globe lost $50 million dollars and that this year they are expected to lose about $80 million dollars. With the Globe expected to lose money, it should not come as a surprise that severe cuts might have to take place in order to save the Globe. The labor unions aren’t making this simple though. In order to achieve their goal, The New York Times recently proposed a package of benefit and wage cuts. The unions responded with a flat out rejection and The New York Times now finds itself implementing a 23% salary cut for all employees across the board. The unions really should have accepted the package. It’s understandable that the unions opposed any sort of cuts. Who likes to have their salary reduced? No one. But surely, the package they were offered must have been better than the 23% salary cut they’re now facing. The New York Times is now quietly looking for buyers and is ready to sell the Globe because honestly, there is only so much you can do for a company that is no longer making you money nor willing to compromise and meet you half way. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) is soliciting interest in a potential sale and is said to have a couple of parties who are interested. The unions may now have to deal with a new owner who is more than willing to start dismissing people or if no one buys the Globe, then The New York Times won’t have any other choice but to close it. However, the real question is: “Who wants to buy a newspaper?” Newspapers are no longer profitable and many have already thrown in the towel. The internet is largely to blame because information is now so readily available with a simple click of the mouse.
Take this article for example. You didn’t pay to read it and you did it within the comfort of your own home or office without ever taking a step out. Newspaper advertisements have declined drastically and profits are no longer what they once were. Any company that decides to buy the Globe would be committing financial suicide because the Globe really is nothing more than a financial burden. Online media is now the king of information and newspapers can do nothing about it.
 So please, if you’re thinking about buying the Globe, stop and think about it because it just doesn’t make sense.About this article:ExpandTagged: Services, Publishing - NewspapersWant to share your opinion on this article?

New York Times Co. Extends 'Ricochet' Ads to Conde Nast, Ad Age and People
A New Class of 'Socially-Driven' Ad Inventory


	By  

Jason Del Rey.
	

	
	
 Published on March 13, 2013. 








Soon a host of publishers will follow the New York Times Co. and allow advertisers to buy specific articles as they are distributed on social networks.

The Times launched the product, called Richochet, last April to let advertisers choose specific articles from a publisher's archive to bind their ads to for a certain duration. The technology then creates a unique URL for the selected articles, which the advertisers can distribute to their social networks. 

The idea is to give brands using Ricochet an incentive to distribute articles in social media, and to give publishers a means to earn additional revenue.





		Michael Zimbalist 
 	


Starting in May, a host of outside publishers--including Ad Age, Conde Nast and Time Inc.'s People--will begin using the technology and sharing revenue with the Times, making it the first product from the Times' R&D Ventures group to be made available to other publishers.

"This is an entirely new concept in digital marketing that creates a whole new class of inventory: socially-driven inventory," Michael Zimbalist, VP-research and development operations at The Times Co., said at back in April. 



Up to now, advertisers have been able to only access content from NYTimes.com, Boston.com and BostonGlobe.com - all owned by The New York Times Company (for the moment). Starting May 1, advertisers will be able to fix their ads to web articles from Ad Age as well as The New Yorker, Glamour, Wired and other Conde Nast titles. Articles from People will also be available as a part of a Time Inc. pilot.



For advertisers, Richochet campaigns will only be as good as their ability to distribute the individual pieces of content on their own - whether to their followings on social networks or through paid channels such as Outbrain. On the other side, the technology seems like a good deal for publishers: it essentially helps them get paid to let advertisers distribute their work for them.



Individual publishers set their own prices and share the resulting ad revenue with The Times Co., which won't comment on the specific terms of those deals. Each publisher also makes their own rules about which pieces of content an advertiser can bind their ads to. A publisher could decide, for example, that advertisers can't tie their ads to articles about themselves or about their competitors.


Ricochet will be a self-serve marketplace for advertisers by May 1, Mr. Zimbalist said in a brief interview. They'll be able to search the content database by topic, upload their ad creative, choose from different page layouts if a publisher offers them, and set the duration of the campaign. 



For now, The Times Co. is focused on working only with "premium content providers," he said. "Over time, as the marketplace grows, it's conceivable that we'll add different niches," he added.

Top Hotel Deals





































Compare Prices






























Get the Scoop: Here's the Truth About Those 80% Off Sales
Now that we have your attention, are you ready to find out why you shouldn't believe those overhyped advertisements?
First off, those enticing "65% Off!", "70% Off!", and "80% Off!" ads generally refer to "discounts" off the highest-priced, most-restricted ticket classes (refundable, etc.). What the carriers are really saying is that there are cheaper flights out there than the most expensive tickets. News flash! In most cases, they're providing absolutely no support that any of those discounts exist under any circumstances.
Here's the bottom line: Most leisure travelers never actually buy the costliest, most-restricted tickets. Those are generally picked up by business travelers shopping on the company dime. With low-cost airlines, online travel agents, and flexible date searches all factoring in to your price hunting, it's rare that you'd ever pay the highest possible price anyway. So that 80% off "discount" doesn't apply to any flight you're likely to book.
For the best strategy, search flights from a wide variety of providers. Comparing rates is the only way to ensure you're getting a competitive price. It's the closest thing you've got to a foolproof strategy for booking flights. Here are our top tips:

Most domestic airlines release sales on Tuesdays, with the majority of competitors matching these deals within 24 hours. To take advantage of these airfare sales and have the largest amount of seats to choose from, search for fares on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. Historically, Saturdays have also proved fair prices for domestic travel.
When heading to a destination serviced by multiple airports, be sure to check them all to ensure you're getting the best fare. For example, if you're flying to New York City, search for the major airports (JFK, LaGuardia, and Newark), as well as smaller options (Long Island/Islip and White Plains).
Be flexible with your dates. Searching a range of dates gives you a good ballpark budget for what you can expect to spend on airfare.
Search, then search again. Frequently checking fares for your preferred route over a fixed period of time (e.g., once or twice per day over a week or two) gives you an in-depth, realistic understanding of what your airfare costs should be. Then, when you see a price you think is fair, book with confidence, knowing you've locked in the best fare for your route and budget.

BookingBuddy allows you to search various partner sites at once so you can compare the prices and options offered. Offers and savings are based on information available on these sites. There is no guarantee that these prices, savings, hotels, or dates will be available at the time of booking. Please check the site for the most recent details. When you book travel, your booking is handled by one of those sites directly, not by BookingBuddy. Transactions, and all subsequent customer care, are directly handled by the site where you booked your travel. BookingBuddy does not control the price, rules, regulations, or restrictions surrounding the price. Please read all rules and regulations before booking.


Get the Scoop: Here's the Truth About Those 70% Off Hotel Deals
You may have seen an enticing ad boasting huge discounts on hotel rooms. Though it got your attention, the deal's unlikely to hold up when subject to scrutiny. Here, we detail why:

That discount is likely "subtracted" from the room's rack rate (the highest price for the room on specific days during the peak booking season). Since it's unlikely that you'll ever be charged that price, the discount isn't really a discount at all.
Advertisers also like to add "extras" to the room rate to artificially inflate that "70% off" and sometimes even "80% off" claim. This "value" often includes daily breakfast, internet access, and other surcharge-carrying services in the nightly rate. The discount, therefore, isn't based on just the room but is based on all the related services that might not be of use to you.
Hotel rates are constantly changing. If an event is coming to town, room rates will skyrocket since demand is at a premium. Conversely, if there are extended periods of lower vacancy (hurricane season in the Caribbean, for example), room prices plummet. Attempting to determine the value of a percentage savings from such volatile price points is, at best, an inexact science.

Here are our top tips for getting the best hotel deals every time:

Don't only check one site and call it a day. By comparing prices across several providers, major online travel agencies, and your favorite hotel brand's site, you may find that one price point undercuts the rest-or offers a little something extra for the same price.
Go for it, go opaque. You'll see the room class, neighborhood, amenities, price, and reviews before you book, but if you're willing to take a chance with the hotel brand, opaque sites such as our partners Hotwire and Priceline are great ways to save big.
Forget the oranges, only compare apples to apples. Make sure you're comparing the same offerings across providers. And to ensure you're getting an even better deal, you'll want to compare prices for similar room types at all hotels.
Look for discounts. Oftentimes, hotels offer additional savings for AAA and AARP members, students, military personnel and their families, teachers, and other groups.
Join a private sale site. Sign up for a luxury discount-hotels site, such as JetSetter, which offers exclusive, members-only discounts at the finest properties throughout the world.

BookingBuddy allows you to search various partner sites at once so you can compare the prices and options offered. Offers and savings are based on information available on these sites. There is no guarantee that these prices, savings, hotels, or dates will be available at the time of booking. Please check the site for the most recent details. When you book travel, your booking is handled by one of those sites directly, not by BookingBuddy. Transactions, and all subsequent customer care, are directly handled by the site where you booked your travel. BookingBuddy does not control the price, rules, regulations, or restrictions surrounding the price. Please read all rules and regulations before booking.
Always Get Low-Price Guarantees!
You may have seen low- or best-price guarantees for hotel rooms. But what does that low-price guarantee for hotels actually mean? The answer, as you'll see below, is a little complicated. Best-price guarantees for hotels promise the following:

The price you pay for your hotel room is the lowest available. You won't find a cheaper rate for that hotel room during your preferred travel dates anywhere else.
If you find a lower price for your hotel room after booking, you can get that cheaper rate, a refund in the amount of the difference, or a fixed-guarantee payout.

But how can competing hotel providers all guarantee to have the best price for the same hotel room, you ask? The answer is simple: They all have plenty of "out" built in to their "guarantees" to get around those promises. For example:

Most hotel providers only honor identical "apples to apples" claims (e.g. same-class room for the same travel period, etc.), with absolutely no room for deviation. Maybe you're staying two nights; someone else could be getting a better price for one or three nights.
The refund process for hotel price guarantees is typically lengthy and confusing. You might be able to get a refund for said hotel room, but you'll have to work hard for it.

So, how do you know that you're truly getting the lowest price for your hotel room? By comparing hotel prices across several providers, that's how. Shopping around is the closest there is to a foolproof strategy for booking the best hotel rate. Here are our top tips:

Be as flexible as possible.
Know the destination.
Keep in mind seasonality.
Search, and search often.

Get the Scoop: Here's the Truth About Those 70% Off Sales
Now that we have your attention, are you ready to find out why you should be skeptical of such claims - or any other advertisements like it, for that matter?
First and foremost, those enticing "65% Off!", "70% Off!", and "80% Off!" ads often may refer to "discounts" off the highest-priced car rental during peak times, which may not even apply to your needs. It's difficult to pinpoint the actual value in savings you're getting at any given time. Additionally, those advertised prices might just be the base rates, which don't include taxes, fees, or mileage. 
When comparing your ultimate car rental price, keep in mind the following: 

Daily, weekly, and weekend rates typically vary.
Car rental companies charge fees beyond the time and mileage charges of the rental (e.g., taxes, concession recovery fees, vehicle license recovery fees, and customer facility charges).
Some special offers only apply to specific vehicle categories.
There may be holiday, weekend, or other blackout windows for advertised discounts.
Drivers must meet age and other requirements, which may vary by location.

But don't worry, start your rate comparison by checking out the latest deals through BookingBuddy.com.
Here are some examples we found on July 17, 2017:

Hotwire.com: Location - Orlando, FL, from $8/day

Get the Scoop: Here's the Truth About Those 70% Off Hotel DealsYou may have seen an enticing ad boasting huge discounts on hotel rooms. Though it got your attention, the deal's unlikely to hold up when subject to scrutiny. Here, we detail why:
That discount is likely "subtracted" from the room's rack rate (the highest price for the room on specific days during the peak booking season). Since it's unlikely that you'll ever be charged that price, the discount isn't really a discount at all.
Advertisers also like to add "extras" to the room rate to artificially inflate that "70% off" and sometimes even "80% off" claim. This "value" often includes daily breakfast, internet access, and other surcharge-carrying services in the nightly rate. The discount, therefore, isn't based on just the room but is based on all the related services that might not be of use to you.
Hotel rates are constantly changing. If an event is coming to town, room rates will skyrocket since demand is at a premium. Conversely, if there are extended periods of lower vacancy (hurricane season in the Caribbean, for example), room prices plummet. Attempting to determine the value of a percentage savings from such volatile price points is, at best, an inexact science. 
Here are our top tips for getting the best hotel deals every time: 
Don't only check one site and call it a day. By comparing prices across several providers, major online travel agencies, and your favorite hotel brand's site, you may find that one price point undercuts the rest-or offers a little something extra for the same price.
Go for it, go opaque. You'll see the room class, neighborhood, amenities, price, and reviews before you book, but if you're willing to take a chance with the hotel brand, opaque sites such as our partners Hotwire and Priceline are great ways to save big.
Forget the oranges, only compare apples to apples.  Make sure you're comparing the same offerings across providers. And to ensure you're getting an even better deal, you'll want to compare prices for similar room types at all hotels.
Look for discounts.  Oftentimes, hotels offer additional savings for AAA and AARP members, students, military personnel and their families, teachers, and other groups.
Join a private sale site.  Sign up for a luxury discount-hotels site, such as JetSetter, which offers exclusive, members-only discounts at the finest properties throughout the world.

Always Get Low-Price Guarantees!You may have seen low- or best-price guarantees for hotel rooms on sites such as Hotels.com, Hilton Hotels, and Travelocity, among countless others. But what does that low-price guarantee for hotels actually mean? The answer, as you'll see below, is a little complicated. 
Best-price guarantees for hotels promise the following:
The price you pay for your hotel room is the lowest available. You won't find a cheaper rate for that hotel room during your preferred travel dates anywhere else.
If you find a lower price for your hotel room after booking, you can get that cheaper rate, a refund in the amount of the difference, or a fixed-guarantee payout.
But how can competing hotel providers all guarantee to have the best price for the same hotel room, you ask? The answer is simple: They all have plenty of "out" built in to their "guarantees" to get around those promises.
For example:  
Most hotel providers only honor identical "apples to apples" claims (e.g. same-class room for the same travel period, etc.), with absolutely no room for deviation. Maybe you're staying two nights; someone else could be getting a better price for one or three nights.
The refund process for hotel price guarantees is typically lengthy and confusing. You might be able to get a refund for said hotel room, but you'll have to work hard for it. 
So, how do you know that you're truly getting the lowest price for your hotel room? By comparing hotel prices across several providers, that's how. Shopping around is the closest there is to a foolproof strategy for booking the best hotel rate. Here are our top tips: 

Be as flexible as possible.
Know the destination. 
Keep in mind seasonality. 
Search, and search often.

Compare Prices






























Get the Scoop: Here's the Truth About Those 80% Off Sales
Now that we have your attention, are you ready to find out why you shouldn't believe those overhyped advertisements?
First off, those enticing "65% Off!", "70% Off!", and "80% Off!" ads generally refer to "discounts" off the highest-priced, most-restricted ticket classes (refundable, etc.). What the carriers are really saying is that there are cheaper flights out there than the most expensive tickets. News flash! In most cases, they're providing absolutely no support that any of those discounts exist under any circumstances.
Here's the bottom line: Most leisure travelers never actually buy the costliest, most-restricted tickets. Those are generally picked up by business travelers shopping on the company dime. With low-cost airlines, online travel agents, and flexible date searches all factoring in to your price hunting, it's rare that you'd ever pay the highest possible price anyway. So that 80% off "discount" doesn't apply to any flight you're likely to book.
For the best strategy, search flights from a wide variety of providers. Comparing rates is the only way to ensure you're getting a competitive price. It's the closest thing you've got to a foolproof strategy for booking flights. Here are our top tips:

Most domestic airlines release sales on Tuesdays, with the majority of competitors matching these deals within 24 hours. To take advantage of these airfare sales and have the largest amount of seats to choose from, search for fares on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. Historically, Saturdays have also proved fair prices for domestic travel.
When heading to a destination serviced by multiple airports, be sure to check them all to ensure you're getting the best fare. For example, if you're flying to New York City, search for the major airports (JFK, LaGuardia, and Newark), as well as smaller options (Long Island/Islip and White Plains).
Be flexible with your dates. Searching a range of dates gives you a good ballpark budget for what you can expect to spend on airfare.
Search, then search again. Frequently checking fares for your preferred route over a fixed period of time (e.g., once or twice per day over a week or two) gives you an in-depth, realistic understanding of what your airfare costs should be. Then, when you see a price you think is fair, book with confidence, knowing you've locked in the best fare for your route and budget.

Attempting to determine the value of a percentage savings from such volatile price points is, at best, an inexact science.

Here are our top tips for getting the best hotel deals every time:

Don't only check one site and call it a day. By comparing prices across several providers, major online travel agencies, and your favorite hotel brand's site, you may find that one price point undercuts the rest-or offers a little something extra for the same price.
Go for it, go opaque. You'll see the room class, neighborhood, amenities, price, and reviews before you book, but if you're willing to take a chance with the hotel brand, opaque sites such as our partners Hotwire and Priceline are great ways to save big.
Forget the oranges, only compare apples to apples. Make sure you're comparing the same offerings across providers. And to ensure you're getting an even better deal, you'll want to compare prices for similar room types at all hotels.
Look for discounts. Oftentimes, hotels offer additional savings for AAA and AARP members, students, military personnel and their families, teachers, and other groups.
Join a private sale site. Sign up for a luxury discount-hotels site, such as JetSetter, which offers exclusive, members-only discounts at the finest properties throughout the world.

BookingBuddy allows you to search various partner sites at once so you can compare the prices and options offered. Offers and savings are based on information available on these sites. There is no guarantee that these prices, savings, hotels, or dates will be available at the time of booking. Please check the site for the most recent details. When you book travel, your booking is handled by one of those sites directly, not by BookingBuddy. Transactions, and all subsequent customer care, are directly handled by the site where you booked your travel. BookingBuddy does not control the price, rules, regulations, or restrictions surrounding the price. Please read all rules and regulations before booking.
Always Get Low-Price Guarantees!
You may have seen low- or best-price guarantees for hotel rooms. But what does that low-price guarantee for hotels actually mean? The answer, as you'll see below, is a little complicated. Best-price guarantees for hotels promise the following:

The price you pay for your hotel room is the lowest available. You won't find a cheaper rate for that hotel room during your preferred travel dates anywhere else.
If you find a lower price for your hotel room after booking, you can get that cheaper rate, a refund in the amount of the difference, or a fixed-guarantee payout.

But how can competing hotel providers all guarantee to have the best price for the same hotel room, you ask? The answer is simple: They all have plenty of "out" built in to their "guarantees" to get around those promises. For example:

Most hotel providers only honor identical "apples to apples" claims (e.g. same-class room for the same travel period, etc.), with absolutely no room for deviation. Maybe you're staying two nights; someone else could be getting a better price for one or three nights.
The refund process for hotel price guarantees is typically lengthy and confusing. You might be able to get a refund for said hotel room, but you'll have to work hard for it.

So, how do you know that you're truly getting the lowest price for your hotel room? By comparing hotel prices across several providers, that's how. Shopping around is the closest there is to a foolproof strategy for booking the best hotel rate. Here are our top tips:

Be as flexible as possible.
Know the destination.
Keep in mind seasonality.
Search, and search often.

Get the Scoop: Here's the Truth About Those 70% Off Sales
Now that we have your attention, are you ready to find out why you should be skeptical of such claims - or any other advertisements like it, for that matter?
First and foremost, those enticing "65% Off!", "70% Off!", and "80% Off!" ads often may refer to "discounts" off the highest-priced car rental during peak times, which may not even apply to your needs. It's difficult to pinpoint the actual value in savings you're getting at any given time. Additionally, those advertised prices might just be the base rates, which don't include taxes, fees, or mileage. 
When comparing your ultimate car rental price, keep in mind the following: 

Daily, weekly, and weekend rates typically vary.
Car rental companies charge fees beyond the time and mileage charges of the rental (e.g., taxes, concession recovery fees, vehicle license recovery fees, and customer facility charges).
Some special offers only apply to specific vehicle categories.
There may be holiday, weekend, or other blackout windows for advertised discounts.
Drivers must meet age and other requirements, which may vary by location.

But don't worry, start your rate comparison by checking out the latest deals through BookingBuddy.com.

The New York Times Apparel Collection by Altru Apparel




 
THE NEW YORK TIMES. “The Gray Lady” has been publishing in New York City since Sept. 18, 1851. With 119 Pulitzer Prizes and a history of providing the American citizenry with the information needed to keep a country free and informed. Along with The NYT participation in protecting the rights of Americans to freely express themselves, they have created a logo that is widely considered to be one of the greatest and most influential logotypes in the history of graphic design. The logo was designed by master American typographer Ed Benquiat in the late 60’s, who also designed the logos for Playboy, Esquire and Sports Illustrated. The designs we have produced in our partnership with The Times have remained true to the classic design and importance of this historic entity.

Myspace Tom, millions of peoples 1st friend.

When the new information age was dawning on humanity,  Tom was there to greet you and be your friend.


 Myspace founder Tom Anderson's profile photo has been seen a lot. No kidding, there is a strong argument that his photo has been viewed by more people than have seen the Mona Lisa Hanging in the Louvre. THE VERGE ﻿﻿has done the analytical work and posted their results in "The enduring portrait of Myspace Tom, the Mona Lisa of profile pictures."
 You can see more of the exclusive release at Urban Outfitters.

Mason McFee Interview
Collaboration and questions with Mason McFee
 
Mason McFee is an artist and graphic designer behind Hello Maseman. There is no shortage of art styles and mediums that have captured his interests but the raw hand-sewn patchworks he has crafted lately became the focus of our collaboration. His early experiences are rooted in a DIY attitude in a small town in Texas mixed with growing up with educators gave him the freedom and opportunity to develop a unique tension between the constraints of a professional graphic designer and an artistic spirit that is anything but constrained. Altru had the opportunity interview him as part of our ongoing Artist Collaboration Projects.
Below is our interview with Mason McFee and some of his art on apparel produced by Altru Apparel
 
A. Hi Mason. How’s it going and can you tell us a little about yourself?
M.M. It’s going great. I’m an artist from Austin, Texas. I dabble in all sorts of artwork from zines to paintings to murals and whatever captures my interest.
 
A. Looking back through your art, you’ve worked with many different mediums. From collage to geometric shapes, zines to the patchworks we are involved with in our collaboration. They all seem to have a kind of natural organic feel. How do you go about doing that?
M.M. Well, I guess I’ve been a doodler and drawer my whole life. It’s just something I love to do. A lot of the organic nature in my work comes from growing up in Boerne, a small Hill Country town in Texas, outside of San Antonio. My parents were both educators when I was growing up, so they encouraged a lot of exploration while I was a kid. I grew up on ten acres and we did all kinds of things around the property including working on cars, building with wood, making forts and tree houses, going fishing in the creek and generally being outdoors. I enjoyed the experience of growing up outside of the city limits where we had a little more freedom to do what we wanted.
 
A. So you had access and were able to get your hands on different equipment for practical reasons and also to build and create?
M.M. Yeah, we’d do whatever you know? My pops showed us how to use power tools and bits about electronics. I did a lot of creating in my parents garage, making artwork with all the stuff my dad had laying around the place. I enjoyed learning new things. That’s sort of how the sewing thing came into play lately. I was interested in making patches, so I was screen printing my own onto fabric. My little sister showed me how to use the sewing machine to sew the edges. I ended up teaching myself to do embroidery after I saw how easy it was to use. Sewing is this weird combination of skills, similar to using a band saw and sort of like welding, but with fabric. I kinda enjoy that.
 
A. What other mediums are you interested in?
M.M. Right now I’ve been excited about getting back into making sculptures and installations. Also, I’m doing some collaborations with my new project, Elmer Gomer. This will be where I’m going to start selling my patches and artworks, but it’s also more of an avenue to sell stuff my artwork. I’m not going to just leave it to patches and hats and shirts and stuff, but start doing collaborative artworks again with friends on projects.
 
 A. I saw that you and your wife had collaborated and made over 25 zines. How is it working with your wife and do you often collaborate together?
M.M. We collaborate on lots of stuff. The zine project we worked together on was called Crummy House. We lived in this run down house in South Austin that inspired the name. We’d invite artists over to collaborate on zines that we’d scrap together on our kitchen table. That was a project that became useful for meeting other artists and allowing us to do our own thing when we both had full time jobs. It ended up being a really great experience at a time when we were both creatively drained.
So, Jessica Clark is my wife and is a graphic designer in Austin, as well. Art + Math is her graphic design company. We do all sorts of stuff together right now. We finally moved out of the Crummy House and into a house over in East Austin where we now live. We enjoy hanging around the house with our two cats and having friends over. Jess is a graphic  designer for a vegan cupcake company here in Austin. She does her own thing and I do mine. Having an artist and designer as a spouse inspires me to create each day. We’re going to collaborate on a project with Elmer Gomer very soon, so stay tuned for that.
 
A. You had been an art director at an advertising agency. How was that?
M.M. It was a good experience. I graduated college then jumped right into working with someone who was a graphic designer and ended up starting his own agency. I worked with him for seven years. It taught me how to take a project all the way to completion. It helped with learning how to work with people in a professional environment. When you work with someone else on a project, there are lots of steps making sure they are stoked on what they get at the end. Also, you know, learning about processes I needed to do when it comes to (ha) billing and invoicing and making sure you are getting paid. The business world is a tricky one and I’m definitely still learning.
 
A. If you had to choose a different career, what comes to mind?
M.M. I’d probably want to do something outdoors. I wouldn’t mind being a park ranger at a national park. Something out doors for sure. I was actually a tour guide as a summer job for a while at a cavern outside of Boerne. I enjoy the outdoors for sure, being out in nature.
 
A. Any artists or graphic designer favorites?
M.M. I was very inspired by Maya Hayuk growing up. I actually got to meet her and she’s kind of a rock star artist that I look up to. She does very large outdoor paintings, murals. I really like her brilliance when it comes to color and her positive energy. Her work is very bright and psychedelic and I like that she is constantly reinventing her work.
 
A. You said you once had a a chance to meet her. Tell us about that.
M.M. When I was still in school I used to do these mini-zines and send them out to people in the art world that I admired. I basically would find their email and ask them if they wanted to trade art packages. She was one of the people that responded back. We ended up trading stuff, like mix tapes, CDs and stuff in the early days. She was just one of those artists that really encouraged you and was engaging as a person. So, a week after I met Jessica, I was so in love I followed her on a trip to New York. Well, I thought I’d reach out to Maya and she invited us to an Anthony Lister art show and ended up getting to check out her studio, too. So that was pretty big, especially in my early years just getting started. She was inspiring for sure.
Oh, also in Austin I have a huge family of rad artist friends. I’d try and list them all here, but the list would seriously be way too long for this interview. They are all very inspiring to me for sure.
 
A. Do you get to travel?
M.M. I do get to travel, but not as often as I’d like. I’m heading out to the West Coast soon. Hopefully a Japan trip and maybe Sweden in the coming years. I’ve got my patches over in a little shop in Tokyo called LECHOPPE. They came to my studio in Austin and bought pretty much every patch I had in my studio. I’m excited to show off a new collatoration with them of 13 Wrangler shirts and jackets. They’ll be done pretty soon and for sale this Winter.
 
A. Final Question... Glitter, Yea or Nay?
M.M. Yea! (Ha)
Thanks Mason!

Sterling Bartlett Interview
Collaboration and questions with Sterling Bartlett

A. Hey Sterling How’s it Going?
S.B. Pretty Good.A. So Can you tell us little bit about yourself?
S.B. Yeah, I’m an artist living in Los Angeles, California. I've lived and worked here for about 10 years. I do a lot of illustration, design, and I have a painting practice.
A. Describe a day in the life of Sterling.
S.B. I generally get up about 8 o’clock, take the dog on a hike in the morning. Come back, fix myself some breakfast and get the house in order. I’ll generally work from about 10/11 am to about 6/7 pm. I desperately try to keep it Monday through Friday. That generally doesn’t happen, but if I don’t keep banker hours I’ll go crazy, I’ll work until 3 in the morning so I try keeping it pretty steady. My time is split 50/50 between my painting practice and my design/illustration work.
 
A. Where did you grow up?
S.B. I was Born in Dumas Texas, which is way up in the panhandle by Oklahoma. I was raised and went to school in San Angelo, which is in west Texas. My dad was in the military so we moved around a lot. I ended up living in Phoenix, Arizona after high School for quite a while. I just had to get the hell out of there, so I eventually moved to LA.
 
A. When did you first get into the art scene and designing.
S.B. I have been doing design and illustration professionally for about 10 years. I have exclusively been doing freelance work for about 6 years.
 
A. What was your first job?
S.B. That’s hard to remember, but I think the first job that mattered to me was working for KR3W Denim with a guy name Angel, who I met through a friend.
 
A. I know of Angel, he is a maniac!
S.B. He’s great... I love that guy.
 
A. Are you in touch with him?
S.B. I haven’t seen him in a while, but he actually put this (band-aid) tattoo on me, hahaha.

A. How long were you at KR3W Denim?
S.B. I just worked for them freelance. We met through a mutual friend and I did some work for him off and on. I worked a lot with skate, surf and that sort of stuff afterward and it just kind of expanded from there.
 
A. Have you been doing art shows the whole time or did the focus shift to that later on?
S.B. I used to do a lot of art exhibitions. That kind of took a back seat for a while, but it’s become a much bigger focus for me lately.
 
A. Why is that?S.B. There is a fulfillment that comes from working in design and illustration that is fantastic, but you know it's just something else when you can come up with an image in your head and (snaps) someone immediately feels compelled to own it. - it’s just a different beast.
 
A. How do you come up with ideas and inspiration?S.B. Well, that’s tough. Speaking to my illustrations, they incorporate text and humorous sayings. That just stems from reading frankly. For the paintings it’s a little bit different. They are much more based on my environment (Los Angeles), the cityscape and the people. That’s a more direct documentation of the things I see.
 
A. I see on your desk you’re reading the Steve Martin autobiography. Are you a fan of Stand-up? What other comedians do you like?S.B. I love, love standup comedy. I love the form so much. Off the top of my head I’d list... Richard Prior, and George Carlin. Let’s see, the newer comics, there are so many, it’s so huge right now. There’s Kate Berlant who I think is amazing, Kyle Mooney, Hannibal Buress I love. Louie C.K. I’ve seen a couple times, he’s fantastic. I’m all over the place, I’m just a big fan.A. Is the imagery you see around LA a large part of what you are doing now?
S.B. Basically, yeah. For so long I’d been working with text and I wanted to move away from that and just be completely visual. So these images are predominantly me walking around, just out walking the dog or taking a hike then stopping and taking photos of something I feel is emblematic of the city.
 
A. You have gone through a few phases where your focus is on a particular technique. What prompts you to make a change?
S.B. I think exploration is a pretty good way of putting it. You know, I worked in graphite, making these kind of verbal asides with visual accompaniment for so long that I felt like I’d just gotten to the end of that phase of my work. It felt like I did whatever it was I was going to be able to do there. So the medium I’m working in now, (monoprint) allowed me to step away from that and make something totally to the left of it.
 
A. Can you describe the process of monoprinting.
S.B. What I do is a bastardized version of monoprint. I cut a stencil out of paper, let’s say a palm tree for example. I cut the leafy green portion from the top of the tree out. Then on a separate piece of material, whether it’s another piece of paper or glass, I will apply the paint. I then lay that over the stencil and using a brayer or the back of my hand for pressure, print it onto the piece of paper below the stencil. The stencil then gets removed leaving us with the first part of the tree. I repeat the process using different colors until finished.A. What I’ve noticed from your Monoprint pieces is the use of bright colors, which is nearly an exact opposite of what you’d been doing. Bringing out a feeling of a fresher more colorful world than from your graphite only pieces.
S.B. Absolutely. I think that was part of change too, going back to what we were talking about before, boredom is something to look out for. Graphite is just one color, -it’s dark gray. (ha) I did that for about 9 years. So I’m trying to go as far away from that as possible! Another thing is when you’re doing monoprint, if you mix too many colors together during the printing process, the pushing of the pigment through of the paper muddies them. I’m almost forced to use the brightest colors possible in order for them to pop once they’ve been printed onto the surface.
 
A. I would imagine the communication with the viewer is much different from your single color graphite works with text vs the layered monoprint form you are creating now. Is there much difference?
S.B. Absolutely. When I was working with graphite illustrations, it was often an image paired with text. They were basically inside jokes. They were about bringing a certain subset of people together that could understand those jokes in a very specific way. That was a communication between me and a select group of people. The mono-prints, because they are purely visual, are so much more inclusive. A lot more people are on board, if I’m being honest.A. There seems to have been a recent explosion with the zine art form and that culture. What are your thoughts on its beginning and where it is going.
S.B. In the last 5 or 6 years there has been a resurgence of zine culture. It’s moved some away from punk and into the realm of art. There is certainly an overlap there. I myself, along with a group of friends are involved 3 or 4 times a year in a kind of zine club called “Drawing Party LA”. Where we get together with an old Risograph machine and make a limited number of zines, just kind of for ourselves, just to do it.
 
A. What is a “Risograph”?
S.B. Basically, a risograph is a Japanese copy machine that puts out a silk screen type of print rather than a photocopy.
 
A. Looking over some of your collection, do you have a cherished zine?
S.B. From this collection? It’s tough to say. I mean I really like them all, I have a pretty broad zine library. I am proud to say I have Boys Club #1 by Matt Furie, that’s awesome. Adam Villacin and Travis Millard both make a lot of cool zines. Too many more to name.
 
A. Have you produced your own zine that is publicly available?
S.B. I put out a zine for my last art show called Le Banquet Rousseau. It contained a compilation of essays by my friend Christina Martinez about her experience in Los Angeles juxtaposed against my paintings.A. Do you remember any single point when art became a part of your life?
S.B. When I was a kid I just always drew. It was always a part of my day-to-day. I can remember drawing at 3 years old. You know, that 3 years and another 32 years of practice, at some point you know it’s what you want to do.
 
A. Who are some of your favorite artists?
S.B. Oh- that’s so tough. I love Matisse, I just think Matisse is incredible. I love Goya, I think Raymond Pettibone is a hell of a doodler, Mike Kelley, Robert Crumb... So many……..too many to list. I have so many friends that are amazing too. I love Jason Moore's work, Brendon Donnelly, Victor Solomon. I’m very lucky to know some of my favorite artists.
 
A. We got in touch and licensed some of Robert Crumbs work for T-shirts.
S.B. That’s awesome!
 
A. Everybody loved it- all the buyers, and all the graphic design guys and artists... but the public didn’t like it at all.
S.B. That’s awful… that’s too bad.
 
A. They just didn’t want to wear it. His (Robert Crumb's) art isn’t pretty.
S.B. It’s rough and it’s got a lot going on too…
 
A. That’s a big part of his aesthetic.
S.B. Yeah, the ugly and weird city-scapes are great. So detailed.
 
A. Lastly, glitter, yea or nay?
S.B. Absolutely yea (ha!) -gets in everything.
 
A. Thanks Sterling. What are you going to do now?
S.B. I’m going to go grab some lunch            Alright Sterling, thanks and bon appetite!

Luke Pelletier Interview
Collaboration and questions with Luke Pelletier

Luke Pelletier, a recent L.A. transplant from Chicago, has been up to a lot of things apart from our recent collaboration. A solo show at New Image Art LA in August is taking up the majority of his time. He still keeps his other interests active, like pitching ideas for cartoons or practicing, preforming and recording music with a band. This work ethic surely helped get him through his early trouble with school. The down times between occasional expulsions had an on-the-job-training aspect. The time was filled with creating art for promotional fliers and performing music with a band. His encouraging parents, strong work ethic and an intrinsic creativity guided Luke into a career path that included going to SAIC and receiving an arts degree (BFA) in 2015.Below is our interview with Luke Pelletier and some of his art on apparel produced by Altru Apparel,
 


 
A. So as a kid did you draw on your books and papers in school? If so, what kind of stuff?  L.P. I drew a lot, but it was all over the place. I’d copy cartoons. And skate graphics. I Really got into drawing when I started a band. I was doing all the flyer’s, shirts, and album covers.  A. Please describe how your interest in art and creativity was nourished or encouraged? Any group, friend, teacher or family?  L.P. I got in a lot of trouble as a kid. I was in and out of different schools pretty quickly. My parents always supported my art though. I think they always knew I wasn’t going to work a normal job. So even if I would get expelled from a school one week, they would let me practice and play shows with my band the next. They were very supportive.  A. It’s been about a year since you graduated from School of the Art Institute of Chicago (SAIC). Besides the skills and knowledge you gained, what was the greatest influence from that cultural breeding ground? L.P. It’s weird. That school was really hard on me. They’re a conceptual art school. Most of my art is based in aesthetics, but they pushed me to talk about my art the same way they did. So it definitely made me experiment more with how I make work. I’ve been really enjoying being out of school though. California has been amazing.  A. Is your work stream of conscience or ideas thought out and expressed? L.P. Both for sure. I have to plan out a lot of the patterns and compositions because of the math, but I try to always leave room to try new things and goof around. My lyrics are mostly stream of conscience. And I write a lot of those on my paintings.  A. Do you know when a piece is finished or is it hard to stop working on it and adding touches? L.P. I always know if it’s finished. I rarely ever touch a painting after I sign it.  A. Are you having fun? What are you doing for fun? L.P. Yeah! I’ve been a little stressed lately. Mostly because my ambition and scale is getting bigger. And with that, so are my expenses, but I try not to worry to much about money. For fun, I paint, write, do band practice, play shows, record songs, go to the beach, watch TV, sketch, some old same old.  A. Are you a collector of anything? L.P. A ton of stuff! But nothing specific. I collect art, shells, beach glass, dice, matchbooks, trinkets mostly. Just inspiration really!  A. Is there a project you would like to do but haven’t been able to yet? L.P. Tons! But they’re all in the works! I’d love to open a bar, design a stage, do a cartoon, etc.  A. What project are you working on now? L.P. Today, I’m working on a pitch for a cartoon I’ve been working on, but I’m mostly working on my solo show at New Image Art in LA. It’ll open in August!  A. Do you have any use for technology in your creative process? L.P. I email and use Photoshop like everyday!  A. Are you a binge working artist with periods of down time, or do you have a strict work schedule? L.P. I work everyday for the most part. I have to many things to do to have any downtime! haha I started taking Tuesdays off though!Thanks Luke.See more at Luke’s Instagramwww.instagram.com/lukepelletier

Simon Spilsbury Interview
Introducing Simon Spilsbury

Style is more than simply what you like. Its tied to culture, space and time as well as personal preference and on some gut level, instinct. Someone recently caught our eye who fits the Altru style sensibility, the ridiculously funny, talented and prolific Illustrator Simon Spilsbury. His art style is very precise but also sometimes sketchy and it grabs you and shakes you about. It’s like a very talented juvenile delinquent made off with a very expensive fountain pen. He has the classic British touch - loose lines that don’t always connect, an airy light touch then slipping into a bold smear. True talent makes what is very difficult look easy, he’s got that in spades. The result is fun, cool and definitely someone we want to hang around with.
As a way of introduction, here are some samples of his work printed on a fabric medium along with the short interview we did with Simon. CHEERS! 
 
 
 

 
 
A. Who were the people who influenced you?S.S. All the S’s - Steadman, Scarfe, Searle, Steinberg and a few others obviously like Bernie Fuchs, Seymour Chwast, Alan E Cober.
A. What was the first piece of art you remember seeing?S.S. I was in my dad’s life room from the age of four, so all that I saw there really - old-lady impasto and a bit of hippy psychedelia. Not much in the way of big galleries until I was well into my teens but I remember the uber ones like The Mona Lisa, Guernica and Goya’s ‘El Tercero De Mayo'
A. Where do you go to for visual inspiration now?S.S. I don’t have an inspiration routine but my best thinking’s done while walking and I walk a lot - I’m not a fan of being trapped in a vehicle or behind a desk - I don’t even like wearing a hat! Depends where the inspiration’s needed; people is easy, just sit outside a cafe in a city and watch how women hold their handbags and how men smoke - or the other way round preferably. If it’s inspiration for composition, I’ll look at contemporaries who are better designers than me - Noma Bar, Seymour Chwast. Or I’ll leaf through George Grosz and Saul Steinberg books.
A. If you could relocate your studio for a year, where would you go?S.S. It would have to be somewhere in the States, not necessarily NYC, maybe Chicago, LA or somewhere hicky like Oklahoma - I’ve been to Oklahoma a couple of times and it’s got its fair share of weirdos to draw.
A. What is your most indispensable bit of kit?S.S. My collection of Kaweko pens, they sound Japanese but come from Germany and are packaged in a great little tin.
A. If you hadn’t been an illustrator... ?S.S. My mum once said “why don’t you get a job in the Post Office.” That’s when I packed my bags. If I wasn’t a busy illustrator I’d definitely write a bit more but in my dreams I’d be leading people through the jungles in Asia with my jungle mate - who incidentally can kill you with his eyeball.
A. What are you working on right now?S.S. Various wall drawings, a personal project based around celebrity, boosting my retail archive and just about to start an animated TVC for a booze company [that’s all I’m allowed to say]. 
A. How do you unwind at the end of the day?S.S. I don’t really…I annoy the crap out of myself by carrying my sketchbook everywhere and then getting anxious when I haven’t opened it. If I’m in the pub I treat it like a life room. If I’m at a dinner party I draw naked people for laughs. 
A. Do you travel? Do you enjoy travel? When traveling how is your life & creative process effected?S.S. I used to travel a lot as I spent 10 years travel writing for The Sunday Times but currently not travelling huge amounts because the kids have got to get through exams and university but it won’t be much longer. I have just got back from Northern Australia and a desert trek in The Sahara with all my explorer mates so don’t pity me too much.
A. Technology? To embrace, disregard or rebel against it?S.S. Necessary evil. Computer Armageddon would suit me well.
A. What relationship do you have to clothing?S.S. Chuck it on and peel it off. I am partial to T’s though.
