Then they develop an asset allocation, and funds or managers within each asset class, they believe will produce the desired return without exceeding the client’s risk tolerance over the long-term (15 years or more).Federal Street Advisors'' generally recommends that clients invest through separate account managers who manage investments in individual stocks or fixed-income securities; mutual funds including ETFs that invest primarily in such stocks or securities; and/or other pooled funds, including hedge funds and private equity funds. These managers and funds, in turn, invest in individual stocks, debt securities, or other investments.

Family Office




For the family of means, a family office offers many benefits. When structured appropriately and managed well, a family office coordinates the stewardship of assets and the pursuit of philanthropic and personal interests. It also provides the flexibility to pursue strategies that take into account the needs of the individuals, as well as the family as a whole. The family office also plays a critical role in defining and preserving a sense of family values. 
Operating a single family office can be complicated and costly. This is why Hemenway Trust Company offers an alternative, multi-family office platform for clients.
We work with families to assess the many factors involved in making the very personal decision to establish a family office, including size of the asset base and family dynamics. Regardless of which path you take, Hemenway Trust Company, together with Hemenway & Barnes LLP, offers a full range of family office services including:

Wealth Preservation including portfolio investment, fiduciary services, trust administration, oversight of outside managers, performance reporting and review and integrated tax reporting
Wealth Transfer Planning including estate planning and administration, tax planning and return preparation, family gifting/loans, planning for family lands, tangible property and collections, risk management, special needs/disability planning and financial planning
Family Education and Governance including family meetings, wealth education of children, marital agreements, and advice and education regarding aging family members
Philanthropy including foundation management and charitable planning
Legal assistance with residential and commercial real estate, personal litigation and dispute resolution, will contests, tax audit representation, guardianships and conservatorships
Household Management including bill paying, mail, budgeting and cash flow analysis and hiring and managing contractors and household staff.

The range of services we provide depends on the goals and needs of each family and we tailor our services accordingly.

OverviewInvestment ManagementTrust & Fiduciary ServicesTax & Estate PlanningIRAsCharitable PlanningFamily OfficeFinancial Planning 




Investment Management


Our goal is to preserve and grow our clients’ wealth through sound investment management philosophy and best practices. We are committed to a long-term investment approach using a diversified portfolio of holdings that spans asset classes and industry sectors, coupled with sophisticated estate and tax planning.
Our Investment Approach
As a client, you have direct access to your wealth advisor, an experienced professional dedicated to knowing you and your family as well as your financial goals and individual aspirations. Accordingly, we tailor an asset allocation and investment strategy to meet each client's unique requirements, including risk tolerance, investment objectives and financial needs. 
Our investment management process, which combines discipline, critical analysis and common sense, is designed to identify investments that will outperform over the long term.
Core Equity Holdings 
Equity portfolios are intended to preserve and enhance client wealth. We invest directly in common stocks issued by high-quality companies with growing earnings, broad exposure to global markets, reliable dividend growth and strong balance sheets. 
Fixed Income
We view a bond portfolio as a source of liquidity, a dependable source of income and a hedge against economic downturns that negatively affect equity investments. We avoid credit risk and are typically in US Treasury and other federal government obligations. When circumstances warrant, we sometimes include high-quality municipal and corporate bonds.
Alternative Investments 
Beyond stocks and bonds, and where it is warranted, we expand the range of portfolio investments to include other asset classes, including venture capital, commercial real estate, private equity, commodities and hedge funds. Alternative assets provide diversification and, in the case of private equity, have longer investment horizons and a potential for higher returns. 
Outside Investment Advisors
Hemenway Trust Company partners with outside investment advisors and researchers who are experts in their respective asset classes. They share their perspective, research and insight which, in turn, helps inform Hemenway Trust Company’s investment decisions. This third-party perspective serves to validate, clarify and refine our investment approach and ensure the best results for our clients. We are free to make independent judgments, unclouded by conflict because we do not offer proprietary investment vehicles.
