MONTVALE, N.J. and HOUSTON, Jan. 13, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- Ridgewood Energy Corp. ("Ridgewood Energy" or "Ridgewood"), a private upstream oil and gas investment company based in Montvale, New Jersey, and Houston, Texas, has closed its latest private equity fund, Ridgewood Energy Oil and Gas Fund II, L.P. ("Fund II"), with total commitments of $1.1 billion, reaching its hard cap.  The Fund, which had an original target amount of $750 million, has been formed by Ridgewood to invest in exploration and production of oil projects in the U.S. deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico.
Fund II is a continuation of Ridgewood Energy's investment program focused on generating superior risk adjusted returns for investors by drilling and developing high-potential new oil fields.
The Fund's commitments were sourced from 39 institutional investors, including a number of leading state and union pension plans, well-known university endowments and foundations, and a number of Fund of Funds, private wealth managers and family offices.
Kenny Lang, Ridgewood Energy's President, said, "Our focused investment strategy, coupled with disciplined execution, has demonstrated the potential to generate enormous value for our funds' limited partners.  We aim to continue delivering on that strategy for our Fund II LPs."
Fund II has already invested in two oil wells, one of which, the Dantzler Project, was drilled in partnership with Noble Energy Inc. (NYSE:   NBL) and resulted in an oil discovery (see Noble Energy Press Release).
Robert Swanson, Ridgewood's Founder and Chairman said, "We are extremely pleased with the strong reception to our latest private equity fund, which we believe reflects the growing importance sophisticated investors place on focused, value-added investment strategies executed by a specialized team of professionals with deep, industry-specific knowledge."   
Robert Gold, Senior Managing Director of Ridgewood, said, "We particularly appreciated receiving strong support from a diverse set of institutional investors with significant expertise in energy.  Fund II provided these investors with targeted asset-class exposure, along with the potential to deliver true alpha."
Ridgewood's $1.1 billion in commitments secured by Fund II comes in addition to $700 million in capital and commitments Ridgewood currently manages on behalf of Riverstone Holdings, LLC, ("Riverstone") the energy-focused private equity firm, through entities known as ILX Holdings I, LLC and ILX Holdings II, LLC (which are affiliates of Riverstone's two most recent private equity funds).  
Eaton Partners, LLC, based in Rowayton, CT, acted as placement agent for the fund.  Vinson & Elkins LLP, served as fund counsel.

Returns reflect temporary contractual fee waivers and/or expense reimbursements. Had the ETF incurred all expenses and fees, investment returns would have been reduced. Investment returns and ETF share values will fluctuate so that investors' shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. ETF returns assume that dividends and capital gains distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at NAV.The "Net Asset Value" (NAV) of a VanEck Vectors Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) is determined at the close of each business day, and represents the dollar value of one share of the fund; it is calculated by taking the total assets of the fund, subtracting total liabilities, and dividing by the total number of shares outstanding. The NAV is not necessarily the same as the ETF 's intraday trading value. VanEck Vectors ETF investors should not expect to buy or sell shares at NAV.

Exhibit 14

 

September 2009

Code of Ethics for Ridgewood
Energy Corporation

 


 


As a registered
investment adviser, Ridgewood Energy Corporation (“Ridgewood
Energy”)  is required to adopt a Code of Ethics
pursuant to Rule 204A-1 (the “Rule”)of the Investment
Advisers Act of 1940 (“Advisers Act”).  This
Code of Ethics, together with The Ridgewood Companies Code of
Ethics (attached as Exhibit A), will serve as Ridgewood
Energy’s Code of Ethics (“Code”) for purposes of
the Rule.


 







I.



Statement of
General Policy






 


 Ridgewood Energy and its employees owe a
fiduciary duty to their clients.  A fiduciary is a person
or entity that acts in certain matters on behalf of another person
or entity.  Fiduciaries are held to a higher standard of
care when managing the affairs of others and must act with
integrity, skill, care and diligence.  A fiduciary must
disclose conflicts of interest with its clients or, in some cases,
avoid such conflicts entirely. A fiduciary’s duties also
require it to treat clients fairly and not to favor one client over
another.  Accordingly, at all times Ridgewood Energy and
its employees must avoid activities, interests and relationships
that run contrary (or appear to run contrary) to the best interests
of their clients.  The Code sets forth specific standards
for Ridgewood Energy and its employees when fulfilling Ridgewood
Energy’s fiduciary responsibilities.


 


All employees are also required to read,
understand and comply at all times with the Code, including The
Ridgewood Companies Code of Ethics (Exhibit A), which contains
standards of business conduct that Ridgewood Energy and its
affiliates require of their employees such as: (i) the expectation
that all employees perform their duties in an honest and ethical
manner; (ii) the requirement that employees ensure that all
disclosures in reports and documents are complete, fair, accurate,
timely and understandable; and (iii) the requirement that no
employee retaliate against any other employee who provides
information in good faith to any of the affiliated Ridgewood
Companies, law enforcement officials or regulatory agencies
concerning a possible violation of law or regulation (see the
Ridgewood Companies Internal Reporting Procedures).


 


While the Code cannot anticipate every situation
in which personal interests may be in conflict with the interests
of Ridgewood Energy’s clients, all employees are expected to
be responsive to the spirit and intent of the Code as well as its
specific provisions.  The Chief Compliance Officer
(“CCO”) and the Legal Department are responsible for
enforcement of the Code. All persons subject to the Code are
required to report any violations of the Code of which they become
aware to the CCO.  When any doubt exists regarding any
Code provision or whether a conflict of interest might exist with
regard to an Advisory Client (see definition below), you should
discuss the transaction beforehand with the CCO.


 


Each employee of Ridgewood Energy will be
required to sign the Code of Ethics Acknowledgement Form
acknowledging that he/she has received, read and understands the
contents of the Code.

defined herein have the same meanings ascribed to them in either
the Advisers Act, the 1933 Act or the Securities Exchange Act of
1934.

 

III.           Standards
of Conduct

 







 




A.




All Supervised
Persons have a fiduciary duty to:







 







 




1.




Always place
the interests of the Advisory Clients first and not take
inappropriate advantage of their positions;







 







 




2.




Ensure that all
personal securities transactions and other activities are conducted
consistent with the Code and in such a manner as to avoid any
actual or potential conflict of interest or any abuse of a
Supervised Person’s position of trust and responsibility (see
Section D below for more on Conflicts of Interests);







 







 




3.




Not engage in
any act, practice, or course of business which results in the
distribution to unauthorized persons of material nonpublic
information of public companies learned in the course of business
which is confidential, pursuant to the requirements established by
the “Insider Trading Policy”.  Although Access
Persons are most likely to come in contact with material nonpublic
information, the prohibition on insider trading and potential
sanctions applies to all Supervised Persons.







 



 



 





 




 

Code of Ethics for Ridgewood
Energy Corporation

 Page 4

 September 2009

 







 




4.




Ensure that
independence is maintained in the investment decision-making
process.







 







 




B.




Supervised
Persons must comply with all applicable federal securities laws,
which includes the Advisers Act, 1933 Act, the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, Title V of the
Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, any rules adopted by the SEC under any of
these statutes, the Bank Secrecy Act to the extent it applies to
funds and investment advisers, and any rules adopted thereunder by
the SEC or the Department of the Treasury (collectively,
“Federal Securities Laws”).







 







 




C.




In connection
with the purchase or sale, directly or indirectly, of securities
held or to be acquired by an Advisory Client, Supervised Persons
are not permitted to:







 







 




1.




Employ any
device, scheme or artifice to defraud an Advisory
Client;







 







 




2.




Mislead an
Advisory Client, including by making any untrue statement of a
material fact or by making a statement that omits material
facts;







 







 




3.




Engage in any
act, practice, or course of business that operates or would operate
as a fraud or deceit upon an Advisory Client;







 







 




4.




Engage in any
manipulative practice with respect to an Advisory Client;
or







 







 




5.




Engage in any
manipulative practice with respect to securities including price
manipulation.







 







 




D.




Conflicts of
Interest among Advisory Clients may arise where an Adviser or its
Supervised Persons have reason to favor the interests of one
Advisory Client over another Advisory Client ( e.g. , funds
with a larger number of investors versus funds with fewer
investors; funds in which employees of an Adviser have made
material personal investments versus those
without).   Inappropriate favoritism of one Advisory
Client over another Advisory Client would constitute a breach of
fiduciary duty.







 







 




E.




The standards
set forth in Sections A-D above, govern all conduct whether or not
the conduct is also covered by more specific provisions of the
Code.  Supervised Persons are encouraged to raise any
questions concerning the Code with the CCO.  The CCO is
ultimately responsible for administering, monitoring and reviewing
such procedures to ensure that they are accomplishing their stated
goal.







 







IV.



Restrictions
on Personal Securities Transactions -- Access
Persons






 







 




A.



Access Persons
shall not purchase or sell, directly or indirectly, any Covered
Security in which she or he has, any direct or indirect Beneficial
Ownership and which at the time of such purchase or
sale:






 


 







 




1.



Is a publicly
traded exploration and production oil and gas company that has
substantial activities in the Gulf of Mexico or a publicly traded
drilling or pipeline company that has substantial activities in the
Gulf of Mexico.  If you are not sure whether a particular
security falls within this category, please consult with the CCO
before entering an order for the Purchase or Sale of a
Security.

Product Description
Item Id:  Warner01
Case Name:  Warner, Curtis L & Karen L
Case Number:  12 32988
Trustee: 
 Starting Minimum Bid: $9,995
Description:  Estate’s interest in 1 share in Ridgewood Energy X Fund, LLC.  The share percentage represents 0.00209643% in the Energy X Fund.  The fund owns a working interest in some oil and gas leases.   
Ridgewood Energy is a private equity firm focused on investments in the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico. With more than two decades of experience investing in Gulf of Mexico oil and gas projects, Ridgewood Energy has earned its reputation as a reliable, professional, value-adding project partner to many leading energy companies. Ridgewood Energy applies a highly-disciplined evaluation process across a broad range of opportunities, and selects only those projects that meet the firm’s high standards for investment. Ridgewood participates in annual Federal offshore lease sales alongside industry partners. Ridgewood also acquires leasehold interests and participate in projects that exhibit compelling prospectivity.   
 As of May 2016, the Trustee is receiving monthly payments averaging approximately $253.00 in payment royalties as a result of their original investment in Energy X Fund.  The payment stream documentation is linked below under ‘Payment History’  This equates to just over $3,000 annually for the past 12 months.
Upon completion of the auction, a stock transfer assignment will be provided to the winning bidder.  That new assignment must be submitted to Ridgewood Energy under the provisions of their document on the Energy X Fund (Article 9, Section 9.4) which permits ownership transfer due to bankruptcy filing by the share owner(s)     
Location Info  Ridgewood Energy is headquartered in Montvale, New Jersey, outside of Newark. The SEC prohibits foreign investors from owning any interest.  Ridgewood states potential buyers must meet specific financial criteria as required by the SEC (a minimum of $2,000,000 net worth excluding the value of a primary residence).      
Payout History: 
Distribution History ReportRevised Payments to Trustee from RE
Ridgewood Fund LLC Agreement
Notes:  A closing cost fee of $200 will apply. This is all we know about this item. Any fees/liens owing on this item are not part of the final bid price.  A bid submitted by a buyer is an agreement to our Terms. Buyers should not bid unless they fully intend to complete the sale in accordance with our Terms (to view terms, click “Terms” tab in Seller Store header at top of ad).  
Bidders should familiarize themselves with BKAssets.com policy regarding ‘Proxy Bidding’ (see ‘Bidding Guide’ on www.bkassets.com Home Screen). BKAssets is not responsible for connectivity issues, or Internet transmission times, when submitting an auction bid near the close of auction. The auction process does not extend past the set close time of the auction and bidders are solely responsible for the timing and receipt of their bids if they elect not to utilize Proxy bidding.
Title and Escrow:  The stock transfer will be an assignment of the stock certificates which must be submitted by the winning bidder to Ridgewood Energy.  Please note above under ‘Description’ related to Ridgewood qualifications for ownership. Because this is a US Bankruptcy Court ordered, as is, where is, sale, BKAssets.com is not permitted to use an escrow company, or provide any warranties or guarantee, implied or stated.   
Legal Info: By Order of the United States Bankruptcy Court, Bkassets.com sells this and any other property “AS IS, WHERE IS”, with no warranties implied or stated. This means that the Seller and the trustee are not responsible for problems (if any) with the title, the condition of the stock, or any liens or encumbrances against the unit or Ridgewood Energy. The buyer will be entirely responsible for this stock after the sale including but not limited to: paying any fees/costs associated with this stock, paying all fees/liens (if any), recording/transferring the assignment and gathering any paperwork/documentation necessary for that process. Seller and trustee are NOT realtors or stock investors. BKAssets and the trustee shall be under no obligation to buyer except to provide buyer with a Bill of Sale, death certificate, and the stock certificates. All the information as to the item description has been provided by the management company, trustee and Relief Mine website. BKAssets cannot guarantee that all the information is accurate. BKAssets recommends all bidders perform their own due diligence prior to bidding. As with any bankruptcy sale, this sale may be subject to court approval. 
Payment Info: $U.S. Money order, certified check, cashier’s check. Bkassets may also accept “Bill Pay” from Citibank, Chase, Wells Fargo, Bank of America, a local regional bank or credit union.  If you would like to use “Bill Pay,” but do not bank at one of these establishments, please call BKAssets prior to sending payment.
A closing cost fee of $200 (payable to seller) will apply. Full payment must be received within (7) days of winning bid. Any bidder who does not complete the sale within 7 days from the close of auction will be considered in default. Seller has the right to proceed with the next highest bidder. 
Shipping Info:  Shipping is free to all buyers in the United States. International bidders are welcome, please contact Bkassets for shipping costs to countries other than the United States prior to bidding. Shipping costs to locations outside of the US will be calculated at the close of auction. Please be advised that because this is a US Bankruptcy Court Ordered sale, and subject to approval, shipping can take an average of 3-6 weeks.  
Liens:  We do not know of any other liens.
 Bidding Guide: Please review the bkassets.com bidding guide for terms of auction  prior to placing a bid or making an offer..

Strategy & Benefits

Key Benefits
You know that TRADING is different than investing. But the opportunity to take advantage of short-term trends is only won, if you get the direction right.
Whether you’re a bull or a bear, Direxion is with you. Our leveraged ETFs are powerful tools built to help you:

Magnify your short-term perspective with daily 3X leverage
Go where there’s opportunity, with bull and bear funds for both sides of the trade; and
Stay agile – with liquidity to trade through rapidly changing markets

Leveraged and inverse ETFs pursue daily leveraged investment objectives which means they are riskier than alternatives which do not use leverage. They seek daily goals and should not be expected to track the underlying index over periods longer than one day. They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by investors who understand leverage risk and who actively manage their investments.







Target Index

The S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production Select Industry Index (SPSIOPTR) is provided by Standard & Poor’s Index Provider and includes domestic companies from the oil and gas exploration and production sub-industry. The Index is designed to measure the performance of a sub-industry or group of sub-industries determined based on the Global Industry Classification Standards (GICS). One cannot directly invest in an index.

* The Net Expense Ratio includes management fees, other operating expenses and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses. If Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses were excluded, the Net Expense Ratio would be 0.95%.  The Funds’ Adviser, Rafferty Asset Management, LLC (“Rafferty”) has entered into an Operating Expense Limitation Agreement with each Fund, under which Rafferty has contractually agreed to cap all or a portion of its management fee and/or reimburse each Fund for Other Expenses through September 1, 2018, to the extent that the Fund’s Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses exceed 0.95% of the Fund’s daily net assets other than the following:  taxes, swap financing and related costs, acquired fund fees and expenses, dividends or interest on short positions, other interest expenses, brokerage commissions and extraordinary expenses. If these expenses were included, the expense ratio would be higher.
The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.

You know that TRADING is different than investing. But the opportunity to take advantage of short-term trends is only won, if you get the direction right.
Whether you’re a bull or a bear, Direxion is with you. Our leveraged ETFs are powerful tools built to help you:

Magnify your short-term perspective with daily 3X leverage
Go where there’s opportunity, with bull and bear funds for both sides of the trade; and
Stay agile – with liquidity to trade through rapidly changing markets

Leveraged and inverse ETFs pursue daily leveraged investment objectives which means they are riskier than alternatives which do not use leverage. They seek daily goals and should not be expected to track the underlying index over periods longer than one day. They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by investors who understand leverage risk and who actively manage their investments.







Target Index

The Energy Select Sector Index (IXETR) is provided by S&P Dow Jones Indices and includes domestic companies from the energy sector which includes the following industries: oil, gas and consumable fuels; and energy equipment and services.  One cannot directly invest in an index.

* The Net Expense Ratio includes management fees, other operating expenses and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses. If Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses were excluded, the Net Expense Ratio would be 0.95%.  The Funds’ Adviser, Rafferty Asset Management, LLC (“Rafferty”) has entered into an Operating Expense Limitation Agreement with each Fund, under which Rafferty has contractually agreed to cap all or a portion of its management fee and/or reimburse each Fund for Other Expenses through September 1, 2018, to the extent that the Fund’s Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses exceed 0.95% of the Fund’s daily net assets other than the following:  taxes, swap financing and related costs, acquired fund fees and expenses, dividends or interest on short positions, other interest expenses, brokerage commissions and extraordinary expenses. If these expenses were included, the expense ratio would be higher.
The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.

  NOTES
TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Organization
and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies




 

Organization

The
Ridgewood Energy X Fund, LLC (the “Fund”), a Delaware
limited liability company, was formed on August 30, 2007 and
operates pursuant to a limited liability company agreement (the
“LLC Agreement”) dated as of January 2, 2008 by and
among Ridgewood Energy Corporation (the “Manager”) and
the shareholders of the Fund, which addresses matters such as the
authority and voting rights of the Manager and shareholders,
capitalization, transferability of membership interests,
participation in costs and revenues, distribution of assets and
dissolution and winding up.  The Fund was organized to
primarily acquire interests in oil and gas properties located in
the United States offshore waters of Texas, Louisiana and Alabama
in the Gulf of Mexico.

 

The
Manager has direct and exclusive control over the management of the
Fund’s operations.  With respect to project investments,
the Manager locates potential projects, conducts due diligence, and
negotiates and completes the transactions.  The Manager
performs, or arranges for the performance of, the management,
advisory and administrative services required for Fund
operations.  Such services include, without limitation, the
administration of shareholder accounts, shareholder relations and
the preparation, review and dissemination of tax and other
financial information.  In addition, the Manager provides
office space, equipment and facilities and other services necessary
for Fund operations.  The Manager also engages and manages the
contractual relations with unaffiliated custodians, depositories,
accountants, attorneys, broker-dealers, corporate fiduciaries,
insurers, banks and others as required. See Notes 2 and
3.

 

Basis of
Presentation

These
unaudited interim condensed financial statements have been prepared
by the Fund’s management in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America
(“GAAP”) and in the opinion of management, contain all
adjustments (consisting of only normal recurring adjustments)
necessary to present fairly the Fund’s financial position,
results of operations and cash flows for the periods
presented.  Certain information and note disclosures normally
included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with
GAAP have been omitted in these unaudited interim condensed
financial statements.  The results of operations, financial
position, and cash flows for the periods presented herein are not
necessarily indicative of future financial results.  These
unaudited interim condensed financial statements should be read in
conjunction with the Fund’s December 31, 2015 financial
statements and notes thereto included in the Fund’s Annual
Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (“SEC”).  The year-end condensed
balance sheet data was derived from audited financial statements
for the year ended December 31, 2015, but does not include all
disclosures required by GAAP.

 

Use of
Estimates

The
preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during
the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, the Manager reviews its
estimates, including those related to the fair value of financial
instruments, depletion and amortization, determination of proved
reserves, impairment of long-lived assets and asset retirement
obligations. Actual results may differ from those
estimates.

 

Fair Value
Measurements

The fair
value measurement guidance provides a hierarchy that prioritizes
and defines the types of inputs used to measure fair value. The
fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to Level 1 inputs,
which consists of unadjusted quoted prices for identical
instruments in active markets. Level 2 inputs consist of quoted
prices for similar instruments.  Level 3 inputs are
unobservable inputs and include situations where there is little,
if any, market activity for the instrument; hence, these inputs
have the lowest priority.

 

Cash and
Cash Equivalents

All highly
liquid investments with maturities, when purchased, of three months
or less, are considered cash equivalents.  These balances, as
well as cash on hand, are included in “Cash and cash
equivalents” on the balance sheet. As of September 30, 2016,
the Fund had no cash equivalents. At times, deposits may be in
excess of federally insured limits, which are $250 thousand per
insured financial institution.  As of September 30, 2016, the
Fund’s bank balances were maintained in uninsured bank
accounts at Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.

Salvage
Fund

The Fund
deposits in a separate interest-bearing account, or salvage fund,
cash to provide for the dismantling and removal of production
platforms and facilities and plugging and abandoning its wells at
the end of their useful lives in accordance with applicable federal
and state laws and regulations. Interest earned on the account will
become part of the salvage fund. There are no restrictions on
withdrawals from the salvage fund.

 

Investment
in Delta House

The Fund
has investments in Delta House Oil and Gas Lateral, LLC and Delta
House FPS, LLC (collectively “Delta House”), legal
entities that own interests in a deepwater floating production
system operated by LLOG Exploration Company.  The Fund
accounts for its investment in Delta House using the cost method of
accounting for investments as it does not have the ability to
exercise significant influence over such investment.  Under
the cost method, the Fund recognizes an investment in the equity of
an investee at cost.   The Fund recognizes as income
dividends received that are distributed from net accumulated
earnings of the investee since the date of acquisition by the
Fund.  Dividends received in excess of earnings subsequent to
the date of investment are considered a return of investment and
are recorded as reductions of cost of the investment.  The
Fund reviews its cost method investment for impairment at each
reporting period and when an event or change in circumstances has
occurred that may have significant adverse effect on the fair value
of the investment. Losses on cost method investments including
impairments that are deemed to be other than temporary are
classified as non-operating losses in the Fund’s statements
of operations.

 

As of
September 30, 2016, the Fund invested a total of $0.6 million in
Delta House and has received and recorded dividends totaling $0.3
million. During third quarter 2016, the Fund received an offer from
a third party for the purchase of a portion of its investment in
Delta House for $0.3 million in cash. The transaction closed
pursuant to a unit purchase agreement with D-Day Offshore Holdings,
LLC dated October 31, 2016. Certain other funds managed by the
Manager were also parties to the agreement. The Fund adjusted the
carrying value of its investment in Delta House as of September 30,
2016 to fair value, which was determined based on the third party
offer and recorded a loss on investment for the quarter ended
September 30, 2016. Such adjustment amounting to $0.1 million was
included on the Fund’s statement of operations within
“Loss on investment in Delta House”. Inputs used to
estimate fair value of the investment in Delta House are
categorized as level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.  After the
sale the Fund will have received cash from its investment in Delta
House totaling $0.6 million, of which $0.3 million relates to cash
proceeds from the sale and $0.3 million relates to dividends, and
will have a remaining carrying value for the investment in Delta
House of $0.1 million.

 

Oil and
Gas Properties

The Fund
invests in oil and gas properties, which are operated by
unaffiliated entities that are responsible for drilling,
administering and producing activities pursuant to the terms of the
applicable operating agreements with working interest owners. The
Fund’s portion of exploration, drilling, operating and
capital equipment expenditures is billed by operators.

 

Exploration,
development and acquisition costs are accounted for using the
successful efforts method. Costs of acquiring unproved and proved
oil and natural gas leasehold acreage, including lease bonuses,
brokers’ fees and other related costs are capitalized. Costs
of drilling and equipping productive wells and related production
facilities are capitalized.  The costs of exploratory wells
are capitalized pending determination of whether proved reserves
have been found.  If proved commercial reserves are not found,
exploratory well costs are expensed as dry-hole costs.  At
times, the Fund receives adjustments to certain wells from their
respective operators upon review and audit of the wells’
costs.  Annual lease rentals and exploration expenses are
expensed as incurred.  All costs related to production
activity, transportation expense and workover efforts are expensed
as incurred.

 

Once a
well has been determined to be fully depleted or upon the sale,
retirement or abandonment of a property, the cost and related
accumulated depletion and amortization, if any, is eliminated from
the property accounts, and the resultant gain or loss is
recognized.

 

As of
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, amounts recorded in due
to operators totaling $37 thousand related to capital expenditures
for oil and gas properties.

 

Advances
to Operators for Working Interests and
Expenditures

The Fund
may be required to advance its share of the estimated succeeding
month’s expenditures to the operator for its oil and gas
properties. As the costs are incurred, the advances are
reclassified to proved properties.

Table of
Contents

 

Asset
Retirement Obligations

For oil
and gas properties, there are obligations to perform removal and
remediation activities when the properties are retired. Upon the
determination of a property to be either proved or dry, a
retirement obligation is incurred. The Fund recognizes the fair
value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the
period incurred.  Plug and abandonment costs associated with
unsuccessful projects are expensed as dry-hole costs.  As
indicated above, the Fund maintains a salvage fund to provide for
the funding of asset retirement obligations.

 

Syndication
Costs

Syndication
costs are direct costs incurred by the Fund in connection with the
offering of the Fund’s shares, including professional fees,
selling expenses and administrative costs payable to the Manager,
an affiliate of the Manager and unaffiliated broker-dealers, which
are reflected on the Fund’s balance sheet as a reduction of
shareholders’ capital.

 

Revenue
Recognition and Imbalances

Oil and
gas revenues are recognized when oil and gas is sold to a purchaser
at a fixed or determinable price, when delivery has occurred and
title has transferred, and collectability of the revenue is
reasonably assured.  The Fund uses the sales method of
accounting for gas production imbalances.  The volumes of gas
sold may differ from the volumes to which the Fund is entitled
based on its interests in the properties.  These differences
create imbalances that are recognized as a liability only when the
properties’ estimated remaining reserves net to the Fund will
not be sufficient to enable the underproduced owner to recoup its
entitled share through production.  The Fund’s recorded
liability, if any, would be reflected in other liabilities. 
No receivables are recorded for those wells where the Fund has
taken less than its share of production.

 

Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets

The Fund
reviews the carrying value of its oil and gas properties annually
and when management determines that events and circumstances
indicate that the recorded carrying value of properties may not be
recoverable.  Impairments are determined by comparing
estimated future net undiscounted cash flows to the carrying value
at the time of the review.  If the carrying value exceeds the
estimated future net undiscounted cash flows, the carrying value of
the asset is written down to fair value, which is determined using
estimated future net discounted cash flows from the asset. 
The fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are
sensitive to change.  Different pricing assumptions, reserve
estimates or discount rates could result in a different calculated
impairment.  Given the volatility of oil and natural gas
prices, it is reasonably possible that the Fund’s estimate of
discounted future net cash flows from proved oil and natural gas
reserves could change in the near term.

 

Significant
declines in oil and natural gas prices since fourth quarter 2014
have impacted the fair value of the Fund’s oil and gas
properties. If oil and natural gas prices continue to decline, even
if only for a short period of time, it is possible that impairments
of oil and gas properties will occur.

 

Depletion
and Amortization

Depletion
and amortization of the cost of proved oil and gas properties are
calculated using the units-of-production method.  Proved
developed reserves are used as the base for depleting capitalized
costs associated with successful exploratory well costs,
development costs and related facilities. The sum of proved
developed and proved undeveloped reserves is used as the base for
depleting or amortizing leasehold acquisition costs.  During
the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Fund recorded $0.4
million of depletion expense related to adjustments to asset
retirement obligations for fully depleted properties.

 

Income
Taxes

No
provision is made for income taxes in the financial
statements.  The Fund is a limited liability company, and as
such, the Fund’s income or loss is passed through and
included in the tax returns of the Fund’s shareholders. 
The Fund files U.S. Federal and State tax returns and the 2013
through 2015 tax returns remain open for examination by tax
authorities.

 

Income and
Expense Allocation

Profits
and losses are allocated to shareholders and the Manager in
accordance with the LLC Agreement.

 

Distributions

Distributions
to shareholders are allocated in proportion to the number of shares
held.  The Manager determines whether available cash from
operations, as defined in the LLC Agreement, will be distributed.
Such distributions are allocated 85% to the shareholders and 15% to
the Manager, as required by the LLC Agreement.

Available
cash from dispositions, as defined in the LLC Agreement, will be
paid 99% to shareholders and 1% to the Manager until the
shareholders have received total distributions equal to their
capital contributions.  After shareholders have received
distributions equal to their capital contributions, 85% of
available cash from dispositions will be distributed to
shareholders and 15% to the Manager.

 

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements

In January
2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”)
issued accounting guidance that requires, among other things,
companies to measure investments in other entities, except those
accounted for under the equity method, at fair value and recognize
any changes in fair value in net income unless an election is made
to record the investment at cost, less impairment and plus or minus
subsequent adjustments for observable price changes with change in
basis reported in current earnings. This pronouncement is effective
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim
periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption not
permitted. The Fund is currently evaluating the impact of this
guidance on its financial statements.

 

In 2014,
the FASB issued accounting guidance on revenue recognition, which
provides for a single five-step model to be applied to all revenue
contracts with customers. In 2015, the FASB issued a deferral of
the effective date of the guidance to 2018, with early adoption
permitted in 2017. In May 2016, the FASB issued final amendments
which provided narrow scope improvements and practical expedients
related to the implementation of the guidance. The Fund is
currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on its financial
statements.

Related
Parties




 

Pursuant
to the terms of the LLC Agreement, the Manager renders management,
administrative and advisory services to the Fund.  For such
services, the Manager is entitled to an annual management fee,
payable monthly, of 2.5% of total capital contributions, net of
cumulative dry-hole and related well costs incurred by the
Fund.  In addition, pursuant to the terms of the LLC
Agreement, the Manager is also permitted to waive the management
fee at its own discretion. Such fee may be temporarily waived to
accommodate the Fund’s short-term capital commitments.
Management fees during each of the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $0.3 million and $0.8 million,
respectively.

 

The
Manager is entitled to receive a 15% interest in cash distributions
from operations made by the Fund. Distributions paid to the Manager
during each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016
were $0.1 million. Distributions paid to the Manager during the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 were $7 thousand and
$0.1 million, respectively.

 

None of
the amounts paid to the Manager have been derived as a result of
arm’s length negotiations.

 

In
February 2015, Delta House Sales & Transport, LLC (“Delta
House S&T”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Manager,
was formed to act as an aggregator to and as an accommodation for
the Fund and other funds managed by the Manager (the
“Ridgewood Delta House Funds”) to facilitate the
transportation and sale of oil and gas produced from the Diller and
Marmalard projects. On April 11, 2016, the Ridgewood Delta
House Funds entered into a master agreement (the
“Agreement”) with Delta House S&T in which Delta
House S&T will purchase from Ridgewood Delta House Funds all of
their interests in oil and gas produced at the Diller and Marmalard
projects and sell such volumes to unrelated third party
purchasers. Delta House S&T is a pass-through entity such
that it receives no benefit or compensation for the services
provided under the Agreement or under any other agreements it
enters into with regards to the oil and gas acquired from the
Ridgewood Delta House Funds.   The Ridgewood Delta House Funds
indemnify, defend and hold harmless Delta House S&T from and
against all claims, liabilities, losses, causes of action, costs
and expenses asserted against as a result of or arising from any
act or omission, breach and claims for losses or damages arising
out of Delta House S&T’s dealing with third parties with
respect to the transportation, processing or sale of oil and gas
from the Diller and Marmalard projects. The revenues from the sale
of oil and gas to third party purchasers are recorded as oil and
gas revenue in the statements of operations and expenses are
recorded as operating expenses in the statements of
operations.

 

At times,
short-term payables and receivables, which do not bear interest,
arise from transactions with affiliates in the ordinary course of
business.

 

The Fund
has working interest ownership in certain projects to acquire and
develop oil and natural gas projects with other entities that are
likewise managed by the Manager.

Commitments and Contingencies

 

Capital
Commitments

The Fund
has entered into multiple agreements for the acquisition, drilling
and development of its oil and gas properties. The estimated
capital expenditures associated with these agreements vary
depending on the stage of development on a property-by-property
basis.

 

As of
September 30, 2016, the Fund’s estimated capital commitments
related to its oil and gas properties were $7.1 million (which
include asset retirement obligations for the Fund’s projects
of $3.8 million), of which $1.8 million is expected to be spent
during the next twelve months.

 

Based upon
its current cash position and its current reserve estimates, the
Fund expects cash flow from operations to be sufficient to cover
its commitments, as well as ongoing operations. Reserve estimates
are projections based on engineering data that cannot be measured
with precision, require substantial judgment, and are subject to
frequent revision.

 

Environmental
Considerations

The
exploration for and development of oil and natural gas involves the
extraction, production and transportation of materials which, under
certain conditions, can be hazardous or cause environmental
pollution problems.  The Manager and operators of the
Fund’s properties are continually taking action they believe
appropriate to satisfy applicable federal, state and local
environmental regulations and do not currently anticipate that
compliance with federal, state and local environmental regulations
will have a material adverse effect upon capital expenditures,
results of operations or the competitive position of the Fund in
the oil and gas industry.  However, due to the significant
public and governmental interest in environmental matters related
to those activities, the Manager cannot predict the effects of
possible future legislation, rule changes, or governmental or
private claims.  As of September 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015, there were no known environmental contingencies that required
adjustment to, or disclosure in, the Fund’s financial
statements.

 

During the
past several years, the United States Congress, as well as certain
regulatory agencies with jurisdiction over the Fund’s
business, have considered or proposed legislation or regulation
relating to the upstream oil and gas industry both onshore and
offshore.  If any such proposals were to be enacted or adopted
they could potentially materially impact the Fund’s
operations.  It is not possible at this time to predict
whether such legislation or regulation, if proposed, will be
adopted as initially written, if at all, or how legislation or new
regulation that may be adopted would impact the Fund’s
business. Any such future laws and regulations could result in
increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions,
which could have a material adverse effect on the Fund’s
operating results and cash flows.

 

Insurance
Coverage

The Fund
is subject to all risks inherent in the exploration for and
development of oil and natural gas. Insurance coverage as is
customary for entities engaged in similar operations is maintained,
but losses may occur from uninsurable risks or amounts in excess of
existing insurance coverage.  The occurrence of an event that
is not insured or not fully insured could have a material adverse
impact upon earnings and financial position.  Moreover,
insurance is obtained as a package covering all of the funds
managed by the Manager.  Claims made by other funds managed by
the Manager can reduce or eliminate insurance for the
Fund.
