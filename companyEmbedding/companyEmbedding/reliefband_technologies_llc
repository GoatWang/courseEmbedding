Neurowave Medical Technologies™ Launches ReliefBand® Voyager: The #1 
      Trusted Name to Treat Motion Sickness




The Safe, Drug-Free, and Clinically Proven FDA Cleared Transdermal 
      Neuromodulation Medical Device used for the Treatment of Motion Sickness.






October 07, 2013 08:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time



CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Neurowave Medical Technologies™ (NMT) will launch the OTC version of 
      its popular ReliefBand® Voyager, an innovative and highly efficacious 
      Transdermal Neuromodulation Medical Device used to treat people 
      suffering from Motion Sickness, at the 2013 Cruise Shipping Asia 
      Trade Conference. ReliefBand® is the #1 brand trusted by 
      millions of people to relieve their symptoms, allowing them to take 
      control of motion sickness, and travel with confidence.



      Motion Sickness affects up to 33% of the population with 7.5% of these 
      sufferers experiencing severe and debilitating symptoms. Motion Sickness 
      is the #1 reason that prevents people from participating and enjoying 
      activities like boating, cruising, plane rides, or traveling.
    

      For many people, medications not only have limited efficacy but can also 
      cause significant side effects. In addition, most of the common 
      medications are contraindicated for use with alcohol or use with motor 
      vehicles thus preventing participants from further enjoying their 
      activities. The ReliefBand® Voyager medical device relieves the 
      suffering from Motion Sickness; without the negative side effects of 
      medications.
    

      The ReliefBand® Voyager is a non-drug treatment that uses NMT’s 
      proprietary transdermal neuromodulation technology platform to 
      positively modulate neural pathways using proprietary programmed 
      electrical pulses to treat Motion Sickness. It is the only solution that 
      is safe and clinically proven to be effective before or after symptoms 
      start. The ReliefBand® Voyager begins working within minutes of 
      activation rather than hours as seen with commonly used medications. The 
      ReliefBand® Voyager provides the added benefit of being controlled by 
      the user; sufferers can simply turn the device on/off as needed and get 
      immediate relief. Now everyone has the power to take control of their 
      symptoms without worrying about the negative side effects, or 
      limitations associated with medications.
    

      In a clinical study performed to test the effectiveness of the 
      ReliefBand® for passengers suffering from Motion Sickness during a 
      cruise, results showed a significant reduction in the severity of Motion 
      Sickness over the course of the cruise. Also, the passengers’ ability to 
      eat, drink, and participate in activities went from 14% to 83% after 
      using the ReliefBand®. By the end of the cruise, over 90% of the 
      passengers who received a ReliefBand® were using it continuously, 
      resulting in increased passenger satisfaction and increased spending by 
      these passengers while on cruise.
    

      “ReliefBand® is a recognized and trusted brand in the treatment of 
      motion sickness,” said Farhan Hussain, CEO of Neurowave Medical 
      Technologies. “As the only FDA cleared transdermal neuromodulation 
      medical device in the market, people no longer have to take medications 
      or limit their activities out of fear of when motion sickness may affect 
      them. ReliefBand® allows motion sickness sufferers to take control and 
      to get the relief they need when they need it most, and without the side 
      effects of medications. Up to this point, many people suffering from 
      motion sickness simply avoid travel or any activities that cause 
      symptoms. When they do travel, they have had to take numerous pills in 
      anticipation of when they think they may get sick or before they board a 
      plane/boat/train or car. With ReliefBand® and its fast onset of relief, 
      people can relieve symptoms only when they need it, thus eliminating the 
      need to premedicate or overmedicate.”
    

      The ReliefBand® Voyager is available as an over-the-counter medical 
      device through Neurowave Medical Technologies or one of its distributors.

Counting The Costs Of CINV
Nausea & Vomiting may result in prolonged hospitalizations, an inability to continue usual activities, depression, the need for additional support, and a greater impact on health care costs. A review of 12 published studies1 found that the direct cost of care was higher for patients who did not receive adequate prophylaxis for CINV. Indirect costs related to lost work hours were also higher for patients with uncontrolled CINV. Another study examined 178 patients receiving highly or moderately emetogenic chemotherapy for their first chemotherapy course.2 Higher direct and indirect health care costs and lower Functional Living Index—Emesis (FLIE) scores for quality of life were seen in patients who failed CINV prophylaxis. A study of 19,139 patients in the Premier Perspective database who received prophylaxis to, all of. In those with uncontrolled CINV, the overall mean additional costs were $5,299 per episode.3





Mode Of Action
Reliefband Technologies’ advanced, wearable neuromodulation devices generate sophisticated programmed transdermal pulses with a highly-specific waveform, frequency, and amplitude to stimulate the median nerve on the underside of the wrist.
These precise transdermal pulses generate signals within the median nerve that travel via the peripheralnervous system to the central nervous system’s higher emetic control center in the brainstem. These signals positively modulate various natural neural pathways involved in regulating emesis via the vagus nerve to restore normal gastric rhythms.




See How It Works >





A proprietary pulse is generated from the underside of the device that stimulates the median nerve.




The generated signals travel to the body’s central nervous system and the higher emetic center of the brain.4




The signals modulate the neural pathways between the brain and the stomach, via the vagus nerve, restoring normal gastric rhythm and relieving nausea.5,6





Direction For Use





1 Area

Find the starting area on the wrist. Using either wrist, the correct area is in between the two tendons on the underside of the wrist – two finger widths from the first (proximal) crease at the wrist.





2 Apply

Clean the area first. Apply a small drop of gel and spread in a circle about the size of a large coin with an even sheen





3 Adjust & Activate

Place the device over the gelled area and fasten device snugly. Press the power button to turn on the device. Starting at power level 1, increase stimulation until tingling is felt in palm and middle finger at a comfortable level. Press the power button for 3 seconds to turn off.





Highly Effective,
Clinically Proven
Rapid Onset Of Action
The onset of action and symptom relief begins within minutes of activation – can be used preventively or even after symptoms appear.
Drug Free
Free from the unwanted side effects or potential drug ? drug interactions associated with antiemetic drugs
Patient?Controlled Therapy
Patients can easily activate and adjust the level of stimulation, depending on the intensity of their symptoms.

How Reliefband Works
Reliefband is an FDA cleared wearable that uses clinically proven technology called neuromodulation to treat morning sickness. The technology was developed for use in hospitals and uses the body’s own natural neural pathways to “turn off” nausea.
Watch our 60 second video and see exactly how Reliefband works without drugs and without delay.

How To Use Reliefband






The Reliefband® delivers gentle pulses to the median nerve at the P6 presure point  located on the underside of the wrist.
These pulses signal the “nausea control center” of the brain.1
There the signals modulate the neural pathways between the brain and the stomach, via the vagus nerve, restoring normal gastric rhythm and relieving nausea.2, 3
