Biography[edit]
He was born at Oswego, New York. He first exhibited at the National Academy of Design in 1876, and was made an associate in 1885 and a full academician two years later. He became a member of the Society of American Artists (1901) and of the American Watercolor Society. At first influenced by Wyant and Inness, after 1900 he attacked the modern problems of light and air, thus combining the old and new theories of landscape painting. His chief characteristics are extreme refinement and charm, poetic sentiment, and beauty of surface.[1] His composition is simple and his rendering of soil unique. A past master of values, he preferred the quiet and subdued aspects of nature. He received numerous awards, including a gold medal at Charleston (1902) and the Inness medal in 1910.

                           In verse, a grandmother tells her granddaughter about the day two men came to buy her "antique" furniture, which she thinks
                              of as "a heap of rubbidge." She sells the lot for fifty dollars, only to discover that her granddaughter has bought just one
                              of the items, a her table, for fifty dollars from a New York antique dealer. She then realizes how much the old things mean
                              to her compared with their value to the men who have cheated her of her money and her memories

                           The Jay T. Last Collection of Printing and Publishing: Louis Prang Archive contains over 3,600 items dating from 1858 to 1916,
                              with the bulk of the items spanning from 1860 to 1897. This archive chronicles the business history of Boston lithographer
                              Louis Prang through art prints, advertisements, printed volumes, and promotional ephemera produced by L. Prang & Co. and its
                              successor companies: Prang Educational Company and Taber Prang Art Co. The archive also contains catalogs, certificates, price
                              lists, business records and correspondence, personal letters and photographs, news clippings, and original art considered
                              for lithographic reproduction. The collection provides a resource for studying the business and output of one of the most
                              influential major lithographic firms in the United States in the 19th century. The images provide information about American
                              tastes and culture as well as the evolution of advertising strategies in the 19th and early 20th centuries. As graphic materials,
                              the prints offer evidence of developing techniques and trends in printmaking, and of the artists, lithographers, printers,
                              and publishers involved in the creative process

                              The records of Milch Gallery document the business transactions of the corporation and the professional and personal relationships

                                 1911 and 1980. Unfortunately, early correspondence is sparse. In a letter responding to a 1951 request for historical information,
                                 Milch replied: "Several years ago [1947] we had to give up our gallery at 108 West 57th Street, and move to smaller quarters
                                 here. Since we had no room for old records, we had to destroy most of them."
