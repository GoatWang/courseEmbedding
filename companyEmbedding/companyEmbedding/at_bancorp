HARP Refinance

Lower your interest rate and monthly mortgage payment.
Save money and your home by lowering your interest rate.

Find out if you're eligible for a Home Affordable Refinance.



Our Complaint ProcessIf you have a complaint about your loan regarding, or related to, our loss mitigation foreclosure alternatives process or our foreclosure process, please direct your complaint, along with the name of each borrower and the loan number, to U.S. Bank Home Mortgage, 17500 Rockside Road, Bedford, OH 44146, attention: Escalation Center.



Determine Your Repayment Options OnlineTo build a repayment plan that's right for you, please log in to your U.S. Bank Home Mortgage Account.

To talk to a loan counselor about delinquent payments:               

Call Default Counseling at 800.365.7900.




For free or low-cost general advice about buying a home, renting, default or avoiding foreclosure:               

Contact a housing counselor at the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) at 800-569-4287.






Options for Retaining Your HomeWe offer several options to help you retain your home. To determine which might best suit your needs, please review the following:
Repayment Plan
A repayment plan allows you to pay your regular monthly payment plus additional funds applied to past-due amounts. Payments are distributed over an agreed-upon period of time.
This option may work for you if:

You can afford your regular monthly payments and other expenses.
You have surplus funds at the end of the month.

Hardship Loan Modification
This option allows you to roll interest and escrow shortage from delinquent payments into the existing loan. You may qualify for an interest-rate reduction to have the term of the loan extended.
This option may work for you if:

You can afford your regular monthly payment or a slight increase in your payment, plus other monthly expenses.
You don't have substantial funds left at the end of the month.

Partial Claim
With a Partial Claim option, funds are advanced to bring your mortgage current. A second lien is held on your property in the amount of the advance. You will have to sign a Promissory Note, which means your delinquent payments are due and payable at the termination of your first mortgage. Your account is immediately brought current upon approval of Partial Claim (also called Second Lien Advance).
This option may work for you if:

You have an FHA-insured loan or a loan for which U.S. Bank is the investor.
You can afford your regularly monthly mortgage payment and other monthly expenses.
You don't have additional funds left at the end of the month.
You can't afford a slight increase in payment.




Options Regarding Selling Your HomeIf you face the possibility of selling your home, ask yourself the following before starting the process:

Are you prepared to sell your home?
Are you unable to recover from a situation that caused you to fall behind on your mortgage payments?
Are you unable to afford your regular monthly payment and have no means to catch up on delinquent payments?

If you decide to sell your home, consider the following options.
Short Sale
In a short sale, the lender agrees to discount the loan balance due to hardship. The home is sold but proceeds fall short of the balance owed.
This option may work for you if:

You can't afford your regular monthly payment and expenses.
You are interested in selling your home, which is worth less than you owe.

Deed in Lieu of Foreclosure
This option allows you to deed your home back to your lender or investor instead of facing foreclosure.
This option may work for you if:

You can't afford your regular monthly payment or a slight increase in your payment, plus other monthly expenses.
You don't have substantial funds left at the end of the month.

Overdraft Protection
Because nobody's perfect.





















It’s happened to all of us: A small budget miscalculation or oversight that resulted in an unexpected shortage of funds.
That’s why having Overdraft Protection is convenient. It covers transactions that exceed the balance in your checking account, giving you peace of mind and eliminating the inconvenience of a rejected check, debit card or ATM transaction.
Step 1: Choose your backup accounts
With Overdraft Protection, you can link up to three eligible accounts to your checking account.1  Then, if you overdraw your checking account, funds from the linked accounts will be transferred automatically to cover your negative checking balance.
Eligible U.S. Bank accounts include:

Savings and money market2
Credit cards3
Reserve Line of Credit (overdraft protection line of credit)3
Premier Line of Credit3
Home Equity Line of Credit3


You can also choose the order in which your accounts are linked for Overdraft Protection. This allows you to pull money from a savings account before transferring funds from an account that charges interest.
Step 2: Set up Overdraft Protection
Once you've decided which accounts you want your Overdraft Protection transfers to come from, you're ready to set up Overdraft Protection. To do this, simply:

Log in to Online Banking or Mobile Banking, then go to your checking account and click the Overdraft Protection link.
Call us at 800-872-2657 (800-US BANKS).
Talk to a banker at any U.S. Bank branch.

How Overdraft Protection works
Once you link your accounts, funds will automatically be transferred from the linked Overdraft Protection account as follows:

If the negative available balance in your checking account is $5.01 or more, funds will be transferred in multiples of $50, and the Overdraft Protection transfer fee will be charged.
If your negative available balance is $5.00 or less, the transfer amount will be $5.00, and the Overdraft Protection transfer fee will be waived.

If the account linked for Overdraft Protection doesn’t have sufficient funds to cover the overdraft:

The available balance in the linked account will be transferred to reduce the overdrawn amount.
If there’s another account linked to your checking account, funds will be transferred from that account in multiples of $50 to cover the remaining negative balance.

For example, let’s say your checking account balance is $42 and the available checking balance in the linked account is $1,000. If you write a check for $125, this would overdraw your checking account by $83. We would transfer $100 from your primary account linked for overdraft protection, which includes enough to cover your negative balance and your Overdraft Protection transfer fee.
Overdraft Protection transfer fees (and how to avoid them)
Linking your account for Overdraft Protection is free. However, every day an Overdraft Protection transfer is made, an Overdraft Protection transfer fee will be charged to the checking account that received the transfer. For most U.S. Bank checking accounts, this fee is more than $12.50.
Ways to reduce or avoid overdraft protection transfer fees:

Set up account alerts and receive email or text messages when your balance is low or when payments are due.
Monitor your account and transfer funds into your checking account on your own before an overdraft occurs.
Switch to a different type of checking account. Gold Checking customers pay $7.50 for Overdraft Protection transfers, and Platinum Checking customers pay no Overdraft Protection transfer fee. To switch to a different account, Call us at 800-872-2657 (800-US BANKS), or talk to a banker at any U.S. Bank branch.

Standard overdraft coverage vs. Overdraft Protection
Standard overdraft coverage pays some types of overdrafts. U.S. Bank will authorize and pay overdrafts for these types of transactions at our discretion:

Checks and other transactions that use your checking account number
Automatic bill payments
Recurring debit card transactions (for example, when you pay a monthly gym fee automatically with your U.S. Bank Visa® Debit Card)

We will not authorize and pay overdrafts for these types of transactions unless you say "yes" to ATM and Debit Card Overdraft Coverage:

ATM transactions
Everyday debit card transactions (purchases made with your debit card on day-to-day basis)

Each overdraft item we pay on your behalf will be subject to "Overdraft Paid" fees.
Overdraft Protection pays all types of overdrafts. Funds are automatically transferred from the account or accounts you link (a savings account, for example) to cover your negative checking account balance, saving you from uncertainty and overdraft fees.

Banks and credit unions can provide a safe and convenient way to accumulate savings—and some banks offer services that can help you manage your money.
Deposits at banks and most credit unions are federally insured up to a limit set by Congress. And transaction (or checking) accounts and deposit accounts offer liquidity, making it easy for you to get to your funds for any reason—from day-to-day expenses to a down payment or money for unexpected emergencies. In addition to being insured by the FDIC, checking accounts let you transfer money by check or electronic payment to a person or organization that you designate as payee.
But remember, the interest you earn from bank products—including certificates of deposit (CDs)—tends to be lower than potential returns from other investments.
Types of Accounts








 



Savings Accounts 

These insured deposit accounts, which pay interest, give you the flexibility to make as many deposits as you like, whenever you like. They tend to have more withdrawal restrictions than checking accounts and higher minimum deposits.
 




 



Money Market Accounts 

Money market accounts also are deposit accounts, giving you the safety, convenience and liquidity of a savings account, plus a slightly higher interest rate. They typically have limited check writing privileges.
 




 



Certificates of Deposit (CDs) 

CDs offer predictable returns at higher interest rates than savings accounts. The tradeoff is that cannot withdraw your money without penalty for a set period of time. Most CDs are insured.
 




 



Federal Insurance 

The money you put in a bank account is insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), an independent agency of the U.S. government.

About Us 
American Trust has been a community pillar since 1911. It has grown to strengthen the products, services, and financial management provided to clients while retaining the integrity and commitment that can only be found through a community bank. After three generations of growth, ATBancorp (originally incorporated as Amtrust, Inc.) was formed in 1985 to serve as the bank holding company for American Trust & Savings Bank. Today ATBancorp is a three-bank holding company for American Trust and American Bank & Trust, Wisconsin. Headquartered in Dubuque, IA, ATBancorp is a banking organization with assets in excess of $900 million serving nine communities through seventeen banking facilities in Eastern and Central Iowa and Southwest Wisconsin.
In 1998, ATBancorp acquired the Cuba City State Bank in Cuba City and Hazel Green, WI. ATBancorp announced the expansion of services in Wisconsin with a new office in Lancaster in 2001. All three Wisconsin offices were united under the new name of American Bank & Trust, WI. The year 2002 brought added growth with an office in Fennimore, WI. In July 2006, American Bank’s newest office opened in Platteville, WI.
ATBancorp extended its footprint into other banking markets as well. In March 2003, the company became a significant investor in a new state-chartered bank formed in San Mateo, California. State chartered United American Bank (UAB) was formed in 2003 and is a community bank specializing in commercial and private banking services. The bank grew quickly, and by 2007 UAB had grown to four California banking offices in San Mateo, Sunnyvale, Half Moon Bay, and Redwood City. In October of 2011, ATBancorp and United American Bank announced the completion of ATBancorp’s initial $10.0 million investment in UAB’s capital stock. In July of 2012, United American Bank announced a successful stock offering, raising $1.618 in additional capital.
The Financial Management Group (FMG) division of American Trust continues to be a key strategic unit of the bank. With assets under management exceeding $2.1 billion, it is one of the largest independent Iowa-based operations in trust and related services. FMG offers clients wealth management, retirement, investment, and brokerage services. In January 2005, FMG began to offer wealth management services to United American Bank clients in California through its affiliation with ATBancorp.
In 2006, a new ATBancorp subsidiary was formed to serve as a Registered Investment Advisory (RIA) company in the FMG division. ATCapital Management provides strategic growth models and additional investment alternatives.
Throughout the years, ATBancorp has developed a strong reputation for providing outstanding service to its clients and strongly supporting its local communities. ATBancorp is proud of this tradition and looks forward to serving its clients and communities in the future.

Important information about our rate tables 

The rate information above is obtained by Bankrate from the listed institutions. Bankrate cannot guaranty the accuracy or availability of any rates shown above. Institutions may have different rates on their own websites than those posted on Bankrate.com.
All rates are subject to change without notice and may vary branch to branch. These quotes are from banks, thrifts, and credit unions, some of whom have paid for a link to their own Web site where you can find additional information. Those with a paid link are our Advertisers. Those without a paid link are listings we obtain to improve the consumer shopping experience and are not Advertisers. To receive the Bankrate.com rate from an Advertiser, please identify yourself as a Bankrate customer. Bank and thrift deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Credit union deposits are insured by the National Credit Union Administration.
Consumer Satisfaction: Bankrate attempts to verify the accuracy and availability of its Advertisers' terms through its quality assurance process and requires Advertisers to agree to our Terms and Conditions and to adhere to our Quality Control Program. If you believe that you have received an inaccurate quote or are otherwise not satisfied with the services provided to you by the institution you choose, please click here.
