About Nevro Corp. (NYSE:NVRO)
Nevro Corp. is a global medical device company. The Company focuses on providing products that improve the quality of life of patients suffering from chronic pain. The Company has developed and commercialized the Senza spinal cord stimulation (SCS) system, an evidence-based neuromodulation platform for the treatment of chronic pain. Its HF10 therapy is designed to deliver neuromodulation solutions for treating chronic pain. HF10 therapy enables patients to achieve sustained pain relief without paresthesia, thus enabling its patients to avoid the uncomfortable shocking or jolting sensations commonly associated with paresthesia. HF10 therapy relies on consistent anatomical lead placement. As of December 31, 2016, it was investigating the use of HF10 therapy to address additional indications, such as chronic upper limb and neck pain, painful neuropathies and non-surgical refractory back pain. The Senza system is approved to create electrical impulses from 2 hertz (Hz) to 10,000 Hz.

What are analysts saying about Nevro Corp. stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Nevro Corp. stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "Nevro Corp. is a medical device company. It engages in developing and commercializing a neuromodulation platform for the treatment of chronic pain. The Company provides pain relief to the customers suffering from low back pain and types of chronic pains. Nevro has developed and commercialized the Senza (R) spinal cord stimulation (SCS) system for the treatment of chronic pain. Senza, HF10, Nevro and the Nevro logo are trademarks of the company. Nevro Corp. is headquartered in Menlo Park, California.   " (6/3/2017)
2. Northland Securities analysts commented, "The widely awaited release of Boston Scientific's ACCELERATE Study data on the Q4 call today, was a downer. Strangely enough, the company stated on its call that it "would continue enrolling patients in the trial, expects enrollment to finish by end of FY17, and data release by mid-2018." Suffice it to say, the anti-climax will be perceived as something being off in the ACCELERATE Study, hence being positive for Nevro."The analyst speculated that something is off in the ACCELERATE study, causing a delay in datarelease. Here are some thoughts / questions:Is Boston Sci increasing the sample size in the trial ?Was there a sub-group analysis done and investigators realized that the bellcurve on lead placements was not on T8 - T10 locations, hence pain relief was sub-optimal? Will there now be more anatomical placement on T8 - T10 with its HF arm? In essence, is Boston Sci converging on Nevro's "secret sauce" (2/2/2017)

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Nevro Corp. (NYSE:NVRO) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 1 Hold Rating, 8 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Buy (Score: 2.89)Consensus Price Target: $103.89 (20.34% upside)
