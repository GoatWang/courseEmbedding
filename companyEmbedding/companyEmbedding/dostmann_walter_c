Walter H Dostmann's Experience
Title: Director
               Company: New Germany Fund Inc
Job Details
               The New Germany Fund, Inc. is a non-diversified, closed-end investment company seeking capital appreciation primarily through investment in the Mittelstand - an important group of small and mid-cap German companies. The Fund may invest up to 35% of its assets in large cap German companies, and up to 20% in other Western European companies. Its shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "GF". The Fund is managed and advised by members of the Deutsche Bank Group.  The Fund is non-diversified and can take larger positions in fewer companies, increasing its overall risk profile. Investments in securities of foreign issuers present greater risks including currency fluctuations and changes in political/economic conditions. Foreign securities markets generally exhibit greater price volatility and less liquid than the US markets.

History of products








Foundation 1964


Inspired by the Six thermometer invented by James Six in 1782, the very first TFA product was a maximum-minimum thermometer which was patented by Heinz Dostmann. Production began in Kreuzwertheim in 1964.










as from 1965


In the 1960s, simple household and commercial thermometers were added to the product portfolio, which was further expanded in the 1970s to include barometers, hygrometers and compasses. Many TFA products have gone on to become genuine classics and continue to be produced today in a virtually unchanged format.










as from 1975


 
With its multiple patents and product ideas, TFA qualified as a weather specialist. In 1977, a patent was registered for a high-precision synthetic hair hygrometer. In 1982, TFA launched the Galileo Galilei thermometer – this glass cylinder with its coloured bubbles would become a cult object in the 1980s and 1990s. 










as from 1985


In the mid-1980s, the first electronic weather instruments were introduced to the market and impressed with their precision and easy-to-read digital display. TFA took the bold step and began production of digital thermometers at the site in Reicholzheim.










as from 1995


TFA’s innovative radio controlled thermometers with wireless transmission of temperature readings have become bestsellers. Intelligent forecasting systems further improve the accuracy of weather forecasts. The first digital window thermometers were designed and well received on the market.










as from 2005


TFA developed WETTERdirekt technology in 2007 (only for Germany): Professional forecasts are transmitted directly to the station multiple times a day using radio and satellite technology. In 2012, the stations were further developed to incorporate official weather warnings. 










Prospects 2015 


With a great flair for forward-thinking weather-related products, we want to continue to be a pacesetter in the market, rooted in 50 years of tradition and success at TFA Dostmann GmbH & Co. KG.
