About Us














 


OUR CORE PRINCIPLES

 


KDI Capital Partners’ name comes from its three core operating principles: Knowledge, Discipline, and Integrity. Below we highlight some of the key tenets of each of these founding beliefs.

 



Knowledge
 

Invest in business models and companies where the investment team has considerable experience and coverage.
Employ proprietary Leveraged Buyout (LBO) valuation model to assist in forecasting and comprehensive financial statement review.
Confer with industry experts to enhance due diligence efforts in conducting primary research.


 


Discipline
 

Focus on great businesses, which incorporate the following characteristics – growth, predictability, barriers to entry, high returns on capital, strong management teams, and efficient capital allocation.
Invest in a limited number of outstanding opportunities – generally 15 – 25 companies.
Adhere to a strict buy-sell price discipline, which is based on a private market valuation derived from our proprietary LBO model.
Evaluate opportunities through the perspective of the private business owner with a long term view.
Mitigate the risk of capital impairment with a willingness to hold significant amounts of cash and write call options against positions to create downside protection when risk/reward dynamics are unfavorable.


 


Integrity
 

Align client and principal interests through significant co-investment by principals.
Seek to invest in management teams that exhibit a history of prioritizing strong corporate values.
Commit to the highest standards and transparency in client relationships.


 




 


OUR PHILOSOPHY

 


KDI is committed to reducing the risk associated with equity investing. To achieve this objective and to differentiate KDI as the manager of choice, the firm has been guided by an investment philosophy and has utilized an investment process characterized by:
 



Commitment to value investing principles


Superior knowledge of focus market sectors and potential portfolio companies through extensive due diligence


Disciplined adherence to buy and sell parameters developed through comprehensive financial and qualitative analysis



 
One of the key philosophies of KDI is a belief that the principals should invest side by side with the clients.

 





 


OUR HISTORY

 


The history of KDI dates to 1991 when Managing Partner John Day formed a partnership with Investors Management Corporation (IMC), the parent company of Golden Corral Corporation, to invest in publicly traded companies. Over time, the partnership achieved impressive returns and attracted interest from outside investors.
 
 
In 1996, Maynard Capital Partners, LLC (MCP) was formed to invest in public equities for investors outside of the IMC organization. The MCP name reflected the founding involvement of James Maynard, then Chairman and CEO of IMC and Golden Corral.
 
 
As MCP continued to enjoy attractive investment results, the firm grew in terms of its client base, assets under management and market coverage. In 2004, Sheldon Fox joined the firm and became a partner in 2007. Also, in 2007, MCP changed its name to KDI Capital Partners, LLC to highlight the firm’s core operating principles: Knowledge, Discipline and Integrity.
 
 
Today, John Day and Sheldon Fox are the majority owners of KDI with IMC retaining a minority share.
