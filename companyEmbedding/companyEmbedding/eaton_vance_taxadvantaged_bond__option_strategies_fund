Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate so that shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Performance is for the stated time period only; due to market volatili ty, the Fund's current performance may be lower or higher than quoted. The Fund's performance at market price will differ from its results at NAV. Returns are historical and are calculated by determining the percentage change in net asset value or market  price (as applicable) with all distributions reinvested and includes management fees and other expenses. Until the reinvestment of Fund distributions is completed, returns are calculated using the lower of the net asset value or market price of the shar es on the distribution ex date.  Once the reinvestment is complete, returns are calculated using the average reinvestment price.  Performance less than or equal to one year is cumulative. The Fund has adopted a policy to pay common shareholders  a stable quarterly distribution, and may pay distributions consisting of amounts characterized for federal income tax purposes as qualified and non-qualified ordinary dividends, capital gains distributions and nondividend distributions, also known as re turn of capital. There is no assurance that the Fund will always be able to pay distributions of a particular size. Click here for more information.

This data reflects distributions paid on Fund shares held for the full calendar year and is not predictive of the tax character of current or future distributions.  Fund shareholders should refer to the individual IRS Form 1099-DIVs provided to them shor tly after each year-end to determine the appropriate federal income tax treatment of the distributions they receive.  Eaton Vance is not responsible for any errors in tax reporting that may result from using the above data. Exempt-interest dividends are  not subject to regular federal income tax. Exempt-interest dividends derived from specified private activity bonds are subject to the alternative minimum tax (AMT). Non-qualified ordinary dividends are subject to federal income tax at ordinary rates. Cap ital gains distributions are taxable at long-term capital gain rates. Nondividend distributions, also known as return of capital distributions, are not subject to current federal income tax. Instead, the tax cost basis of each shareholder receiving a ret urn of capital distribution is reduced by the amount of the distribution. The Fund has adopted a policy to pay common shareholders a stable quarterly distribution. In an effort to maintain a stable distribution amount, the Fund may pay distribu tions consisting of amounts characterized for federal income tax purposes as qualified and non-qualified ordinary dividends, capital gains distributions and nondividend distributions, also known as return of capital. There is no assurance that the Fund w ill always be able to pay distributions of a particular size. In recent years, a significant portion of the Fund's distributions has been characterized as a return of capital. Click  here for more information.

Consistent returns, proprietary strategy, outstanding results.
Profound stock market directional insight.
New option trade release coming soon.
 

Options trading for consistent returns is our primary focus. Preserving capital is also a primary objective. Our strategy produces excellent results in rising bull markets. This strategy is also ideal for declining markets. Keeping funds tied up in long-term stagnant positions is a situation we try to avoid.  Our goal is to outperform all averages.  Profits are not re-invested – the goal is monthly income, not yearly returns. Monthly trade ideas have a target of double-digit returns each & every month. A very high success rate has been reached in accomplishing this goal. Trades may go against the position. It does not happen often, but it does happen. We are not shy about pulling the cord and exiting positions quickly. Holding on to winning trades, and closing out losing trades, this is a wise strategy. It is actually the most successful strategy. There’s always a new opportunity, and we excel at finding the best equity option spread situations. Over the years this system has become very adept at implementing the best options trading system. Become a member and receive the current trade of the month, as well as the upcoming Trade of the Month.  UPDATE: Completed 2016 for a very nice +67% return. The prior year 2015 we were up +159%, our best year ever.  Yes, we are that good!  Unique profit strategy, come join our program.


Option Spread Strategies is the leading strategy-oriented website when it comes to consistent returns using options.  We lead our subscribers through times of low volatility and high volatility. On a regular basis we research, discuss, speculate, and predict stock and options movement. This newsletter’s stock option trading knowledge & expertise is unsurpassed. I do believe we are…the ‘smartest guys in the room’.  Steadfast double-digit monthly returns with minimal risk is the end result goal. This is not easy. There are swings. Not all trade ideas will be profitable. Options, by nature, are volatile. However, history has shown a strong penchant for profiting on a consistent basis here. Timing is critical when trading options. Simply put, you’ve found the best options advisory newsletter. Years & years of experience is what allows this newsletter to make confident, intuitive decisions. In-depth research provides the best opportunity to profit via shrewd option spread investing on a monthly basis. We hope you make the decision to try our newsletter today.

This newsletter service will release one stock options investment idea per month. Frequently, the optimal strategy is trading equity option credit spreads. Maintaining the best options strategies while striving to control risk and mitigate volatility is sought after. Thorough research and investment analysis has accounted for superior returns since this website’s inception. These proprietary strategies are time tested. These strategies have shown documented success year over year.  My knowledge of the options industry is second to none. Each year this website take’s pride in outperforming stock market indices. Join the best option trading newsletter today & let’s get to work.
