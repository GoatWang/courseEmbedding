R-Mark Certification


				For over 50 years, the Rack Manufacturers Institute (RMI) has been evolving consensus 

				standards for industrial steel storage racks. In 2012 the industry developed its latest 

				and most comprehensive consensus document RMI/ANSI 

				MH16.1 - 2012. The document includes seismic design provisions and has been accepted 

			  as the default standard for the International Building Code and NFPA Building Codes. RMI has further developed the National Standard for welded wire rack decking which has been adopted as RMI MH26:2-2007. Both documents serve as baseline specifications for the R-Mark Certification Program.

				The following companies hold an active R-Mark License:
For Industrial Steel Storage Racks:


Advance Storage Products
Atlanta Pallet Rack
Elite Storage Solutions, Inc.
Engineered Products
Equipement Boni Inc.
Frazier Industrial
Hannibal Industries, Inc.
Konstant
Interlake Mecalux Inc.
Nanjing Kingmore Logistics Equipment Manufacturing Company, Ltd.
Rack USA
Nanjing Huade Storage Equipment Manufacturing Co., LTD
Ridg-U-Rak, Inc.
Space Rak, Div. EWCO
Speedrack Products Group, Ltd.
Steel King Industries, Inc.
Unarco Material Handling / Kingway Material Handling
United Material Handling, Inc.
Wireway Husky Corporation


For Welded Wire Rack Decking


ITC Manufacturing
J&L Wire Cloth LLC
Nashville Wire Products, Inc.
Wireway Husky Corporation
Worldwide Material Handling Products, LLC


Members of RMI have voluntarily chosen to be guided by the appropriate 

                RMI/ANSI standards. RMI members have further voluntarily agreed to a certification process administered 

                through a panel of independent Registered Professional Engineers. The R-Mark Certification represents one leg of a 3-legged stool - the others being 

                Consensus Standards and Conformity. Initiatives in all three areas are part of a focused strategic objective launched in the 

                early 1990's. The purpose of this overview is to speak specifically to the R-Mark "leg". Suffice it 

                to say that all three "legs" are critically dependent on one another.  R-Mark is a registered asset of the Rack Manufacturers Institute (RMI) and is offered 

                under license to members and non-members who are proven to meet certain requirements.





                  Guiding Principles 
                



In developing consensus on a process, a number 
                of guiding principles were followed.  Process must be:

Open and Fair
Technically Sound
Credible
Non-Intrusive
Flexible
Self-Policing
Cost Effective 







                  Basic Conditions
                



General operating characteristics of the Program include:

Licensee must be a manufacturer of Industrial Steel Storage Racks or Welded Wire Rack Decking (as defined in the by-laws of RMI); 
Licensee may manufacture their products anywhere in the world, provided that the products are used in USA; 
RMI membership is NOT required to receive an R-Mark License; 
R-Mark can only be applied to product that conforms to and within the scope of the RMI/ANSI Standards as approved by the general membership of RMI; 
Licensing procedures/guidelines/frequency are developed, determined and directed by membership of RMI;
R-Mark may only be applied by a cognizant USA Registered Professional Engineer employed by the Licensee. 







                  Approval Process
                




Information about the R-Mark Process
R-Mark Recommendations

Highlights of the Certification and Licensing process follow:

Applicants for an R-Mark License contact the Managing Director of RMI, who, a)oversees a due diligent evaluation of applicants qualifications as defined in the by-laws of RMI, and, b)provides applicant with procedural and technical requirements;
Program requirements call for each applicant to prepare two identical submittal packages containing load tables for one or more standard "families" of load beams and one or more standard "families" of upright frames as outlined in the R-Mark Program Technical Requirements.
Applicant provides the necessary submittals under Seal of his/her cognizant USA Registered Professional Engineer;
RMI randomly selects two external Reviewers from a group of six independent USA Registered Professional Engineers chosen and approved by the RMI membership as having recognized experience and expertise in the design/application of racking systems;
Each Reviewer is sent one of the identical submittal packages. The packages contain all necessary tables, evidence of tests, and calculations to allow the Reviewer(s) to assess understanding of and conformity to the appropriate norms, including RMI/ANSI Standards. Any questions or needs are resolved between the Reviewers and Applicant acting together as one;
When satisfied that all requirements have been met according to R-Mark Certification Program guidelines set by the membership; the reviewing engineers notify the RMI Managing Director under Seal;
On receipt of both notices, RMI issues a License to the Applicant including uniquely numbered Seals and Stamps for use by the licensee's USA Registered Professional Engineer as outlined in the License.
Having earned the R-Mark Certification, Licensee is entitled to display the R-Mark on any qualified product designed and Sealed in the manner of their qualified submittals without any further review. 

The process is voluntary and is open to all rack manufacturers. RMI encourages specifiers 
				and users of Industrial Steel Storage Rack to consider the value of R-Mark certification 
				when applying racking solutions.
Questions on the program can be directed to 

				Pat Davison, MHI Director of Standards.

Mark Levin has become one of the hottest properties in Talk radio, his top-rated show on WABC New York is now syndicated nationally by Cumulus Media.

Mark's radio show on WABC in New York City skyrocketed to Number 1 on the AM dial in his first 18 months on the air in the competitive 6:00 PM - 8:00 PM time slot. Mark's book Men in Black was released February 7, 2005 and quickly climbed to Number 3 in the nation on the New York Times Best-Seller list. When your book is endorsed by Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity, you know you have a winner on your hands. In a short period of time, Mark has become one of the most listened to local radio Talk show hosts in the nation.Mark Levin took over the WABC 6:00 PM slot on September 2, 2003. Before that, he hosted a popular Sunday afternoon program. "He's smart, witty, and fast on the draw," according to WABC Program Director Phil Boyce. "He has this sharp sarcastic wit that can easily stun his opponents. I know I would not want to debate him." Mark's show follows the ever popular Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity on WABC, but everyday he manages to come up with a new twist on the day's top news events, as well as his own unique information. His passion and intellect have made him a favorite of tens of thousands of radio listeners in the New York City area.Mark has been a frequent guest and substitute host on The Sean Hannity Show, and has also been an advisor to Limbaugh, who frequently refers to him on the air with the nickname "F. Lee Levin." He is perhaps more well-known for his nickname, "The Great One," coined by his friend Hannity.Mark Levin is one of America's preeminent conservative commentators and constitutional lawyers. He's in great demand as a political and legal commentator, and has appeared on hundreds of television and radio programs. Levin is also a contributing editor for National Review Online, and writes frequently for other publications. Levin has served as a top advisor to several members of President Ronald Reagan's Cabinet - including as Chief of Staff to the Attorney General of the United States. In 2001, the American Conservative Union named Levin the recipient of the prestigious Ronald Reagan Award. He currently practices law in the private sector, heading up the prestigious Landmark Legal Foundation in Washington DC.Source: http://marklevinshow.com/article.asp?...

      If the Commander in Chief believes that transgender issues have no place in the military then they have no place in the military. This is not about an individual’s desire to express him or herself, but about the US military. The military is where you learn discipline, to follow orders, and to protect your fellow countrymen. After that, the House Intelligence Committee Chairman, Devin Nunes is a...

Quotes by Mark R. Levin



      “Where utopianism is advanced through gradualism rather than revolution, albeit steady and persistent as in democratic societies, it can deceive and disarm an unsuspecting population, which is largely content and passive. It is sold as reforming and improving the existing society's imperfections and weaknesses without imperiling its basic nature. Under these conditions, it is mostly ignored, dismissed, or tolerated by much of the citizenry and celebrated by some. Transformation is deemed innocuous, well-intentioned, and perhaps constructive but not a dangerous trespass on fundamental liberties.”

      “The Conservative does not despise government. He despises tyranny. This is precisely why the Conservative reveres the Constitution and insists on adherence to it.”

      “Utopianism also finds a receptive audience among the society's disenchanted, disaffected, dissatisfied, and maladjusted who are unwilling or unable to assume responsibility for their own real or perceived conditions but instead blame their surroundings, 'the system,' and others. They are lured by the false hopes and promises of utopian transformation and the criticisms of the existing society, to which their connection is tentative or nonexistent. Improving the malcontent's lot becomes linked to the utopian cause. Moreover, disparaging and diminishing the successful and accomplished becomes an essential tactic. No one should be better than anyone else, regardless of the merits or values of his contributions. By exploiting human frailties, frustrations, jealousies, and inequities, a sense of meaning and self-worth is created in the malcontent's otherwise unhappy and directionless life. Simply put, equality in misery -- that is, equality of result or conformity -- is advanced as a just, fair, and virtuous undertaking. Liberty, therefore, is inherently immoral, except where it avails equality.”

Publisher's Description▼▲
Gone are the days of chivalry and knights, but that hasn’t changed God’s vision of you as a man of valor. Integrity and honor are elusive in a world that’s lost its moral compass, yet every man should strive to possess those qualities.Integrity, in Latin, means being a whole person. Having integrity, being complete with no cracks or fissures, means we will act at all times according to our faith. This example is found in the Gospel of John in the way Jesus interacts with others. Mark R. Laaser claims if we truly studied the interactions Jesus had with people and the words He said to them, we would have a psychology textbook so powerful it would transform lives. Laaser takes you on a journey to engage this wisdom from the life of Jesus. You can aspire to be the man God calls you to be--a man of integrity and honor.

Description












                                            People still say "Don't count your chickens before they're hatched," "The early bird catches the worm," and "A stitch in time saves nine," but do youngsters have any idea what these proverbial lessons actually mean? Also the author of the illustrated history books George Washington: The Crossing and Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address Illustrated, Jack Levin here returns to a book he started decades ago for readers up to 8, presenting 29 proverbs with lighthearted cartoons to illuminate these bits of wisdom passed down from generation to generation. Levin also provides further, verbal explanations at the end of this book.
