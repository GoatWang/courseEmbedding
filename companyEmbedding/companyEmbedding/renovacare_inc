Frequently Asked Questions
Technology Q&A | View All


What is the CellMist™ System?


The CellMist™ System is an innovative investigational medical treatment for processing and spraying a patient’s own stem cells onto wounds for rapid healing.
The CellMist™ System is comprised of two primary components:

The CellMist™ Solution
A liquid suspension containing a patient’s own stem cells which are isolated from a small sample of their skin, using a patented process.
The SkinGun™
A patented investigational medical device which gently sprays the CellMist™ Solution on to a wound site for rapid healing.

Once sprayed onto the wound site, the patient’s stem cells contained in the CellMist™ Solution go to work, naturally and rapidly regenerating damaged skin.
The CellMist™ System replaces traditional skin grafts, harvested through painful surgery to remove significant portions of skin from the donor’s body.  These graft surgeries create large secondary wounds. The CellMist™ System requires only a postage stamp-sized sample of donor skin.


What is the SkinGun™


Our patented SkinGun™ is an investigational spray device specially designed to deliver the CellMist™ Solution and its regenerative stem cells to heal burns and wounds.
Stem cells are delicate and can be easily damaged by conventional spray methods.  These pumps use mechanical compression, generating turbulent forces which can thrash and damage the cells.
In contrast, the SkinGun™ is an ultra-gentle sprayer, which delicately carries the patient’s own stem cells to wound sites.  We make use of a novel positive-pressure system engineered to avoid violent forces.


How does the CellMist™ System work?


The CellMist™ System sprays a patient’s own stem cells onto wounds, naturally regenerating skin to heal traumatic wounds quicker than traditional therapies.
First, a patient’s cells are liberated from a small sample of skin, often as little as a postage stamp.  These naturally potent cells are collected in a water-based liquid called the CellMist™ Solution.
Next, the CellMist™ Solution is sprayed gently onto the wounded area using our patented investigational SkinGun™.
This procedure takes as little as 90 minutes from start to finish. In some cases, patients can leave the hospital within a few days, rather than the many weeks required by alternative treatments.


What conditions does the CellMist™ System treat?


The CellMist™ System has been used in experimental procedures to treat severe second-degree burns.
Our future target markets include chronic wounds, vitiligo (areas of unpigmented skin), scars, and other skin disorders, which collectively account for a $45 billion market and 143 million patients.


Where is CellMist™ treatment available?


The CellMist™ System is under development and has only been used in experimental protocols on a very limited basis.  Our technologies are not currently available for use or treatment in the United States.


What is the liquid sprayer for wound care and irrigation fluids?


RenovaCare’s Solution Spray Deposition Device was designed to meet a specific clinical need. Liquid spraying, such as saline solution spraying to cleanse a wound, to irrigate a wound, or to maintain a moist wound environment is clinically desirable in surgery. While saline and other wound-wetting solutions’ distribution over burns and other wounds is typically performed by pouring the liquid or squirting with a standard syringe, RenovaCare has developed a device that sprays gently and evenly over a large wound area.

RenovaCare products are under development and not approved for sale in the United States.





Cell Renewal, Naturally™





RenovaCare, Inc. is a biotechnology company focused on developing first-of-their-kind autologous (self-donated) stem cell therapies for the regeneration of human organs.
Our initial products under development target the body’s largest organ, the skin. Our flagship technology, the CellMist™ System, uses our patented SkinGun™ to spray a liquid suspension of a patient’s stem cells – the CellMist™ Solution – onto wounds. We’re also developing medical-grade liquid spray devices for wound care and irrigation fluids.
In investigative clinical use in the United States, SkinGun™ treatments have shown the potential to naturally and rapidly heal burns and other serious wounds.
We are developing our CellMist™ System as a promising new alternative for patients suffering from burns, chronic and acute wounds, and scars. In the US alone, this $45 billion market is greater than spending on high-blood pressure management, cholesterol treatments, and back pain therapeutics.
Currently in investigational clinical use for second degree burn patients in the United States, our CellMist™ System targets an estimated 143 million patients worldwide who suffer burns, chronic and acute wounds, acne scarring, and skin defects and diseases such as vitiligo (a skin discoloration condition, suffered by celebrities Michael Jackson and Jon Hamm). According to the National Institutes of Health, skin disorders account for 40% of occupational-disease claims nationally.
For patients the potential breakthrough of a quick-healing, gentle mist of their own stem cells will be a promising alternative to conventional skin grafts, which can be extremely painful, slow-to-heal, and prone to complications.
The CellMist™ System harvests a patient’s stem cells from a small area of skin, generally around 1 square inch, and suspends them in the water-based CellMist™ Solution. The suspension is delicately sprayed onto the wound using the SkinGun™ deposition device, where it begins to grow new skin at the cellular level.
RenovaCare’s SkinGun™ spray device is the world’s most advanced technology of its kind, using a gentle positive-pressure air stream to spray the CellMist™ Solution onto wounds. This is a marked improvement over pump spray devices, which spray by creating high pressure behind a narrow aperture, and expose fragile cells to strong forces that are likely to tear them apart.
This procedure can take as little as 90 minutes from start to finish. In some cases patients will be able to leave the hospital within only a few days, rather than the many weeks required by other alternative treatments such as in-vitro cultured epithelial grafts.

RenovaCare Inc (OTCMKTS:RCAR) Soars on Product Exposure

By Jermaine Farmer -  December 3, 2016 


SHARE

Facebook
Twitter






RenovaCare Inc (OTCMKTS:RCAR) has been powering in an uptrend as traders digest the impact of the company’s recent press on the potentially revolutionary impact of its lead product, the SkinGun. In articles published in Women’s Weekly, Huffington Post, and BioScience Technology, the product received very prominent treatment. This came just a couple weeks after the company announced the appointment of Roger Esteban-Vives, Ph.D. as Director of Cell Sciences.
“I’m thrilled to be joining the RenovaCare team to help bring to market the company’s breakthrough stem cell spray technology, the SkinGun™,” said Dr. Roger Esteban-Vives. “What makes the SkinGun unique is its ability to gently spray large areas of wounds and burns with a patient’s own stem cells, within only minutes of arriving in an emergency ward. Best of all, the process is entirely natural, quick, and gentle.”
RenovaCare Inc (OTCMKTS:RCAR) promulgates itself as a company that focuses on the acquisition, research, development, and commercialization of autologous cellular therapies for use in medical and aesthetic applications.
It develops a treatment methodology for skin isolation; and SkinGun, a medical-grade liquid spraying device and associated equipment for the regeneration of human skin cells. The company was formerly known as Janus Resources, Inc. and changed its name to RenovaCare, Inc. in January 2014. RenovaCare, Inc. is based in New York, New York.
According to company materials, “RenovaCare, Inc. is developing first-of-its-kind autologous stem cell therapies for the regeneration of human organs. Its initial product under development targets the body’s largest organ, the skin. The company’s flagship technology, the CellMist™ System, uses its patented SkinGun™ to spray a liquid suspension of a patient’s stem cells – the CellMist™ Solution – onto wounds. RenovaCare is developing its CellMist™ System as a promising new alternative for patients suffering from burns, chronic and acute wounds, and scars. In the US alone, this $45 billion market is greater than the spending on high-blood pressure management, cholesterol treatments, and back pain therapeutics.”

The company has been putting the pedal to the metal lately as far as generating greater exposure for its product.
According to their materials, “RenovaCare is developing its patented SkinGun to spray a liquid suspension of a patient’s stem cells – the CellMist Solution – onto wounds. RenovaCare believes the technology will be a promising new alternative for patients suffering from burns, chronic and acute wounds, and scars. In the U.S. alone, this $45 billion market is greater than the spending on high-blood pressure management, cholesterol treatments, and back pain therapeutics. Key to the RenovaCare approach is its ultra-gentle delivery of regenerative stem cells to the wound site. The company’s SkinGun™ achieves uniform distribution of fluids with 200 times greater coverage than conventional methods, according to tests conducted at Stem cell Systems GmbH (Berlin, Germany).”
We’ve witnessed just under 110% during the past week in terms of shareholder gains in the listing, but that move comes in the context of a larger bearish trend. Market participants may want to pay attention to this stock. RCAR has a history of dramatic rallies. What’s more, the name has seen a recent influx of interest, with the stock’s recent average trading volume running 500% beyond what we have been seeing over the larger time frame.
It pays to take note of this fact due to the limited float size in the stock (just a tad more than 20M shares). Traders should not overlook this combination, as a jump in average daily transaction volume in a stock with a restricted float can unleash fireworks as supply is squeezed.
Currently trading at a market capitalization of $145.5M, RCAR has a decent store ($687.75k) of cash on the books, with total assets greater than $850K, which compares with very little total accumulated debt.
The exposure is great and the company can certainly benefit. However, eventually this will likely have to reconciled with government oversight on some level, and we will see this product put to the test. For now, however, this is a very interesting story generating a lot of excitement. We will update again soon as events dictate.

November 17, 2015 09:15 AM Eastern Standard Time



NEW YORK & PITTSBURGH--(BUSINESS WIRE)--RenovaCare, Inc. (OTCQB:RCAR), today announced a partnership to validate 
      the science behind its groundbreaking technology for treatments of 
      wounds, burns and other skin defects. The company’s research partner is 
      Berlin-Brandenburg Center for Regenerative Therapies (BCRT), a 
      translational research center at Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin, 
      one of the world’s largest university hospitals.
    


      The BCRT focuses on enhancing endogenous regeneration by cells, 
      biomaterials, and factors, which can be used to develop and implement 
      innovative therapies and products. RenovaCare, Inc. is the developer of 
      the patented CellMist™ and SkinGun™ technologies for isolating and 
      spraying a patient’s own stem cells onto burns and wounds for rapid 
      self-healing.
    

      “This collaboration with a globally-renowned institution is a huge step 
      forward for RenovaCare as we set out to achieve third party validation 
      of the science behind the promise of our CellMist™ and SkinGun™ 
      technologies,” said Thomas Bold, President and CEO of RenovaCare, Inc. 
      “We are honored to be working with such committed researchers known for 
      partnering with innovative, world-class companies whose mission is to 
      make peoples’ lives better.”
    

      “We are very excited to be working with RenovaCare to advance the 
      treatment of burns, and this project underscores the new treatments for 
      severely burned patients and those with myriad skin conditions,” said 
      Dr. Katrin Zeilinger, Project Leader for BCRT. “We plan to assess all 
      aspects of the company’s technology as it is related to the tissue’s 
      wound-healing function and the characteristics of the treated site.”
    

      The objective of today’s announced research partnership is to evaluate 
      protocols, methods, and outcomes related to the use of the RenovaCare 
      proprietary SkinGun™. This includes better understanding the ability of 
      delicate stem cells to survive and grow after being gently sprayed 
      through SkinGun™ on to targeted body sites. Survival of these cells is 
      vital to wound healing and recovery.
    

      According to RenovaCare engineers, the company’s proprietary SkinGun™ 
      spray device is the world’s most advanced technology of its kind, using 
      an ultra-gentle non-turbulent air stream to spray the cells onto wounds. 
      This is a marked improvement over pump spray devices, which create 
      high-pressure forces behind a narrow aperture, exposing fragile cells to 
      thrashing that is more likely to cause damage.
    

      Scientists at BCRT will also study various additional features and 
      behaviors related to skin stem cells and their ability to replicate and 
      grow, for wound healing.

About RenovaCare


      RenovaCare, Inc. is developing first-of-their-kind autologous 
      (self-donated) stem cell therapies for the regeneration of human organs. 
      Its initial product under development targets the body’s largest organ, 
      the skin. The company’s flagship technology, the CellMist™ System, uses 
      its patented SkinGun™ to spray a liquid suspension of a patient’s stem 
      cells – the CellMist™ Solution – onto wounds. RenovaCare is developing 
      its CellMist™ System as a promising new alternative for patients 
      suffering from burns, chronic and acute wounds, and scars. In the US 
      alone, this $45 billion market is greater than the spending on 
      high-blood pressure management, cholesterol treatments, and back pain 
      therapeutics.
    

      The statements in this press release have not been evaluated by the U.S. 
      Food and Drug Administration (FDA). RenovaCare products are not approved

      No statement herein should be considered an offer or a solicitation of 
      an offer for the purchase or sale of any securities. This release 
      contains forward-looking statements that are based upon current 
      expectations or beliefs, as well as a number of assumptions about future 
      events. Although RenovaCare, Inc. (the “Company”) believes that the 
      expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements and the 
      assumptions upon which they are based are reasonable, it can give no 
      assurance that such expectations and assumptions will prove to have been 
      correct. Forward-looking statements, which involve assumptions and 
      describe our future plans, strategies, and expectations, are generally 
      identifiable by use of the words “may,” “will,” “should,” “could,” 
      “expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “believe,” “intend,” or “project” or 
      the negative of these words or other variations on these words or 
      comparable terminology. The reader is cautioned not to put undue 
      reliance on these forward-looking statements, as these statements are 
      subject to numerous factors and uncertainties, including but not limited 
      to: the timing and success of clinical and preclinical studies of 
      product candidates, the potential timing and success of the Company’s 
      product programs through their individual product development and 
      regulatory approval processes, adverse economic conditions, intense 
      competition, lack of meaningful research results, entry of new 
      competitors and products, inadequate capital, unexpected costs and 
      operating deficits, increases in general and administrative costs, 
      termination of contracts or agreements, obsolescence of the Company's 
      technologies, technical problems with the Company's research, price 
      increases for supplies and components, litigation and administrative 
      proceedings involving the Company, the possible acquisition of new 
      businesses or technologies that result in operating losses or that do 
      not perform as anticipated, unanticipated losses, the possible 
      fluctuation and volatility of the Company's operating results, financial 
      condition and stock price, losses incurred in litigating and settling 
      cases, dilution in the Company's ownership of its business, adverse 
      publicity and news coverage, inability to carry out research, 
      development and commercialization plans, loss or retirement of key 
      executives and research scientists, and other risks. There can be no 
      assurance that further research and development will validate and 
      support the results of our preliminary research and studies. Further, 
      there can be no assurance that the necessary regulatory approvals will 
      be obtained or that the Company will be able to develop commercially 
      viable products on the basis of its technologies. In addition, other 
      factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are 
      discussed in the Company's most recent Form 10-Q and Form 10-K filings 
      with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These reports and filings 
      may be inspected and copied at the Public Reference Room maintained by 
      the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission at 100 F Street, N.E., 
      Washington, D.C. 20549. You can obtain information about operation of 
      the Public Reference Room by calling the U.S. Securities & Exchange 
      Commission at 1-800-SEC-0330. The U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission 
      also maintains an Internet site that contains reports, proxy and 
      information statements, and other information regarding issuers that 
      file electronically with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission at http://www.sec.gov. 
      The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly release the results of 
      any revisions to these forward-looking statements that may be made to 
      reflect the events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect

	Outcomes of Burn Patients Treated with Cell Spray Technology Behind RenovaCare SkinGun™ Published in Prestigious Medical Journal




	 



	New York & Pittsburgh

	–

	April 27, 2017

	- RenovaCare, Inc. (OTCQB: RCAR), highlighted an analysis of treatment results on a variety of wide-area and severe burn injuries published in Burns, the peer-reviewed Journal of the International Society for Burn Injuries. The treatment method, which involved isolating and spraying the patient’s own skin stem cells on the burn wounds, is the technology underlying RenovaCare’s patented CellMist™ and SkinGun™*.


	 


	“The early cell spray technology which was used to successfully treat a wide spectrum of burn injuries to some of the largest body areas ever treated with stem cell transplantation, has been engineered into today’s RenovaCare SkinGun™ device,” explained Mr. Thomas Bold, President and CEO of RenovaCare, Inc.


	 


	The results, published in August 2016, report the retrospective analysis of outcomes in 45 severe second-degree burn patients who received skin stem cell spray grafting treatment under an innovative practice approach.


	 


	The patients suffered burn wounds such as gas and chemical explosions, as well as electrical, gasoline, hot water and tar scalding burns. Click here to see before-after photos


	 


	“In the case of one patient with severe electrical burns to over one-third of his body, his wounds were sprayed with 23 million stem cells isolated from a tiny 2” x 2” sample of his own skin. Within five days of treatment, his chest and arms were already healed. Four days later, the patient was discharged from the hospital,” said Mr. Bold.


	 


	“These published analyses are especially encouraging to us because patients were successfully treated with the technology no matter what the source of the burn,” concluded Mr. Bold.

	According to the

	Burns

	article authors, regardless of the burn type, cell spray showed quick healing (“fast epithelialization”), along with other benefits. "Cell-spray grafting is also especially suitable for hands and joint areas, where prolonged times to re-epithelization may significantly impact functionality and esthetic outcome," said the report.


	 


	Other findings in the article, following cell spray with the technology include:


	 



	Gas Explosion Patient



	A gas explosion caused burns to the upper right arm and partial right chest area of a 43- year-old man who also suffered orthopedic injuries. "There was no evidence of hypertrophic


	(abnormal enlargement of an organ) scarring throughout the prior burn area, and his only functional impairment ... was due to his wrist injury," concluded the report.

	Chemical Explosion Burn



	A 37-year-old patient suffered serious burns to his arms and hands as a result of a potassium nitrate explosion. The report observed the following outcome: "... the areas of autografts were noted to be almost indiscernible with the normal skin ... The patient maintained a full range of motion in all extremities without restriction."


	 



	Electrical Burn



	After grabbing a live electrical wire a 35-year-old male received deep burns to the head, chest, abdomen, back, right hand and foot. Doctors indicated a full recovery to the affected areas in the article: “... all of the areas treated with cell spray grafting were noted as completely healed and re-epithelialized ... the patient had a functional range of motion in all extremities."


	 



	Gasoline Flame Burn



	A gasoline flame injury to an 18-year-old male resulted in burns to the arms and legs. Forty-five million cells were obtained from the patient and used to spray the entire burn wound surface. "Wounds were completely healed by ... and there was no evidence of ... scarring or contractures, and the patient demonstrated a full range of motion in all extremities," the article said.


	 



	Hot Water Scalding



	A hot water scalding injury covered a 43-year-old patient’s upper left arm, shoulder, back and torso. His post cell spray treatment provided the following results: "A 100% re-epithelialization was noted and the patient was discharged that day with instructions to apply Eucerin moisturizer to the wound ... the patient was also noted to have a full range of motion in his extremities,” according to the article.


	 



	Hot Tar Scalding



	Hot tar burned a 43-year-old man’s right arm, right hand and midsection and within seven days of treatment the article concluded: “… all areas were noted to be healed and re-epithelialized and the patient was discharged.”

RenovaCare: Stem Cell Treatment Heals Burns In Weeks Not Months - RenovaCare, Inc. (OTCMKTS:RCAR) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»RenovaCare: Stem Cell Treatment Heals Burns In Weeks Not MonthsMar.15.17 | About: RenovaCare, Inc. (RCAR) Harlan Levy Long/short equity, newspaper business reporterHarlan Levy's articlesSummarySpray-on stem-cell treatment heals burns in weeks or less.Stem-cell burn treatment leaves no scars.Treats burns without restricting joints.Stem cell burn treatment has huge international market.RenovaCare Inc. (OTCQB:RCAR) is a New York City-based biotechnology company developing its patented CellMist and SkinGun stem cell technologies for treating burns in weeks or less as well as treating chronic and acute wounds, acne scarring, and skin defects and diseases. In December, it received a U.S. patent for its SkinGun device. Before joining RenovaCare, CEO Thomas Bold was CEO of StemCell Systems. He has more than 15 years of experience in medical biotechnology device manufacturing and stem cell platform development. Harlan Levy: How does your CellMist technology specifically work? Thomas Bold: Doctors isolate a high concentration of the most desirable stem cell population from a very small donor sample of the patient's own skin and suspended in the liquid CellMist Solution. It's then gently sprayed onto wound sites using our SkinGun, which looks like Captain Kirk's particle-beam gun, the "Phaser" in the Star Trek TV series. The isolated cells include cells that proliferate rapidly in order to achieve quick re-epithelialization. This is the stage at which a burn is technically considered "healed" and patients are often discharged. The average person would recognize this healing phase as the point at which the wound develops a thin, shiny, pink-colored protective layer. 

 H.L.: What are existing burn treatments, and how do they compare with the SkinGun treatment? T.B.: Traditional skin grafting has been the treatment for burns and wounds for centuries. More recently, mesh grafting has become the latest standard of care. This process surgically removes large sheets of healthy skin from the patient. Following this painful donor procedure, the sheet is punctured in a grid-like pattern to form an expandable mesh. Surgeons pull this mesh as wide as feasible and surgically stitch this skin to the patient's wound. The procedure is extremely painful, creates an additional wound at each donor site and results in poor cosmetic outcomes, often with scarred and deformed skin.
 This transplanted skin can result in restricted joint movement and is unable to grow with the patient. Consequently, mesh graft patients require months and sometimes up to a year of physical therapy and can face psychological problems from the permanent disfigurement of scarring. In addition, long-term pain management with painkillers is very often necessary. With the RenovaCare treatment technology, by spraying the patient's stem cells, the SkinGun overcomes the need for removing large sheets of donor skin, and the resultant healing does not require prolonged physical therapy. The spray procedure is gentle, and the skin that regrows looks, feels, and functions as the original skin that it replaces. Most often the healing process takes only a week. It's very important to note here that a sheet of meshed skin covers only up to six times its original donor area. The RenovaCare system covers up to 100 times its donor skin sample. This is why the donor skin sample can be so small compared to the injured treatment area. H.L.: What about scars and infection potential compared with conventional treatments? T.B.: A wound heals from the edges towards the middle. The bigger the wound, the longer this process takes. And the longer this process takes, the higher the risk of infection and scarring. Imagine a large burn of 20, 30, 40 percent of your total body surface. With our CellMist System, the doctor sprays the patient's own stem cells with a highly regenerative capacity onto the wound and, by doing so, creates tens of thousands of little regenerative islands across the wound. These islands grow outwards, ultimately connecting to each other to create a protective epithelial skin layer that covers the wound. Experts believe the formation of this pink-colored layer marks the moment of re-epithelization where the risk of infection is reduced and the patient's wound is effectively healed. Beyond this stage, the cosmetic healing process also happens entirely natural to produce a scar-free result where, finally, skin color, tone and pigmentation are restored.
 Since the RenovaCare spray procedure uses the patient's own stem cells, there isn't the risk of tissue rejection, infection, or ongoing immuno suppression therapy. H.L.: What results have you found for patients using the SkinGun? T.B.: We have many examples of patients recovering from severe burns within a week or two, scar-free, and walking away with unlimited joint restrictions. In the case of one patient with severe electrical burns to over a third of his body, we were able to spray his wounds with 23 million stem cells isolated from a tiny two-inch-by two-inch sample of his own skin. Within five days of treatment, his chest and arms were already healed. Four days later, the patient was discharged from the hospital. It's also important to note that reconstructive surgery for burn patients is especially challenging when tackling joints in the body. To this end, the authors of a case study in the reputable journal "Burns," said, "Cell-spray grafting is also especially suitable for hands and joint areas, where prolonged times to re-epithelization may significantly impact functionality and esthetic outcome." 

 H.L.: What different uses does the SkinGun have beside burns? T.B.: Currently, we are focusing on severe second-degree burns, but we see the RenovaCare technology also applicable for other indications such as cosmetic procedures targeting skin pigmentation disorders, scar treatment, and other related conditions. Our goal is to bring to market the world's most advanced technology for skin repair using a patient's own stem cells. H.L.: Is there a record of the SkinGun™ use in the States and abroad? T.B.: Having treated 72 burn patients to date, the company's early clinical target is burns with follow-on indications, including chronic wounds and cosmetic procedures.
 H.L.: How much research went into creating the SkinGun and over what time period? T.B.: The birth of RenovaCare technology goes back to the early 2000s in Berlin, Germany. Researchers, at that time, were trying to "grow" skin by seeding stem cells inside multi-dimensional bioreactors. They soon discovered that these artificial chambers were no match for the growth of the same cells when transplanted inside a human body; thus, the birth of a concept to use a patient's own wound as a natural bioreactor. A study published in "Advances in Plastic Surgery" highlights 19 early patients with deep dermal wound burns to the face and neck, complex three-dimensional surfaces. Researchers achieved such outstanding results using our cell spray that they refused to perform further skin grafting. Instead, surgeons adopted our founding technology as their standard of care. Let me quote from the surgeons' study, which states "We refuse to perform a prospective randomized study with groups in which traditional skin grafting and/or wound healing are still applied for the therapy for deep dermal burns due to the excellent results in our study. The method of CEA spray application has become our standard of care for these indications. The faster wound closure, the promotion of spontaneous wound healing by keratinocyte application, as well as the preservation of donor sites are further advantages of the method." The same paper concluded that "using a spray technique results in excellent cosmetic outcomes compared with any other method." H.L.: How has the technology changed since then? T.B.: Since the time of this early approach, our technology has evolved and matured significantly. Our cell isolation no longer requires complex procedures, culturing, expansion, and processing time, and our stem cell spray device no longer requires multiple hand-assembled parts. Its independent power and flow-control unit has been condensed in size from a 2-foot cube down to a 9-volt battery placed inside the handle of a single handheld spray gun.
 H.L.: What is the potential market for the technology in dollars and number of patients? T.B.: Conservatively speaking, the market for our technology exceeds $50 billion. There are nearly a million people who suffer from burns each year in the U.S. alone. According to the American Burn Association, burn injuries continue to be one of the leading causes of accidental death and injury in the U.S, and one civilian fire death occurs every two hours and forty minutes. H.L.: How much would you estimate the treatment cost may be for each different use? T.B.: The SkinGun technology is currently under development and not approved for clinical use in the U.S., so it's too early to talk about what the treatment will cost. We have always been mindful of reimbursement, and nearly two years ago, we commissioned an investigation into the reimbursement pathway for our CellMist System. We know that reimbursement opportunities are available by way of current coding and practices. We have further investigated and evaluated the "bundling" approach currently advocated for by insurers and are confident that that our technology is well placed to take advantages of any shift towards such a model. H.L: What is the schedule to get Federal Drug Administration clearance? T.B.: In order to achieve FDA clearance for the CellMist System and the SkinGun, we will be working to show our technology is safe and prove its efficacy within applicable clinical trial formats and according to the relevant regulatory requirements. I can't speculate as to how long the FDA clearance process will take, and, therefore, it's hard to speculate when our product will be commercialized. H.L.: What other products are you investigating and how may they work? T.B.: We are focusing on bringing the SkinGun™ and our stem cell spray technology to market at this time. H.L.: What is your background, including age, education, prior employment? T.B.: Before joining RenovaCare I worked as the CEO of StemCell Systems GmbH, a Berlin-based biomedical company engaged in the development and commercialization of advanced cell culture bioreactors. I have more than 15 years of professional business experience in the field of medical biotechnology device manufacturing, stem cell culture technology platform development and regenerative medicine research project management and product development.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

NEW YORK & PITTSBURGH--(BUSINESS WIRE)--RenovaCare, Inc., (OTCQB:RCAR), 
      developer of the patented CellMist™ and SkinGun™ technologies* for 
      isolating and spraying a patient’s own stem cells onto burns and wounds 
      for rapid self-healing, today issued its beginning of the year 2017 
      shareholder update.
    


      Below is a statement from Thomas Bold, President and CEO of RenovaCare, 
      Inc.:
    

Dear Valued Shareholders:


      Thanks to your support, 2016 was an incredible year for us and our 
      CellMist™ and SkinGun™ technologies for spraying a patient’s own stem 
      cells on to wounds and burns.
    

      We closed the year emboldened by the issuance of an important new 
      patent, a string of encouraging pre-clinical and engineering outcomes, 
      and what could be considered by any standard an enviable quantity of 
      media attention.
    

      And, we look forward to the year ahead as we move beyond engineering and 
      lab work and on to a focused regulatory pathway to help move our 
      breakthrough products to market.
    

The future of medicine: rapid, scar-free healing using a patient’s 
      own stem cells.


      Our investigational CellMist™ System isolates a patient’s stem cells 
      from a tiny donor skin sample and ultra-gently sprays those regenerative 
      cells on to wounds using our SkinGun™.
    

      Nothing is as moving as this compelling 
      video testimony and the before and after images of state trooper 
      Matt Uram, one of the first patients treated with the SkinGun™.
    

      In his latest book, author and motivational lecturer, Tony Robbins, 
      recalls the severity of Matt’s second-degree burns and his emergency 
      room ordeal:
    

“Every ten minutes in America someone is horribly burned ...


“So, imagine how one night Matt Uram, a 40-year-old state trooper, 
      finds himself about to become another one of those grim statistics. His 
      life altered forever …


“The doctors and nurses move fast, cleaning off the blistered skin, 
      disinfecting Matt’s wounds, applying salves. Normally he would be in the 
      burn unit for weeks or months, going through the same agonizing process 
      twice a day. Instead, a team of specialists goes to work with a new 
      technique. They harvest a layer of healthy cells from unburned patches 
      of his own skin. No cadaver skin for Matt!


“... Before long, a spray gun is gently painting the wounds with a 
      solution of Matt’s own stem cells.


“Three days later, his arms and face were completely healed. And, 
      this 
      miracle has to be seen to be believed!”


Beyond medicine: why we do what we do.


      The goal is to bring our stem cell technologies to the 140 million 
      patients worldwide who suffer burns, chronic and acute wounds, acne 
      scarring, and skin defects and diseases.
    

      Our mission is to help these patients by replacing painful skin grafts 
      with, we believe, the greatest breakthrough in wound healing in the past 
      half-century – a gentle mist of stem cells.
    

      Remember, within only two hours of arriving in an emergency room, Matt’s 
      own stem cells were sprayed on to his burns using the SkinGun™. A few 
      days later he walked out of the hospital.
    

      As Matt explains it, “When I had the procedure, they sprayed me on a 
      Friday. It was hard to believe that I was walking out that Monday, 
      completely healed. No scarring. No pain.”
    

      Since Matt’s treatment, we’ve worked harder than ever to miniaturize and 
      advance-engineer the early prototypes of our SkinGun™ into a 
      market-ready product.
    

      Our push is to eliminate painful and disfiguring skin graft surgeries, 
      reduce hospital stays, and minimize pain and infections.
    

Our path ahead.


      If the year we leave behind was one of creating and building our 
      technologies, then the road ahead in 2017 is all about clarity in 
      advancing and bringing it to market.
    

      Our patents, regulatory strategy, clinical outcomes, and brand-building 
      are key initiatives for the year ahead. I believe that each of these 
      will advance our business and build shareholder value.
    

      The issuance of our latest SkinGun™ device patent bolsters our 
      intellectual property portfolio, provides important protection of our 
      invention and gives us commercial confidence to move forward.
    

      With engineering and internal documentation work largely behind us, 
      we’re more excited than ever to move forward along the regulatory 
      pathway.
    

      Expect to hear more in the coming weeks and months as well as receive 
      updates on pre-clinical and clinical work – all part of our 2017 
      undertaking.
    

Rewarding our valued shareholders.


      As it is an important part of our mission to build shareholder value, 
      you can anticipate an ongoing effort to build and boost our public 
      brand, not only in the investment community, but also with clinicians, 
      physician, and, of course, patients.
    

      Already, iconic media outlets such as Forbes, National Geographic, 
      Fast Co. and Bloomberg TV have showered RenovaCare with press 
      coverage.
    

      Finally, and as part of my ongoing commitment to all our shareholders, I 
      encourage you to contact us with any questions, suggestions or comments.
    

      Once again, thank you for your confidence and support.
    

      Very truly yours,
    

      Thomas BoldPresident and CEORenovaCare, Inc.
