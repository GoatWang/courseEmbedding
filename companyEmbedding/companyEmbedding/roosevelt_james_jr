Early life[edit]
Roosevelt was born on November 9, 1945 to Congressman James Roosevelt (1907–1991) and Romelle Theresa Schneider (1915–2002).[2] His two full siblings are Michael (born December 7, 1946) and Anna (born January 10, 1948). Through his father, he has two elder half-sisters (Sara and Kate), a younger half-brother (Hall), and a younger half-sister (Rebecca). His paternal grandparents were President Franklin Delano Roosevelt (1882–1945) and First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt (1884–1962).
Roosevelt graduated from La Salle High School in Pasadena in 1963. He earned his A.B. with honors in government from Harvard College in 1968. He later received his J.D. from Harvard Law School and completed the Advanced Management Program at Harvard Business School.
Career[edit]
On June 12, 1968, following his graduation from Harvard, he was commissioned in the Naval Reserve and rose to the rank of lieutenant on July 1, 1971.[3]
After obtaining his J.D. from Harvard Law, Roosevelt spent 10 years as partner at Choate, Hall & Stewart in Boston, Massachusetts. Roosevelt was the associate commissioner for Retirement Policy for the Social Security Administration before joining Tufts Health Plan in 1999 as senior vice president and general counsel. He held that position until June 2005, when he became President and Chief Executive Officer of Tufts Health Plan.[4]
In 1986, he ran for Congress, losing the Democratic Primary to Joseph P. Kennedy, II.[5]
He has also served as chief legal counsel for the Massachusetts Democratic Party. He is past chairman of the board of trustees for the Massachusetts Hospital Association, past president of the American Health Lawyers Association and past chairman of the board of trustees for Mount Auburn Hospital. Currently, Roosevelt serves as chairman of the board of directors for Massachusetts Association of Health Plans, and as a member of the boards at America's Health Insurance Plans, Catholic Democrats, Emmanuel College, and the Kenneth B. Schwartz Center.
He was called upon in 2008 to oversee hearings on controversies related to seating delegates from Florida and Michigan to the 2008 Democratic National Convention. Roosevelt was described as "detail-oriented," and as having great "institutional knowledge." He had not publicly endorsed either Clinton or Obama before the committee meeting.[6][7][8]
Personal life[edit]
On June 15, 1968, Roosevelt married Ann Martha Conlon (born March 31, 1945), the daughter of Walter N. Conlon, and a 1966 graduate of Radcliffe College.[9][10] Together, they have three daughters:[11]

Kathleen Ann Roosevelt (born 1978), who married Jeffrey Walker in 2007.[12]
Theresa Marie "Tracy" Roosevelt (born 1982), who married Robert O’Loughlin in 2016.[13]
Maura Amy Roosevelt (born 1984), who married Joshua Fisher in 2014.[14]

Early life[edit]
Roosevelt was born in New York City at 125 East 36th Street. He attended the Potomac School and the National Cathedral School in Washington, D.C., and the Groton School in Massachusetts. At Groton, he rowed and played football, and was a prefect in his senior year. After graduation in 1926, he attended Harvard College, where he rowed with the freshman and junior varsity crews. At Harvard he followed family traditions, joining the Signet Society and Hasty Pudding Club, of which both his father and his maternal granduncle and paternal fifth cousin once removed, President Theodore Roosevelt, had been members, as well as the Fly Club, which his father had joined, and Institute of the 1770. He graduated from Harvard in 1930 and was elected permanent treasurer of his class.[2]
After graduation, Roosevelt enrolled in the Boston University School of Law. He also took a sales job with Boston insurance agent Victor De Gerard. Roosevelt was so successful, that within one year, he abandoned his law studies. In 1932 he started his own insurance agency, Roosevelt and Sargent, in partnership with John A. Sargent. As president of Roosevelt & Sargent, he made a substantial fortune (about $500,000). He resigned from the firm in 1937, when he officially went to work in the White House, but retained his half ownership.[3]
Politics and the White House[edit]
Roosevelt attended the 1924 Democratic National Convention where he served, in his words, as his father's "page and prop". In 1928, he and some Harvard classmates campaigned for Democratic Presidential nominee Al Smith. In 1932, he headed FDR's Massachusetts campaign; he made about two hundred campaign speeches that year. Though FDR lost the Massachusetts Democratic primary (to Smith), he easily carried Massachusetts in the November election. James Roosevelt was viewed as his father's political deputy in Massachusetts, allocating patronage in alliance with Boston mayor James Michael Curley. He was also a delegate from Massachusetts to the Constitutional Convention for the repeal of Prohibition in 1933.
Roosevelt was a close protege of Joseph P. Kennedy Sr.. In 1934, the two journeyed to England to obtain the market in post-prohibition liquor imports.[1] Many of Roosevelt's controversial business ventures were aided by Kennedy, including his maritime insurance interests, and the National Grain Yeast Corp. affair (1933-5). Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau, Jr. threatened to resign unless FDR forced James to leave the latter company, suspected of being a front for bootlegging.[4] James Roosevelt was instrumental in securing Kennedy's appointment as ambassador to the United Kingdom.[5]
In April 1936, Presidential Secretary Louis Howe died. James Roosevelt unofficially assumed Howe's duties.[3] Soon after the 1936 re-election of FDR, James Roosevelt was given a direct commission as a lieutenant colonel in the Marine Corps, which caused public controversy for its obvious political implications. He accompanied his father to the Inter-American Conference at Buenos Aires in December as a military aide. On January 6, 1937, he was officially appointed "administrative assistant to the President"; on July 1, 1937, he was appointed Secretary to the President.[2] He became White House coordinator for eighteen federal agencies in October 1937.
James Roosevelt was considered among his father's most important counselors. Time magazine suggested he might be considered "Assistant President of the United States".[3]
In July 1938, there were allegations that James Roosevelt had used his political position to steer lucrative business to his insurance firm. He had to publish his income tax returns and denied these allegations in an NBC broadcast and an interview in Collier's magazine. This became known as the Jimmy's Got It affair after Alva Johnston's reportage in the Saturday Evening Post. Roosevelt resigned from his White House position in November 1938.[2][6]
Hollywood[edit]
After leaving the White House, Roosevelt moved to Hollywood, California, where he first accepted a job as a $750/week administrative assistant for motion picture producer Samuel Goldwyn. He was on Goldwyn's payroll until November 1940. In 1939 he set up "Globe Productions", a company to produce short films for penny arcades, but the company was liquidated in 1944 while James was on active duty with the Marine Corps.[2] Roosevelt also produced the film Pot o' Gold and distributed the British film Pastor Hall.
During his Hollywood period, Roosevelt became involved with Joseph Schenck, the movie mogul who funnelled mob money to the Democratic Party. Schenck also lent money for Roosevelt's movie. When Schenck was jailed for income tax evasion, Roosevelt interceded with his father to pardon him, but again Henry Morgenthau, Jr. vetoed the plan. Roosevelt later wrote that "Stories appeared that I was mixed up with Mafia mobsters."[7]
Military career[edit]




Roosevelt as a Marine Corps lieutenant colonel in World War II


World War II broke out in Europe in September 1939; the following month Roosevelt resigned the lieutenant colonel's commission that he had been given in 1936, and was instead commissioned as a captain in the Marine Corps Reserve. He went on active duty in November 1940.
In April 1941, President Roosevelt sent James Roosevelt on a secret, world-circling diplomatic mission to assure numerous governments that the United States would soon be in the war. The leaders contacted included Chiang Kai-shek in China, King Farouk in Egypt, and King George of Greece. During this trip, Roosevelt came under German air attack in both Crete and Iraq. In the African/Middle Eastern portion of the mission, he traveled with Britain's Lord Mountbatten as far as Bathurst in the Gambia. They reported on trans-African air ferry conditions, an important concern of FDR and Winston Churchill at the time.[8][9] In August, Roosevelt joined the staff of William J. Donovan, Coordinator of Information, with the job of working out the exchange of information with other agencies.[2]
World War II[edit]
After Japan's Attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, Roosevelt requested assignment to combat duty and was transferred to the Marine Raiders in January 1942, a new Marine Corps commando force, and became second-in-command of the 2nd Raider Battalion under Evans Carlson (Carlson's Raiders) whom Roosevelt knew when Carlson commanded the Marine Detachment at the Warm Springs, Georgia residence of Franklin Roosevelt. Roosevelt's influence helped win presidential backing for the Raiders, who were opposed by Marine Corps traditionalists.
Despite occasionally debilitating health problems, Roosevelt served with the 2nd Raiders at Midway as a major in early June 1942 and in the Makin Island raid on August 17–18, 1942, where he and several others were awarded the Navy Cross. In October, he was given command of the new 4th Raiders, but during training for an upcoming combat operation he became ill enough to be hospitalized in February 1943.[10] Beginning in August 1943, he served in various staff positions during the rest of the war. He was attached to and landed with the U.S. Army's 165th Regimental Combat Team, 27th infantry Division during the invasion of Makin on November 20–23, and was awarded the Silver Star by the Army.[11] He was promoted to colonel on April 13, 1944. He was released from active duty in August 1945 and was placed on the inactive list in October 1945. That same month he became a Compatriot of the Empire State Society of the Sons of the American Revolution.
Roosevelt continued in the Marine Corps Reserve, and retired on October 1, 1959 with the advanced rank of brigadier general.[9] Roosevelt suffered from flat feet, and while other Marines were required to wear boots, he was allowed to wear sneakers.[12]

Navy Cross citation[edit]

"The Navy Cross is presented to James Roosevelt, Major, U.S. Marine Corps (Reserve), for extraordinary heroism and distinguished service as second in command of the Second Marine Raider Battalion against enemy Japanese armed forces on Makin island. Risking his own life over and above the ordinary call of duty, Major Roosevelt continually exposed himself to intense machine-gun and sniper fire to ensure effective control of operations from the command post. As a result of his successful maintenance of communications with his supporting vessels, two enemy surface ships, whose presence was reported, were destroyed by gun fire. Later during evacuation, he displayed exemplary courage in personally rescuing three men from drowning in the heavy surf. His gallant conduct and his inspiring devotion to duty were in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service."[11]

For the President,
Chester W. Nimitz
Silver Star citation[edit]

"The President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star (Army Award) to Lieutenant Colonel James R. Roosevelt (MCSN: 0-5477), United States Marine Corps, for gallantry in action at Makin Atoll, Gilbert Islands, 20 to 23 November 1943. Attached as an observer to the units of the 27th Infantry Division which effected the landing on Makin Atoll, Lieutenant Colonel Roosevelt voluntarily sought out the scenes of the heaviest fighting. Throughout the three-day period, he continually accompanied the leading elements of the assault, exposing himself to constant danger. His calmness under fire and presence among the foremost elements of the attacking force was a source of inspiration to all ranks."

General Orders: Headquarters, U.S. Army Forces, Central Pacific Area, General Orders No. 55 (1944)(26)
Battle stars[edit]
LtCol Roosevelt was entitled to campaign participation credit (i.e., the "battle stars" worn on the Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal) for the following actions:[citation needed]

Battle of Midway, June 3-6, 1942 (Navy P-7)
Capture and Defense of Guadalcanal, August 10, 1942 - February 8, 1943 (Navy P-9)
Makin Raid, August 17-18, 1942 (Navy P-10)
Eastern Mandates November 1943 - January 1944 (Army, for Makin)

Post-war career[edit]
After the war, Roosevelt returned to live in California. He rejoined Roosevelt and Sargent as an executive vice president, and established the company's office in Los Angeles. In 1946 he became chairman of the board of Roosevelt and Haines, successor to Roosevelt and Sargent. He later became president of Roosevelt and Company, Inc.
On July 21, 1946, Roosevelt became chairman of the California State Democratic Central Committee. He also began making daily radio broadcasts of political commentary. Like his brother Elliott, James Roosevelt was prominent in the movement to draft Dwight Eisenhower as the Democratic candidate for President in 1948. When President Truman was renominated instead, Roosevelt stepped down as state chairman on August 8. He remained a Democratic National Committeeman until 1952.[2]
In 1950, Roosevelt was the Democratic candidate for Governor of California, but lost to Republican incumbent Earl Warren by almost 30% of the votes.[13]
In 1954, Roosevelt was elected U.S. Representative from California's 26th congressional district, a "safe" Democratic district.[13] He was re-elected to five additional terms and served from 1955 to 1965, resigning during his sixth term. Roosevelt was one of the first politicians to denounce the tactics of Senator Joseph McCarthy. He was also the only Representative to vote against appropriating funds for the House Un-American Activities Committee.
In April 1965, Roosevelt ran for Mayor of Los Angeles, challenging incumbent Sam Yorty, but lost in the primary.[13]
He resigned from Congress in October 1965, 10 months into his sixth term, when President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed him a delegate to the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). Roosevelt resigned from UNESCO in December 1966, and retired to become an executive of the Investors Overseas Service (IOS) in Geneva, Switzerland.[2]
Roosevelt joined IOS despite the overseas firm's concurrent investigation by the SEC for numerous irregularities. In Geneva in May 1969, during the unraveling of IOS, Roosevelt's third wife, Irene Owens, stabbed him "eight times" with his "own Marine combat knife"[14] while he was preparing divorce proceedings.[15] When fugitive financier Robert Vesco obtained control of IOS from Bernie Cornfeld and absconded with approximately $200 million, Roosevelt initially stayed on under Vesco. Roosevelt later wrote that "As soon as I saw the situation for what it was, in 1971, I resigned my position."[16] However, this episode resulted in federal charges being laid against Roosevelt and several others, and in a Swiss arrest warrant. Roosevelt returned to California, settling in Newport Beach, and charges were dropped. He became associated with the Nixon Administration in several capacities and remained friendly with Richard Nixon until his death.[17]
Despite having been a liberal Democrat all of his life, Roosevelt joined Democrats for Nixon and publicly supported President Nixon's 1972 re-election,[18] and also supported Ronald Reagan in 1980[19] and 1984.[20]
His writings include Affectionately, FDR (with Sidney Shalett, 1959) and My Parents, a Differing View (with Bill Libby, 1976). The latter was written in part as a response to his brother Elliott Roosevelt's book An Untold Story, which told of FDR's marital issues and was fiercely repudiated by the other siblings. He authored the novel A Family Matter (with Sam Toperoff, 1979), and edited The Liberal Papers, published in 1962.

Later Controversy

In the 1980s, a non-profit organization established by Roosevelt, the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, and its associated political action committee, were investigated by the House Ways and Means Committee for questionable money raising practices, and by the Post Office for mail fraud. By direct mail, Roosevelt's group solicited contributions from elderly persons by claiming that Social Security and Medicare programs were in financial jeopardy. Roosevelt also urged contributors to order their Social Security statements of earnings from his group (these are free from the government.) [21][22]
Family and death[edit]
His first marriage was to philanthropist Betsey Maria Cushing (1908–1998), the middle daughter of surgeon Harvey Williams Cushing and Katharine Stone Crowell. Betsey's sisters were socialites Barbara "Babe" Cushing (1915–1978) and Mary Benedict "Minnie" Cushing (1906–1978). James and Betsey had two daughters, Sara (born 1932) and Kate (1936), before divorcing in 1940.

NEW YORK, June 20, 2017 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- FAIR Health, Inc. announced today that it has elected James Roosevelt, Jr. to its Board of Directors. Currently Counsel at Verrill Dana LLP in Boston, Mr. Roosevelt brings to FAIR Health decades of experience as a distinguished business and civic leader with expertise in many aspects of the national healthcare system.








"We welcome Mr. Roosevelt to the FAIR Health Board," said Stephen A. Warnke, Chairman of FAIR Health's Board of Directors. "At a time of unprecedented strain on our healthcare system, Jim's understanding of the issues that affect health plan members, professional and institutional providers, insurers, policy makers, researchers and others adds a uniquely broad-based perspective to inform FAIR Health's core mission of helping all of these stakeholders navigate the challenges of the healthcare sector."
"Mr. Roosevelt's career accomplishments demonstrate his continuing commitment to maintaining a broadly effective healthcare system and aiding individual consumers in navigating that system—issues critical to FAIR Health's mission," stated Robin Gelburd, President of FAIR Health. "As the needs of the populations we serve continue to evolve, and we seek to keep pace with innovative ways to package and share our claims data assets, his experience in both healthcare policy and administration will make him a valuable addition to our Board."
Mr. Roosevelt served for more than 10 years as the President and Chief Executive Officer of Tufts Health Plan. Former chair of America's Health Insurance Plans, he currently chairs the organization's Policy and Regulatory Committee. Previously, Mr. Roosevelt chaired the Massachusetts Hospital Association and the Massachusetts Association of Health Plans; he also served on the Board of the American Hospital Association and is a past president of the American Health Lawyers Association. In 2016, Mr. Roosevelt was a distinguished Visiting Fellow at Harvard's Institute of Politics at the John F. Kennedy School of Government. In 2008, President-Elect Barack Obama appointed Mr. Roosevelt to his transition team to co-chair a review of the Social Security Administration. 
"I am excited to join FAIR Health's Board," said Mr. Roosevelt. "Healthcare today is at a crossroads. With its comprehensive, independent data repository revealing the way care is being delivered, and at what cost, FAIR Health is in a unique position to add clarity to the national conversation on health policy. It is a privilege to join the FAIR Health Board and to help guide this organization in its service to all healthcare system participants."
About FAIR Health
FAIR Health is a national, independent, nonprofit organization dedicated to bringing transparency to healthcare costs and health insurance information through data products, consumer resources and health systems research support. FAIR Health oversees the nation's largest collection of healthcare claims data, which includes a repository of over 23 billion billed medical and dental procedures that reflect the claims experience of over 150 million privately insured individuals, and separate data representing the experience of more than 55 million individuals enrolled in Medicare. Certified by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) as a Qualified Entity, FAIR Health receives all of Medicare Parts A, B and D claims data for use in nationwide transparency efforts. FAIR Health licenses its privately billed data and data products—including benchmark modules, data visualizations, custom analytics, episodes of care analytics and market indices—to commercial insurers and self-insurers, employers, hospitals and healthcare systems, government agencies, researchers and others. FAIR Health has earned HITRUST CSF and Service Organization Controls (SOC 2) certifications by meeting the rigorous data security standards of those organizations. As a testament to FAIR Health's data security and validation protocols, its data have been incorporated in statutes and regulations around the country and designated as the official, neutral data source for a variety of state health programs, including workers' compensation and personal injury protection (PIP) programs. FAIR Health data serve as an official reference point in support of certain state balance billing laws that protect consumers against bills for surprise out-of-network and emergency services. FAIR Health also uses its database to power a free consumer website available in English and Spanish and as an English/Spanish mobile app, which enable consumers to estimate and plan their healthcare expenditures and offer a rich educational platform on health insurance. The website has been honored by the White House Summit on Smart Disclosure, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), URAC, the eHealthcare Leadership Awards, appPicker, Employee Benefit News and Kiplinger's Personal Finance. FAIR Health also is named a top resource for patients in Elisabeth Rosenthal's new book, An American Sickness: How Healthcare Became Big Business and How You Can Take It Back. For more information on FAIR Health, visit fairhealth.org.

Early life[edit]
Roosevelt was born on November 9, 1945 to Congressman James Roosevelt (1907–1991) and Romelle Theresa Schneider (1915–2002).[2] His two full siblings are Michael (born December 7, 1946) and Anna (born January 10, 1948). Through his father, he has two elder half-sisters (Sara and Kate), a younger half-brother (Hall), and a younger half-sister (Rebecca). His paternal grandparents were President Franklin Delano Roosevelt (1882–1945) and First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt (1884–1962).
Roosevelt graduated from La Salle High School in Pasadena in 1963. He earned his A.B. with honors in government from Harvard College in 1968. He later received his J.D. from Harvard Law School and completed the Advanced Management Program at Harvard Business School.
Career[edit]
On June 12, 1968, following his graduation from Harvard, he was commissioned in the Naval Reserve and rose to the rank of lieutenant on July 1, 1971.[3]
After obtaining his J.D. from Harvard Law, Roosevelt spent 10 years as partner at Choate, Hall & Stewart in Boston, Massachusetts. Roosevelt was the associate commissioner for Retirement Policy for the Social Security Administration before joining Tufts Health Plan in 1999 as senior vice president and general counsel. He held that position until June 2005, when he became President and Chief Executive Officer of Tufts Health Plan.[4]
In 1986, he ran for Congress, losing the Democratic Primary to Joseph P. Kennedy, II.[5]
He has also served as chief legal counsel for the Massachusetts Democratic Party. He is past chairman of the board of trustees for the Massachusetts Hospital Association, past president of the American Health Lawyers Association and past chairman of the board of trustees for Mount Auburn Hospital. Currently, Roosevelt serves as chairman of the board of directors for Massachusetts Association of Health Plans, and as a member of the boards at America's Health Insurance Plans, Catholic Democrats, Emmanuel College, and the Kenneth B. Schwartz Center.
He was called upon in 2008 to oversee hearings on controversies related to seating delegates from Florida and Michigan to the 2008 Democratic National Convention. Roosevelt was described as "detail-oriented," and as having great "institutional knowledge." He had not publicly endorsed either Clinton or Obama before the committee meeting.[6][7][8]
Personal life[edit]
On June 15, 1968, Roosevelt married Ann Martha Conlon (born March 31, 1945), the daughter of Walter N. Conlon, and a 1966 graduate of Radcliffe College.[9][10] Together, they have three daughters:[11]

Kathleen Ann Roosevelt (born 1978), who married Jeffrey Walker in 2007.[12]
Theresa Marie "Tracy" Roosevelt (born 1982), who married Robert O’Loughlin in 2016.[13]
Maura Amy Roosevelt (born 1984), who married Joshua Fisher in 2014.[14]

Roosevelt and Eleanor Roosevelt, he received the Navy Cross for extraordinary heroism while serving as a Marine Corps officer during World War II. He served as an official Secretary to the President and in the United States House of Representatives.

Early life[edit]
Roosevelt was born in New York City at 125 East 36th Street. He attended the Potomac School and the National Cathedral School in Washington, D.C., and the Groton School in Massachusetts. At Groton, he rowed and played football, and was a prefect in his senior year. After graduation in 1926, he attended Harvard College, where he rowed with the freshman and junior varsity crews. At Harvard he followed family traditions, joining the Signet Society and Hasty Pudding Club, of which both his father and his maternal granduncle and paternal fifth cousin once removed, President Theodore Roosevelt, had been members, as well as the Fly Club, which his father had joined, and Institute of the 1770. He graduated from Harvard in 1930 and was elected permanent treasurer of his class.[2]
After graduation, Roosevelt enrolled in the Boston University School of Law. He also took a sales job with Boston insurance agent Victor De Gerard. Roosevelt was so successful, that within one year, he abandoned his law studies. In 1932 he started his own insurance agency, Roosevelt and Sargent, in partnership with John A. Sargent. As president of Roosevelt & Sargent, he made a substantial fortune (about $500,000). He resigned from the firm in 1937, when he officially went to work in the White House, but retained his half ownership.[3]
Politics and the White House[edit]
Roosevelt attended the 1924 Democratic National Convention where he served, in his words, as his father's "page and prop". In 1928, he and some Harvard classmates campaigned for Democratic Presidential nominee Al Smith. In 1932, he headed FDR's Massachusetts campaign; he made about two hundred campaign speeches that year. Though FDR lost the Massachusetts Democratic primary (to Smith), he easily carried Massachusetts in the November election. James Roosevelt was viewed as his father's political deputy in Massachusetts, allocating patronage in alliance with Boston mayor James Michael Curley. He was also a delegate from Massachusetts to the Constitutional Convention for the repeal of Prohibition in 1933.
Roosevelt was a close protege of Joseph P. Kennedy Sr.. In 1934, the two journeyed to England to obtain the market in post-prohibition liquor imports.[1] Many of Roosevelt's controversial business ventures were aided by Kennedy, including his maritime insurance interests, and the National Grain Yeast Corp. affair (1933-5). Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau, Jr. threatened to resign unless FDR forced James to leave the latter company, suspected of being a front for bootlegging.[4] James Roosevelt was instrumental in securing Kennedy's appointment as ambassador to the United Kingdom.[5]
In April 1936, Presidential Secretary Louis Howe died. James Roosevelt unofficially assumed Howe's duties.[3] Soon after the 1936 re-election of FDR, James Roosevelt was given a direct commission as a lieutenant colonel in the Marine Corps, which caused public controversy for its obvious political implications. He accompanied his father to the Inter-American Conference at Buenos Aires in December as a military aide. On January 6, 1937, he was officially appointed "administrative assistant to the President"; on July 1, 1937, he was appointed Secretary to the President.[2] He became White House coordinator for eighteen federal agencies in October 1937.
James Roosevelt was considered among his father's most important counselors. Time magazine suggested he might be considered "Assistant President of the United States".[3]
In July 1938, there were allegations that James Roosevelt had used his political position to steer lucrative business to his insurance firm. He had to publish his income tax returns and denied these allegations in an NBC broadcast and an interview in Collier's magazine. This became known as the Jimmy's Got It affair after Alva Johnston's reportage in the Saturday Evening Post. Roosevelt resigned from his White House position in November 1938.[2][6]
Hollywood[edit]
After leaving the White House, Roosevelt moved to Hollywood, California, where he first accepted a job as a $750/week administrative assistant for motion picture producer Samuel Goldwyn. He was on Goldwyn's payroll until November 1940. In 1939 he set up "Globe Productions", a company to produce short films for penny arcades, but the company was liquidated in 1944 while James was on active duty with the Marine Corps.[2] Roosevelt also produced the film Pot o' Gold and distributed the British film Pastor Hall.
During his Hollywood period, Roosevelt became involved with Joseph Schenck, the movie mogul who funnelled mob money to the Democratic Party. Schenck also lent money for Roosevelt's movie. When Schenck was jailed for income tax evasion, Roosevelt interceded with his father to pardon him, but again Henry Morgenthau, Jr. vetoed the plan. Roosevelt later wrote that "Stories appeared that I was mixed up with Mafia mobsters."[7]
Military career[edit]




Roosevelt as a Marine Corps lieutenant colonel in World War II


World War II broke out in Europe in September 1939; the following month Roosevelt resigned the lieutenant colonel's commission that he had been given in 1936, and was instead commissioned as a captain in the Marine Corps Reserve. He went on active duty in November 1940.
In April 1941, President Roosevelt sent James Roosevelt on a secret, world-circling diplomatic mission to assure numerous governments that the United States would soon be in the war. The leaders contacted included Chiang Kai-shek in China, King Farouk in Egypt, and King George of Greece. During this trip, Roosevelt came under German air attack in both Crete and Iraq. In the African/Middle Eastern portion of the mission, he traveled with Britain's Lord Mountbatten as far as Bathurst in the Gambia. They reported on trans-African air ferry conditions, an important concern of FDR and Winston Churchill at the time.[8][9] In August, Roosevelt joined the staff of William J. Donovan, Coordinator of Information, with the job of working out the exchange of information with other agencies.[2]
World War II[edit]
After Japan's Attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, Roosevelt requested assignment to combat duty and was transferred to the Marine Raiders in January 1942, a new Marine Corps commando force, and became second-in-command of the 2nd Raider Battalion under Evans Carlson (Carlson's Raiders) whom Roosevelt knew when Carlson commanded the Marine Detachment at the Warm Springs, Georgia residence of Franklin Roosevelt. Roosevelt's influence helped win presidential backing for the Raiders, who were opposed by Marine Corps traditionalists.
Despite occasionally debilitating health problems, Roosevelt served with the 2nd Raiders at Midway as a major in early June 1942 and in the Makin Island raid on August 17–18, 1942, where he and several others were awarded the Navy Cross. In October, he was given command of the new 4th Raiders, but during training for an upcoming combat operation he became ill enough to be hospitalized in February 1943.[10] Beginning in August 1943, he served in various staff positions during the rest of the war. He was attached to and landed with the U.S. Army's 165th Regimental Combat Team, 27th infantry Division during the invasion of Makin on November 20–23, and was awarded the Silver Star by the Army.[11] He was promoted to colonel on April 13, 1944. He was released from active duty in August 1945 and was placed on the inactive list in October 1945. That same month he became a Compatriot of the Empire State Society of the Sons of the American Revolution.
Roosevelt continued in the Marine Corps Reserve, and retired on October 1, 1959 with the advanced rank of brigadier general.[9] Roosevelt suffered from flat feet, and while other Marines were required to wear boots, he was allowed to wear sneakers.[12]

Navy Cross citation[edit]

"The Navy Cross is presented to James Roosevelt, Major, U.S. Marine Corps (Reserve), for extraordinary heroism and distinguished service as second in command of the Second Marine Raider Battalion against enemy Japanese armed forces on Makin island. Risking his own life over and above the ordinary call of duty, Major Roosevelt continually exposed himself to intense machine-gun and sniper fire to ensure effective control of operations from the command post. As a result of his successful maintenance of communications with his supporting vessels, two enemy surface ships, whose presence was reported, were destroyed by gun fire. Later during evacuation, he displayed exemplary courage in personally rescuing three men from drowning in the heavy surf. His gallant conduct and his inspiring devotion to duty were in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service."[11]

For the President,
Chester W. Nimitz
Silver Star citation[edit]

"The President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star (Army Award) to Lieutenant Colonel James R. Roosevelt (MCSN: 0-5477), United States Marine Corps, for gallantry in action at Makin Atoll, Gilbert Islands, 20 to 23 November 1943. Attached as an observer to the units of the 27th Infantry Division which effected the landing on Makin Atoll, Lieutenant Colonel Roosevelt voluntarily sought out the scenes of the heaviest fighting. Throughout the three-day period, he continually accompanied the leading elements of the assault, exposing himself to constant danger. His calmness under fire and presence among the foremost elements of the attacking force was a source of inspiration to all ranks."

General Orders: Headquarters, U.S. Army Forces, Central Pacific Area, General Orders No. 55 (1944)(26)
Battle stars[edit]
LtCol Roosevelt was entitled to campaign participation credit (i.e., the "battle stars" worn on the Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal) for the following actions:[citation needed]

Battle of Midway, June 3-6, 1942 (Navy P-7)
Capture and Defense of Guadalcanal, August 10, 1942 - February 8, 1943 (Navy P-9)
Makin Raid, August 17-18, 1942 (Navy P-10)
Eastern Mandates November 1943 - January 1944 (Army, for Makin)

Post-war career[edit]
After the war, Roosevelt returned to live in California. He rejoined Roosevelt and Sargent as an executive vice president, and established the company's office in Los Angeles. In 1946 he became chairman of the board of Roosevelt and Haines, successor to Roosevelt and Sargent. He later became president of Roosevelt and Company, Inc.
On July 21, 1946, Roosevelt became chairman of the California State Democratic Central Committee. He also began making daily radio broadcasts of political commentary. Like his brother Elliott, James Roosevelt was prominent in the movement to draft Dwight Eisenhower as the Democratic candidate for President in 1948. When President Truman was renominated instead, Roosevelt stepped down as state chairman on August 8. He remained a Democratic National Committeeman until 1952.[2]
In 1950, Roosevelt was the Democratic candidate for Governor of California, but lost to Republican incumbent Earl Warren by almost 30% of the votes.[13]
In 1954, Roosevelt was elected U.S. Representative from California's 26th congressional district, a "safe" Democratic district.[13] He was re-elected to five additional terms and served from 1955 to 1965, resigning during his sixth term. Roosevelt was one of the first politicians to denounce the tactics of Senator Joseph McCarthy. He was also the only Representative to vote against appropriating funds for the House Un-American Activities Committee.
In April 1965, Roosevelt ran for Mayor of Los Angeles, challenging incumbent Sam Yorty, but lost in the primary.[13]
He resigned from Congress in October 1965, 10 months into his sixth term, when President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed him a delegate to the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). Roosevelt resigned from UNESCO in December 1966, and retired to become an executive of the Investors Overseas Service (IOS) in Geneva, Switzerland.[2]
Roosevelt joined IOS despite the overseas firm's concurrent investigation by the SEC for numerous irregularities. In Geneva in May 1969, during the unraveling of IOS, Roosevelt's third wife, Irene Owens, stabbed him "eight times" with his "own Marine combat knife"[14] while he was preparing divorce proceedings.[15] When fugitive financier Robert Vesco obtained control of IOS from Bernie Cornfeld and absconded with approximately $200 million, Roosevelt initially stayed on under Vesco. Roosevelt later wrote that "As soon as I saw the situation for what it was, in 1971, I resigned my position."[16] However, this episode resulted in federal charges being laid against Roosevelt and several others, and in a Swiss arrest warrant. Roosevelt returned to California, settling in Newport Beach, and charges were dropped. He became associated with the Nixon Administration in several capacities and remained friendly with Richard Nixon until his death.[17]
Despite having been a liberal Democrat all of his life, Roosevelt joined Democrats for Nixon and publicly supported President Nixon's 1972 re-election,[18] and also supported Ronald Reagan in 1980[19] and 1984.[20]
His writings include Affectionately, FDR (with Sidney Shalett, 1959) and My Parents, a Differing View (with Bill Libby, 1976). The latter was written in part as a response to his brother Elliott Roosevelt's book An Untold Story, which told of FDR's marital issues and was fiercely repudiated by the other siblings. He authored the novel A Family Matter (with Sam Toperoff, 1979), and edited The Liberal Papers, published in 1962.

Later Controversy

In the 1980s, a non-profit organization established by Roosevelt, the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, and its associated political action committee, were investigated by the House Ways and Means Committee for questionable money raising practices, and by the Post Office for mail fraud. By direct mail, Roosevelt's group solicited contributions from elderly persons by claiming that Social Security and Medicare programs were in financial jeopardy. Roosevelt also urged contributors to order their Social Security statements of earnings from his group (these are free from the government.) [21][22]
Family and death[edit]
His first marriage was to philanthropist Betsey Maria Cushing (1908–1998), the middle daughter of surgeon Harvey Williams Cushing and Katharine Stone Crowell. Betsey's sisters were socialites Barbara "Babe" Cushing (1915–1978) and Mary Benedict "Minnie" Cushing (1906–1978). James and Betsey had two daughters, Sara (born 1932) and Kate (1936), before divorcing in 1940.
James married his nurse Romelle Theresa Schneider (1915) the next year. They had three children, James Jr. (born 1945), Michael (born 1946), and Anna (born 1948).
In 1956, he married Gladys Irene Owens (c.1917–1987),[23] his receptionist, and they had a son together named Hall (called "Del") in 1959.
He married his fourth wife, Mary Winskill, teacher to his youngest son "Del," in 1969. They had one daughter, Rebecca, in 1971.[24]

Death

Roosevelt died in Newport Beach, California in 1991 of complications arising from a stroke and Parkinson's disease. He was 83 and was the last surviving child of Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt.[25]

Roosevelt and Eleanor Roosevelt, he received the Navy Cross for extraordinary heroism while serving as a Marine Corps officer during World War II. He served as an official Secretary to the President and in the United States House of Representatives.

Early life[edit]
Roosevelt was born in New York City at 125 East 36th Street. He attended the Potomac School and the National Cathedral School in Washington, D.C., and the Groton School in Massachusetts. At Groton, he rowed and played football, and was a prefect in his senior year. After graduation in 1926, he attended Harvard College, where he rowed with the freshman and junior varsity crews. At Harvard he followed family traditions, joining the Signet Society and Hasty Pudding Club, of which both his father and his maternal granduncle and paternal fifth cousin once removed, President Theodore Roosevelt, had been members, as well as the Fly Club, which his father had joined, and Institute of the 1770. He graduated from Harvard in 1930 and was elected permanent treasurer of his class.[2]
After graduation, Roosevelt enrolled in the Boston University School of Law. He also took a sales job with Boston insurance agent Victor De Gerard. Roosevelt was so successful, that within one year, he abandoned his law studies. In 1932 he started his own insurance agency, Roosevelt and Sargent, in partnership with John A. Sargent. As president of Roosevelt & Sargent, he made a substantial fortune (about $500,000). He resigned from the firm in 1937, when he officially went to work in the White House, but retained his half ownership.[3]
Politics and the White House[edit]
Roosevelt attended the 1924 Democratic National Convention where he served, in his words, as his father's "page and prop". In 1928, he and some Harvard classmates campaigned for Democratic Presidential nominee Al Smith. In 1932, he headed FDR's Massachusetts campaign; he made about two hundred campaign speeches that year. Though FDR lost the Massachusetts Democratic primary (to Smith), he easily carried Massachusetts in the November election. James Roosevelt was viewed as his father's political deputy in Massachusetts, allocating patronage in alliance with Boston mayor James Michael Curley. He was also a delegate from Massachusetts to the Constitutional Convention for the repeal of Prohibition in 1933.
Roosevelt was a close protege of Joseph P. Kennedy Sr.. In 1934, the two journeyed to England to obtain the market in post-prohibition liquor imports.[1] Many of Roosevelt's controversial business ventures were aided by Kennedy, including his maritime insurance interests, and the National Grain Yeast Corp. affair (1933-5). Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau, Jr. threatened to resign unless FDR forced James to leave the latter company, suspected of being a front for bootlegging.[4] James Roosevelt was instrumental in securing Kennedy's appointment as ambassador to the United Kingdom.[5]
In April 1936, Presidential Secretary Louis Howe died. James Roosevelt unofficially assumed Howe's duties.[3] Soon after the 1936 re-election of FDR, James Roosevelt was given a direct commission as a lieutenant colonel in the Marine Corps, which caused public controversy for its obvious political implications. He accompanied his father to the Inter-American Conference at Buenos Aires in December as a military aide. On January 6, 1937, he was officially appointed "administrative assistant to the President"; on July 1, 1937, he was appointed Secretary to the President.[2] He became White House coordinator for eighteen federal agencies in October 1937.
James Roosevelt was considered among his father's most important counselors. Time magazine suggested he might be considered "Assistant President of the United States".[3]
In July 1938, there were allegations that James Roosevelt had used his political position to steer lucrative business to his insurance firm. He had to publish his income tax returns and denied these allegations in an NBC broadcast and an interview in Collier's magazine. This became known as the Jimmy's Got It affair after Alva Johnston's reportage in the Saturday Evening Post. Roosevelt resigned from his White House position in November 1938.[2][6]
Hollywood[edit]
After leaving the White House, Roosevelt moved to Hollywood, California, where he first accepted a job as a $750/week administrative assistant for motion picture producer Samuel Goldwyn. He was on Goldwyn's payroll until November 1940. In 1939 he set up "Globe Productions", a company to produce short films for penny arcades, but the company was liquidated in 1944 while James was on active duty with the Marine Corps.[2] Roosevelt also produced the film Pot o' Gold and distributed the British film Pastor Hall.
During his Hollywood period, Roosevelt became involved with Joseph Schenck, the movie mogul who funnelled mob money to the Democratic Party. Schenck also lent money for Roosevelt's movie. When Schenck was jailed for income tax evasion, Roosevelt interceded with his father to pardon him, but again Henry Morgenthau, Jr. vetoed the plan. Roosevelt later wrote that "Stories appeared that I was mixed up with Mafia mobsters."[7]
Military career[edit]




Roosevelt as a Marine Corps lieutenant colonel in World War II


World War II broke out in Europe in September 1939; the following month Roosevelt resigned the lieutenant colonel's commission that he had been given in 1936, and was instead commissioned as a captain in the Marine Corps Reserve. He went on active duty in November 1940.
In April 1941, President Roosevelt sent James Roosevelt on a secret, world-circling diplomatic mission to assure numerous governments that the United States would soon be in the war. The leaders contacted included Chiang Kai-shek in China, King Farouk in Egypt, and King George of Greece. During this trip, Roosevelt came under German air attack in both Crete and Iraq. In the African/Middle Eastern portion of the mission, he traveled with Britain's Lord Mountbatten as far as Bathurst in the Gambia. They reported on trans-African air ferry conditions, an important concern of FDR and Winston Churchill at the time.[8][9] In August, Roosevelt joined the staff of William J. Donovan, Coordinator of Information, with the job of working out the exchange of information with other agencies.[2]
World War II[edit]
After Japan's Attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, Roosevelt requested assignment to combat duty and was transferred to the Marine Raiders in January 1942, a new Marine Corps commando force, and became second-in-command of the 2nd Raider Battalion under Evans Carlson (Carlson's Raiders) whom Roosevelt knew when Carlson commanded the Marine Detachment at the Warm Springs, Georgia residence of Franklin Roosevelt. Roosevelt's influence helped win presidential backing for the Raiders, who were opposed by Marine Corps traditionalists.
Despite occasionally debilitating health problems, Roosevelt served with the 2nd Raiders at Midway as a major in early June 1942 and in the Makin Island raid on August 17–18, 1942, where he and several others were awarded the Navy Cross. In October, he was given command of the new 4th Raiders, but during training for an upcoming combat operation he became ill enough to be hospitalized in February 1943.[10] Beginning in August 1943, he served in various staff positions during the rest of the war. He was attached to and landed with the U.S. Army's 165th Regimental Combat Team, 27th infantry Division during the invasion of Makin on November 20–23, and was awarded the Silver Star by the Army.[11] He was promoted to colonel on April 13, 1944. He was released from active duty in August 1945 and was placed on the inactive list in October 1945. That same month he became a Compatriot of the Empire State Society of the Sons of the American Revolution.
Roosevelt continued in the Marine Corps Reserve, and retired on October 1, 1959 with the advanced rank of brigadier general.[9] Roosevelt suffered from flat feet, and while other Marines were required to wear boots, he was allowed to wear sneakers.[12]

Navy Cross citation[edit]

"The Navy Cross is presented to James Roosevelt, Major, U.S. Marine Corps (Reserve), for extraordinary heroism and distinguished service as second in command of the Second Marine Raider Battalion against enemy Japanese armed forces on Makin island. Risking his own life over and above the ordinary call of duty, Major Roosevelt continually exposed himself to intense machine-gun and sniper fire to ensure effective control of operations from the command post. As a result of his successful maintenance of communications with his supporting vessels, two enemy surface ships, whose presence was reported, were destroyed by gun fire. Later during evacuation, he displayed exemplary courage in personally rescuing three men from drowning in the heavy surf. His gallant conduct and his inspiring devotion to duty were in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service."[11]

For the President,
Chester W. Nimitz
Silver Star citation[edit]

"The President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star (Army Award) to Lieutenant Colonel James R. Roosevelt (MCSN: 0-5477), United States Marine Corps, for gallantry in action at Makin Atoll, Gilbert Islands, 20 to 23 November 1943. Attached as an observer to the units of the 27th Infantry Division which effected the landing on Makin Atoll, Lieutenant Colonel Roosevelt voluntarily sought out the scenes of the heaviest fighting. Throughout the three-day period, he continually accompanied the leading elements of the assault, exposing himself to constant danger. His calmness under fire and presence among the foremost elements of the attacking force was a source of inspiration to all ranks."

General Orders: Headquarters, U.S. Army Forces, Central Pacific Area, General Orders No. 55 (1944)(26)
Battle stars[edit]
LtCol Roosevelt was entitled to campaign participation credit (i.e., the "battle stars" worn on the Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal) for the following actions:[citation needed]

Battle of Midway, June 3-6, 1942 (Navy P-7)
Capture and Defense of Guadalcanal, August 10, 1942 - February 8, 1943 (Navy P-9)
Makin Raid, August 17-18, 1942 (Navy P-10)
Eastern Mandates November 1943 - January 1944 (Army, for Makin)

Post-war career[edit]
After the war, Roosevelt returned to live in California. He rejoined Roosevelt and Sargent as an executive vice president, and established the company's office in Los Angeles. In 1946 he became chairman of the board of Roosevelt and Haines, successor to Roosevelt and Sargent. He later became president of Roosevelt and Company, Inc.
On July 21, 1946, Roosevelt became chairman of the California State Democratic Central Committee. He also began making daily radio broadcasts of political commentary. Like his brother Elliott, James Roosevelt was prominent in the movement to draft Dwight Eisenhower as the Democratic candidate for President in 1948. When President Truman was renominated instead, Roosevelt stepped down as state chairman on August 8. He remained a Democratic National Committeeman until 1952.[2]
In 1950, Roosevelt was the Democratic candidate for Governor of California, but lost to Republican incumbent Earl Warren by almost 30% of the votes.[13]
In 1954, Roosevelt was elected U.S. Representative from California's 26th congressional district, a "safe" Democratic district.[13] He was re-elected to five additional terms and served from 1955 to 1965, resigning during his sixth term. Roosevelt was one of the first politicians to denounce the tactics of Senator Joseph McCarthy. He was also the only Representative to vote against appropriating funds for the House Un-American Activities Committee.
In April 1965, Roosevelt ran for Mayor of Los Angeles, challenging incumbent Sam Yorty, but lost in the primary.[13]
He resigned from Congress in October 1965, 10 months into his sixth term, when President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed him a delegate to the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). Roosevelt resigned from UNESCO in December 1966, and retired to become an executive of the Investors Overseas Service (IOS) in Geneva, Switzerland.[2]
Roosevelt joined IOS despite the overseas firm's concurrent investigation by the SEC for numerous irregularities. In Geneva in May 1969, during the unraveling of IOS, Roosevelt's third wife, Irene Owens, stabbed him "eight times" with his "own Marine combat knife"[14] while he was preparing divorce proceedings.[15] When fugitive financier Robert Vesco obtained control of IOS from Bernie Cornfeld and absconded with approximately $200 million, Roosevelt initially stayed on under Vesco. Roosevelt later wrote that "As soon as I saw the situation for what it was, in 1971, I resigned my position."[16] However, this episode resulted in federal charges being laid against Roosevelt and several others, and in a Swiss arrest warrant. Roosevelt returned to California, settling in Newport Beach, and charges were dropped. He became associated with the Nixon Administration in several capacities and remained friendly with Richard Nixon until his death.[17]
Despite having been a liberal Democrat all of his life, Roosevelt joined Democrats for Nixon and publicly supported President Nixon's 1972 re-election,[18] and also supported Ronald Reagan in 1980[19] and 1984.[20]
His writings include Affectionately, FDR (with Sidney Shalett, 1959) and My Parents, a Differing View (with Bill Libby, 1976). The latter was written in part as a response to his brother Elliott Roosevelt's book An Untold Story, which told of FDR's marital issues and was fiercely repudiated by the other siblings. He authored the novel A Family Matter (with Sam Toperoff, 1979), and edited The Liberal Papers, published in 1962.

Later Controversy

In the 1980s, a non-profit organization established by Roosevelt, the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, and its associated political action committee, were investigated by the House Ways and Means Committee for questionable money raising practices, and by the Post Office for mail fraud. By direct mail, Roosevelt's group solicited contributions from elderly persons by claiming that Social Security and Medicare programs were in financial jeopardy. Roosevelt also urged contributors to order their Social Security statements of earnings from his group (these are free from the government.) [21][22]
Family and death[edit]
His first marriage was to philanthropist Betsey Maria Cushing (1908–1998), the middle daughter of surgeon Harvey Williams Cushing and Katharine Stone Crowell. Betsey's sisters were socialites Barbara "Babe" Cushing (1915–1978) and Mary Benedict "Minnie" Cushing (1906–1978). James and Betsey had two daughters, Sara (born 1932) and Kate (1936), before divorcing in 1940.
James married his nurse Romelle Theresa Schneider (1915) the next year. They had three children, James Jr. (born 1945), Michael (born 1946), and Anna (born 1948).
In 1956, he married Gladys Irene Owens (c.1917–1987),[23] his receptionist, and they had a son together named Hall (called "Del") in 1959.
He married his fourth wife, Mary Winskill, teacher to his youngest son "Del," in 1969. They had one daughter, Rebecca, in 1971.[24]

Death

Roosevelt died in Newport Beach, California in 1991 of complications arising from a stroke and Parkinson's disease. He was 83 and was the last surviving child of Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt.[25]

Early life[edit]
Roosevelt was born on November 9, 1945 to Congressman James Roosevelt (1907–1991) and Romelle Theresa Schneider (1915–2002).[2] His two full siblings are Michael (born December 7, 1946) and Anna (born January 10, 1948). Through his father, he has two elder half-sisters (Sara and Kate), a younger half-brother (Hall), and a younger half-sister (Rebecca). His paternal grandparents were President Franklin Delano Roosevelt (1882–1945) and First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt (1884–1962).
Roosevelt graduated from La Salle High School in Pasadena in 1963. He earned his A.B. with honors in government from Harvard College in 1968. He later received his J.D. from Harvard Law School and completed the Advanced Management Program at Harvard Business School.
Career[edit]
On June 12, 1968, following his graduation from Harvard, he was commissioned in the Naval Reserve and rose to the rank of lieutenant on July 1, 1971.[3]
After obtaining his J.D. from Harvard Law, Roosevelt spent 10 years as partner at Choate, Hall & Stewart in Boston, Massachusetts. Roosevelt was the associate commissioner for Retirement Policy for the Social Security Administration before joining Tufts Health Plan in 1999 as senior vice president and general counsel. He held that position until June 2005, when he became President and Chief Executive Officer of Tufts Health Plan.[4]
In 1986, he ran for Congress, losing the Democratic Primary to Joseph P. Kennedy, II.[5]
He has also served as chief legal counsel for the Massachusetts Democratic Party. He is past chairman of the board of trustees for the Massachusetts Hospital Association, past president of the American Health Lawyers Association and past chairman of the board of trustees for Mount Auburn Hospital. Currently, Roosevelt serves as chairman of the board of directors for Massachusetts Association of Health Plans, and as a member of the boards at America's Health Insurance Plans, Catholic Democrats, Emmanuel College, and the Kenneth B. Schwartz Center.
He was called upon in 2008 to oversee hearings on controversies related to seating delegates from Florida and Michigan to the 2008 Democratic National Convention. Roosevelt was described as "detail-oriented," and as having great "institutional knowledge." He had not publicly endorsed either Clinton or Obama before the committee meeting.[6][7][8]
Personal life[edit]
On June 15, 1968, Roosevelt married Ann Martha Conlon (born March 31, 1945), the daughter of Walter N. Conlon, and a 1966 graduate of Radcliffe College.[9][10] Together, they have three daughters:[11]

Kathleen Ann Roosevelt (born 1978), who married Jeffrey Walker in 2007.[12]
Theresa Marie "Tracy" Roosevelt (born 1982), who married Robert O’Loughlin in 2016.[13]
Maura Amy Roosevelt (born 1984), who married Joshua Fisher in 2014.[14]

Early life[edit]
Roosevelt was born in New York City at 125 East 36th Street. He attended the Potomac School and the National Cathedral School in Washington, D.C., and the Groton School in Massachusetts. At Groton, he rowed and played football, and was a prefect in his senior year. After graduation in 1926, he attended Harvard College, where he rowed with the freshman and junior varsity crews. At Harvard he followed family traditions, joining the Signet Society and Hasty Pudding Club, of which both his father and his maternal granduncle and paternal fifth cousin once removed, President Theodore Roosevelt, had been members, as well as the Fly Club, which his father had joined, and Institute of the 1770. He graduated from Harvard in 1930 and was elected permanent treasurer of his class.[2]
After graduation, Roosevelt enrolled in the Boston University School of Law. He also took a sales job with Boston insurance agent Victor De Gerard. Roosevelt was so successful, that within one year, he abandoned his law studies. In 1932 he started his own insurance agency, Roosevelt and Sargent, in partnership with John A. Sargent. As president of Roosevelt & Sargent, he made a substantial fortune (about $500,000). He resigned from the firm in 1937, when he officially went to work in the White House, but retained his half ownership.[3]
Politics and the White House[edit]
Roosevelt attended the 1924 Democratic National Convention where he served, in his words, as his father's "page and prop". In 1928, he and some Harvard classmates campaigned for Democratic Presidential nominee Al Smith. In 1932, he headed FDR's Massachusetts campaign; he made about two hundred campaign speeches that year. Though FDR lost the Massachusetts Democratic primary (to Smith), he easily carried Massachusetts in the November election. James Roosevelt was viewed as his father's political deputy in Massachusetts, allocating patronage in alliance with Boston mayor James Michael Curley. He was also a delegate from Massachusetts to the Constitutional Convention for the repeal of Prohibition in 1933.
Roosevelt was a close protege of Joseph P. Kennedy Sr.. In 1934, the two journeyed to England to obtain the market in post-prohibition liquor imports.[1] Many of Roosevelt's controversial business ventures were aided by Kennedy, including his maritime insurance interests, and the National Grain Yeast Corp. affair (1933-5). Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau, Jr. threatened to resign unless FDR forced James to leave the latter company, suspected of being a front for bootlegging.[4] James Roosevelt was instrumental in securing Kennedy's appointment as ambassador to the United Kingdom.[5]
In April 1936, Presidential Secretary Louis Howe died. James Roosevelt unofficially assumed Howe's duties.[3] Soon after the 1936 re-election of FDR, James Roosevelt was given a direct commission as a lieutenant colonel in the Marine Corps, which caused public controversy for its obvious political implications. He accompanied his father to the Inter-American Conference at Buenos Aires in December as a military aide. On January 6, 1937, he was officially appointed "administrative assistant to the President"; on July 1, 1937, he was appointed Secretary to the President.[2] He became White House coordinator for eighteen federal agencies in October 1937.
James Roosevelt was considered among his father's most important counselors. Time magazine suggested he might be considered "Assistant President of the United States".[3]
In July 1938, there were allegations that James Roosevelt had used his political position to steer lucrative business to his insurance firm. He had to publish his income tax returns and denied these allegations in an NBC broadcast and an interview in Collier's magazine. This became known as the Jimmy's Got It affair after Alva Johnston's reportage in the Saturday Evening Post. Roosevelt resigned from his White House position in November 1938.[2][6]
Hollywood[edit]
After leaving the White House, Roosevelt moved to Hollywood, California, where he first accepted a job as a $750/week administrative assistant for motion picture producer Samuel Goldwyn. He was on Goldwyn's payroll until November 1940. In 1939 he set up "Globe Productions", a company to produce short films for penny arcades, but the company was liquidated in 1944 while James was on active duty with the Marine Corps.[2] Roosevelt also produced the film Pot o' Gold and distributed the British film Pastor Hall.
During his Hollywood period, Roosevelt became involved with Joseph Schenck, the movie mogul who funnelled mob money to the Democratic Party. Schenck also lent money for Roosevelt's movie. When Schenck was jailed for income tax evasion, Roosevelt interceded with his father to pardon him, but again Henry Morgenthau, Jr. vetoed the plan. Roosevelt later wrote that "Stories appeared that I was mixed up with Mafia mobsters."[7]
Military career[edit]




Roosevelt as a Marine Corps lieutenant colonel in World War II


World War II broke out in Europe in September 1939; the following month Roosevelt resigned the lieutenant colonel's commission that he had been given in 1936, and was instead commissioned as a captain in the Marine Corps Reserve. He went on active duty in November 1940.
In April 1941, President Roosevelt sent James Roosevelt on a secret, world-circling diplomatic mission to assure numerous governments that the United States would soon be in the war. The leaders contacted included Chiang Kai-shek in China, King Farouk in Egypt, and King George of Greece. During this trip, Roosevelt came under German air attack in both Crete and Iraq. In the African/Middle Eastern portion of the mission, he traveled with Britain's Lord Mountbatten as far as Bathurst in the Gambia. They reported on trans-African air ferry conditions, an important concern of FDR and Winston Churchill at the time.[8][9] In August, Roosevelt joined the staff of William J. Donovan, Coordinator of Information, with the job of working out the exchange of information with other agencies.[2]
World War II[edit]
After Japan's Attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, Roosevelt requested assignment to combat duty and was transferred to the Marine Raiders in January 1942, a new Marine Corps commando force, and became second-in-command of the 2nd Raider Battalion under Evans Carlson (Carlson's Raiders) whom Roosevelt knew when Carlson commanded the Marine Detachment at the Warm Springs, Georgia residence of Franklin Roosevelt. Roosevelt's influence helped win presidential backing for the Raiders, who were opposed by Marine Corps traditionalists.
Despite occasionally debilitating health problems, Roosevelt served with the 2nd Raiders at Midway as a major in early June 1942 and in the Makin Island raid on August 17–18, 1942, where he and several others were awarded the Navy Cross. In October, he was given command of the new 4th Raiders, but during training for an upcoming combat operation he became ill enough to be hospitalized in February 1943.[10] Beginning in August 1943, he served in various staff positions during the rest of the war. He was attached to and landed with the U.S. Army's 165th Regimental Combat Team, 27th infantry Division during the invasion of Makin on November 20–23, and was awarded the Silver Star by the Army.[11] He was promoted to colonel on April 13, 1944. He was released from active duty in August 1945 and was placed on the inactive list in October 1945. That same month he became a Compatriot of the Empire State Society of the Sons of the American Revolution.
Roosevelt continued in the Marine Corps Reserve, and retired on October 1, 1959 with the advanced rank of brigadier general.[9] Roosevelt suffered from flat feet, and while other Marines were required to wear boots, he was allowed to wear sneakers.[12]

Navy Cross citation[edit]

"The Navy Cross is presented to James Roosevelt, Major, U.S. Marine Corps (Reserve), for extraordinary heroism and distinguished service as second in command of the Second Marine Raider Battalion against enemy Japanese armed forces on Makin island. Risking his own life over and above the ordinary call of duty, Major Roosevelt continually exposed himself to intense machine-gun and sniper fire to ensure effective control of operations from the command post. As a result of his successful maintenance of communications with his supporting vessels, two enemy surface ships, whose presence was reported, were destroyed by gun fire. Later during evacuation, he displayed exemplary courage in personally rescuing three men from drowning in the heavy surf. His gallant conduct and his inspiring devotion to duty were in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service."[11]

For the President,
Chester W. Nimitz
Silver Star citation[edit]

"The President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star (Army Award) to Lieutenant Colonel James R. Roosevelt (MCSN: 0-5477), United States Marine Corps, for gallantry in action at Makin Atoll, Gilbert Islands, 20 to 23 November 1943. Attached as an observer to the units of the 27th Infantry Division which effected the landing on Makin Atoll, Lieutenant Colonel Roosevelt voluntarily sought out the scenes of the heaviest fighting. Throughout the three-day period, he continually accompanied the leading elements of the assault, exposing himself to constant danger. His calmness under fire and presence among the foremost elements of the attacking force was a source of inspiration to all ranks."

General Orders: Headquarters, U.S. Army Forces, Central Pacific Area, General Orders No. 55 (1944)(26)
Battle stars[edit]
LtCol Roosevelt was entitled to campaign participation credit (i.e., the "battle stars" worn on the Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal) for the following actions:[citation needed]

Battle of Midway, June 3-6, 1942 (Navy P-7)
Capture and Defense of Guadalcanal, August 10, 1942 - February 8, 1943 (Navy P-9)
Makin Raid, August 17-18, 1942 (Navy P-10)
Eastern Mandates November 1943 - January 1944 (Army, for Makin)

Post-war career[edit]
After the war, Roosevelt returned to live in California. He rejoined Roosevelt and Sargent as an executive vice president, and established the company's office in Los Angeles. In 1946 he became chairman of the board of Roosevelt and Haines, successor to Roosevelt and Sargent. He later became president of Roosevelt and Company, Inc.
On July 21, 1946, Roosevelt became chairman of the California State Democratic Central Committee. He also began making daily radio broadcasts of political commentary. Like his brother Elliott, James Roosevelt was prominent in the movement to draft Dwight Eisenhower as the Democratic candidate for President in 1948. When President Truman was renominated instead, Roosevelt stepped down as state chairman on August 8. He remained a Democratic National Committeeman until 1952.[2]
In 1950, Roosevelt was the Democratic candidate for Governor of California, but lost to Republican incumbent Earl Warren by almost 30% of the votes.[13]
In 1954, Roosevelt was elected U.S. Representative from California's 26th congressional district, a "safe" Democratic district.[13] He was re-elected to five additional terms and served from 1955 to 1965, resigning during his sixth term. Roosevelt was one of the first politicians to denounce the tactics of Senator Joseph McCarthy. He was also the only Representative to vote against appropriating funds for the House Un-American Activities Committee.
In April 1965, Roosevelt ran for Mayor of Los Angeles, challenging incumbent Sam Yorty, but lost in the primary.[13]
He resigned from Congress in October 1965, 10 months into his sixth term, when President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed him a delegate to the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). Roosevelt resigned from UNESCO in December 1966, and retired to become an executive of the Investors Overseas Service (IOS) in Geneva, Switzerland.[2]
Roosevelt joined IOS despite the overseas firm's concurrent investigation by the SEC for numerous irregularities. In Geneva in May 1969, during the unraveling of IOS, Roosevelt's third wife, Irene Owens, stabbed him "eight times" with his "own Marine combat knife"[14] while he was preparing divorce proceedings.[15] When fugitive financier Robert Vesco obtained control of IOS from Bernie Cornfeld and absconded with approximately $200 million, Roosevelt initially stayed on under Vesco. Roosevelt later wrote that "As soon as I saw the situation for what it was, in 1971, I resigned my position."[16] However, this episode resulted in federal charges being laid against Roosevelt and several others, and in a Swiss arrest warrant. Roosevelt returned to California, settling in Newport Beach, and charges were dropped. He became associated with the Nixon Administration in several capacities and remained friendly with Richard Nixon until his death.[17]
Despite having been a liberal Democrat all of his life, Roosevelt joined Democrats for Nixon and publicly supported President Nixon's 1972 re-election,[18] and also supported Ronald Reagan in 1980[19] and 1984.[20]
His writings include Affectionately, FDR (with Sidney Shalett, 1959) and My Parents, a Differing View (with Bill Libby, 1976). The latter was written in part as a response to his brother Elliott Roosevelt's book An Untold Story, which told of FDR's marital issues and was fiercely repudiated by the other siblings. He authored the novel A Family Matter (with Sam Toperoff, 1979), and edited The Liberal Papers, published in 1962.

Later Controversy

In the 1980s, a non-profit organization established by Roosevelt, the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, and its associated political action committee, were investigated by the House Ways and Means Committee for questionable money raising practices, and by the Post Office for mail fraud. By direct mail, Roosevelt's group solicited contributions from elderly persons by claiming that Social Security and Medicare programs were in financial jeopardy. Roosevelt also urged contributors to order their Social Security statements of earnings from his group (these are free from the government.) [21][22]
Family and death[edit]
His first marriage was to philanthropist Betsey Maria Cushing (1908–1998), the middle daughter of surgeon Harvey Williams Cushing and Katharine Stone Crowell. Betsey's sisters were socialites Barbara "Babe" Cushing (1915–1978) and Mary Benedict "Minnie" Cushing (1906–1978). James and Betsey had two daughters, Sara (born 1932) and Kate (1936), before divorcing in 1940.
James married his nurse Romelle Theresa Schneider (1915) the next year. They had three children, James Jr. (born 1945), Michael (born 1946), and Anna (born 1948).
In 1956, he married Gladys Irene Owens (c.1917–1987),[23] his receptionist, and they had a son together named Hall (called "Del") in 1959.
He married his fourth wife, Mary Winskill, teacher to his youngest son "Del," in 1969. They had one daughter, Rebecca, in 1971.[24]

Death

Roosevelt died in Newport Beach, California in 1991 of complications arising from a stroke and Parkinson's disease. He was 83 and was the last surviving child of Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt.[25]

Early life[edit]
Roosevelt was born in New York City at 125 East 36th Street. He attended the Potomac School and the National Cathedral School in Washington, D.C., and the Groton School in Massachusetts. At Groton, he rowed and played football, and was a prefect in his senior year. After graduation in 1926, he attended Harvard College, where he rowed with the freshman and junior varsity crews. At Harvard he followed family traditions, joining the Signet Society and Hasty Pudding Club, of which both his father and his maternal granduncle and paternal fifth cousin once removed, President Theodore Roosevelt, had been members, as well as the Fly Club, which his father had joined, and Institute of the 1770. He graduated from Harvard in 1930 and was elected permanent treasurer of his class.[2]
After graduation, Roosevelt enrolled in the Boston University School of Law. He also took a sales job with Boston insurance agent Victor De Gerard. Roosevelt was so successful, that within one year, he abandoned his law studies. In 1932 he started his own insurance agency, Roosevelt and Sargent, in partnership with John A. Sargent. As president of Roosevelt & Sargent, he made a substantial fortune (about $500,000). He resigned from the firm in 1937, when he officially went to work in the White House, but retained his half ownership.[3]
Politics and the White House[edit]
Roosevelt attended the 1924 Democratic National Convention where he served, in his words, as his father's "page and prop". In 1928, he and some Harvard classmates campaigned for Democratic Presidential nominee Al Smith. In 1932, he headed FDR's Massachusetts campaign; he made about two hundred campaign speeches that year. Though FDR lost the Massachusetts Democratic primary (to Smith), he easily carried Massachusetts in the November election. James Roosevelt was viewed as his father's political deputy in Massachusetts, allocating patronage in alliance with Boston mayor James Michael Curley. He was also a delegate from Massachusetts to the Constitutional Convention for the repeal of Prohibition in 1933.
Roosevelt was a close protege of Joseph P. Kennedy Sr.. In 1934, the two journeyed to England to obtain the market in post-prohibition liquor imports.[1] Many of Roosevelt's controversial business ventures were aided by Kennedy, including his maritime insurance interests, and the National Grain Yeast Corp. affair (1933-5). Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau, Jr. threatened to resign unless FDR forced James to leave the latter company, suspected of being a front for bootlegging.[4] James Roosevelt was instrumental in securing Kennedy's appointment as ambassador to the United Kingdom.[5]
In April 1936, Presidential Secretary Louis Howe died. James Roosevelt unofficially assumed Howe's duties.[3] Soon after the 1936 re-election of FDR, James Roosevelt was given a direct commission as a lieutenant colonel in the Marine Corps, which caused public controversy for its obvious political implications. He accompanied his father to the Inter-American Conference at Buenos Aires in December as a military aide. On January 6, 1937, he was officially appointed "administrative assistant to the President"; on July 1, 1937, he was appointed Secretary to the President.[2] He became White House coordinator for eighteen federal agencies in October 1937.
James Roosevelt was considered among his father's most important counselors. Time magazine suggested he might be considered "Assistant President of the United States".[3]
In July 1938, there were allegations that James Roosevelt had used his political position to steer lucrative business to his insurance firm. He had to publish his income tax returns and denied these allegations in an NBC broadcast and an interview in Collier's magazine. This became known as the Jimmy's Got It affair after Alva Johnston's reportage in the Saturday Evening Post. Roosevelt resigned from his White House position in November 1938.[2][6]
Hollywood[edit]
After leaving the White House, Roosevelt moved to Hollywood, California, where he first accepted a job as a $750/week administrative assistant for motion picture producer Samuel Goldwyn. He was on Goldwyn's payroll until November 1940. In 1939 he set up "Globe Productions", a company to produce short films for penny arcades, but the company was liquidated in 1944 while James was on active duty with the Marine Corps.[2] Roosevelt also produced the film Pot o' Gold and distributed the British film Pastor Hall.
During his Hollywood period, Roosevelt became involved with Joseph Schenck, the movie mogul who funnelled mob money to the Democratic Party. Schenck also lent money for Roosevelt's movie. When Schenck was jailed for income tax evasion, Roosevelt interceded with his father to pardon him, but again Henry Morgenthau, Jr. vetoed the plan. Roosevelt later wrote that "Stories appeared that I was mixed up with Mafia mobsters."[7]
Military career[edit]




Roosevelt as a Marine Corps lieutenant colonel in World War II


World War II broke out in Europe in September 1939; the following month Roosevelt resigned the lieutenant colonel's commission that he had been given in 1936, and was instead commissioned as a captain in the Marine Corps Reserve. He went on active duty in November 1940.
In April 1941, President Roosevelt sent James Roosevelt on a secret, world-circling diplomatic mission to assure numerous governments that the United States would soon be in the war. The leaders contacted included Chiang Kai-shek in China, King Farouk in Egypt, and King George of Greece. During this trip, Roosevelt came under German air attack in both Crete and Iraq. In the African/Middle Eastern portion of the mission, he traveled with Britain's Lord Mountbatten as far as Bathurst in the Gambia. They reported on trans-African air ferry conditions, an important concern of FDR and Winston Churchill at the time.[8][9] In August, Roosevelt joined the staff of William J. Donovan, Coordinator of Information, with the job of working out the exchange of information with other agencies.[2]
World War II[edit]
After Japan's Attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, Roosevelt requested assignment to combat duty and was transferred to the Marine Raiders in January 1942, a new Marine Corps commando force, and became second-in-command of the 2nd Raider Battalion under Evans Carlson (Carlson's Raiders) whom Roosevelt knew when Carlson commanded the Marine Detachment at the Warm Springs, Georgia residence of Franklin Roosevelt. Roosevelt's influence helped win presidential backing for the Raiders, who were opposed by Marine Corps traditionalists.
Despite occasionally debilitating health problems, Roosevelt served with the 2nd Raiders at Midway as a major in early June 1942 and in the Makin Island raid on August 17–18, 1942, where he and several others were awarded the Navy Cross. In October, he was given command of the new 4th Raiders, but during training for an upcoming combat operation he became ill enough to be hospitalized in February 1943.[10] Beginning in August 1943, he served in various staff positions during the rest of the war. He was attached to and landed with the U.S. Army's 165th Regimental Combat Team, 27th infantry Division during the invasion of Makin on November 20–23, and was awarded the Silver Star by the Army.[11] He was promoted to colonel on April 13, 1944. He was released from active duty in August 1945 and was placed on the inactive list in October 1945. That same month he became a Compatriot of the Empire State Society of the Sons of the American Revolution.
Roosevelt continued in the Marine Corps Reserve, and retired on October 1, 1959 with the advanced rank of brigadier general.[9] Roosevelt suffered from flat feet, and while other Marines were required to wear boots, he was allowed to wear sneakers.[12]

Roosevelt's military decorations and awards include:

Navy Cross citation[edit]

"The Navy Cross is presented to James Roosevelt, Major, U.S. Marine Corps (Reserve), for extraordinary heroism and distinguished service as second in command of the Second Marine Raider Battalion against enemy Japanese armed forces on Makin island. Risking his own life over and above the ordinary call of duty, Major Roosevelt continually exposed himself to intense machine-gun and sniper fire to ensure effective control of operations from the command post. As a result of his successful maintenance of communications with his supporting vessels, two enemy surface ships, whose presence was reported, were destroyed by gun fire. Later during evacuation, he displayed exemplary courage in personally rescuing three men from drowning in the heavy surf. His gallant conduct and his inspiring devotion to duty were in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service."[11]

For the President,
Chester W. Nimitz
Silver Star citation[edit]

"The President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star (Army Award) to Lieutenant Colonel James R. Roosevelt (MCSN: 0-5477), United States Marine Corps, for gallantry in action at Makin Atoll, Gilbert Islands, 20 to 23 November 1943. Attached as an observer to the units of the 27th Infantry Division which effected the landing on Makin Atoll, Lieutenant Colonel Roosevelt voluntarily sought out the scenes of the heaviest fighting. Throughout the three-day period, he continually accompanied the leading elements of the assault, exposing himself to constant danger. His calmness under fire and presence among the foremost elements of the attacking force was a source of inspiration to all ranks."

General Orders: Headquarters, U.S. Army Forces, Central Pacific Area, General Orders No. 55 (1944)(26)
Battle stars[edit]
LtCol Roosevelt was entitled to campaign participation credit (i.e., the "battle stars" worn on the Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal) for the following actions:[citation needed]

Battle of Midway, June 3-6, 1942 (Navy P-7)
Capture and Defense of Guadalcanal, August 10, 1942 - February 8, 1943 (Navy P-9)
Makin Raid, August 17-18, 1942 (Navy P-10)
Eastern Mandates November 1943 - January 1944 (Army, for Makin)

Post-war career[edit]
After the war, Roosevelt returned to live in California. He rejoined Roosevelt and Sargent as an executive vice president, and established the company's office in Los Angeles. In 1946 he became chairman of the board of Roosevelt and Haines, successor to Roosevelt and Sargent. He later became president of Roosevelt and Company, Inc.
On July 21, 1946, Roosevelt became chairman of the California State Democratic Central Committee. He also began making daily radio broadcasts of political commentary. Like his brother Elliott, James Roosevelt was prominent in the movement to draft Dwight Eisenhower as the Democratic candidate for President in 1948. When President Truman was renominated instead, Roosevelt stepped down as state chairman on August 8. He remained a Democratic National Committeeman until 1952.[2]
In 1950, Roosevelt was the Democratic candidate for Governor of California, but lost to Republican incumbent Earl Warren by almost 30% of the votes.[13]
In 1954, Roosevelt was elected U.S. Representative from California's 26th congressional district, a "safe" Democratic district.[13] He was re-elected to five additional terms and served from 1955 to 1965, resigning during his sixth term. Roosevelt was one of the first politicians to denounce the tactics of Senator Joseph McCarthy. He was also the only Representative to vote against appropriating funds for the House Un-American Activities Committee.
In April 1965, Roosevelt ran for Mayor of Los Angeles, challenging incumbent Sam Yorty, but lost in the primary.[13]
He resigned from Congress in October 1965, 10 months into his sixth term, when President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed him a delegate to the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). Roosevelt resigned from UNESCO in December 1966, and retired to become an executive of the Investors Overseas Service (IOS) in Geneva, Switzerland.[2]
Roosevelt joined IOS despite the overseas firm's concurrent investigation by the SEC for numerous irregularities. In Geneva in May 1969, during the unraveling of IOS, Roosevelt's third wife, Irene Owens, stabbed him "eight times" with his "own Marine combat knife"[14] while he was preparing divorce proceedings.[15] When fugitive financier Robert Vesco obtained control of IOS from Bernie Cornfeld and absconded with approximately $200 million, Roosevelt initially stayed on under Vesco. Roosevelt later wrote that "As soon as I saw the situation for what it was, in 1971, I resigned my position."[16] However, this episode resulted in federal charges being laid against Roosevelt and several others, and in a Swiss arrest warrant. Roosevelt returned to California, settling in Newport Beach, and charges were dropped. He became associated with the Nixon Administration in several capacities and remained friendly with Richard Nixon until his death.[17]
Despite having been a liberal Democrat all of his life, Roosevelt joined Democrats for Nixon and publicly supported President Nixon's 1972 re-election,[18] and also supported Ronald Reagan in 1980[19] and 1984.[20]
His writings include Affectionately, FDR (with Sidney Shalett, 1959) and My Parents, a Differing View (with Bill Libby, 1976). The latter was written in part as a response to his brother Elliott Roosevelt's book An Untold Story, which told of FDR's marital issues and was fiercely repudiated by the other siblings. He authored the novel A Family Matter (with Sam Toperoff, 1979), and edited The Liberal Papers, published in 1962.

Later Controversy

In the 1980s, a non-profit organization established by Roosevelt, the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, and its associated political action committee, were investigated by the House Ways and Means Committee for questionable money raising practices, and by the Post Office for mail fraud. By direct mail, Roosevelt's group solicited contributions from elderly persons by claiming that Social Security and Medicare programs were in financial jeopardy. Roosevelt also urged contributors to order their Social Security statements of earnings from his group (these are free from the government.) [21][22]
Family and death[edit]
His first marriage was to philanthropist Betsey Maria Cushing (1908–1998), the middle daughter of surgeon Harvey Williams Cushing and Katharine Stone Crowell. Betsey's sisters were socialites Barbara "Babe" Cushing (1915–1978) and Mary Benedict "Minnie" Cushing (1906–1978). James and Betsey had two daughters, Sara (born 1932) and Kate (1936), before divorcing in 1940.
James married his nurse Romelle Theresa Schneider (1915) the next year. They had three children, James Jr. (born 1945), Michael (born 1946), and Anna (born 1948).
In 1956, he married Gladys Irene Owens (c.1917–1987),[23] his receptionist, and they had a son together named Hall (called "Del") in 1959.
He married his fourth wife, Mary Winskill, teacher to his youngest son "Del," in 1969. They had one daughter, Rebecca, in 1971.[24]

Death

Roosevelt died in Newport Beach, California in 1991 of complications arising from a stroke and Parkinson's disease. He was 83 and was the last surviving child of Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt.[25]

Early life[edit]
Roosevelt was born on November 9, 1945 to Congressman James Roosevelt (1907–1991) and Romelle Theresa Schneider (1915–2002).[2] His two full siblings are Michael (born December 7, 1946) and Anna (born January 10, 1948). Through his father, he has two elder half-sisters (Sara and Kate), a younger half-brother (Hall), and a younger half-sister (Rebecca). His paternal grandparents were President Franklin Delano Roosevelt (1882–1945) and First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt (1884–1962).
Roosevelt graduated from La Salle High School in Pasadena in 1963. He earned his A.B. with honors in government from Harvard College in 1968. He later received his J.D. from Harvard Law School and completed the Advanced Management Program at Harvard Business School.
Career[edit]
On June 12, 1968, following his graduation from Harvard, he was commissioned in the Naval Reserve and rose to the rank of lieutenant on July 1, 1971.[3]
After obtaining his J.D. from Harvard Law, Roosevelt spent 10 years as partner at Choate, Hall & Stewart in Boston, Massachusetts. Roosevelt was the associate commissioner for Retirement Policy for the Social Security Administration before joining Tufts Health Plan in 1999 as senior vice president and general counsel. He held that position until June 2005, when he became President and Chief Executive Officer of Tufts Health Plan.[4]
In 1986, he ran for Congress, losing the Democratic Primary to Joseph P. Kennedy, II.[5]
He has also served as chief legal counsel for the Massachusetts Democratic Party. He is past chairman of the board of trustees for the Massachusetts Hospital Association, past president of the American Health Lawyers Association and past chairman of the board of trustees for Mount Auburn Hospital. Currently, Roosevelt serves as chairman of the board of directors for Massachusetts Association of Health Plans, and as a member of the boards at America's Health Insurance Plans, Catholic Democrats, Emmanuel College, and the Kenneth B. Schwartz Center.
He was called upon in 2008 to oversee hearings on controversies related to seating delegates from Florida and Michigan to the 2008 Democratic National Convention. Roosevelt was described as "detail-oriented," and as having great "institutional knowledge." He had not publicly endorsed either Clinton or Obama before the committee meeting.[6][7][8]
Personal life[edit]
On June 15, 1968, Roosevelt married Ann Martha Conlon (born March 31, 1945), the daughter of Walter N. Conlon, and a 1966 graduate of Radcliffe College.[9][10] Together, they have three daughters:[11]

Kathleen Ann Roosevelt (born 1978), who married Jeffrey Walker in 2007.[12]
Theresa Marie "Tracy" Roosevelt (born 1982), who married Robert O’Loughlin in 2016.[13]
Maura Amy Roosevelt (born 1984), who married Joshua Fisher in 2014.[14]

Roosevelt and Eleanor Roosevelt, he received the Navy Cross for extraordinary heroism while serving as a Marine Corps officer during World War II. He served as an official Secretary to the President and in the United States House of Representatives.

Early life[edit]
Roosevelt was born in New York City at 125 East 36th Street. He attended the Potomac School and the National Cathedral School in Washington, D.C., and the Groton School in Massachusetts. At Groton, he rowed and played football, and was a prefect in his senior year. After graduation in 1926, he attended Harvard College, where he rowed with the freshman and junior varsity crews. At Harvard he followed family traditions, joining the Signet Society and Hasty Pudding Club, of which both his father and his maternal granduncle and paternal fifth cousin once removed, President Theodore Roosevelt, had been members, as well as the Fly Club, which his father had joined, and Institute of the 1770. He graduated from Harvard in 1930 and was elected permanent treasurer of his class.[2]
After graduation, Roosevelt enrolled in the Boston University School of Law. He also took a sales job with Boston insurance agent Victor De Gerard. Roosevelt was so successful, that within one year, he abandoned his law studies. In 1932 he started his own insurance agency, Roosevelt and Sargent, in partnership with John A. Sargent. As president of Roosevelt & Sargent, he made a substantial fortune (about $500,000). He resigned from the firm in 1937, when he officially went to work in the White House, but retained his half ownership.[3]
Politics and the White House[edit]
Roosevelt attended the 1924 Democratic National Convention where he served, in his words, as his father's "page and prop". In 1928, he and some Harvard classmates campaigned for Democratic Presidential nominee Al Smith. In 1932, he headed FDR's Massachusetts campaign; he made about two hundred campaign speeches that year. Though FDR lost the Massachusetts Democratic primary (to Smith), he easily carried Massachusetts in the November election. James Roosevelt was viewed as his father's political deputy in Massachusetts, allocating patronage in alliance with Boston mayor James Michael Curley. He was also a delegate from Massachusetts to the Constitutional Convention for the repeal of Prohibition in 1933.
Roosevelt was a close protege of Joseph P. Kennedy Sr.. In 1934, the two journeyed to England to obtain the market in post-prohibition liquor imports.[1] Many of Roosevelt's controversial business ventures were aided by Kennedy, including his maritime insurance interests, and the National Grain Yeast Corp. affair (1933-5). Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau, Jr. threatened to resign unless FDR forced James to leave the latter company, suspected of being a front for bootlegging.[4] James Roosevelt was instrumental in securing Kennedy's appointment as ambassador to the United Kingdom.[5]
In April 1936, Presidential Secretary Louis Howe died. James Roosevelt unofficially assumed Howe's duties.[3] Soon after the 1936 re-election of FDR, James Roosevelt was given a direct commission as a lieutenant colonel in the Marine Corps, which caused public controversy for its obvious political implications. He accompanied his father to the Inter-American Conference at Buenos Aires in December as a military aide. On January 6, 1937, he was officially appointed "administrative assistant to the President"; on July 1, 1937, he was appointed Secretary to the President.[2] He became White House coordinator for eighteen federal agencies in October 1937.
James Roosevelt was considered among his father's most important counselors. Time magazine suggested he might be considered "Assistant President of the United States".[3]
In July 1938, there were allegations that James Roosevelt had used his political position to steer lucrative business to his insurance firm. He had to publish his income tax returns and denied these allegations in an NBC broadcast and an interview in Collier's magazine. This became known as the Jimmy's Got It affair after Alva Johnston's reportage in the Saturday Evening Post. Roosevelt resigned from his White House position in November 1938.[2][6]
Hollywood[edit]
After leaving the White House, Roosevelt moved to Hollywood, California, where he first accepted a job as a $750/week administrative assistant for motion picture producer Samuel Goldwyn. He was on Goldwyn's payroll until November 1940. In 1939 he set up "Globe Productions", a company to produce short films for penny arcades, but the company was liquidated in 1944 while James was on active duty with the Marine Corps.[2] Roosevelt also produced the film Pot o' Gold and distributed the British film Pastor Hall.
During his Hollywood period, Roosevelt became involved with Joseph Schenck, the movie mogul who funnelled mob money to the Democratic Party. Schenck also lent money for Roosevelt's movie. When Schenck was jailed for income tax evasion, Roosevelt interceded with his father to pardon him, but again Henry Morgenthau, Jr. vetoed the plan. Roosevelt later wrote that "Stories appeared that I was mixed up with Mafia mobsters."[7]
Military career[edit]




Roosevelt as a Marine Corps lieutenant colonel in World War II


World War II broke out in Europe in September 1939; the following month Roosevelt resigned the lieutenant colonel's commission that he had been given in 1936, and was instead commissioned as a captain in the Marine Corps Reserve. He went on active duty in November 1940.
In April 1941, President Roosevelt sent James Roosevelt on a secret, world-circling diplomatic mission to assure numerous governments that the United States would soon be in the war. The leaders contacted included Chiang Kai-shek in China, King Farouk in Egypt, and King George of Greece. During this trip, Roosevelt came under German air attack in both Crete and Iraq. In the African/Middle Eastern portion of the mission, he traveled with Britain's Lord Mountbatten as far as Bathurst in the Gambia. They reported on trans-African air ferry conditions, an important concern of FDR and Winston Churchill at the time.[8][9] In August, Roosevelt joined the staff of William J. Donovan, Coordinator of Information, with the job of working out the exchange of information with other agencies.[2]
World War II[edit]
After Japan's Attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, Roosevelt requested assignment to combat duty and was transferred to the Marine Raiders in January 1942, a new Marine Corps commando force, and became second-in-command of the 2nd Raider Battalion under Evans Carlson (Carlson's Raiders) whom Roosevelt knew when Carlson commanded the Marine Detachment at the Warm Springs, Georgia residence of Franklin Roosevelt. Roosevelt's influence helped win presidential backing for the Raiders, who were opposed by Marine Corps traditionalists.
Despite occasionally debilitating health problems, Roosevelt served with the 2nd Raiders at Midway as a major in early June 1942 and in the Makin Island raid on August 17–18, 1942, where he and several others were awarded the Navy Cross. In October, he was given command of the new 4th Raiders, but during training for an upcoming combat operation he became ill enough to be hospitalized in February 1943.[10] Beginning in August 1943, he served in various staff positions during the rest of the war. He was attached to and landed with the U.S. Army's 165th Regimental Combat Team, 27th infantry Division during the invasion of Makin on November 20–23, and was awarded the Silver Star by the Army.[11] He was promoted to colonel on April 13, 1944. He was released from active duty in August 1945 and was placed on the inactive list in October 1945. That same month he became a Compatriot of the Empire State Society of the Sons of the American Revolution.
Roosevelt continued in the Marine Corps Reserve, and retired on October 1, 1959 with the advanced rank of brigadier general.[9] Roosevelt suffered from flat feet, and while other Marines were required to wear boots, he was allowed to wear sneakers.[12]

Navy Cross citation[edit]

"The Navy Cross is presented to James Roosevelt, Major, U.S. Marine Corps (Reserve), for extraordinary heroism and distinguished service as second in command of the Second Marine Raider Battalion against enemy Japanese armed forces on Makin island. Risking his own life over and above the ordinary call of duty, Major Roosevelt continually exposed himself to intense machine-gun and sniper fire to ensure effective control of operations from the command post. As a result of his successful maintenance of communications with his supporting vessels, two enemy surface ships, whose presence was reported, were destroyed by gun fire. Later during evacuation, he displayed exemplary courage in personally rescuing three men from drowning in the heavy surf. His gallant conduct and his inspiring devotion to duty were in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service."[11]

For the President,
Chester W. Nimitz
Silver Star citation[edit]

"The President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star (Army Award) to Lieutenant Colonel James R. Roosevelt (MCSN: 0-5477), United States Marine Corps, for gallantry in action at Makin Atoll, Gilbert Islands, 20 to 23 November 1943. Attached as an observer to the units of the 27th Infantry Division which effected the landing on Makin Atoll, Lieutenant Colonel Roosevelt voluntarily sought out the scenes of the heaviest fighting. Throughout the three-day period, he continually accompanied the leading elements of the assault, exposing himself to constant danger. His calmness under fire and presence among the foremost elements of the attacking force was a source of inspiration to all ranks."

General Orders: Headquarters, U.S. Army Forces, Central Pacific Area, General Orders No. 55 (1944)(26)
Battle stars[edit]
LtCol Roosevelt was entitled to campaign participation credit (i.e., the "battle stars" worn on the Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal) for the following actions:[citation needed]

Battle of Midway, June 3-6, 1942 (Navy P-7)
Capture and Defense of Guadalcanal, August 10, 1942 - February 8, 1943 (Navy P-9)
Makin Raid, August 17-18, 1942 (Navy P-10)
Eastern Mandates November 1943 - January 1944 (Army, for Makin)

Post-war career[edit]
After the war, Roosevelt returned to live in California. He rejoined Roosevelt and Sargent as an executive vice president, and established the company's office in Los Angeles. In 1946 he became chairman of the board of Roosevelt and Haines, successor to Roosevelt and Sargent. He later became president of Roosevelt and Company, Inc.
On July 21, 1946, Roosevelt became chairman of the California State Democratic Central Committee. He also began making daily radio broadcasts of political commentary. Like his brother Elliott, James Roosevelt was prominent in the movement to draft Dwight Eisenhower as the Democratic candidate for President in 1948. When President Truman was renominated instead, Roosevelt stepped down as state chairman on August 8. He remained a Democratic National Committeeman until 1952.[2]
In 1950, Roosevelt was the Democratic candidate for Governor of California, but lost to Republican incumbent Earl Warren by almost 30% of the votes.[13]
In 1954, Roosevelt was elected U.S. Representative from California's 26th congressional district, a "safe" Democratic district.[13] He was re-elected to five additional terms and served from 1955 to 1965, resigning during his sixth term. Roosevelt was one of the first politicians to denounce the tactics of Senator Joseph McCarthy. He was also the only Representative to vote against appropriating funds for the House Un-American Activities Committee.
In April 1965, Roosevelt ran for Mayor of Los Angeles, challenging incumbent Sam Yorty, but lost in the primary.[13]
He resigned from Congress in October 1965, 10 months into his sixth term, when President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed him a delegate to the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). Roosevelt resigned from UNESCO in December 1966, and retired to become an executive of the Investors Overseas Service (IOS) in Geneva, Switzerland.[2]
Roosevelt joined IOS despite the overseas firm's concurrent investigation by the SEC for numerous irregularities. In Geneva in May 1969, during the unraveling of IOS, Roosevelt's third wife, Irene Owens, stabbed him "eight times" with his "own Marine combat knife"[14] while he was preparing divorce proceedings.[15] When fugitive financier Robert Vesco obtained control of IOS from Bernie Cornfeld and absconded with approximately $200 million, Roosevelt initially stayed on under Vesco. Roosevelt later wrote that "As soon as I saw the situation for what it was, in 1971, I resigned my position."[16] However, this episode resulted in federal charges being laid against Roosevelt and several others, and in a Swiss arrest warrant. Roosevelt returned to California, settling in Newport Beach, and charges were dropped. He became associated with the Nixon Administration in several capacities and remained friendly with Richard Nixon until his death.[17]
Despite having been a liberal Democrat all of his life, Roosevelt joined Democrats for Nixon and publicly supported President Nixon's 1972 re-election,[18] and also supported Ronald Reagan in 1980[19] and 1984.[20]
His writings include Affectionately, FDR (with Sidney Shalett, 1959) and My Parents, a Differing View (with Bill Libby, 1976). The latter was written in part as a response to his brother Elliott Roosevelt's book An Untold Story, which told of FDR's marital issues and was fiercely repudiated by the other siblings. He authored the novel A Family Matter (with Sam Toperoff, 1979), and edited The Liberal Papers, published in 1962.

Later Controversy

In the 1980s, a non-profit organization established by Roosevelt, the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, and its associated political action committee, were investigated by the House Ways and Means Committee for questionable money raising practices, and by the Post Office for mail fraud. By direct mail, Roosevelt's group solicited contributions from elderly persons by claiming that Social Security and Medicare programs were in financial jeopardy. Roosevelt also urged contributors to order their Social Security statements of earnings from his group (these are free from the government.) [21][22]
Family and death[edit]
His first marriage was to philanthropist Betsey Maria Cushing (1908–1998), the middle daughter of surgeon Harvey Williams Cushing and Katharine Stone Crowell. Betsey's sisters were socialites Barbara "Babe" Cushing (1915–1978) and Mary Benedict "Minnie" Cushing (1906–1978). James and Betsey had two daughters, Sara (born 1932) and Kate (1936), before divorcing in 1940.
James married his nurse Romelle Theresa Schneider (1915) the next year. They had three children, James Jr. (born 1945), Michael (born 1946), and Anna (born 1948).
In 1956, he married Gladys Irene Owens (c.1917–1987),[23] his receptionist, and they had a son together named Hall (called "Del") in 1959.
He married his fourth wife, Mary Winskill, teacher to his youngest son "Del," in 1969. They had one daughter, Rebecca, in 1971.[24]

Death

Roosevelt died in Newport Beach, California in 1991 of complications arising from a stroke and Parkinson's disease. He was 83 and was the last surviving child of Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt.[25]

Early life[edit]
Roosevelt was born on July 16, 1828 in Hyde Park, New York, He was the son of businessman Isaac Daniel Roosevelt (1790–1863) and Mary Rebecca Aspinwall (1809–1886). Isaac's parents were businessman and politician Jacobus Roosevelt III and Catherine Welles. His maternal grandparents were John Aspinwall and Susan Howland.
In 1847, James Roosevelt graduated from Union College in Schenectady, New York.
Career[edit]
Roosevelt's business interests were primarily in coal and transportation. He was vice president of the Delaware and Hudson Railway and president of the Southern Railway Security Company.
Personal life[edit]
Before his marriage, Roosevelt was considered an eligible bachelor: tall, slender, and wealthy, with considerable society connections. In 1853, he married his second cousin, Rebecca Brien Howland (1831–1876). They had one son, James Roosevelt "Rosey" Roosevelt (1854–1927), who married Helen Schermerhorn Astor (1855–1893).
Four years after Rebecca's death, he met a sixth cousin named Sara Ann Delano (1854–1941) at a party celebrating graduation of his distant cousin Theodore Roosevelt, Jr. (1858–1919) from Harvard University. James and Sara were married on October 7, 1880, and became the parents of Franklin Delano Roosevelt (1882–1945), who married Eleanor Roosevelt (1884–1962). James reportedly was a good father to Franklin, but his recurring heart problems eventually made him an invalid. Franklin reacted by becoming fiercely protective of his father.
James died twenty years after he married Sara and left the bulk of his estate to her, and a modest inheritance to Franklin.[2] He is buried at the churchyard at St. James Episcopal Church in Hyde Park; his grave is flanked by those of his wives.
In popular culture[edit]
Roosevelt is voiced by John Lithgow in The Roosevelts, a 2014 documentary series by Ken Burns.
Legacy[edit]
In 1927 Franklin and Sara Roosevelt donated money to the town of Hyde Park for the construction of a new library, named after James, and still in use today.

Early life[edit]
Roosevelt was born on July 16, 1828 in Hyde Park, New York, He was the son of businessman Isaac Daniel Roosevelt (1790–1863) and Mary Rebecca Aspinwall (1809–1886). Isaac's parents were businessman and politician Jacobus Roosevelt III and Catherine Welles. His maternal grandparents were John Aspinwall and Susan Howland.
In 1847, James Roosevelt graduated from Union College in Schenectady, New York.
Career[edit]
Roosevelt's business interests were primarily in coal and transportation. He was vice president of the Delaware and Hudson Railway and president of the Southern Railway Security Company.
Personal life[edit]
Before his marriage, Roosevelt was considered an eligible bachelor: tall, slender, and wealthy, with considerable society connections. In 1853, he married his second cousin, Rebecca Brien Howland (1831–1876). They had one son, James Roosevelt "Rosey" Roosevelt (1854–1927), who married Helen Schermerhorn Astor (1855–1893).
Four years after Rebecca's death, he met a sixth cousin named Sara Ann Delano (1854–1941) at a party celebrating graduation of his distant cousin Theodore Roosevelt, Jr. (1858–1919) from Harvard University. James and Sara were married on October 7, 1880, and became the parents of Franklin Delano Roosevelt (1882–1945), who married Eleanor Roosevelt (1884–1962). James reportedly was a good father to Franklin, but his recurring heart problems eventually made him an invalid. Franklin reacted by becoming fiercely protective of his father.
James died twenty years after he married Sara and left the bulk of his estate to her, and a modest inheritance to Franklin.[2] He is buried at the churchyard at St. James Episcopal Church in Hyde Park; his grave is flanked by those of his wives.
In popular culture[edit]
Roosevelt is voiced by John Lithgow in The Roosevelts, a 2014 documentary series by Ken Burns.
Legacy[edit]
In 1927 Franklin and Sara Roosevelt donated money to the town of Hyde Park for the construction of a new library, named after James, and still in use today.

Early life[edit]
Roosevelt was born on July 16, 1828 in Hyde Park, New York, He was the son of businessman Isaac Daniel Roosevelt (1790–1863) and Mary Rebecca Aspinwall (1809–1886). Isaac's parents were businessman and politician Jacobus Roosevelt III and Catherine Welles. His maternal grandparents were John Aspinwall and Susan Howland.
In 1847, James Roosevelt graduated from Union College in Schenectady, New York.
Career[edit]
Roosevelt's business interests were primarily in coal and transportation. He was vice president of the Delaware and Hudson Railway and president of the Southern Railway Security Company.
Personal life[edit]
Before his marriage, Roosevelt was considered an eligible bachelor: tall, slender, and wealthy, with considerable society connections. In 1853, he married his second cousin, Rebecca Brien Howland (1831–1876). They had one son, James Roosevelt "Rosey" Roosevelt (1854–1927), who married Helen Schermerhorn Astor (1855–1893).
Four years after Rebecca's death, he met a sixth cousin named Sara Ann Delano (1854–1941) at a party celebrating graduation of his distant cousin Theodore Roosevelt, Jr. (1858–1919) from Harvard University. James and Sara were married on October 7, 1880, and became the parents of Franklin Delano Roosevelt (1882–1945), who married Eleanor Roosevelt (1884–1962). James reportedly was a good father to Franklin, but his recurring heart problems eventually made him an invalid. Franklin reacted by becoming fiercely protective of his father.
James died twenty years after he married Sara and left the bulk of his estate to her, and a modest inheritance to Franklin.[2] He is buried at the churchyard at St. James Episcopal Church in Hyde Park; his grave is flanked by those of his wives.
In popular culture[edit]
Roosevelt is voiced by John Lithgow in The Roosevelts, a 2014 documentary series by Ken Burns.
Legacy[edit]
In 1927 Franklin and Sara Roosevelt donated money to the town of Hyde Park for the construction of a new library, named after James, and still in use today.

About James Roosevelt, Sr.


James Roosevelt, Sr. (July 16, 1828 – December 8, 1900) was a businessman and father of the President of the United States Franklin Delano Roosevelt. He was born in Hyde Park, New York to Isaac Roosevelt (1790–1863) and his wife Mary Rebecca Aspinwall (1809–1886).
Roosevelt's father Isaac Roosevelt was a fourth-generation descendant of Nicholas Roosevelt (1658-1742), who was also a sixth-generation ancestor of Theodore Roosevelt. His wife Mary Aspinwall was a sixth-generation descendant of Rebecca Stoughton, sister of William Stoughton, judge and prosecutor during the Salem Witch Trials.
Business
Roosevelt's business interests were primarily in coal and transportation. He was vice president of the Delaware and Hudson Railway, and president of the Southern Railway Security Company. James was a tall, slender and wealthy man with considerable society connections, an eligible bachelor by any standard. He graduated from Union College (NY) in 1847. In 1853, he married his first cousin once removed Rebecca Howland (1831–1876). They had a son, James "Rosy" Roosevelt, Jr (1854–1927). James became a widower in 1876.
Marriage
Four years later, at a party celebrating graduation of his cousin Theodore Roosevelt from Harvard University, he met a very distant relative Sara Delano; they were married on October 7, 1880 and became parents of Franklin Delano Roosevelt. James was reportedly a good father to Franklin; however, his recurring heart problems eventually turned him into an invalid. Franklin reacted by becoming fiercely protective of his father. James died twenty years after he married Sara. His estate was given to his sons.
