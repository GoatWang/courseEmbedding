WHAT IS A TRUST


IS A TRUST RIGHT FOR YOU


ESTATE SETTLEMENT












What Is A Trust?

 
A trust is a legal structure set up in order to transfer assets advantageously to beneficiaries - often your spouse, children, grandchildren or a charity. To establish a trust, you provide instructions in a Trust Agreement prepared by an attorney. The assets you transfer to the trust are managed and distributed by First Financial Bank as a trustee in accordance with the Trust Agreement.
A trust may be the most important financial legacy you ever create. Your trust contains assets you have carefully safeguarded, along with your instructions on how these assets are to be protected and distributed to the people you care about. With First Financial Wealth Management, you can be confident that your wishes will be carried out just as you have planned.
















Is A Trust Right For You?

In order to ensure a trust is the right way to protect your legacy, our team suggests you consider creating a trust if your situation meets the conditions described below. If you are unsure whether a trust is best for you, our team is happy to meet with you to further discuss the option of a trust.











Your assets have increased substantially in value, potentially exposing your estate to high taxes
You are concerned about controlling "who gets what and when" in the event of your death or incapacity




You have children from a previous marriage
You have special-needs children whom you want to support
You have a financial interest in a business
You own property in two or more states




You want to simplify life by appointing a dependable agent to pay bills and keep tax records for yourself or a loved one
You are concerned about your assets or your children's future inheritance being vulnerable to a creditor 






















Benefits Of A Trust

 
A trust can be a very powerful tool when managing your legacy. If you have decided a trust is right for you, explore the benefits of a trust. First Financial Bank as trustee can help you accomplish these goals.
 






Enforcing terms of a trust pursuant to grantor's intent
Understanding and applying laws
Duty of loyalty and impartiality to all beneficiaries
Comfort knowing your plan will be carried out in a professional manner















Estate Settlement Services Overview

 
After the hard work you have put in to plan your financial legacy, your wishes deserve to be honored. It is often difficult for a family member or friend to handle the personal and legal responsibilities of settling an estate, especially when they are still struggling with the loss of a loved one.
Let our team of trust professionals serve as an executor or personal representative of your estate. As an experienced corporate fiduciary, we comply with strict standards that ensure your wishes are carried out as expressed in your will.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

                          Stock prices used are the "total returns" stock price and will include
                          dividends, spinoffs, splits, and other adjustments.  Because of this, stock
                          prices shown here will likely not
                          match a stock's actual closing stock price on the same date.
