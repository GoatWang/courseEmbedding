Share with your friendsYour NameYour EmailRecipient EmailEnter a MessageI read this article and found it very interesting, thought it might be interesting for you. The article is called Scientific Botanical Leasing  $3.50 million  Fundraising. Brent Nerguizian  Released Aug 11  Filing and is was published by Octafinance.com at http://www.octafinance.com/scientific-botanical-leasing-3-50-million-fundraising-brent-nerguizian-released-aug-11-filing/147966/.CaptchaSubmit
Scientific Botanical Leasing  Financing
Scientific Botanical Leasing, Llc, Limited Liability Company just  released form D  regarding $3.50 million debt financing. The date of first sale was 2015-02-13. Scientific Botanical Leasing  was able to  sell $800,000 so far. That is 22.86% of the  financing offer. The total  financing amount was $3.50 million.  This form was filed on 2015-08-11. The reason for the financing was: unspecified.  The fundraising still has about $2.70 million more and is not closed yet. We have to wait more to see if the offering will be fully taken.
 Scientific Botanical Leasing  is based in Alabama. The  firm’s business is Commercial. The  SEC form was  filed by Brent Nerguizian CEO.  The company was incorporated in 2014. The filler’s address is: 23623 N. Scottsdale Road, #D3269, Scottsdale, Az, Arizona, 85255.  Brent Berj Nerguizian is the related person in the form and it has address: 23623 N. Scottsdale Rd., #D3269, Scottsdale, Az, Arizona, 85255. Link to Scientific Botanical Leasing  Filing: 000161103915000004.
Analysis of Scientific Botanical Leasing  Offering
On average,  firms in the Commercial sector, sell 65.22% of the total offering  amount. Scientific Botanical Leasing  sold 22.86% of the offering.  The fundraising is still open. The average  investment offering size for companies in the Commercial industry is $1.60 million. The offering was 50.00% smaller than the average of $1.60 million.  Of course this should not be  interpreted as negative.  Companies  raise funds for  different  reasons and needs. The minimum investment for this  financing  was set at $50000. If you know more about the reasons for the  fundraising, please comment below.
What is Form D? What It Is Used For
Form D disclosures could be used to track and understand better your competitors. The information in Form D is usually highly confidential for ventures and startups and they don’t like revealing it. This is because it reveals amount raised or planned to be raised as well as reasons for the financing. This could help competitors. Entrepreneurs usually want to keep their financing a ‘secret’ so they can stay in stealth mode for longer.
Why Fundraising Reporting Is Good For Scientific Botanical Leasing  Also
The Form D signed by Brent Nerguizian might help Scientific Botanical Leasing, Llc’s sector. First, it helps potential customers feel more safe to deal with a firm that is well financed. The odds are higher that it will stay in the business. Second, this could attract other investors such as venture-capital firms, funds and angels. Third, positive PR effects could even bring leasing firms and venture lenders.
