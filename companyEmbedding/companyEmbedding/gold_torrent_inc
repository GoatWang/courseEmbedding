Gold Torrent  =  High Grade Gold + Near Term ProductionGold Torrent is a publicly-traded (OTCQB: GTOR) gold mining company with a historic producing high-grade gold project (the "Lucky Shot") located only 75 miles from Anchorage, Alaska. The Lucky Shot project is accessible by road and can be operated all year.Gold Torrent's experienced management and technical team's main focus is to develop and advance the Lucky Shot project. Construction is underway and the project is expected to initiate commercial production in Q4 of 2018 and produce in Phase One 25,000 and Phase Two 50,000 ounces of gold per year at estimated all in sustaining cash cost of $675 per ounce (from the July 2016 NI 43-101 Preliminary Feasibility Study).Gold Torrent continues to look for additional high grade gold opportunities in safe mining jurisdictions and seek ownership in late stage exploration to development-stage  gold mining projects in North America.

Lucky Shot — Gold Torrent Inc.





















































Project






Lucky Shot ProjectWillow, Alaska USALucky Shot is located approximately 75 miles (121 km) north of Anchorage, Alaska, in the Willow Creek mining district. Historically, this area is the third-largest lode-gold producing district in Alaska, having produced 667,000 oz of gold from the early 1900s until 1942 when mining was halted by World War II. The contiguous project claim block includes 76 patented and 62 State of Alaska lode mining claims covering a total area of approximately 8,700 acres (3,520 hectares). Lucky Shot is reported to be free milling with greater than 80% recovery by gravity alone and recoveries up to 95% from gravity and flotation processing.Previous drilling campaigns identified a significant unmined up-dip extension of a high-grade gold zone in a faulted vein segment called the Coleman zone. Miranda Gold completed a 43-101 compliant resource estimate for the Upper Coleman Deposit which identifies a Measured and Indicated Resource of 62,100 troy ounces at an average grade of 24.6 grams per tonne. An additional 4,100 troy ounces are Inferred. A high-grade gold intercept, (0.5m) at 2.3 oz Au/t (77.2 g Au/t) sixty-five feet below the Hogan stope, a historic producer of 252,000 ounces, also indicates gold potential for an extension of this mineralization. Additionally, the project indicates potential for extension and discovery of northeast raking ore-shoots both up and down-dip of the immediate area of the mines. The vein also continues to the east and the west in other faulted vein segments. Limited drilling to the east intersected values in a blind down-dropped vein segment up to 1.6 oz Au/t (55 g Au/t) at 820 ft (250 m) below the workings of the district.In March 2016, an updated Canadian NI43-101 standard mineral resource estimate was completed on the Project by Hard Rock Consulting, LLC ("HRC") resulting in 121,500 ounces of gold contained in 206,500 tonnes grading an average of 18.3 grams per tonne ("g/t") gold classified as measured and indicated mineral resources. An additional 35,150 ounces of gold contained in 59,000 tonnes grading an average of 18.5 g/t gold are classified as inferred mineral resources, all based on a 5.0 g/t cutoff.In July 2016, a NI 43-101 preliminary feasibility study (the "PFS") was completed by HRC resulting in 93,274 ounces of gold contained in 207,000 tonnes grading an average of 14.0 g/t, classified as proven and probable mineral reserves. The PFS includes a mine plan and cost estimate with annual gold production of approximately 25,000 ounces of gold per year (after pre-production and build-up) at a underground mining rate of 200 tonnes per day. The mine plan includes a total of 87,612 ounces gold contained in 174,500 tonnes and a recovery plant head grade of 15.6g/t at an all-in sustaining cash cost of $675.00 per ounce of gold produced. The gold recovery plant utilizes gravity-only gold recovery methods, without chemical treatment, and produces no toxic tails. The plant is designed to capture coarse visible gold contained in the mesothermal quartz vein material by crushing and screening the material into multiple size fractions and then separating the gold using jigs, spirals and tables.Past historical on-site gold production occurred prior to World War II and records show that gravity methods achieved some 89% recovery. Independent test work completed on the quartz material as part of the PFS confirmed gravity-only gold recovery. Historical production records indicate that between 1918 and 1942 some 667,000 ounces of gold were produced from the project area at an average grade of 1.2 oz/ton (37.5 g/t). Historical records, geologic evidence and recent drilling also indicate that the gold is deposited in deep-seated mesothermal quartz veins that plunge at about 30 degrees to depth with continuation of mineralization to at least the mines' deepest points. The Project has had no down-dip exploration.The existing Project infrastructure includes approximately 500 meters of underground access via the Enserch adit; lessor-owned man-camp, facilities and used equipment to support mining; and road access. The Project also has a 30-acre mill site on private land adjacent to line electrical power and we plan to transport the high-grade ore from the mine to the plant via a 26-mile road using 27-ton highway haul trucks.The development plan is to initiate gold production based on the PFS and not based on a full feasibility study of the mineral reserves demonstrating that level of economic and technical viability. Readers are cautioned that there is increased uncertainty and higher risk of economic and technical failure associated with such production decisions.StatusGold Torrent has a 70% interest in the project through the formation of Alaska Gold Torrent, LLC, our Alaskan subsidiary owned 30% by Miranda Gold.  Engineering, field activities, and purchasing work have been underway on an accelerated basis to take advantage of the current summer season in Alaska from April to October 2017.  During this season, the mill building is being erected, insulated and enclosed to allow continued work inside prior to the following cold period. The mine site is being improved with the addition of certain facilities to support underground mining.ReportsLucky Shot - March 2016 43-101 Tech ReportLucky Shot - July 2016 Preliminary Feasibility Study NI 43-101 Technical Report

	GOLD
	TORRENT, INC.







	Notes
	to Interim Financial Statements




	Nine
	Months Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015




	(Unaudited
	- Expressed in US dollars)




	 







	1.






	Nature
	of Operations and Going Concern







	 




	GOLD
	TORRENT, INC. (the “Company”) was incorporated as a Nevada company on August 15, 2006. At the time of its inception,
	the Company created, tested and developed mobile applications, games and tools designed to engage consumers in transacting business
	via mobile devices. On November 19, 2014, the Company entered into a Spin-off Agreement (the “Agreement”) with a company
	controlled by a former shareholder to sell all intellectual property and assets associated with the previous business of the Company,
	pursuant to which the Company was released from certain liabilities amounting to $420,653.




	 




	During
	the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015, the Company entered into an Exploration and Option to Enter Joint Venture Agreement with
	a third party (Note 10).




	 




	The
	Company has incurred losses since inception and has an accumulated deficit of $3,255,213 (March 31, 2016 - $2,040,757) as of December
	31, 2016, with limited resources and limited source of operating cash flows. As of December 31, 2016, the Company’s working
	capital deficiency was $301,562 (March 31, 2016 – $196,599).




	 




	The
	Company’s continuance as a going concern is dependent on the success of the efforts of its directors and principal stockholders
	in providing financial support in the short-term, raising additional capital through equity or debt financing either from its
	own resources or from third parties, and achieving profitable operations. In the event that such resources are not secured, the
	assets may not be realized or liabilities discharged at their carrying amounts, and the difference from the carrying amounts reported
	in these unaudited interim financial statements could be material. There is no assurance that management’s plan to seek
	additional capital will be realized, and these factors cast substantial doubt upon the use of the going concern assumption.




	 




	These
	unaudited interim financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability
	and classification of the assets or the amounts and classifications of the liabilities that may result from the inability of the
	Company to continue as a going concern.




	 







	2.






	Significant
	Accounting Policies







	 






	 




	(a)




	Basis
	of presentation






	 




	These
	unaudited interim financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
	States of America (“US GAAP”). The Company’s functional and reporting currency is the US dollar.




	 




	These
	unaudited interim financial statements reflect all adjustments (all of which are normal and recurring in nature) that, in the
	opinion of management, are necessary for fair presentation of the interim financial information. The results of operations for
	the interim period presented are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any subsequent quarter or for the
	entire fiscal year ending March 31, 2017. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in annual financial statements
	prepared in accordance with US GAAP have been condensed or omitted. These unaudited interim financial statements and notes included
	herein have been prepared on a basis consistent with, and should be read in conjunction with, the Company’s audited financial
	statements and notes for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, as filed in its Form 10-K.

	GOLD
	TORRENT, INC.





	Notes
	to Interim Financial Statements




	Nine
	Months Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015




	(Unaudited
	- Expressed in US dollars)




	 







	2.






	Significant
	Accounting Policies (continued)







	 






	 




	(b)




	Use
	of estimates






	 




	The
	preparation of interim financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
	affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the interim
	financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, the
	Company evaluates its estimates, including, but not limited to, those related to accounts payable and accrued liabilities, the
	fair value of warrants attached to common shares issued, the fair value of shares issued for services, the fair value of stock
	options granted, and the recoverability of income tax assets.




	 




	While
	management believes the estimates used are reasonable, actual results could differ from those estimates and could impact future
	results of operations and cash flows.




	 






	 




	(c)




	Basic
	and diluted earnings (loss) per share






	 




	Basic
	earnings (loss) per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings (loss)
	per share assumes the exercise of common stock equivalents, such as stock issuable pursuant to the exercise of stock options and
	warrants. However, the calculation of diluted loss per share excludes the effects of various conversions and exercise of options
	and warrants that would be anti-dilutive.




	 






	 




	(d)




	Foreign
	currency translation






	 




	Transactions
	in currencies other than the US dollar are translated into US dollars at the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date
	for monetary assets and liabilities, and at historical exchange rates for non-monetary assets and liabilities. Expenses are translated
	at the average rates for the period, except amortization, which is translated on the same basis as the related assets. Resulting
	translation gains or losses are reflected in net income/loss.




	 






	 




	(e)




	Financial
	instruments






	 




	All
	financial instruments are classified as one of the following: held-to-maturity, loans and receivables, held-for-trading, available-for-sale
	or other financial liabilities. Financial assets and liabilities held-for-trading are measured at fair value with gains and losses
	recognized in net income. Financial assets held-to-maturity, loans and receivables, and other financial liabilities are measured
	at amortized cost using the effective interest method. Available-for-sale instruments are measured at fair value with unrealized
	gains and losses recognized in other comprehensive income and reported in stockholders’ equity.




	 




	A
	financial instrument’s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant
	to the fair value measurement. The Company prioritizes the inputs into three levels that may be used to measure fair value:




	 






	 




	(i)
	Level 1 –




	Applies
	to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.






	 




	 




	 






	 




	(ii)
	Level 2 –




	Applies
	to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the
	asset or liability, either directly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, or indirectly,
	such as quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions.






	 




	 




	 






	 




	(iii)
	Level 3 –




	Applies
	to assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable market data.

	GOLD
	TORRENT, INC.





	Notes
	to Interim Financial Statements




	Nine
	Months Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015




	(Unaudited
	- Expressed in US dollars)




	 







	2.






	Significant
	Accounting Policies (continued)







	 






	 




	(e)




	Financial
	instruments (continued)






	 




	Transaction
	costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial instruments that are classified as held-to-maturity,
	loans and receivables or other financial liabilities are included in the initial carrying value of such instruments and amortized
	using the effective interest method. Transaction costs classified as held-for-trading are expensed when incurred, while those
	classified as available-for-sale are included in the initial carrying value.




	 






	 




	(f)




	Income
	taxes






	 




	The
	Company uses the asset and liability approach in its method of accounting for income taxes that requires the recognition of deferred
	tax liabilities and assets for expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the
	tax basis of assets and liabilities. The Company recognizes the effect of uncertain tax positions where it is more likely than
	not based on technical merits that the position could be sustained where the tax benefit has a greater than 50% likelihood of
	being realized upon settlement. A valuation allowance against deferred tax assets is recorded if based upon available evidence,
	it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.




	 






	 




	(g)




	Share-based
	payments






	 




	The
	Company records all share-based payments at fair value. Where equity instruments are granted to employees, they are recorded at
	the fair value of the equity instrument granted at the grant date. The grant date fair value is recognized through profit or loss
	over the vesting period, described as the period during which all the vesting conditions are to be satisfied.




	 




	Where
	equity instruments are granted to non-employees, they are recorded at the fair value of the goods or services received. When the
	value of goods or services received in exchange for the share-based payment cannot be reliably estimated, the fair value is measured
	by use of a valuation model.




	 




	At
	each balance sheet date, the amount recognized as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of stock options expected
	to vest. On the exercise of stock options, common stock is recorded for the consideration received and for the fair value amounts
	previously recorded to contributed surplus. The Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to estimate the fair value
	of share-based payments.




	 






	 




	(h)




	Exploration
	and evaluation






	 




	The
	Company is primarily engaged in the acquisition and exploration of mining properties. Mineral property exploration costs are expensed
	as incurred. Mineral property acquisition costs are initially capitalized when incurred. An impairment loss is recognized when
	the sum of the expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the mineral property. Impairment losses,
	if any, are measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the mineral property over its estimated fair value.




	 






	 




	(i)




	Recent
	accounting guidance adopted






	 




	The
	Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect. These pronouncements did not have any material impact
	on the financial statements unless otherwise disclosed, and the Company does not believe that there are any other new accounting
	pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.

	Notes
	to Interim Financial Statements

	Months Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015




	(Unaudited
	- Expressed in US dollars)




	 







	3.






	Financial
	Instruments







	 




	The
	Company has designated its cash as held-for-trading; and accounts payable, accrued liabilities and stockholders’ loans as
	other financial liabilities.




	 






	 




	(a)




	Fair
	value






	 




	The
	fair values of the Company’s cash, accounts payable, accrued liabilities and stockholders’ loans approximate their
	carrying values due to the short-term maturity of these instruments.




	 






	 




	(b)




	Credit
	risk






	 




	Credit
	risk is the risk of potential loss to the Company if the counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual
	obligations. The Company is not exposed to significant credit risk as of December 31, 2016.




	 






	 




	(c)




	Translation
	risk






	 




	The
	Company’s functional currency is the US dollar. The Company translates transactions in foreign currencies into US currency
	using rates on the date of the transactions. Translation risk is considered minimal, as the Company does not incur any significant
	transactions in currencies other than US dollars.




	 






	 




	(d)




	Interest
	rate risk






	 




	The
	Company is not exposed to significant interest rate risk due to the short-term maturity of its monetary current assets and liabilities.




	 






	 




	(e)




	Liquidity
	risk






	 




	Liquidity
	risk is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in satisfying its financial obligations as they become due. The Company
	manages its liquidity risk by forecasting cash flows from operations and anticipated investing and financing activities. At December
	31, 2016, the Company had accounts payable of $118,216 (March 31, 2016 - $226,619), which are due within 30 days or less. At December
	31, 2016, accrued liabilities consist of accrued accounting and legal fees of $10,000 (March 31, 2016 - $15,000), and accrued
	executive compensation of $423,107 (March 31, 2016 - $264,750).




	 







	4.






	Common
	Stock







	 




	During
	the year ended March 31, 2016, the Company entered into subscription agreements for the issuance of 5,363,600 shares of common
	stock at a purchase price of $0.25 per share for a total amount of $1,340,900 in cash.




	 



	During the period ended December 31, 2016,
	the Company entered into subscription agreements for the issuance of 500,000 shares of common stock at a purchase price
	of $0.50 per share for a total amount of $250,000 in cash.



	 







	5.






	Stock
	Options







	 




	Stock
	options have been granted in conjunction with an Equity Incentive Plan (the “Plan”) for employees, directors and consultants,
	whereby a maximum aggregate number of common shares that may be issued under the Plan are 20,000,000 common shares. The term of
	the options is determined by the Board of Directors and cannot exceed 10 years. The exercise price of the stock options is determined
	by Board of Directors, but shall not be less than the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant. Stock options
	granted under the Plan vest over varying periods at the discretion of the Board of Directors. During the period ended December
	31, 2016 and fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, the Company did not grant any options to officers and directors of the Company.

	Exploration
	and Development







	 




	On
	July 28, 2014, the Company entered into a non-binding Letter of Intent (“LOI”) with a third party to negotiate and
	enter into a Joint Venture Agreement for the development of the gold property known as Lucky Shot, Alaska (formerly known as “Willow
	Creek”). On November 5, 2014, the Company signed an Exploration and Option to Enter Joint Venture Agreement for the Lucky
	Shot project in Alaska. The Exploration and Option Agreement provides the Company with the right to earn up to a 70% interest
	in a joint venture with Miranda USA Inc. (“Miranda”) by making certain expenditures over the next three years totaling
	$10,000,000. The principal terms of the Exploration and Option Agreement initially provided that the Company could earn an initial
	20% interest in the Lucky Shot gold project by incurring an initial work commitment of $1,070,000 before November 5, 2015 in costs
	related to exploration and development of the project. On September 2, 2015, Miranda granted the Company a Nine-month extension
	to the dates related to this earn-in. Therefore, the Company was able to earn an initial 20% interest in the Lucky Shot gold project
	by incurring an initial work commitment of $1,070,000 before May 5, 2016 in costs related to exploration and development of the
	project. On May 25, 2016, the Company received formal notice from Miranda that the Company has acquired a permanent 20% interest
	in the Lucky Shot project by virtue of meeting the initial earning required expenditures.




	 




	On
	January 15, 2015 and January 6, 2016, the Company paid $150,000 for a Lease Agreement between Miranda and a private company, and
	the amount was included in prepaid expenses and expensed over 12 months. In addition, the Company is committed to paying $150,000
	every year on January 15. The purpose of this lease is to afford Miranda the opportunity to enter onto and produce minerals from
	certain patents and State of Alaska mining claims located in the State of Alaska. This lease is to be transferred by Miranda to
	the joint venture upon the Company earning its initial 20% interest. The parties have agreed to postpone forming the joint venture
	company until the project finance discussions have been advanced to a point where the security and other requirements of the project
	investor can be determined.




	 




	On
	May 25, 2016, the Company received formal notice from Miranda that the Company has acquired a permanent 20% interest in the Lucky
	Shot project by virtue of meeting the initial earning required expenditures.




	 




	On
	July 8, 2016, the Company purchased a 30-acre parcel of private, undeveloped land for $100,507 in Alaska near the Lucky Shot project
	for the siting of a gold recovery plant.




	 




	The
	total of $1,807,830 expended for exploration and development costs consists of exploration, engineering and evaluation costs of
	$949,932 as of March 31, 2016, and $857,898 in development costs during the nine months ended December 31, 2016, consisting of:

	Business
	Overview





	 




	Gold
	Torrent, Inc. (the “Company”) was incorporated in Nevada as Celldonate Inc. on August 15, 2006. Historically we were
	in the business of developing mobile monetization solutions and applications. On September 10, 2013, certain shareholders, including
	the Company’s current Chief Executive Officer and its President, acquired approximately 53% of the Company’s issued
	and outstanding common stock resulting in a change of control. In connection with the transaction, Daniel Kunz was appointed Executive
	Chairman and Ryan Hart was appointed Chief Executive Officer and President. Thereafter the Company began to focus on acquiring
	ownership in late-stage exploration to development stage gold mining projects and/or royalty or streaming interests in low capital
	intensity, late-stage mining projects in North America. On January 16, 2014, the Company changed its name to “Gold Torrent,
	Inc.” in order to better reflect the direction and business of the Company. On that date, the Company also amended its Articles
	of Incorporation to (i) effectuate a reverse split of the Company’s common stock on a 1 for 5 basis; and (ii) increase the
	number of the Company’s authorized capital stock to 220,000,000 of which 200,000,000 were classified as common stock and
	20,000,000 were classified as “blank check” preferred stock. On November 19, 2014, the Company entered into a Spin-off
	Agreement (the “Agreement”) with a company controlled by a former shareholder to sell all intellectual property and
	assets associated with the previous business of the Company, pursuant to which the Company was released from certain liabilities
	amounting to $420,653.




	 




	Going
	forward, the Company plans to focus on acquiring ownership in late-stage exploration to development-stage gold mining projects
	and/or royalty or streaming interests in low capital intensity, late-stage mining projects in North America but may pursue other
	profitable business opportunities that are available to us. Our main focus will be on identifying solid resources, and then utilize
	funding to bring a distressed asset into production, while either securing equity ownership or rights of title in the form of
	royalties. We are targeting pre-production resource projects that are well understood and show strong financial projections and
	low capital intensity, where we can apply capital to take the projects into production within 12-36 months.

	On
	November 5, 2014, the Company signed an Exploration and Option to Enter Joint Venture Agreement with Miranda U.S.A., Inc. (“Miranda”)
	for the Willow Creek project in Alaska (the “Exploration and Option Agreement”). The Exploration and Option Agreement
	provides the Company with the right to earn up to 70% interest in a joint venture with Miranda Gold Corp. by making certain expenditures
	over the next three years totaling US$10 million. The initial principal terms of the Exploration and Option Agreement provided
	that the Company could earn an initial 20% interest in the Willow Creek gold project by incurring an initial work commitment of
	$1,070,000 before November 5, 2015 in costs related to exploration and development of the project. On September 2, 2015 Miranda
	granted the Company a six-month extension to the dates related to the earn-in. Therefore the Company could earn an initial 20%
	interest in the Willow Creek gold project by incurring an initial work commitment of $1,070,000 before May 5, 2016 in costs related
	to exploration and development of the project. While the Company shall be the manager of the initial joint venture, the management
	committee during the initial earn–in period shall be comprised of one nominee from the Company and one nominee from Miranda.




	 




	Upon
	completion of the initial work commitment, the Company can then either terminate the agreement or exercise an option to enter
	into a limited liability company (“JV”) with Miranda under the following terms:




	 






	 




	●




	Miranda
	will assign the underlying twenty-year lease that includes 8700 acres of patented mining claims and State Claims on the Lucky
	Shot project to the JV and Miranda will retain a 30% participating interest in the JV;






	 




	 




	 






	 




	●




	The
	Company will solely fund the next US$8.93 million of expenditures on the JV to earn a 70% interest in the JV in two stages
	over the next two years while Miranda will hold the remaining 30%; and






	 




	 




	 






	 




	●




	The
	Company shall be entitled to 90% of the cash flow from production at the Lucky Shot project until it recovers its US$10 million
	initial capital investment, and 80% of the cash flow from production thereafter until it recovers any of its initial investment
	that exceeds $10 million, and thereafter shall be entitled to 70% of project cash flows. Miranda shall be entitled to 10%,
	20% and 30%, respectively, of the Lucky Shot cash flow.






	 




	The
	Company plans to complete initial engineering, resource, permitting, and economic studies during the initial earn-in period with
	a goal to bring the Lucky Shot project, beginning initially in the Coleman area gold resource area, into production as soon as
	possible. Expansion and exploration drilling is planned during construction and during commercial production and is expected to
	expand the initial known mineralization well beyond the current levels.




	 




	On
	January 15, 2015, and January 6, 2016 the Company paid $150,000 for a Lease Agreement between Miranda USA Inc. and a private company,
	and the amount was included in prepaid expenses and expensed over 12 months. In addition, the Company is committed to paying $150,000
	every year on January 15. The purpose of this lease is to afford Miranda USA Inc. the opportunity to enter onto and produce minerals
	from certain patented and State of Alaska mining claims located in the State of Alaska. This lease is to be transferred by Miranda
	to the joint venture upon the Company earning its initial 20% interest.




	 




	On
	May 25, 2016, the Company received formal notice from Miranda that the Company has acquired a permanent 20% interest in the Lucky
	Shot project by virtue of meeting the initial earning required expenditures. The parties have agreed to postpone forming the joint
	venture company until the project finance discussions have been advanced to a point where the security and other requirements
	of the project investor can be determined.




	 




	The
	Company engaged third party consultants to complete a Preliminary Feasibility Study on its Lucky Shot Project. The Preliminary
	Feasibility Study for the Lucky Shot Project was completed June 30, 2016. The study concludes, “The Project is projected
	to have robust economics at the base case gold and silver prices of $1,175/oz. and $15.00/oz. respectively. The Project would
	be economically viable based on the parameters considered in this study. The base case scenario produces approximately 79,100
	salable ounces of gold and 7,700 salable ounces of silver over a 4.5-year period. The Project is most sensitive to the gold price
	and to operating costs, but not as sensitive to capital costs. The base case economic analysis of the Project shows an After-Tax
	NPV-10 of $5.28 million using a 200-tonne/day crushing/grinding/gravity separation plant. The total required initial and working
	capital is $16.2 million and reaches pay-back in 1.9 years at an after tax IRR of 21.8%.”

	On
	July 8, 2016, the Company purchased for $100,507 a 30-acre parcel of private, undeveloped land in Alaska near the Lucky Shot project
	for the siting of a gold recovery plant.




	 




	During
	the current quarter the Company was engaged in project finance efforts culminating in three project finance term sheets. On September
	16, 2016 management entered into a 45-day exclusivity period with one of the short-listed prospective investors. The Company inspected
	the Coleman underground works with one prospective project investor at the Lucky Shot project as part of their due diligence period.




	 




	During
	August the Company conducted assessment work on the project’s State of Alaska claim blocks. One 640-foot surface core drill
	hole was completed in an area underlain by the eastern extension of the Murphy Vein block. This drill hole was designed to test
	the concept that the zone encountered in the 2005 – 2009 prior owner drilling program extends across the valley floor at
	a depth of about 350 feet. The success of the drill hole provides a much larger resource target area for future exploration drilling.

	conducted
	chemical analysis of the water samples collected






	 




	 




	 






	 




	●




	excavated
	four pits to assess mill foundation load bearing strengths






	 




	 




	 






	 




	●




	completed
	laboratory analysis of the ground materials and






	 




	 




	 






	 




	●




	provided
	survey locations.






	 




	Detailed
	design and engineering work for the gold recovery plant was continued through the reporting period. The gravity only gold recovery
	plant design and final engineering is near complete and ready for construction drawings and plant to be completed. Logistics analyses
	have been completed for shipment of required plant equipment, materials and supplies from various vendors to the project site.
	The mine engineering work continued for the period on portal and surface logistics and requirements.




	 




	Planning
	continues for project permitting, staffing, training and project initiation and startup.




	 




	During
	the current period, we retained new legal counsel and terminated the services of our previous legal counsel. The termination resulted
	in the Company receiving a settlement of all past and current debt invoices, a mutual release from certain liabilities and obligations,
	and a $66,000 gain on the settlement of debt due to a negotiated discount.




	 




	The
	total of the $1,807,830 expended exploration and development costs, consists of the exploration and evaluation cost of $949,932
	as of March 31, 2016, and the $857,898 development cost during the Nine months ending at December 31, 2016, consisting of: Mine
	Engineering cost (including prepaid) $150,356, Mill Engineering cost $281,056, Laboratory Costs $16,788, Metallurgy cost $64,301,
	Geology cost $48,238, Exploration drilling cost $50,591, Permitting cost 23,920, development related travel cost $36,689, development
	related administration cost $14,874, development related rent cost $17,067, property lease cost $53,487, and Property Acquisition
	cost $100,531

	the same period in the prior year.




	 




	Our
	total expenses during the three months ended December 31, 2016 consisted of $21,311 in accounting and legal fees, $308,731 in
	development costs, $121,250 in executive compensation, $4,614 in licenses and fees, $208 in bank charges and finance fees, $8,743
	in travel costs, and $1,588 in office expenses. For the same period ended December 31, 2015, we incurred expenses of $15,959 in
	accounting and legal fees, $56,977 in exploration and evaluation costs, $121,250 in executive compensation, $42,595 in licenses
	and fees, $2,508 in bank charges and finance fees, $7,595 in travel costs, and $4,712 in office expenses. Our total expenses are
	significantly higher. The variation in expenses is mainly due to the higher development and exploration fees related to the Lucky
	Shot property start up.




	 





	For
	the Nine Months ended December 31, 2016





	 




	During
	the nine months ended December 31, 2016, we recognized $66,000 gain on settlement of debt, compared to $nil during the same period
	in the prior year.




	 




	During
	the nine month period ended December 31, 2016, we recognized a loss from continuing operations of $1,214,456, compared to a loss
	of $951,730 during the same period in the prior year.




	 




	Our
	net loss per share for the nine months ended December 31, 2016 was $0.09. Our net loss per share for the nine months ended December
	31, 2015 was $0.09,




	 




	During
	the nine months ended December 31, 2016, we incurred total expenses of $1,280,456, compared to total expenses of $951,730 during
	the same period in the prior year.




	 




	Our
	total expenses during the nine months ended December 31, 2016 consisted of $96,864 in accounting and legal fees, $723,091in development
	costs, $363,750 in executive compensation, $55,113 in licenses and fees, $1,792 in bank charges and finance fees, $31,938 in travel
	costs, and $7,908 in office expenses. For the same period ended December 31, 2015, we incurred expenses of $58,459 in accounting
	and legal fees, $3,744 in advertising and promotion, $463,080 in exploration and evaluation costs, $242,500 in executive compensation,
	$127,610 in licenses and fees, $11,661 in bank charges and finance fees, $20,506 in travel costs, $8,850 in share-based payments,
	and $15,320 in office expenses. Our total expenses are higher. The variation in expenses is mainly due to the higher accounting
	and legal fees and development cost and decreased finance fees due to the payment of loans.

	Liquidity
	and Capital Resources





	 




	We
	have limited operational history, and did not generate any revenues besides the gain on settlement of debt. As of December 31,
	2016, we had $249,761 in cash and prepaid expenses, $551,323 in total liabilities and a working capital deficiency of $301,562.
	As of December 31, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $3,255,213. We are dependent on funds raised through equity financing,
	related parties, and loan payables. Our operations were funded by equity financing and advances from shareholders and former and
	current related parties. We anticipate that we will incur substantial losses for the foreseeable future and our ability to generate
	any revenues in the next 12 months continues to be uncertain.




	 




	During
	the Nine months ended December 31, 2016, we used $1,078,789 in cash on continuing operating activities, and paid back $93,793
	in loans and received net $1,116,207 from cash provided by financing activities, invested $100,507 in land and decreased cash
	by $63,089. During the same period in fiscal 2015 we used $643,491 in cash on continuing operating activities, and paid back $201,825
	in loans and increased cash by $310,584.




	 




	During
	the Nine months ended December 31, 2016, we received an additional $1,210,000 in proceeds from issuance of common stock, compared
	to proceeds of $1,155,900 in cash during the same period in fiscal 2015. For the period ending December 31, 2016 the Company has
	accrued interest of $936 (March 31, 2016 - $13,446).




	 




	During
	the Nine months ended December 31, 2016, our monthly cash requirements to fund our operating activities, including advances from
	former related parties, was approximately $119,865 compared to approximately $71,499 during the same period in fiscal 2015. In
	the absence of the continued sale of our common stock or advances from the former or new related parties, our cash of $202,226
	as of December 31, 2016 is not sufficient to cover our current monthly burn rate for the foreseeable future and not enough to
	pay our current liabilities balance of $551,323. Until we are able to complete private and/or public financing as described below,
	we anticipate that we will rely on loans from shareholders to proceed with our plan of operations.




	 




	Our
	business strategy going forward is to acquire ownership in late-stage exploration to development-stage gold mining projects and/or
	royalty or streaming interests in low capital intensity, mining projects in North America. Our main focus will be on identifying
	solid resources, and then utilize funding to bring a distressed asset into production, while either securing equity ownership
	or rights of title in the form of royalties.




	 




	We
	expect to require approximately $5,000,000 in equity funds and up to $12 to $15 million in project funds to carry out our business
	strategy. Our plan of operations over the next 12 months is to obtain the necessary financing to earn at least an additional 25%
	interest in the Lucky Shot project by expending $2.44 million and advance the project to production. We also are seeking financing
	to earn the full 70% interest available. If we secure less than the full amount of financing that we require, we will not be able
	to carry out our complete business plan and we will be forced to proceed with a scaled back business plan based on our available
	financial resources.




	 





	Future
	Financings





	 




	We
	have not generated any revenues, have achieved losses since our inception, and rely upon the sale of our securities, loans and
	advances from current related parties to fund our operations. We anticipate that we will incur substantial losses for the foreseeable
	future, and we are dependent upon obtaining outside financing to carry out our operations. Our unaudited financial statements
	for the three months ended December 31, 2016 have been prepared on a going concern basis and do not include any adjustments that
	might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.




	 




	We
	will require approximately $5,000,000 over the next 12 months in order to enable us to proceed with our plan of operations, including
	paying our ongoing expenses. These cash requirements are in excess of our current cash and working capital resources. Accordingly,
	we intend to raise the balance of our cash requirements for the next 12 months from private placements, advances from related
	parties or possibly a registered public offering (either self-underwritten or through a broker-dealer), or from third party investors
	including streaming, royalty and lending investors. If we are unsuccessful in raising enough money through such efforts, we may
	review other financing possibilities such as bank loans. On September 16, 2016, we signed a non-binding term sheet with a prospective
	project investor that had a 45-day exclusivity period ending October 31 for Lucky Shot project finance which expired at that time.
	On November 10, 2016, we signed a non-binding term sheet with a prospective project investor that has a 45-day exclusivity period
	ending December 28 for Lucky Shot project finance. On November 21, the Company accompanied a prospective investor to the Lucky
	Shot underground workings and to the various surface sites on a due diligence visit in Alaska. The due diligence work and preparation
	of documents related to the prospective investor are continuing through this reporting period. There is no guarantee that any
	financing will be available to us or if available, on terms that will be acceptable to us.




	 











	 



	18



	 









	 


	 


	 







	 




	If
	we are unable to obtain the necessary additional financing, then we plan to reduce the amounts that we spend on our operations
	so as not to exceed the amount of capital resources that are available to us. If we do not secure additional financing our current
	cash reserves and working capital will not be sufficient to enable us to sustain our operations for the next 12 months, even if
	we do decide to scale back our operations.




	 





	Off-Balance
	Sheet Arrangements





	 




	We
	do not have any off balance sheet arrangements.




	 





	Critical
	Accounting Policies





	 




	Our
	unaudited interim financial statements are affected by the accounting policies used and the estimates and assumptions made by
	management during their preparation. A complete summary of these policies is included in Note 2 of the notes to our unaudited
	interim financial statements. We have identified below the accounting policies that are of particular importance in the presentation
	of our financial position, results of operations and cash flows, and which require the application of significant judgment by
	our management.




	 





	Foreign
	Currency Translation





	 




	Our
	unaudited financial statements are presented in United States dollars. Transactions in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are
	translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date for monetary assets and liabilities, and
	at historical exchange rates for non-monetary assets and liabilities. Expenses are translated at the average rates for the period,
	excluding amortization, which is translated on the same basis as the related assets. Resulting translation gains or losses are
	reflected in net loss.




	 





	Share-Based
	Payments





	 




	The
	Company records all share-based payments at fair value. Where equity instruments are granted to employees, they are recorded at
	the fair value of the equity instrument granted at the grant date. The grant date fair value is recognized through profit or loss
	over the vesting period, described as the period during which all the vesting conditions are to be satisfied.




	 




	Where
	equity instruments are granted to non-employees, they are recorded at the fair value of the goods or services received. When the
	value of goods or services received in exchange for the share-based payment cannot be reliably estimated, the fair value is measured
	by use of a valuation model.




	 




	At
	each balance sheet date, the amount recognized as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of stock options expected
	to vest. On the exercise of stock options, common stock is recorded for the consideration received and for the fair value amounts
	previously recorded to contributed surplus. The Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to estimate the fair value
	of share-based payments.




	 





	Recent
	Accounting Guidance Adopted





	 




	The
	Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect. These pronouncements did not have any material impact
	on the financial statements unless otherwise disclosed, and the Company does not believe that there are any other new accounting
	pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.




	 





	Inflation





	 




	The
	amounts presented in the unaudited interim financial statements do not provide for the effect of inflation on our operations or
	financial position. The net operating losses shown would be greater than reported if the effects of inflation were reflected either
	by charging operations with amounts that represent replacement costs or by using other inflation adjustments.

	Item
	3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk





	 




	We
	are a smaller reporting company as defined by 17 C.F.R. 229 (10)(f)(i) and are not required to provide information under this
	item.





	 









	Item
	4. Controls and Procedures





	 





	Disclosure
	Controls





	 




	We
	maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) designed
	to provide reasonable assurance the information required to be reported in our Exchange Act filings is recorded, processed, summarized
	and reported within the time periods specified and pursuant to Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) rules and
	forms, including controls and procedures designed to ensure that this information is accumulated and communicated to our management,
	including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required
	disclosure.




	 




	As
	of the end of the period covered by this report, our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
	Financial Officer, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon this evaluation,
	our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective
	to ensure that information we are required to disclose in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
	summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms.




	 





	Internal
	Control Over Financial Reporting





	 




	Our
	management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. Under the supervision
	of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control
	over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016 using the criteria established in

	Internal Control—Integrated Framework

	(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).




	 




	A
	material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there
	is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or
	detected on a timely basis. In our assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of March 31,
	2016, we determined that there were significant deficiencies that constituted material weaknesses, as described below.




	 






	1.




	We
	do not have a majority of independent directors. We have no policy on fraud and no code of ethics at this time.






	 




	 






	2.




	All
	cash management is conducted solely by the Company’s officers, which may result in the misappropriation of funds.






	 




	 






	3.




	The
	lack of independent directors exercising an oversight role increases the risk of management override and potential fraud.






	 




	 






	4.




	We
	are in the development stage with limited resources and limited monitoring of internal control and assessment of risk is conducted.






	 




	Management
	is currently evaluating remediation plans for the above control deficiencies.




	 




	In
	light of the existence of these control deficiencies, management concluded that there is a reasonable possibility that a material
	misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by the company’s
	internal controls.




	 




	As
	a result, management has concluded that we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of December
	31, 2016 based on criteria established in

	Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013)

	issued by COSO.




	 





	Changes
	in Internal Control





	 




	There
	were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) under the Exchange
	Act) during the three months ended December 31, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect,
	our internal control over financial reporting.
