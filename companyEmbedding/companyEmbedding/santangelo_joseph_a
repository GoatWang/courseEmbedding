Description


Product Details




                    The solitude and quiet peace of a flickering candle has long been a symbol of remembrance.

Website in perpetuity. Through the lighting of a memorial candle, your thoughtful gesture will be recorded
 and the proceeds will go directly towards helping ensure that the 
family and friends of Joseph S. Santangelo can continue to memorialize, re-visit, interact with each 
other and enhance this tribute for future generations.

                



Candle will be lit for the limited time of one month
