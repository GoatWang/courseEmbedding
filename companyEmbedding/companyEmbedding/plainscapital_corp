PLAINSCAPITAL CORPORATION Revenue and Financial Data

   PlainsCapital isn't just a plain old bank. PlainsCapital Corporation is the holding company for PlainsCapital Bank, which has some 40 branches in and around the Texas cities of Austin, Dallas, Fort Worth, Lubbock, and San Antonio, as well as an offshore branch in the Cayman Islands. Most locations (except those in Lubbock) eschew marketing to the masses, instead focusing on serving middle-market companies and high-net worth individuals as a way to differentiate itself from competitors. In addition to deposit and loan services, PlainsCapital offers private banking, wealth and investment management, trust services, correspondent banking, and equipment leasing. Hilltop Holdings acquired PlainsCapital in 2012.

PLAINSCAPITAL CORPORATION Revenue and Financial Data

   PlainsCapital isn't just a plain old bank. PlainsCapital Corporation is the holding company for PlainsCapital Bank, which has some 40 branches in and around the Texas cities of Austin, Dallas, Fort Worth, Lubbock, and San Antonio, as well as an offshore branch in the Cayman Islands. Most locations (except those in Lubbock) eschew marketing to the masses, instead focusing on serving middle-market companies and high-net worth individuals as a way to differentiate itself from competitors. In addition to deposit and loan services, PlainsCapital offers private banking, wealth and investment management, trust services, correspondent banking, and equipment leasing. Hilltop Holdings acquired PlainsCapital in 2012.

PLAINSCAPITAL CORPORATION Company Profile

   PlainsCapital isn't just a plain old bank. PlainsCapital Corporation is the holding company for PlainsCapital Bank, which has some 40 branches in and around the Texas cities of Austin, Dallas, Fort Worth, Lubbock, and San Antonio, as well as an offshore branch in the Cayman Islands. Most locations (except those in Lubbock) eschew marketing to the masses, instead focusing on serving middle-market companies and high-net worth individuals as a way to differentiate itself from competitors. In addition to deposit and loan services, PlainsCapital offers private banking, wealth and investment management, trust services, correspondent banking, and equipment leasing. Hilltop Holdings acquired PlainsCapital in 2012.
