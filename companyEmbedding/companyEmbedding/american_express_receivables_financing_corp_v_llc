AMERICAN EXPRESS RECEIVABLES FINANCING CORP V LLC - S-3/A - 20060217 - PROCEED_USE





USE OF PROCEEDS



The net proceeds from the sale of each series, class and tranche of notes
offered hereby will be paid to the transferor and used by the transferor for
the general corporate purposes of the transferor, including the repayment of
amounts owed to TRS or certain of its affiliates.



THE ISSUING ENTITY



American Express Issuance Trust, also referred to as the issuance trust or
the issuing entity, is a statutory trust created under the laws of the State
of Delaware on May 18, 2005. The issuing entity's principal offices are in
Delaware, in case of Wilmington Trust Company, as owner trustee, at the
following address: Rodney Square North, 1100 North Market Street, Wilmington,
Delaware 19890-1600. Its phone number is (302) 651-1000.


RFC V is the depositor and transferor to the issuance trust. Pursuant to
receivables purchase agreements, each of Centurion and FSB sells to TRS its
right, title and interest in the receivables in the accounts designated to be
included in the issuing entity's Portfolio, and TRS sells its right, title and
interest in the receivables in those accounts and receivables in accounts
owned by TRS to RFC V. See "Description of the Receivables Purchase Agreements
and the Sale Agreements" in this prospectus. Those receivables are then
transferred, subject to certain conditions, by RFC V to the issuing entity.
See "Sources of Funds to Pay the Notes--Addition of Assets" in this
prospectus. RFC V or any of its affiliates may also be a transferor to master
trusts or other securitization special purpose entities which issue collateral
certificates that are included in the issuance trust.


Uniform Commercial Code financing statements have been and will be filed, to
the extent appropriate, to perfect the ownership or security interests of the
issuing entity and the indenture trustee described herein. See "Risk Factors"
in this prospectus for a discussion of risks associated with the issuing
entity and the issuing entity's assets and see "Description of the Receivables
Purchase Agreements and the Sale Agreements," "Sources of Funds to Pay the
Notes--Representations and Warranties" and "The Indenture--Issuing Entity
Covenants" in this prospectus for a discussion of certain covenants regarding
the perfection of security interests.


The issuing entity operates under a trust agreement, dated as of May 18,
2005, as amended from time to time, between RFC V, as transferor, and
Wilmington Trust Company. The issuing entity does not have any officers or
directors. Currently, its sole beneficiary is RFC V, although affiliates of
RFC V may be beneficiaries in the future. The powers and duties of the owner
trustee are ministerial only.  Accordingly, as beneficiary, RFC V will direct
the owner trustee in the management of the issuing entity and its assets.


39





RFC V and the owner trustee may amend the trust agreement without the
consent of the noteholders or the indenture trustee so long as the amendment
is not reasonably expected to (i) adversely affect in any material respect the
interests of the noteholders or (ii) significantly change the permitted
activities of the issuing entity, as set forth in the trust agreement.
Accordingly, neither the indenture trustee nor any holder of any note will be
entitled to vote on any such amendment.


In addition, RFC V and the owner trustee may amend the trust agreement if
holders of not less than (i) in the case of a significant change in the
permitted activities of the issuing entity which the issuing entity does not
reasonably expect to have a material adverse effect on the noteholders, a
majority of the aggregate outstanding dollar principal amount of the notes
affected by an amendment consent, and (ii) in all other cases, 66 2/3% of the
aggregate outstanding dollar principal amount of the notes affected by an
amendment consent; however, unless all of the holders of the aggregate
outstanding dollar principal amount of the notes consent, the trust agreement
may not be amended for the purpose of (a) increasing or reducing the amount
of, or accelerating or delaying the timing of, collections of payments in
respect of the assets of the issuance trust or distributions that are required
to be made for the benefit of the noteholders or (b) reducing the percentage
of holders of the outstanding dollar principal amount of the notes the holders
of which are required to consent to any amendment.


See "The Indenture--Tax Opinions for Amendments" in this prospectus for
additional conditions to amending the trust agreement.


The issuing entity's activities will include, but not be limited to:


o acquiring and holding the receivables, collateral certificates and other
assets of the issuing entity and the proceeds from these assets;


o issuing notes;


o making payments on the notes; and


o engaging in other activities that are necessary or incidental to
accomplish these limited purposes.


As of the date of this prospectus, the issuing entity's primary assets are:


o receivables arising in designated consumer and small business charge
accounts owned by TRS, Centurion and FSB; and


o funds on deposit in the issuing entity accounts.


In the future, the issuance trust may include receivables arising in
designated commercial charge accounts owned by TRS or any of its affiliates,
receivables arising in additional designated consumer and small business
accounts owned by TRS, Centurion, FSB or any of their affiliates and
collateral certificates, each representing an undivided interest in a master
trust or other securitization special purpose entity, whose assets consist
primarily of receivables in designated charge accounts owned by TRS,
Centurion, FSB or any of their affiliates. It is not expected that the issuing
entity will have any other significant assets or means of capitalization.  The
fiscal year for the issuing entity will end on December 31 of each year.


40





The issuing entity has established a collection account for the purpose of
receiving collections on receivables and any other assets included in the
issuance trust, including collections on any collateral certificates included
in the issuance trust. The issuing entity also has established an
overconcentration account for the purpose of holding Principal Collections
that would otherwise be paid to the holder of the transferor interest at a
time when the Commercial Obligor Overconcentration Amount is greater than zero
and the Available Overconcentration Account Amount is, or as a result of a
payment would become, less than the Required Overconcentration Account Amount.
In addition, the issuing entity has established an excess funding account for
the purpose of holding Principal Collections that would otherwise be paid to
the holder of the transferor interest at a time when (i) the Transferor Amount
is, or as a result of a payment would become, less than the Required
Transferor Amount or (ii) the Pool Balance is, or as a result of a payment
would become, less than the Required Pool Balance.


As described in the related prospectus supplement, receivables originated
under the designated charge accounts included in the issuing entity's
Portfolio consist of amounts charged by accountholders for merchandise and
services, annual membership fees and certain other administrative fees billed
to accountholders on the accounts. These receivables generally are not subject
to monthly finance charge assessments. See "Domestic Charge Card Business" in
this prospectus. As a result, in order to provide yield to the issuance trust
with respect to the related receivables, pursuant to the transfer and
servicing agreement, a portion of the receivables in the accounts included in
the issuing entity's Portfolio are treated as finance charge receivables and
collections received with respect to such receivables are treated as Finance
Charge Collections. The remainder of such receivables are treated as principal
receivables and collections received with respect to such receivables are
treated as Principal Collections. See "Sources of Funds to Pay the
Notes--Discount Option" and "Risk Factors--A change in the discount option
percentage may result in the payment of principal earlier or later than
expected" in this prospectus.



TRS, CENTURION, FSB, RFC V AND CREDCO




TRS



TRS is the sponsor of the issuance trust and, as such, organizes and
initiates the asset-backed securities transactions of the issuance trust. TRS
also is an account owner of certain consumer, small business and commercial
charge cards, the receivables of which are included in the issuance trust. See
"Domestic Charge Card Business" in this prospectus. In addition, TRS is the
servicer and administrator of the issuance trust. See "Sources of Funds to Pay
the Notes--Collection and Other Servicing Procedures" in this prospectus for a
description of certain matters relating to the servicer.


TRS has been involved in the securitization of consumer charge receivables
since 1992, when it formed and serviced the American Express Master Trust. The
American Express Master Trust issued an aggregate of approximately $7.4
billion principal amount of investor certificates, all of which were paid on
their respective expected final payment dates. TRS no longer uses the American
Express Master Trust to securitize consumer charge receivables, as charge
receivables are now securitized through the issuance trust. In addition, TRS
is the servicer of the American Express Credit Account Master Trust, which was
created in 1996 to


41





securitize credit card receivables and which has issued an aggregate of $[ ]
principal amount of investor certificates, of which $[ ] aggregate principal
amount is currently outstanding.


TRS is a New York corporation, with its headquarters at 200 Vesey Street,
New York, New York 10285-4405. Its phone number is (212) 640-2000. TRS was
incorporated under the laws of the State of New York on May 3, 1982. TRS,
directly or through its subsidiaries (TRS, together with its subsidiaries, is
referred to in this prospectus as "American Express TRS"), provides a variety
of products and services worldwide, including global card network services,
charge and credit cards for consumers, small businesses and corporations,
consumer and small business lending products, American Express Travelers
Cheques and prepaid card products, business expense management products and
services, business travel and travel management services, consumer travel
services, merchant acquiring and transaction processing, point-of-sale and
back-office products and services for merchants and magazine publishing.
American Express-branded cards are currently issued in more than 45 currencies
(including cards issued by third-party banks and other institutions). In 2004,
American Express TRS's worldwide billed business (spending on American
Express-branded cards, including cards issued by third parties) was $416
billion, with approximately $305 billion coming from card holders domiciled in

AMERICAN EXPRESS RECEIVABLES FINANCING CORP V LLC - S-3/A - 20060330 - BUSINESS





DOMESTIC CHARGE CARD BUSINESS




OVERVIEW



The receivables conveyed to the issuance trust pursuant to the transfer and
servicing agreement have been generated from transactions made by holders of
certain consumer and small business charge cards owned by TRS, Centurion, FSB
or any of their respective affiliates (together, "American Express TRS"). In
the future, receivables generated from transactions made by holders of certain
commercial charge cards owned by American Express TRS may be conveyed to the
issuance trust. See "Description of the Receivables Purchase Agreements and
the Sale Agreements" for a description of how receivables are transferred by
the account owners.


TRS, Centurion and FSB do not outsource originating functions to outside
third parties. Through service level agreements, Centurion and FSB have
contracted with TRS or one of its subsidiaries for the provision of account
origination, credit risk and underwriting and servicing functions, which are
provided subject to oversight by their respective boards of directors. Credit
risk is managed within board-approved policies covering all facets of credit
extension, including approvals, authorizations, line management and fraud
preventions.



CONSUMER AND SMALL BUSINESS CHARGE BUSINESS




GENERAL




CONSUMER CHARGE BUSINESS



Consumer charge card receivables are generated from transactions made by
accountholders. TRS, Centurion and FSB, as account owners of the consumer
charge accounts, offer various unsecured consumer charge card products,
including but not limited to the American Express Card, the American Express
Gold Card, the American Express Rewards Card, the American Express Rewards
Gold Card, the American Express Preferred Rewards


45





Card, the American Express Preferred Rewards Gold Card, the American Express
Rewards Plus Gold Card, the Platinum Card and the Centurion Card. The consumer
charge products are collectively referred to in this "Domestic Charge Card
Business" section as consumer cards. Each consumer card is associated with an
account owned by TRS, Centurion or FSB and is issued pursuant to an account
agreement between the applicable account owner and the individual
accountholder.


Consumer cards are accepted at service establishments worldwide and may be
used for the purchase of merchandise and services. The cards are designed for
use as a method of payment, not as a means of financing the purchase of
merchandise and services. As such, the full receivables balance of each
account generally is due upon receipt of a monthly billing statement. The
accounts generally are not subject to finance charge assessments, although
they may be subject to delinquency fees. The accounts generally do not have
pre-set spending limits. See "--Consumer and Small Business Charge
Business--Billing and Fees--Consumer Charge Business" and "--Distinctions
between Charge Accounts and Revolving Credit Plan Products" below. Accounts
may be combined, or be part of, multifeatured accounts that offer the
accountholders other credit products, including revolving credit products, the
receivables of which will not be Eligible Receivables and will not be conveyed
to the issuance trust.



SMALL BUSINESS CHARGE BUSINESS



OPEN From American Express (OPEN), referred to in this "Domestic Charge Card
Business" section as small business, charge card receivables are generated
from transactions made by accountholders. Most small business accountholders
are employed by companies meeting the definition of a small business by the
Small Business Administration (SBA) with fewer than 100 employees and less
than $10 million in annual revenue. TRS and FSB, as account owners for small
business charge accounts, offer various small business charge card products,
including but not limited to the Business Rewards Green Card, the Business
Costco Card, the Business Gold Card, the Executive Business Card, the Business
Platinum Card, and the Business Centurion Card. The small business charge card
products are collectively referred to in this "Domestic Charge Card Business"
section as small business cards. Each small business card is associated with
an account owned by TRS or FSB or, in the future, any of their affiliates, and
is issued pursuant to an account agreement between (i) the applicable account
owner and (ii) the company and the primary cardmember on the account.


Small business cards are accepted at service establishments worldwide and
are designed to be used solely for the purchase of merchandise and services
related to the operation of small businesses. The cards are designed for use
as a method of payment for a wide range of business expenses, not as a means
of financing the purchase of business merchandise and services. As such, the
full receivables balance of each account generally is due upon receipt of a
monthly billing statement. The accounts generally are not subject to finance
charge assessments, although they may be subject to delinquency fees. The
accounts generally do not have pre-set spending limits. See "--Consumer and
Small Business Charge Business--Billing and Fees--Small Business Charge
Business" and "--Distinctions between Charge Accounts and Revolving Credit
Plan Products" below. Accounts may be combined, or be part of, multifeatured
accounts that offer the accountholders other credit products, including
revolving credit products, the receivables of which will not be Eligible
Receivables and will not be conveyed to the issuance trust.

UNDERWRITING AND AUTHORIZATION PROCEDURES




CONSUMER CHARGE BUSINESS



Accounts are originated primarily through pre-approved, direct mail
solicitations and through an application process that consists of making
applications available to the public through a variety of channels, including
service establishments, financial institutions, publications and over the
Internet and telephone. The pre-approved process involves determining in
advance that a person may qualify for an account. The applicable account owner
selects certain persons on the basis of such person's activities (e.g.,
holding credit cards, magazine or newspaper subscriptions, club memberships,
college enrollment). Typically, these names are submitted to credit bureaus,
and the applicable account owner provides the bureaus with screening criteria.
These criteria have been developed from proprietary risk and profitability
models and commercially available risk evaluation scores. Persons who meet
these criteria are solicited to become accountholders. Additional screening is
conducted on applicants who reply to pre-approved offers.


The application process is used for evaluation of unsolicited applications
and certain other categories of applicants. The primary sources of unsolicited
applications are the "inbound" telemarketing program featuring the 1-800-THE-
CARD telephone number and Internet channels. The application process entails
receiving a completed application, evaluating the application using
proprietary scoring models and credit bureau information, screening out prior
incidents of fraud with TRS, Centurion or FSB or any of their affiliates, and
verifying that the information on the application is both accurate and
provided by the true applicant. When applicant information supplemented by
credit bureau data is insufficient for the applicable account owner to make a
credit decision, that account owner requests further information from the
applicant. The additional information used in the credit decision may include
bank information and/or verification of employment.


In addition to the credit review performed in connection with origination of
accounts, utilization of the accounts is subject to authorization at the time
of such utilization based upon the accountholder's past spending and payment
activity, credit history and personal resources. Certain utilizations, such as
purchases indicating out-of-pattern spending, initial utilizations on new
accounts, charges to delinquent accounts and accounts that the applicable
account owner determines to have a higher credit risk, are subject to closer
credit scrutiny.


Exceptions to the underwriting criteria that have been developed pursuant to
policies adopted by the applicable account owner must be pre-approved by the
applicable account owner.



SMALL BUSINESS CHARGE BUSINESS



Accounts are originated through a variety of acquisition channels.
Acquisition channels include, but are not limited to, the following: direct
mail, telemarketing, Internet and American Express "Take-One" boxes located in
a variety of public establishments. Direct mail includes pre-approved and non-
pre-approved offers made through a mail solicitation. "Outbound" telemarketing
includes pre-approved and non-pre-approved offers made through telephone
solicitations. Internet, "inbound" telemarketing, and "Take-One" are
considered unsolicited and all unsolicited applicants are treated as non-pre-
approved.


47





In the pre-approved process, the account owner selects certain persons on
the basis of such persons' activities (e.g., likelihood of owning a small
business, holding credit cards, magazine or newspaper subscriptions, club
memberships). Typically, these names are submitted to credit bureaus, and the
related account owner provides the bureaus with screening criteria. These
criteria have been developed from proprietary risk and profitability models
and commercially available risk evaluation scores. Persons who meet these
criteria are solicited to become accountholders. The account owner may also
screen existing customers for pre-approved charge card offers. For existing
customers, similar criteria were developed from proprietary risk and
profitability models and commercially available risk evaluation scores using
historical internal behavior and consumer and commercial credit bureau data.
Additional screening is conducted on applicants who reply to pre-approved
offers.


For the non-pre-approved process, the account owner receives a completed
application, evaluates the application using proprietary scoring models and
consumer and commercial credit bureau information, screening out prior
incidents of fraud with TRS, Centurion, FSB or any of their affiliates, and
verifying that the information on the application is accurate, provided by the
true applicant and that the person submitting the application on behalf of the
company is authorized to do so.


When applicant information supplemented by consumer and commercial credit
bureau data is insufficient for the applicable account owner to make a credit
decision, that account owner requests additional information from the
applicant. The additional information used in the credit decision may include
business entity financial statements, tax returns, bank information, and/or
other public information. The applicable account owner will then make a credit
decision based on both the primary accountholder's personal credit information
and the company's credit information.


In addition to the credit review performed in connection with origination of
accounts, utilization of the accounts is subject to authorization at the time
of such utilization based upon the accountholder's past spending and payment
activity, credit history and personal resources. Certain utilizations, such as
purchases indicating out-of-pattern spending, initial utilizations on new
accounts, charges to delinquent accounts and accounts that the applicable
account owner determines to have a higher credit risk, are subject to closer
credit scrutiny.


Exceptions to the underwriting criteria that have been developed pursuant to
policies adopted by the applicable account owner must be pre-approved by the
applicable account owner.



LIABILITY STRUCTURE




SMALL BUSINESS CHARGE BUSINESS



Liability for charges made on accounts is joint and several between the
primary cardmember on the account and the company, which means that the
applicable account owner may pursue payment for all charges from both the
primary cardmember on the account and the company. If an accountholder has
added additional cardmembers, the applicable account owner also may pursue
payment from those additional cardmembers for all personal charges made on the
account. Applications for small business cards are made on behalf of both the
company and a business owner or officer authorized to apply for credit on
behalf of the company. When making a credit decision, the applicable account
owner may consider the


48





credit information of the business owner and authorizing officer as well as
the company. See "--Underwriting and Authorization Procedures--Small Business
Charge Business" above and "--Collection Efforts--Small Business Charge
Business" below.



BILLING AND FEES




CONSUMER CHARGE BUSINESS



Each accountholder is subject to an agreement with the applicable account
owner governing the terms and conditions of the account. Each account owner
reserves the right to add, change or terminate any terms or conditions of the
account (including increasing or decreasing fees). The ability of an account
owner to make such changes is subject to the requirements of applicable laws
and to certain limitations in the securitization agreements and the
receivables purchase agreements. Pursuant to account agreements,
accountholders are charged an annual membership fee generally ranging from $55

- $150 depending on the type of consumer card, although the annual membership
fee for the Platinum Card is $395 and for the Centurion Card is $2,500.
Accountholders enrolled in the Senior Membership program are charged an annual
membership fee generally ranging from $35 - $55. Except as described under
"--Collection Efforts--Consumer Charge Business" below, no monthly finance
charges are assessed on the accounts and the full receivables balance is due
upon receipt of each month's billing statement. The accounts are grouped into
billing cycles for purposes of administrative efficiency. In accordance with
TRS's usual servicing procedures, the payment status of an account is
determined by reference to the cycle billing date for such account.


Other fees associated with the accounts include:


o a fee for each additional consumer card generally ranging from $30 - $35
depending on the type of consumer card ($20 - $25 if the accountholder is
enrolled in the Senior Membership program), although there is a fee of
$175 for the first additional Platinum Card and $600 for the first
additional Centurion Card;


o returned payment fees; and


o delinquency fees, which generally are the greater of $29 or 2.99% of the
past due balance (for accounts owned by TRS) and the greater of $30 or
2.9% of the past due balance (for accounts owned by Centurion [and FSB]).


These fees, along with annual membership fees, are included in the issuing
entity's assets.



SMALL BUSINESS CHARGE BUSINESS



The primary cardmember on the account and the company together are subject
to an agreement with the applicable account owner governing the terms and
conditions of the account. Each account owner reserves the right to add,
change or terminate any terms or conditions of the account (including
increasing or decreasing fees). The ability of an account owner to make such
changes is subject to the requirements of applicable laws and to certain
limitations in the securitization agreements and the receivables purchase
agreements. Pursuant to account agreements, accountholders are charged an
annual membership fee generally ranging from $95 - $150 depending on the type
of small business card, although the annual membership fee for the Business
Platinum Card is $300 and for the Business Centurion Card is $2,500.


49





Except as described under "--Collection Efforts--Small Business Charge
Business" below, no monthly finance charges are assessed on the accounts and
the full receivables balance is due upon receipt of each month's billing
statement. The accounts are grouped into billing cycles for purposes of
administrative efficiency. In accordance with TRS's usual servicing
procedures, the payment status of an account is determined by reference to the
cycle billing date for such account.


Other fees associated with the accounts include:


o a fee for each additional small business card generally ranging from $35

- $40 depending on the type of small business card, although there is a
fee of $150 for each additional Executive Business Card and Business
Platinum Card and $1,500 for each additional Business Centurion Card;


o returned payment fees; and


o delinquency fees, which generally are $29 if the balance is not paid
within 45 days of the closing date of the statement in which the balance
was billed, and the greater of $30 and 2.99% of the past due balance on
each subsequent closing date that the amount remains delinquent (for
Platinum Cards, the delinquency fee generally is the greater of $30 and
2.99% of the balance that is not paid on two or more consecutive billing
periods).


These fees, along with annual membership fees, are included in the issuing
entity's assets.



COLLECTION EFFORTS




CONSUMER CHARGE BUSINESS



Each account owner will consider an account delinquent after a charge first
appears as part of an unpaid previous balance on any monthly billing
statement. Efforts to collect delinquent account balances are made by or on
behalf of TRS, as servicer of each account owner, and, under appropriate
circumstances, by collection agencies and attorneys retained by such
collection agencies. Under current practice, the applicable account owner
includes a request for payment of any overdue amounts on all billing
statements following delinquency. The applicable account owner uses
proprietary risk and profitability evaluation systems to determine the
appropriate collection strategy. Accountholders considered to be high risk may
be contacted by either a letter or a telephone call when an account becomes
delinquent, or prior to delinquency based on a number of factors, including
the accountholder's tenure and the amount owed in relation to prior spending
and payment behavior. If it is determined that the accountholder may be unable
to pay the outstanding balance, charge privileges are suspended, the account
is cancelled and a more intensive collection action is initiated. For other
accountholders with delinquent balances, charge privileges are generally
suspended 1 to 90 days from the date of the billing statement on which a
delinquent charge first appeared. For cancelled accounts and those reaching
the 1 to 90 days delinquency status, demand letters generally will be sent. If
an account remains delinquent, it may be referred to a collection agency to
continue with the telephone calls and letters. Legal action may be instituted
against the accountholder by attorneys retained by outside collection
agencies. Arrangements may be made with accountholders to extend or otherwise
change payment schedules to maximize collections. In some cases, an account
owner and a delinquent accountholder may agree to an


50





arrangement, called a recovery arrangement, that will simultaneously suspend
the charge privileges associated with that accountholder's account and
obligate that accountholder to repay delinquent balances in his or her account
in installments according to an agreed-upon installment plan.


Pursuant to the transfer and servicing agreement, receivables will be
charged off on the Date of Processing on which such receivable is recorded as
charged-off on the servicer's computer file of accounts. The receivables in an
account owned by TRS generally will be charged off no later than the date on
which such account becomes twelve contractual payments past due (i.e.,
approximately 330 days delinquent). The receivables in an account owned by
Centurion and FSB generally will be charged off no later than the date on
which such account becomes six contractual payments past due (i.e.,
approximately 180 days delinquent). Bankrupt accountholders' accounts
generally will be charged off upon verification by the applicable account
owner or TRS, as servicer of each account owner, of the bankruptcy petition.
In any case, charge-offs may be made earlier in some circumstances. The credit
evaluation, servicing, charge-off and collection practices of any account
owner and the servicer, as applicable, may change over time in accordance with
its business judgment and applicable law.



SMALL BUSINESS CHARGE BUSINESS



Each account owner will consider an account delinquent after a charge first

circumstances, by collection agencies and attorneys retained by such
collection agencies. Under current practice, the applicable account owner
includes a request for payment of any overdue amounts on all billing
statements following delinquency. The applicable account owner uses
proprietary risk and profitability evaluation systems to determine the
appropriate collection strategy, which may include collection efforts against
the primary cardmember on the account, the company or both. Accountholders
considered to be high risk may be contacted by either a letter or a telephone
call when an account becomes delinquent, or prior to delinquency based on a
number of factors, including the accountholder's tenure and the amount owed in
relation to prior spending and payment behavior. If collection efforts against
the company are deemed appropriate, the account owner may contact the board of
directors, officers, partners or agents of the company to inform them of the
status of the account. If it is determined that the accountholder may be
unable to pay the outstanding balance, charge privileges are suspended, the
account is cancelled and a more intensive collection action is initiated. For
other accountholders with delinquent balances, charge privileges are generally
suspended 1 to 60 days from the date of the billing statement on which a
delinquent charge first appeared. For cancelled accounts and those reaching
the 1 to 60 days delinquency status, demand letters generally will be sent. If
an account remains delinquent, it may be referred to a collection agency to
continue with the telephone calls and letters. Legal action may be instituted
against the primary cardmember on the account, the company or both by
attorneys retained by the outside collection agencies. Arrangements may be
made with accountholders to extend or otherwise change payment schedules to
maximize collections. In some cases, the applicable account owner and a
delinquent accountholder may agree to an arrangement, called a recovery
arrangement, that will simultaneously suspend the charge privileges associated
with that accountholder's account and obligate that accountholder


51





to repay delinquent balances in his or her account in installments according
to an agreed-upon installment plan.


Pursuant to the transfer and servicing agreement, receivables will be
charged-off on the Date of Processing on which such receivable is recorded as
charged-off on the servicer's computer file of accounts. The receivables in an
account owned by TRS generally will be charged off no later than the date on
which such account becomes twelve contractual payments past due (i.e.,
approximately 330 days delinquent). The receivables in an account owned by FSB
generally will be charged off no later than the date on which such account
becomes six contractual payments past due (i.e., approximately 180 days
delinquent). Bankrupt accountholders' accounts will be charged off upon
verification by FSB or TRS, as applicable, of the bankruptcy petition of the
primary cardmember on the account or the company. In any case, charge-offs may
be made earlier in some circumstances. The credit evaluation, servicing,
charge-off and collection practices of any account owner and the servicer, as
applicable, may change over time in accordance with its business judgment and
applicable law.



COMMERCIAL CHARGE BUSINESS




GENERAL



Commercial charge card receivables are generated from transactions made by
accountholders. Most commercial card accountholders are employed by companies
that, in general, have annual revenue over $10 million. TRS, as the account
owner for commercial charge card accounts, offers two primary unsecured
commercial charge card products: the American Express Corporate Card and the
American Express Corporate Purchasing Card. The commercial charge card
products are collectively referred to in this "--Commercial Charge Business"
section as commercial cards. Commercial cards generally are issued to
individuals pursuant to a corporate account agreement between TRS and the
company that employs such individuals. Generally, an agreement with a company
permits either TRS or the company to terminate the relationship at any time by
giving 30 to 60 days prior written notice to the other party. In addition, TRS
may suspend the charge privileges of or cancel any individual cardmember's
account at any time with or without cause and without prior notice.


Commercial cards are accepted at service establishments worldwide and are
designed to be used solely for the purchase of merchandise and services
related to business expenses. The cards are designed for use as a method of
payment for a wide range of business expenses. As such, the full receivables
balance of each account generally is due upon receipt of a monthly billing
statement. The accounts generally are not subject to finance charge
assessments, although they may be subject to delinquency fees. The accounts
generally do not have pre-set spending limits, although companies can choose
to set spending limits on their commercial cards. See "--Commercial Charge
Business--Commercial Card Liability Structure and Billing Arrangements" below.



COMMERCIAL CARD LIABILITY STRUCTURE AND BILLING ARRANGEMENTS



Commercial card accounts provide two primary liability options, though a
particular company may use both liability options to meet various needs. Under
the combined liability program, the individual cardmember and the company are
both responsible for business charges, with the company either obligated to
reimburse the cardmember for business charges


52





or responsible for directly paying them to TRS. Cardmembers who (i) incur
personal charges, (ii) never file for reimbursement or (iii) do not repay
reimbursed business charges are generally solely liable for payment. In
contrast, under the central bill liability program, the company is solely
responsible for charges.


TRS offers various billing programs for the commercial cards. Under the
individual billing program, each cardmember receives a monthly billing
statement detailing his or her charges during the previous period. The company
can choose from 10 billing cycles to coordinate billing dates with its payroll
periods or reimbursement schedules. Payment options within the individual
billing program include (i) individual payment, whereby each cardmember
receives reimbursement from his or her employer for all legitimate business
charges and that cardmember then remits payments for all charges directly to
TRS, and (ii) company payment, whereby each cardmember submits an expense
report to his or her employer and the company issues a single check to TRS for
all legitimate business charges while the cardmember directly pays TRS for all
business charges not reimbursed by his or her employer and for all personal
charges. Under the central billing program, monthly billing statements are
sent to a central address at the company and the company is solely responsible
for all charges.



UNDERWRITING AND AUTHORIZATION PROCEDURES



Commercial charge accounts are underwritten at both the company and the
individual cardmember level. At the company level, TRS evaluates the company
using proprietary scoring models, audited financial statements and other
public information, third party checks, bank references, verification of
application information and commercial credit bureau information to determine
which commercial cards will be made available to the company and the
appropriate liability structure. Once a company has been approved for a
commercial card relationship, individual employees are required to submit
applications for commercial cards and undergo a risk assessment based on their
application information and personal credit history. In some cases, an
individual employee may not be approved for a commercial card on the basis of
his or her personal credit history. In other cases, an individual employee may
be approved for a commercial card only if his or her employer guarantees the
payment of charges incurred on that account or if a spending limit is applied
to that account.


In addition to the credit review performed in connection with origination of
accounts, utilization of the accounts is subject to authorization at the time
of such utilization based upon the accountholder's past spending and payment
activity and credit history. Certain utilizations, such as purchases
indicating out-of-pattern spending, initial utilizations on new accounts,
charges to delinquent accounts, and accounts that TRS determines to have a
higher credit risk, are subject to closer credit scrutiny.


Exceptions to the underwriting criteria that have been developed pursuant to
policies adopted by the applicable account owner must be pre-approved by the
applicable account owner.



FEES



Each accountholder is subject to an individual accountholder agreement with
TRS governing the terms and conditions of the account. TRS reserves the right
to add, change or terminate any terms or conditions of the account (including
increasing or decreasing fees). The ability of TRS to make such changes is
subject to the requirements of applicable laws and to


53





certain limitations in the securitization agreements and the receivables
purchase agreements. Pursuant to account agreements, accountholders are
charged an annual membership fee of $0 - $55 per commercial card, depending on
the company's annual charge volume with TRS and other factors.


Other fees associated with the accounts include:


o returned payment fees; and


o delinquency fees, which generally are $35 if the delinquent amount
remains unpaid for two or more billing periods, and the greater of $29 or
2.99% of all amounts unpaid for at least one billing period
(approximately 30 days).


These fees, along with annual membership fees, are included in the issuing
entity's assets.



COLLECTION EFFORTS



TRS will consider an account delinquent after a charge first appears as part
of an unpaid previous balance on any monthly billing statement. Efforts to
collect delinquent account balances are made by or on behalf of TRS, as
servicer, and collection agencies and attorneys retained by such collection
agencies. Under current practice, TRS includes a request for payment of any
overdue amounts on all billing statements following delinquency. TRS uses
proprietary risk and profitability evaluation systems to determine the
appropriate collection strategy. Accountholders considered to be high risk may
be contacted by either a letter or a telephone call when an account becomes
delinquent, or prior to delinquency based on a number of factors, including
the cardmember's tenure, behavioral scoring and the amount owed in relation to
prior spending and payment behavior. If it is determined that the
accountholder may be unable to pay the outstanding balance, charge privileges
are suspended, the account is cancelled and a more intensive collection action
is initiated. For other cardmembers with delinquent balances, charge
privileges are generally suspended 1 to 90 days from the date of the billing
statement on which a delinquent charge first appeared. For cancelled accounts
and those reaching the 1 to 90 days delinquency status, attorney demand
letters may also be sent. If an account remains delinquent, it may be referred
to a collection agency to continue with the telephone calls and letters. Legal
action may be also be instituted. Arrangements may be made with cardmembers to
extend or otherwise change payment schedules to maximize collections. In some
cases, TRS and the accountholder may agree to an arrangement, called a
recovery arrangement, that will simultaneously suspend the charge privileges
associated with that cardmember's commercial card and obligate that cardmember
to repay delinquent balances in installments according to an agreed-upon
installment plan.


Pursuant to the transfer and servicing agreement, receivables will be
charged-off on the Date of Processing on which such receivable is recorded as
charged-off on the servicer's computer file of accounts. Receivables will be
charged off no later than the date on which the individual cardmember's
account becomes twelve contractual payments past due (i.e., approximately 330
days delinquent). Bankrupt cardmembers' accounts generally will be charged off
upon verification by TRS of the bankruptcy petition of the individual
cardmember or the bankruptcy of the company. In any case, charge-offs may be
made earlier in some circumstances. The credit evaluation, servicing, charge-
off and collection practices of TRS may change over time in accordance with
its business judgment and applicable law.


54






DISTINCTIONS BETWEEN CHARGE ACCOUNTS AND REVOLVING CREDIT PLAN PRODUCTS



There are important distinctions between charge accounts and revolving
credit plan products. Charge accounts generally have no pre-set spending limit
and are designed for use as a convenient method of payment for the purchase of
merchandise and services. Accounts generally cannot be used as a means of
financing such purchases. Accordingly, the full balance of a month's purchases
is billed to accountholders and generally is due upon receipt of the billing
statement. By contrast, revolving credit plans allow customers to make a
minimum monthly payment and to borrow the remaining outstanding balance from
the credit issuer up to a predetermined limit. As a result of these payment
requirement differences, the accounts have a high monthly payment rate and
balances which turn over rapidly relative to their charge volume when compared
to revolving credit plan products.


Another distinction between charge accounts and revolving credit plan
products is that account balances generally are not subject to monthly finance
charges. As described above, the full account balance is billed monthly and is
due upon receipt of the billing statement. Accountholders do not have the
option of using their accounts to extend payment and to pay a finance charge
on the remaining outstanding balance. Revolving credit plan products, by
contrast, do allow customers to pay a specified minimum portion of an
outstanding amount and to finance the balance at a finance charge rate
determined by the credit issuer. Because account balances generally are not
subject to monthly finance charge assessments, in order to provide yield to
the issuance trust with respect to the receivables, pursuant to the transfer
and servicing agreement, a portion of the receivables in the accounts included
in the issuing entity's Portfolio are treated as finance charge receivables
and collections received with respect to such receivables are treated as
Finance Charge Collections. The remainder of such receivables are treated as
principal receivables and collections received with respect to such
receivables are treated as Principal Collections. See "Sources of Funds to Pay
the Notes--Discount Option" in this prospectus.



THE NOTES



The following discussion and the discussions under "Sources of Funds to Pay
the Notes" and "The Indenture" in this prospectus and certain sections in the
related prospectus supplement summarize the material terms of the notes, the
indenture, the transfer and servicing agreement and the indenture supplements.
The indenture supplements may be supplemented by terms documents relating to
the issuance of individual tranches of notes of the related multiple tranche
series, the terms of which will be described in more detail in the related
prospectus supplement. In this prospectus, references to an indenture
supplement will include any applicable terms documents. These summaries do not
purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the
provisions of the notes, the indenture, the transfer and servicing agreement
and the indenture supplements.


The following summaries describe certain provisions common to each series of
notes.



GENERAL



The prospectus supplement for a particular issuance of notes will specify
the series, class and, for a multiple tranche series, the tranche of which
those notes are a part. Each series of notes will be issued pursuant to the
indenture and an indenture supplement. A copy of the


55





form of each of these documents is filed as an exhibit to the registration
statement of which this prospectus is a part. Neither the indenture nor the
indenture supplement limits the aggregate stated principal amount of notes
that may be issued. Each series of notes will represent a contractual debt
obligation of the issuing entity that will be in addition to the debt
obligations of the issuing entity represented by any other series of notes.
Each prospectus supplement will describe the provisions specific to the
related series, class or tranche of notes. Holders of the notes of any
outstanding series, class or tranche will not have the right to prior review
of, or consent to, any subsequent issuance of notes. See "Risk
Factors--Issuance of additional notes or master trust investor certificates
may affect your voting rights and the timing and amount of payments to you"
and "The Notes--Issuances of New Series, Classes and Tranches of Notes" in
this prospectus.


It is expected that most series of notes will consist of multiple classes of
notes. A class designation determines the relative seniority for receipt of
cash flows and exposure to reductions in the Nominal Liquidation Amount of the
related series of notes. For example, subordinated notes of a series provide
credit enhancement for senior notes of that series. See "--Subordination of
Interest and Principal" in this prospectus.


If so specified in the related prospectus supplement, some series of notes
may be multiple tranche series, meaning that multiple tranches of notes may be
issued within each class of notes. Tranches of notes within a class of notes
of a multiple tranche series may be issued on different dates and have
different stated principal amounts, interest rates, interest payment dates,
expected final payment dates, legal maturity dates and other varying
characteristics as described, if applicable, in the related prospectus
supplement. Whenever a class of notes is referred to in this prospectus or any
prospectus supplement, it also includes all tranches of that class, unless the
context otherwise requires.


The issuing entity may issue different tranches of notes of a multiple
tranche series at the same time or at different times, but no tranche of
senior notes of a series may be issued unless a sufficient amount of
subordinated notes of that series will be issued on that date or has
previously been issued and is outstanding and available as subordination for
such tranche of senior notes. See "--Required Subordinated Amount" in this
prospectus.


The issuing entity may offer notes denominated in U.S. dollars or any
foreign currency. The specific terms of any note denominated in a foreign
currency will be described in the related prospectus supplement.


Each series will be allocated its share of Finance Charge Collections, the
Default Amount and the servicing fee based on the Floating Allocation
Percentage of that series, and will be allocated its share of Principal
Collections based on the Principal Allocation Percentage of that series. The
related prospectus supplement will specify the Floating Allocation Percentage
and the Principal Allocation Percentage for each series. If a series offered
by this prospectus and a related prospectus supplement includes more than one
class or tranche, Finance Charge Collections, Principal Collections, the
Default Amount and the servicing fee allocated to that series may be further
allocated among each class or tranche in that series as described in the
related prospectus supplement.


If so specified in the related prospectus supplement, a series may be
included in one or more groups of series for purposes of reallocating Finance
Charge Collections among the


56





series in that Reallocation Group, sharing excess Finance Charge Collections
among the series in that Shared Excess Available Finance Charge Collections
Group or sharing excess Principal Collections among the series in that Shared
Excess Available Principal Collections Group. See "--Groups" in this
prospectus.


If so specified in the related prospectus supplement, the notes of a
particular series, class or tranche may have the benefit of a derivative
agreement, including an interest rate swap, currency swap, cap, collar or
guaranteed investment contract with various counterparties. The specific terms
of each derivative agreement and a description of each derivative counterparty
will be included in the related prospectus supplement. The notes of a
particular series, class or tranche may also have the benefit of a
supplemental credit enhancement agreement or a supplemental liquidity
agreement. The specific terms of each applicable supplemental credit
enhancement agreement or supplemental liquidity agreement and a description of
each enhancement provider or liquidity provider, as applicable, will be
included in the related prospectus supplement. TRS, Centurion, FSB or any of
their affiliates may be counterparties to a derivative agreement or providers
of a supplemental credit enhancement agreement or a supplemental liquidity
agreement.


The issuing entity will pay principal of and interest on a series, class or
tranche of notes solely from the portion of Finance Charge Collections and
Principal Collections which are allocable to that series, class or tranche
after giving effect to all allocations and reallocations, deposits and
withdrawals of amounts in any issuer trust accounts, including any
supplemental accounts, relating to that series, class or tranche, and amounts
received under any derivative agreement, under any supplemental credit
enhancement agreement or under any supplemental liquidity agreement relating
to that series, class or tranche. If those sources are not sufficient for
payment of principal of and interest on that series, class or tranche, the
noteholders will have no recourse to any other assets of the issuing entity or
recourse to any other person or entity for the payment of principal of and
interest on that series, class or tranche of notes.


A note is not a deposit and neither the notes nor any underlying receivables
or collateral certificate are insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation or any other governmental agency or instrumentality.



STATED PRINCIPAL AMOUNT, OUTSTANDING DOLLAR PRINCIPAL AMOUNT, ADJUSTED
OUTSTANDING DOLLAR PRINCIPAL AMOUNT AND NOMINAL LIQUIDATION AMOUNT



Each series, class or tranche of notes has a stated principal amount, an
outstanding dollar principal amount, an Adjusted Outstanding Dollar Principal
Amount and a Nominal Liquidation Amount.



STATED PRINCIPAL AMOUNT



The stated principal amount of a series, class or tranche of notes is the
amount that is stated on the face of the notes of that series, class or
tranche to be payable to the holders of the notes of that series, class or
tranche. It can be denominated in U.S. dollars or in a foreign currency.



OUTSTANDING DOLLAR PRINCIPAL AMOUNT



For a series, class or tranche of U.S. dollar notes, the outstanding dollar
principal amount is the initial dollar principal amount of that series,
class or tranche of notes, as described in the


57





related prospectus supplement, less principal payments made to the noteholders
of that series, class or tranche of notes. For a series, class or tranche of
foreign currency notes, the outstanding dollar principal amount is the U.S.
dollar equivalent of the initial principal amount of that series, class or
tranche of notes, as described in the related prospectus supplement, less
dollar payments made to derivative counterparties or, in the event the
derivative agreement is non-performing, less dollar payments converted to make
payments to noteholders, each with respect to principal for that series,
class or tranche. For a series, class or tranche of discount notes, the
outstanding dollar principal amount is an amount stated in, or determined by a
formula described in, the related prospectus supplement. The outstanding
dollar principal amount of a series, class or tranche of discount notes will
increase over time as principal accretes on that series, class or tranche of
notes. The outstanding dollar principal amount of any series, class or tranche
of notes will decrease as a result of each payment of principal of that
series, class or tranche of notes, and will increase as a result of any
issuance of additional notes of that series, class or tranche.



ADJUSTED OUTSTANDING DOLLAR PRINCIPAL AMOUNT



The Adjusted Outstanding Dollar Principal Amount of a series, class or
tranche of notes is the outstanding dollar principal amount of that series,
class or tranche, less any funds on deposit in the principal funding account
for that series, class or tranche. The Adjusted Outstanding Dollar Principal
Amount of any series, class or tranche of notes will decrease as a result of
each deposit into the principal funding account for such series, class or
tranche.



NOMINAL LIQUIDATION AMOUNT



The Nominal Liquidation Amount of a series, class or tranche of notes is a
U.S. dollar amount based on the initial dollar principal amount of that
series, class or tranche of notes minus some reductions--including reductions
for (i) charge-offs resulting from any uncovered Default Amount allocated to
that series, class or tranche, (ii) Reallocated Principal Collections used to
pay shortfalls in interest on senior notes and any other amounts specified in
the related prospectus supplement, (iii) amounts on deposit in the principal
funding account for that series, class or tranche and (iv) the amount of all
payments of principal of such series, class or tranche of notes--plus some
increases described below. For a multiple tranche series, the Nominal
Liquidation Amount of the series of notes is equal to the sum of the Nominal
Liquidation Amounts of all classes or tranches of notes of that series. Within
a series, subordinated notes bear the risk before senior notes of a reduction
in the Nominal Liquidation Amount of that series due to charge-offs resulting
from any uncovered Default Amount allocated to that series or due to
Reallocated Principal Collections used to pay shortfalls in interest on senior
notes and any other amounts specified in the related prospectus supplement.


The Nominal Liquidation Amount of a series, class or tranche of notes may be
reduced as follows:


o If Finance Charge Collections allocable to a series of notes are
insufficient to fund the Default Amount allocable to that series, the
uncovered Default Amount will result in a reduction in the Nominal
Liquidation Amount of that series.


For a multiple tranche series, while these reductions will be allocated
initially pro rata to each tranche of notes based on its Nominal
Liquidation Amount regardless of class, they will then be reallocated to
the subordinated notes of that series in succession based


58





on class designation. However, these reallocations will be made from
tranches of senior notes to tranches of subordinated notes only to the
extent that such tranches of senior notes have not used all of their
required subordinated amount. For any tranche, the required subordinated
amount will be specified in the related prospectus supplement. Reductions
that cannot be reallocated to a tranche of more subordinate notes will
reduce the Nominal Liquidation Amount of the tranche to which the
reductions were initially allocated.


o If Principal Collections allocable to subordinated notes of a series of
notes are reallocated to pay shortfalls in interest on senior notes and
any other amounts specified in the related prospectus supplement, the
Nominal Liquidation Amount of that series will be reduced by the amount
of the reallocations. The amount of Principal Collections which may be
reallocated may be limited for a given series, class or tranche of notes.
Such limitations will be specified in the related prospectus supplement.
In addition, for a multiple tranche series, Principal Collections
allocable to subordinated notes will be reallocated only to the extent
that senior notes have not used all of their required subordinated
amount.


For a multiple tranche series, these reductions will be allocated to each
tranche of a class pro rata based on its Nominal Liquidation Amount.


o The Nominal Liquidation Amount of a series, class or tranche of notes
will be reduced by the amount on deposit in the principal funding account
for that series, class or tranche.


o The Nominal Liquidation Amount of a series, class or tranche of notes
will be reduced by the amount of all payments of principal of that
series, class or tranche.


o Upon a sale of assets in the issuance trust following (i) an event of
default and acceleration of a series, class or tranche of notes or (ii)
the legal maturity date of a series, class or tranche of notes, the
Nominal Liquidation Amount of such series, class or tranche of notes will
be reduced to zero. See "Sources of Funds to Pay the Notes--Sale of
Assets" in this prospectus.


The Nominal Liquidation Amount of a series, class or tranche of notes can be
increased as follows:


o For a series, class or tranche of discount notes, the Nominal Liquidation
Amount of that series, class or tranche will increase over time as
principal accretes, to the extent that Finance Charge Collections
allocated to the related series of notes are allocated for that purpose.


o For all series of notes, the Nominal Liquidation Amount of that series
will increase if Finance Charge Collections allocable to that series are
available to reimburse earlier reductions in the Nominal Liquidation
Amount of that series due to charge-offs resulting from any uncovered
Default Amount allocated to that series or due to Reallocated Principal
Collections used to pay shortfalls in interest on senior notes and any
other amounts specified in the related prospectus supplement. Within each
series of notes, the increases will be allocated first to the senior-most
notes with a deficiency in


59





their Nominal Liquidation Amounts and then, in succession, to the
subordinated notes with a deficiency in their Nominal Liquidation
Amounts.


o For all series, classes or tranches of notes, the Nominal Liquidation
Amount of a series, class or tranche of notes will increase by an amount
equal to the principal amount of any additional notes of that series,
class or tranche issued after the initial issuance of that series,
class or tranche of notes, or if amounts on deposit in the principal
funding account for that series, class or tranche are deposited into the
principal funding account for another series, class or tranche of notes
or paid to the issuing entity.


For a multiple tranche series, any increase in the Nominal Liquidation
Amount will be allocated to each tranche of a class pro rata based on the
deficiency in the Nominal Liquidation Amount of that tranche.


Finance Charge Collections allocated to a series of notes for each Monthly
Period will be applied, as described in the related prospectus supplement, to
cover the Default Amount allocated to that series. If Finance Charge
Collections allocated to that series are sufficient to cover the Default
Amount allocated to that series, the Nominal Liquidation Amount of that series
of notes will not be reduced. Finance Charge Collections allocated to a series
of notes also will be applied, as described in the related prospectus
supplement, to reimburse earlier reductions in the Nominal Liquidation Amount
of that series of notes due to charge-offs resulting from any uncovered
Default Amount allocated to that series of notes or due to Reallocated
Principal Collections used to pay shortfalls in interest on senior notes and
any other amounts specified in the related prospectus supplement.


In most circumstances, the Nominal Liquidation Amount of a series, class or
tranche of notes, together with any accumulated Principal Collections held in
the related principal funding account, will be equal to the outstanding dollar
principal amount of that series, class or tranche of notes. However, if there
are reductions in the Nominal Liquidation Amount of a series, class or tranche
due to charge-offs resulting from any uncovered Default Amount allocated to
that series, class or tranche or due to Reallocated Principal Collections used
to pay shortfalls in interest on senior notes and any other amounts specified
in the related prospectus supplement, there will be a deficit in the Nominal
Liquidation Amount of that series, class or tranche. Unless that deficit is
reimbursed through the application of Finance Charge Collections allocated to
the applicable series, the stated principal amount of that series, class or
tranche of notes will not be paid in full. This will occur either because the
amount of dollars allocated to pay them is less than the outstanding dollar
principal amount of that series, class or tranche, or because the amount of
dollars allocated to pay the counterparty to a derivative agreement is less
than the amount necessary to obtain enough of the applicable foreign currency
for payment of the notes in full.


The Nominal Liquidation Amount of a series, class or tranche of notes may
not be reduced below zero, and may not be increased above the Adjusted
Outstanding Dollar Principal Amount of that series, class or tranche.


The cumulative amount of reductions in the Nominal Liquidation Amount of any
series, class or tranche of notes due to charge-offs resulting from any
uncovered Default Amount allocated to that series, class or tranche of notes
or due to Reallocated Principal Collections


60





used to pay shortfalls in interest on senior notes and any other amounts
specified in the related prospectus supplement will be limited as described in
the related prospectus supplement.


Allocations of charge-offs resulting from any uncovered Default Amount
allocated to a series, class or tranche or due to Reallocated Principal
Collections used to pay shortfalls in interest on senior notes and any other
amounts specified in the related prospectus supplement will reduce the Nominal
Liquidation Amount of outstanding series, classes and tranches of notes only
and will not affect series, classes or tranches of notes that are issued after
that time.


Upon a sale of assets in the issuance trust following (i) an event of
default and acceleration of a series, class or tranche of notes or (ii) the
legal maturity date of a series, class or tranche of notes, as described in
the related prospectus supplement and in "Sources of Funds to Pay the
Notes--Sale of Assets" in this prospectus, the Nominal Liquidation Amount of
that series, class or tranche of notes will be reduced to zero even if the
proceeds of that sale, amounts on deposit in the issuing entity accounts for
that series, class or tranche and any other amounts available to such
noteholders are not enough to pay all remaining amounts due on those notes.
After such sale, Principal Collections and Finance Charge Collections will no
longer be allocated to that series, class or tranche of notes.



INTEREST



Interest will accrue on a series, class or tranche of notes, except on a
series, class or tranche of discount notes, from the relevant issuance date at
the applicable interest rate for that series, class or tranche, which may be a
fixed, floating or other type of rate as specified in the related prospectus
supplement. Interest on a series, class or tranche of notes will be due and
payable on the dates specified in the related prospectus supplement, each
referred to in this prospectus and the related prospectus supplement as an
interest payment date or a payment date. If the interest payment dates for any
notes occur less frequently than monthly, interest will be deposited in an
interest funding account pending distribution. Each interest funding account
will be established under the indenture supplement for the related series. For
series with one or more classes and/or tranches of notes, each class or
tranche may have a separate interest funding account. Interest deposits or
payments will be funded from Finance Charge Collections allocated to that
series, class or tranche of notes during the preceding Monthly Period or
Monthly Periods, from any applicable credit enhancement, if necessary, and
from certain other amounts specified in the related prospectus supplement.


For each issuance of a series, class or tranche of fixed rate notes, the
fixed rate of interest at which interest will accrue for that series, class or
tranche will be specified in the related prospectus supplement. For each
issuance of a series, class or tranche of floating rate notes, the interest
rate index or other formula on which the interest payment is based will be
specified in the related prospectus supplement. In addition, the related
prospectus supplement will specify if any series, class or tranche of notes
receives any additional interest and how it is to be calculated.


A series, class or tranche of discount notes will be issued at a price lower
than the stated principal amount payable on the expected final payment date of
that series, class or tranche of notes. Until the expected final payment date
for a series, class or tranche of discount notes, accreted principal will be
capitalized as part of the principal of that series, class or tranche of notes
and reinvested in the assets of the issuance trust, so long as an early
amortization event


61





with respect to that series, class or tranche has not occurred. If applicable,
the related prospectus supplement will specify the interest rate to be borne
by a series, class or tranche of discount notes following an early
amortization event or event of default or after its expected final payment
date.


Each payment of interest on a series, class or tranche of notes will include
all interest accrued from the preceding interest payment date--or, for the
first interest period, from the issuance date--through the day preceding the
current interest payment date, or any other period as may be specified in the
related prospectus supplement.


If interest on a series, class or tranche of notes is not paid within 35
days after such interest is due and payable, an event of default will occur
with respect to that series, class or tranche of notes. See "The
Indenture--Events of Default" in this prospectus.



PRINCIPAL



The timing of payment of principal of a series, class or tranche of notes
will be specified in the related prospectus supplement. Each date on which
payment of principal is made is referred to in this prospectus and the related
prospectus supplement as a payment date.


Certain series, classes and tranches of notes are anticipated to have
principal paid on one date, referred to as the expected final payment date.
Principal of a series, class or tranche of notes may be paid later than its
expected final payment date if sufficient funds are not allocated and
available. Additionally, in the case of a tranche of subordinated notes of a
multiple tranche series, principal of that tranche will be paid on its
expected final payment date only to the extent that payment is permitted by
the subordination provisions of the senior notes of that series.


It is not an event of default if the stated principal amount of a series,
class or tranche of notes is not paid on its expected final payment date.
However, if the stated principal amount of a series, class or tranche of notes
is not paid in full on its expected final payment date, an early amortization
event with respect to that series, class or tranche will occur. See "The
Indenture--Early Amortization Events" in this prospectus.


If the stated principal amount of a series, class or tranche of notes is not
paid in full by its legal maturity date, an event of default will occur with
respect to that series, class or tranche of notes. See "The Indenture--Events
of Default" in this prospectus.


Principal of a series, class or tranche of notes may be paid earlier than
its expected final payment date if an early amortization event or an optional
or mandatory redemption occurs. See "The Indenture--Early Amortization Events"
and "--Events of Default" in this prospectus.


See "Risk Factors" in this prospectus for a discussion of factors that may
affect the timing of principal payments on a series, class or tranche of
notes.



SUBORDINATION OF INTEREST AND PRINCIPAL



Interest and principal payments on subordinated notes of a series will be
subordinated as described in the related prospectus supplement.


62





Finance Charge Collections allocated to a series of notes will be used to
pay interest due on senior notes of that series before being available to pay
interest due on subordinated notes of that series.


Within a series, subordinated notes bear the risk before senior notes of a
reduction in the Nominal Liquidation Amount of that series due to charge-offs
resulting from any uncovered Default Amount allocated to that series or due to
Reallocated Principal Collections used to pay shortfalls in interest on senior
notes and any other amounts specified in the related prospectus supplement.
For a multiple tranche series, charge-offs resulting from any uncovered
Default Amount allocated to that series will initially be allocated to each
tranche of that series pro rata based on the Nominal Liquidation Amount of
that tranche and then reallocated from the tranches of senior notes of that
series to the tranches of subordinated notes of that series, reducing the
Nominal Liquidation Amount of such tranches of subordinated notes to the
extent credit enhancement in the form of subordination is still available to
the tranches of senior notes. See "The Notes--Stated Principal Amount,
Outstanding Dollar Principal Amount, Adjusted Outstanding Dollar Principal
Amount and Nominal Liquidation Amount--Nominal Liquidation Amount" in this
prospectus.


In addition, Principal Collections allocated to a series of notes, after
giving effect to any reallocations, will first be used to fund targeted
deposits into the principal funding accounts of senior notes of that series
before being applied to the principal funding accounts of subordinated notes
of that series.



REQUIRED SUBORDINATED AMOUNT



The required subordinated amount for a class or tranche of senior notes is
the amount of subordinated notes that is required to be outstanding and
available to provide subordination for that class or tranche of senior notes
on the date when that class or tranche of senior notes is issued. This amount
or a calculation that determines this amount will be specified in the related
prospectus supplement. No class or tranche of notes of a series may be issued
unless the required subordinated amount for that class or tranche of notes is
available at the time of its issuance, as described in the related prospectus
supplement. For multiple tranche series, the required subordinated amount also
is used, in conjunction with the consumption of enhancement called usage, to
determine the remaining available subordinated amount for a tranche of senior
notes and whether a tranche of subordinated notes of a multiple tranche series
may be repaid before its legal maturity date while senior notes of that series
are outstanding.



GROUPS



A series of notes may be included in one or more groups of series that share
Principal Collections and/or Finance Charge Collections. The related
prospectus supplement will identify whether your series has been included in
one or more of the following groups.



REALLOCATION GROUP



If a series of notes is identified in the related prospectus supplement as
included in a Reallocation Group, Finance Charge Collections which would
otherwise be allocated to each series based on the Floating Allocation
Percentage of that series will instead be combined and will be available for
specified required payments for all series in the same Reallocation Group. Any
issuance of a new series in a Reallocation Group may reduce or increase the
amount of


63





Finance Charge Collections allocated to any other series of notes in that
group. See "Risk Factors--Issuance of additional notes or master trust
investor certificates may affect your voting rights and the timing and amount
of payments to you" in this prospectus. The related prospectus supplement will
specify whether your series will be included in a Reallocation Group and
whether any previously issued series have been included in that group.


While any series of notes may be included in a Reallocation Group, there can
be no assurance that any other series will be included in the same group.



SHARED EXCESS AVAILABLE FINANCE CHARGE COLLECTIONS GROUP



If a series of notes is identified in the related prospectus supplement as
included in a Shared Excess Available Finance Charge Collections Group,
Finance Charge Collections for any Monthly Period allocated to that series in
excess of the amount needed to make all required deposits and payments for
that series will be applied to cover shortfalls in amounts payable from
Finance Charge Collections allocated to other series of notes in that Shared
Excess Available Finance Charge Collections Group. If these shortfalls exceed
the total amount of excess Finance Charge Collections available from all
series in the same Shared Excess Available Finance Charge Collections Group,
referred to as Shared Excess Available Finance Charge Collections, for any
Monthly Period, Shared Excess Available Finance Charge Collections will be
allocated pro rata among the applicable series of notes in that Shared Excess
Available Finance Charge Collections Group based on the relative amounts of
those shortfalls.


To the extent Shared Excess Available Finance Charge Collections exceed
shortfalls, the balance will be paid to the holder of the transferor interest.


The sharing of Shared Excess Available Finance Charge Collections will be
discontinued if the issuing entity delivers to the indenture trustee a
certificate to the effect that the continued sharing of Shared Excess
Available Finance Charge Collections would have adverse regulatory
implications for any account owner or the transferor. Following the delivery
by the issuing entity of any such certificate to the indenture trustee, there
will be no further sharing of Shared Excess Available Finance Charge
Collections.


While any series of notes may be included in a Shared Excess Available
Finance Charge Collections Group, there can be no assurance that:


--any other series will be included in such group,


--there will be any Shared Excess Available Finance Charge Collections for
such group for any Monthly Period, or


--the issuing entity will not at any time deliver the certificate
discontinuing sharing described above.


While the issuing entity does not believe that, based on the applicable
rules and regulations as currently in effect, the sharing of Shared Excess
Available Finance Charge Collections will have an adverse regulatory
implication for any account owner or the transferor, there can be no assurance
that this will continue to be true in the future.


64






SHARED EXCESS AVAILABLE PRINCIPAL COLLECTIONS GROUP



If a series of notes is identified in the related prospectus supplement as
being in a Shared Excess Available Principal Collections Group, Principal
Collections for any Monthly Period allocated to that series in excess of the
amount needed to make all required deposits and payments for that series will
be applied to cover shortfalls in principal deposits or payments payable from
Principal Collections allocated to other series of notes in that Shared Excess
Available Principal Collections Group. If these shortfalls exceed the total
amount of excess Principal Collections available from all series in the same
Shared Excess Available Principal Collections Group, referred to as Shared
Excess Available Principal Collections, for any Monthly Period, Shared Excess
Available Principal Collections will be allocated pro rata among the
applicable series of notes in that Shared Excess Available Principal
Collections Group based on the relative amounts of those shortfalls.


To the extent that Shared Excess Available Principal Collections exceed
principal shortfalls, the balance will be paid to the holder of the transferor
interest, provided that:


o such Shared Excess Available Principal Collections will be distributed to
the holder of the transferor interest only to the extent that the
Available Overconcentration Account Amount is equal to or greater than
the Required Overconcentration Account Amount, the Transferor Amount is
equal to or greater than the Required Transferor Amount and the Pool
Balance is equal to or greater than the Required Pool Balance; and


o in certain circumstances described under "Sources of Funds to Pay the
Notes--Allocations of Amounts to the Overconcentration Account and
Allocations of Amounts on Deposit in the Overconcentration Account" and
"--Allocations of Amounts to the Excess Funding Account and Allocations
of Amounts on Deposit in the Excess Funding Account," such Shared Excess
Available Principal Collections will be deposited into the
overconcentration account or the excess funding account.


While any series of notes may be included in the same Shared Excess
Available Principal Collections Group, there can be no assurance that any
other series will be included in such group or that there will be any Shared
Excess Available Principal Collections for such group for any Monthly Period.


If Principal Collections allocated to a series are shared with another
series, the Nominal Liquidation Amount for the series from which Principal
Collections were shared will not be reduced.



REDEMPTION AND EARLY AMORTIZATION OF NOTES




OPTIONAL REDEMPTION



The issuing entity or the transferor, if the transferor is an affiliate of
the servicer, may, at its option, redeem any series, class or tranche of notes
before its expected final payment date in whole but not in part at any time
when the outstanding dollar principal amount of that series, class or tranche
is less than 10% - or any other percentage that is specified by the transferor

- of the highest outstanding dollar principal amount at any time of that
series, class or tranche. This redemption option is referred to as a clean-up
call. The issuing entity will not redeem subordinated notes if those notes are
required to provide credit enhancement for classes of senior notes.


65





If the issuing entity redeems notes, it will notify the registered holders
of those notes at least 30 days prior to the redemption date. The redemption
price of a note will equal 100% of the outstanding dollar principal amount,
plus accrued, past due and additional interest on those notes to but excluding
the date of redemption.


If the issuing entity is unable to pay the redemption price in full on the
redemption date, monthly payments on those notes will thereafter be made until
the earlier to occur until either the principal of and accrued interest on
those notes are paid in full or the legal maturity date occurs, whichever is
earlier. Any funds in the collection account allocable to those notes, the
related principal funding account and, if applicable, any related Class C
reserve account will be applied to make the principal and interest payments on
those notes on the redemption date.



MANDATORY REDEMPTION



Each series, class or tranche of notes will be subject to mandatory
redemption on its expected final payment date, which generally will be 11
months before its legal maturity date but which may be a different date
specified in the related prospectus supplement.


In addition, if an early amortization event occurs with respect to any
series, class or tranche of notes, the issuing entity will be required to
repay each series, class or tranche of the affected notes before the expected
final payment date of that series, class or tranche; however, if so indicated
in the related prospectus supplement for certain such affected series, class or
tranche of notes with the benefit of a derivative agreement or other type of
arrangement, subject to certain exceptions, such repayment will not occur
earlier than the expected final payment date of such series, class or tranche
of notes. Following an early amortization event, repayment of principal prior
to the expected final payment date will be made only to the extent funds are
available for repayment after giving effect to all allocations and
reallocations and, in the case of subordinated notes of a multiple tranche
series, only to the extent that payment is permitted by the subordination
provisions of the senior notes of that series. The issuing entity will give
notice to holders of the affected series, class or tranche of notes of the
occurrence of an early amortization event. See "The Indenture--Early
Amortization Events" in this prospectus for a description of the early
amortization events and their consequences to noteholders.


Whenever the issuing entity redeems or repays a series, class or tranche of
notes, it will do so only to the extent that Finance Charge Collections and
Principal Collections - including any amounts received under any derivative
agreement, any amounts received under any supplemental credit enhancement
agreement, any amounts received under any supplemental liquidity agreement and
any amounts in the issuing entity accounts not included in Finance Charge
Collections and Principal Collections - allocated to that series, class or
tranche of notes are sufficient to redeem or repay that series, class or
tranche of notes in full. In addition, the redemption and repayment will occur
only to the extent that the notes to be redeemed or repaid are not required to
provide required subordination for senior notes. A noteholder will have no
claim against the issuing entity if the issuing entity fails to make a
required redemption or repayment of a series, class or tranche of notes before
the legal maturity date because no funds are available for that purpose or
because the notes that would otherwise be redeemed or repaid are required to
provide subordination for senior notes. The failure to


66





redeem or repay before the legal maturity date under these circumstances will
not be an event of default.



FINAL PAYMENT OF THE NOTES



Noteholders of a series, class or tranche generally will not receive payment
of principal in excess of the stated principal amount of that series, class or
tranche, or in the case of a series, class or tranche of foreign currency
notes, any amount received by the issuing entity under a derivative agreement
with respect to principal of that series, class or tranche.


Following (i) an event of default and acceleration or (ii) the legal
maturity date of a series, class or tranche of notes, assets in the issuance
trust will be sold generally in an aggregate amount not to exceed (i) the
Nominal Liquidation Amount of that affected series, class or tranche plus (ii)
the product of the Nominal Liquidation Amount of that affected series, class or
tranche and the Discount Option Percentage, subject to any further limitations
specified in the related prospectus supplement and, for a multiple tranche
series, only to the extent that payment is permitted by the subordination
provisions of the senior notes of the same series. The proceeds of that sale
and any other amounts available to such noteholders will be applied, first, to
pay the outstanding dollar principal amount of that affected series, class or
tranche and, second, to pay any accrued, past due and additional interest, if
any, on that affected series, class or tranche of notes upon the sale.


Following an event of default and acceleration with respect to any tranche
of notes of a multiple tranche series which occurs prior to the legal maturity
date of such tranche, any sale of assets in the issuance trust with respect to
such tranche may be delayed until (i) the senior notes of the same series are
prefunded sufficiently, (ii) enough senior notes are repaid, or (iii) new
subordinated notes have been issued, in each case to the extent that the
tranche of subordinated notes is no longer needed to provide the required
subordination for the senior notes of that series. In a multiple tranche
series, if a tranche of notes directs a sale of assets in the issuance trust,
then after the sale, that tranche will no longer be entitled to subordination
from subordinated notes of the same series.


A series, class or tranche of notes will be considered to be paid in full,
the holders of that series, class or tranche of notes will have no further
right or claim, and the issuing entity will have no further obligation or
liability for principal or interest on those notes, on the earliest to occur
of:


o the date of the payment in full of the stated principal amount of, and
any accrued, past due and additional interest on, that series, class or
tranche of notes, as applicable;


o the date on which a sale of assets in the issuance trust has taken place
with respect to that series, class or tranche of notes, as described in
"Sources of Funds to Pay the Notes--Sale of Assets" in this prospectus;
and


o the seventh Business Day following the legal maturity date of such
series, class or tranche of notes,


in each case after giving effect to all deposits, allocations, reimbursements,
reallocations, sales of assets and payments to be made on such date.


67






ISSUANCES OF NEW SERIES, CLASSES AND TRANCHES OF NOTES



The issuing entity may issue a new series, class or tranche of notes or
issue additional notes of an existing series, class or tranche only if the
conditions of issuance are met (or waived as described below). These
conditions include:


o on or prior to the fifth Business Day before the new issuance is to
occur, the issuing entity gives the indenture trustee and each rating
agency that has rated any outstanding series, class or tranche of notes
notice of the new issuance;


o on or prior to the date that the new issuance is to occur, the issuing
entity delivers to the indenture trustee and each rating agency that has
rated any outstanding series, class or tranche of notes a certificate to
the effect that:


--   the issuing entity reasonably believes that the new issuance will
not at the time of its occurance or at a future date (i) cause an
early amortization event or event of default with respect to any
series, class or tranche of notes then outstanding, (ii) have a
material adverse effect on the amount of funds available to be
distributed to noteholders of any series, class or tranche of notes
or the timing of such distributions or (iii) adversely affect the
security interest of the indenture trustee in the collateral
securing the outstanding notes;


--   all instruments furnished to the indenture trustee conform to the
requirements of the indenture and constitute sufficient authority
under the indenture for the indenture trustee to authenticate and
deliver the new notes;


--   the form and terms of the new notes have been established in
conformity with the provisions of the indenture; and


--   the issuing entity shall have satisfied such other matters as the
indenture trustee may reasonably request;


o on or prior to the date that the new issuance is to occur, the issuing
entity delivers to the indenture trustee and each rating agency that has
rated any outstanding series, class or tranche of notes an officer's
certificate of an authorized officer of the issuing entity to the effect
that all laws and requirements with respect to the execution and delivery
by the issuing entity of the new notes have been complied with, the
issuing entity has the trust power and authority to issue the new notes,
and the new notes have been duly authorized and delivered by the issuing
entity, and, assuming due authentication and delivery by the indenture
trustee, constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of the issuing
entity enforceable in accordance with their terms, subject to certain
limitations and conditions, and are entitled to the benefits of the
indenture equally and ratably with all other notes outstanding, if any,
subject to the terms of the indenture and each related indenture
supplement;


o on or prior to the date that the new issuance is to occur, the issuing
entity delivers to the indenture trustee and each rating agency that has
rated any outstanding series, class or tranche of notes an Issuer Tax
Opinion and, to the extent a collateral certificate is included in the
issuance trust, a master trust tax opinion relating to the related master
trust (or other securitization special purpose entity) with respect to
such issuance;


68





o on or prior to the date that the new issuance is to occur, the issuing
entity obtains confirmation from each rating agency that has rated any
outstanding series, class or tranche of notes that the new issuance will
not result a reduction, qualification with negative implications or
withdrawal of any then-current rating of any outstanding series, class or
tranche of notes;


o as of the date that the new issuance is to occur, (i) the Pool Balance as
of the last day of the immediately preceding Monthly Period is equal to
or greater than the Required Pool Balance as of the last day of such
Monthly Period and (ii) the Transferor Amount as of the last day of the
immediately preceding Monthly Period is equal to or greater than the
Required Transferor Amount as of the last day of such Monthly Period;


o in the case of bearer notes, the notes will be as described in section
163(f)(2)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code and that section will apply to
the notes;


o on or prior to the date that the new issuance is to occur, the issuing
entity delivers to the indenture trustee an indenture supplement relating
to the applicable series, class or tranche of notes and, if applicable, a
terms document relating to the applicable class or tranche of notes;


o in the case of foreign currency notes, the issuing entity appoints one or
more paying agents in the appropriate countries;


o the provisions governing required subordinated amounts, if any, are
satisfied; and


o any other conditions specified in the related prospectus supplement are
satisfied.


If the issuing entity obtains approval from each rating agency that has
rated any outstanding series, class or tranche of notes, then any or all of
the conditions described above may be waived or modified (other than the
delivery of certain tax opinions, as described in the fourth bullet point
above). In addition, the issuing entity may issue rated notes subject to
waived, modified or additional conditions agreed to between the issuing entity
and each rating agency rating such notes.


The issuing entity and the indenture trustee are not required to provide
prior notice to, permit any prior review by or obtain the consent of any
noteholder of, any outstanding series, class or tranche to issue any
additional series, classes or tranches of notes or any additional notes of any
outstanding series, class or tranche of notes.


The issuing entity may from time to time, without notice to or the consent
of, the registered holders of a series, class or tranche of notes, create and
issue additional notes equal in rank to the series, class or tranche of notes
offered by the related prospectus supplement in all respects--or in all
respects except for the payment of interest accruing prior to the issuance
date of the further series, class or tranche of notes or the first payment of
interest following the issuance date of the further series, class or tranche
of notes. These further series, classes or tranches of notes may be
consolidated and form a single series, class or tranche with the previously
issued notes and will have the same terms as to status, redemption or
otherwise as the previously issued series, class or tranche of notes. In
addition, the transferor may retain notes of a series, class or tranche upon
initial issuance or upon a reopening of a series, class or tranche of notes
and may sell them on a subsequent date.


69





There are no restrictions on the timing or amount of any issuance of
additional notes of an outstanding series, class or tranche of notes, so long
as the conditions described above are met or waived. As of the date of any
issuance of additional notes of an outstanding series, class or tranche of
notes, the stated principal amount, outstanding dollar principal amount and
Nominal Liquidation Amount of that class or tranche will be increased to
reflect the principal amount of the additional notes. If the additional notes
are part of a series, class or tranche of notes that has the benefit of a
derivative agreement, the issuing entity will enter into a derivative
agreement for the benefit of the additional notes. In addition, if the
additional notes are part of a series, class or tranche of notes that has the
benefit of any supplemental credit enhancement agreement or any supplemental
liquidity agreement, the issuing entity will enter into a similar supplemental
credit enhancement agreement or supplemental liquidity agreement, as
applicable, for the benefit of the additional notes. Furthermore, the targeted
deposits, if any, to any issuing entity account will be increased
proportionately to reflect the principal amount of the additional notes.


When issued, the additional notes of a series, class or tranche will be
identical in all respects to the other outstanding notes of that series,
class or tranche equally and ratably entitled to the benefits of the indenture
and the related indenture supplement as applicable to the previously issued
notes of such series, class or tranche without preference, priority or
distinction.



PAYMENTS ON NOTES; PAYING AGENT



The notes offered by this prospectus and the related prospectus supplement
will be delivered in book-entry form and payments of principal of and interest
on the notes will be made in U.S. dollars as described under "--Book-Entry
Notes" in this prospectus unless the stated principal amount of the notes is
denominated in a foreign currency.


The issuing entity, the indenture trustee and any agent of the issuing
entity or the indenture trustee will treat the registered holder of any note
as the absolute owner of that note, whether or not the note is overdue and
notwithstanding any notice to the contrary, for the purpose of making payment
and for all other purposes.


The issuing entity will make payments on a note to (i) the registered holder
of the note at the close of business on the record date established for the
related payment date and (ii) the bearer of a note in bearer form upon
presentation of that bearer note on the related payment date.


The issuing entity has designated the corporate trust office of The Bank of
New York in New York City as its paying agent for the notes of each series.
The issuing entity will identify any other entities appointed to serve as
paying agents on a series, class or tranche of notes in the related prospectus
supplement. The issuing entity may at any time designate additional paying
agents or rescind the designation of any paying agent or approve a change in
the office through which any paying agent acts. However, the issuer will be
required to maintain an office, agency or paying agent in each place of
payment for a series, class or tranche of notes.


After notice by publication, all funds paid to a paying agent for the
payment of the principal of or interest on any note of any series which
remains unclaimed at the end of two years after the principal or interest
becomes due and payable will be paid to the issuing entity.


70





After funds are paid to the issuer, the holder of that note may look only to
the issuing entity for payment of that principal or interest.



DENOMINATIONS



The notes offered by this prospectus will be issued in denominations of
$[5,000] and multiples of $1,000 in excess of that amount.



RECORD DATE



The record date for payment of the notes will be the last day of the Monthly
Period immediately preceding the related payment date.



GOVERNING LAW



The laws of the State of New York will govern the notes and the indenture.



FORM, EXCHANGE AND REGISTRATION AND TRANSFER OF NOTES



The notes offered by this prospectus and the related prospectus supplement
will be issued in registered form. The notes will be represented by one or
more global notes registered in the name of The Depository Trust Company, as
depository, or its nominee. We refer to each beneficial interest in a global
note as a book-entry note. For a description of the special provisions that
apply to book-entry notes, see "--Book-Entry Notes" in this prospectus.


A holder of notes may exchange those notes for other notes of the same
class or tranche of any authorized denominations and of the same aggregate
stated principal amount, expected final payment date and legal maturity date,
and of like terms.


Any holder of a note may present that note for registration of transfer,
with the form of transfer properly executed, at the office of the note
registrar or at the office of any transfer agent that the issuing entity
designates. Unless otherwise provided in the note to be transferred or
exchanged, holders of notes will not be charged any service charge for the
exchange or transfer of their notes. Holders of notes that are to be
transferred or exchanged will be liable for the payment of any taxes or other
governmental charges described in the indenture (and any supplement thereto)
before the transfer or exchange will be completed. The note registrar or
transfer agent, as the case may be, will effect a transfer or exchange when it
is satisfied with the documents of title and identity of the person making the
request.


The issuing entity has appointed The Bank of New York as the note registrar
and transfer agent for the notes. The issuing entity also may at any time
designate additional transfer agents for any series, class or tranche of
notes. The issuing entity may at any time rescind the designation of any
transfer agent or approve a change in the location through which any transfer
agent acts. However, the issuing entity will be required to maintain a
transfer agent in each place of payment for a series, class or tranche of
notes.


The related prospectus supplement may state that application will be made to
list the related series, class or tranche of notes on the Luxembourg Stock
Exchange or another exchange.



BOOK-ENTRY NOTES



The notes offered by this prospectus and the related prospectus supplement
will be delivered in book-entry form. This means that, except under the
limited circumstances


71





described below under "--Definitive Notes," purchasers of notes will not be
entitled to have the notes registered in their names and will not be entitled
to receive physical delivery of the notes in definitive paper form. Instead,
upon issuance, all of the notes of a class will be represented by one or more
fully registered permanent global notes, without interest coupons.


Each global note will be held by a securities depository named The
Depository Trust Company and will be registered in the name of its nominee,
Cede & Co. No global note representing book-entry notes may be transferred
except as a whole by DTC to a nominee of DTC, or by a nominee of DTC to
another nominee of DTC. Thus, DTC or its nominee will be the only registered
holder of the notes and will be considered the sole representative of the
beneficial owners of notes for purposes of the indenture.


The registration of the global notes in the name of Cede & Co. will not
affect beneficial ownership and is performed merely to facilitate subsequent
transfers. The book-entry system, which is also the system through which most
publicly traded common stock is held, is used because it eliminates the need
for physical movement of securities. The laws of some jurisdictions, however,
may require some purchasers to take physical delivery of their notes in
definitive form. These laws may impair the ability to own or transfer book-
entry notes.


Purchasers of notes in the United States may hold interests in the global
notes through DTC, either directly, if they are participants in that
system--such as a bank, brokerage house or other institution that maintains
securities accounts for customers with DTC or its nominee--or otherwise
indirectly through a participant in DTC. Purchasers of notes in Europe may
hold interests in the global notes through Clearstream, Luxembourg, or through
Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V., as operator of the Euroclear system.


Because DTC will be the only registered owner of the global notes,
Clearstream, Luxembourg and Euroclear will hold positions through their
respective U.S. depositories, which in turn will hold positions on the books
of DTC.


As long as the notes are in book-entry form, they will be evidenced solely
by entries on the books of DTC, its participants and any indirect
participants. DTC will maintain records showing:


o the ownership interests of its participants, including the U.S.
depositories; and


o all transfers of ownership interests between its participants.


The participants and indirect participants, in turn, will maintain records
showing:


o the ownership interests of their customers, including indirect
participants, that hold the notes through those participants; and


o all transfers between these persons.


Thus, each beneficial owner of a book-entry note will hold its note
indirectly through a hierarchy of intermediaries, with DTC at the "top" and
the beneficial owner's own securities intermediary at the "bottom."


The issuing entity, the indenture trustee and their agents will not be
liable for the accuracy of, and are not responsible for maintaining,
supervising or reviewing DTC's records or any participant's records relating
to book-entry notes. The issuing entity, the indenture trustee and


72





their agents also will not be responsible or liable for payments made on
account of the book-entry notes.


Until Definitive Notes are issued to the beneficial owners as described
below under "--Definitive Notes," all references to "holders" of notes means
DTC. The issuing entity, the indenture trustee and any paying agent, transfer
agent or securities registrar may treat DTC as the absolute owner of the notes
for all purposes.


Beneficial owners of book-entry notes should realize that the issuing entity
will make all distributions of principal of and interest on their notes to DTC
and will send all required reports and notices solely to DTC as long as DTC is
the registered holder of the notes. DTC and the participants are generally
required to receive and transmit all distributions, notices and directions
from the indenture trustee to the beneficial owners through the chain of
intermediaries.


Similarly, the indenture trustee will accept notices and directions solely
from DTC. Therefore, in order to exercise any rights of a holder of notes
under the indenture (and any supplement thereto), each person owning a
beneficial interest in the notes must rely on the procedures of DTC and, in
some cases, Clearstream, Luxembourg or Euroclear. If the beneficial owner is
not a participant in that system, then it must rely on the procedures of the
participant through which that person owns its interest. DTC has advised the
issuer that it will take actions under the indenture only at the direction of
its participants, which in turn will act only at the direction of the
beneficial owners. Some of these actions, however, may conflict with actions
it takes at the direction of other participants and beneficial owners.


Notices and other communications by DTC to participants, by participants to
indirect participants, and by participants and indirect participants to
beneficial owners will be governed by arrangements among them.


Beneficial owners of book-entry notes should also realize that book-entry
notes may be more difficult to pledge because of the lack of a physical note.
A beneficial owner may also experience delays in receiving distributions on
his or her notes since distributions will initially be made to DTC and must be
transferred through the chain of intermediaries to the beneficial owner's
account.

DISTRIBUTIONS ON BOOK-ENTRY NOTES



The issuing entity will make distributions of principal of and interest on
book-entry notes to DTC. These payments will be made in immediately available
funds by the issuing agent's paying agent, The Bank of New York, at the office
of the paying agent in New York City that the issuer designates for that
purpose.


In the case of principal payments, the global notes must be presented to the
paying agent in time for the paying agent to make those payments in
immediately available funds in accordance with its normal payment procedures.


Upon receipt of any payment of principal of or interest on a global note,
DTC will immediately credit the accounts of its participants on its book-entry
registration and transfer system. DTC will credit those accounts with payments
in amounts proportionate to the participants' respective beneficial interests
in the stated principal amount of the global note as shown on the records of
DTC. Payments by participants to beneficial owners of book-entry notes will be
governed by standing instructions and customary practices, as is now the case
with securities held for the accounts of customers in bearer form or
registered in "street name," and will be the responsibility of those
participants.


Distributions on book-entry notes held beneficially through Clearstream,
Luxembourg will be credited to cash accounts of Clearstream, Luxembourg
participants in accordance with its rules and procedures, to the extent
received by its U.S. depository.


Distributions on book-entry notes held beneficially through Euroclear will
be credited to the cash accounts of Euroclear participants in accordance with
the Terms and Conditions, to the extent received by its U.S. depository.


In the event Definitive Notes are issued, distributions of principal of and
interest on Definitive Notes will be made directly to the holders of the
Definitive Notes in whose names the Definitive Notes were registered at the
close of business on the related record date.



GLOBAL CLEARANCE AND SETTLEMENT PROCEDURES



Initial settlement for the notes will be made in immediately available
funds. Secondary market trading between DTC participants will occur in the
ordinary way in accordance with DTC's rules and will be settled in immediately
available funds using DTC's Same-Day Funds Settlement System. Secondary market
trading between Clearstream, Luxembourg participants and/or Euroclear
participants will occur in the ordinary way in accordance with the applicable
rules and operating procedures of Clearstream, Luxembourg and Euroclear and
will be settled using the procedures applicable to conventional eurobonds in
immediately available funds.


Cross-market transfers between persons holding directly or indirectly
through DTC, on the one hand, and directly or indirectly through Clearstream,
Luxembourg or Euroclear participants, on the other, will be effected in DTC in
accordance with DTC's rules on behalf of the relevant European international
clearing system by the U.S. depositories. However, cross-market transactions
of this type will require delivery of instructions to the relevant European
international clearing system by the counterparty in that system in


75





accordance with its rules and procedures and within its established deadlines,
European time. The relevant European international clearing system will, if
the transaction meets its settlement requirements, deliver instructions to its
U.S. depository to take action to effect final settlement on its behalf by
delivering or receiving notes in DTC, and making or receiving payment in
accordance with normal procedures for same-day funds settlement applicable to
DTC. Clearstream, Luxembourg participants and Euroclear participants may not
deliver instructions directly to DTC.


Because of time-zone differences, credits to notes received in Clearstream,
Luxembourg or Euroclear as a result of a transaction with a DTC participant
will be made during subsequent securities settlement processing and will be
credited the Business Day following a DTC settlement date. The credits to or
any transactions in the notes settled during processing will be reported to
the relevant Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg participants on that
Business Day. Cash received in Clearstream, Luxembourg or Euroclear as a
result of sales of notes by or through a Clearstream, Luxembourg participant
or a Euroclear participant to a DTC participant will be received with value on
the DTC settlement date, but will be available in the relevant Clearstream,
Luxembourg or Euroclear cash account only as of the Business Day following
settlement in DTC.


Although DTC, Clearstream, Luxembourg and Euroclear have agreed to these
procedures in order to facilitate transfers of notes among participants of
DTC, Clearstream, Luxembourg and Euroclear, they are under no obligation to
perform or continue to perform these procedures and these procedures may be
discontinued at any time.



DEFINITIVE NOTES



Beneficial owners of book-entry notes may exchange those notes for physical
form or Definitive Notes registered in their name only if:


o DTC is unwilling or unable to continue as depository for the global notes
or ceases to be a registered "clearing agency" and the issuing entity is
unable to find a qualified replacement for DTC;


o the issuing entity, in its sole discretion, elects to terminate its
participation in the book-entry system through DTC; or


o any event of default has occurred with respect to those book-entry notes
and beneficial owners evidencing more than 50% of the unpaid outstanding
dollar principal amount of the notes of the related series, class or
tranche advise the indenture trustee and DTC that the continuation of a
book-entry system is no longer in the best interests of those beneficial
owners.


If any of these three events occurs, DTC is required to notify the
beneficial owners through the chain of intermediaries that the Definitive
Notes are available. The appropriate global note will then be exchangeable in
whole for Definitive Notes in registered form of like tenor and of an equal
aggregate stated principal amount, in specified denominations. Definitive
Notes will be registered in the name or names of the person or persons
specified by DTC in a written instruction to the registrar of the notes. DTC
may base its written instruction upon directions it receives from its
participants. Thereafter, the holders of the Definitive Notes will be
recognized as the "holders" of the notes under the indenture (and any
supplement thereto).


76






REPLACEMENT OF NOTES



The issuing entity will replace at the expense of the holder any mutilated
note upon surrender of that note to the indenture trustee. The issuing entity
will replace at the expense of the holder any notes that are destroyed, lost
or stolen upon delivery to the indenture trustee of evidence of the
destruction, loss or theft of those notes satisfactory to the issuing entity
and the indenture trustee. In the case of a destroyed, lost or stolen note,
the issuing entity and the indenture trustee may require the holder of the
note to provide an indemnity satisfactory to the indenture trustee and the
issuing entity before a replacement note will be issued, and the issuing
entity may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other
governmental charge, and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses
of the indenture trustee) in connection with the issuance of a replacement
note.


77






SOURCES OF FUNDS TO PAY THE NOTES




GENERAL



As of the date of this prospectus, the issuing entity's primary assets
consist of charge receivables which were or will be originated by TRS,
Centurion, FSB or any of their affiliates. These receivables include
receivables which are in existence as of the Initial Cut-Off Date and
receivables which are created from time to time thereafter. The issuing entity
has acquired and will acquire the receivables from the transferor pursuant to
the transfer and servicing agreement. The transferor has and will have
acquired receivables from TRS pursuant to a receivables purchase agreement
between TRS and the transferor. TRS has and will have acquired receivables
from Centurion pursuant to a receivables purchase agreement between Centurion
and TRS, from FSB pursuant to a receivables purchase agreement between FSB and
TRS and from Credco pursuant to sale agreements between Credco and TRS. See
"Description of the Receivables Purchase Agreements and the Sale Agreements"
in this prospectus.


In addition to receivables arising in designated charge accounts, the
issuing entity's assets may include one or more collateral certificates, each
representing an undivided interest in a master trust or other securitization
special purpose entity, whose assets consist primarily of receivables arising
in designated charge accounts owned by TRS, Centurion, FSB or any of their
affiliates.


The issuing entity's assets also may include issuing entity accounts or
supplemental accounts established for a particular series, class or tranche of
notes, the benefits of one or more derivative agreements, supplemental credit
enhancement agreements or supplemental liquidity agreements.


Payment of principal of and interest on each series, class or tranche of
notes is secured by the issuing entity's assets.


As of the date of this prospectus, the issuing entity's primary assets are
receivables arising in designated consumer and small business charge accounts
owned by TRS, Centurion and FSB and funds on deposit in the issuing entity
accounts. In the future, the issuing entity's assets may include receivables
arising in designated commercial charge accounts owned by TRS or any of its
affiliates, receivables arising in additional designated consumer and small
business charge accounts owned by TRS, Centurion, FSB or any of their
affiliates and collateral certificates, each representing an undivided
interest in a master trust or other securitization special purpose entity,
whose assets consist primarily of receivables arising in designated charge
accounts owned by TRS, Centurion, FSB or any of their affiliates.


The composition of the issuing entity's assets will change over time due to:


o changes in the composition and amount of the receivables in the issuance
trust, including changes in the relative proportion of consumer, small
business and commercial receivables, or in the master trust or other
securitization special purpose entity which has issued a collateral
certificate included in the issuance trust, as new receivables are
created, existing receivables are paid off or charged off, additional
accounts are designated to have their receivables included in the
issuance trust, master trust or other securitization special purpose
entity and removed accounts are designated


78





to have their receivables removed from the issuance trust, master trust
or other securitization special purpose entity;


o the ability of the transferor to cause to be increased and decreased the
Invested Amount of an existing collateral certificate included in the
issuance trust; and


o the ability of the transferor to transfer additional collateral
certificates to the issuance trust.


If accounts are designated to have their receivables included in the
issuance trust, all newly generated receivables in those accounts will be
transferred to the issuance trust. In addition, additional accounts may be
designated to have their receivables included in the issuance trust.


The transferor can cause to be increased the Invested Amount of an existing
collateral certificate included in the issuance trust to accommodate the
issuance of new notes or solely to increase the size of the Transferor Amount.
If at any time the issuance trust contains receivables and one or more
collateral certificates, the transferor can choose to increase one, all or any
combination thereof in any amount. Any increase in the Invested Amount of an
existing collateral certificate without a corresponding increase in the
Invested Amount of other existing collateral certificates or the principal
amount of receivables in the issuance trust will result in a change in the
composition of the issuing entity's assets.


Alternatively, if at any time the issuance trust contains one or more
collateral certificates, Principal Collections and other amounts treated as
Principal Collections that are not required to be deposited into a principal
funding account for the benefit of a series, class or tranche of notes, paid
to the noteholders of a series, class or tranche, deposited into the
overconcentration account or the excess funding account or used to pay
shortfalls in interest on senior notes and any other amounts specified in the
related prospectus supplement, need not be reinvested in that collateral
certificate to maintain its invested amount, but instead may be (i) invested
or reinvested in another collateral certificate included or to be included in
the issuance trust or (ii) paid to the holder of the transferor interest. Any
such investment, reinvestment or payment will result in a shift in the
composition of the issuing entity's assets and a decrease in the size of the
Invested Amount of that collateral certificate.


In addition, each collateral certificate is subject to its own pay out
events or early amortization events under the terms of the applicable pooling
and servicing agreement or other related securitization agreement. Principal
collections allocated to such collateral certificate upon the occurrence of a
pay out event or early amortization event that are not required to be
deposited into a principal funding account for the benefit of a series,
class or tranche of notes, paid to the noteholders of a series, class or
tranche, deposited into the overconcentration account or the excess funding
account or used to pay shortfalls in interest on senior notes and any other
amounts specified in the related prospectus supplement, may be (i) invested or
reinvested in another collateral certificate included or to be included in the
issuance trust or (ii) paid to the holder of the transferor interest.


As indicated above, the composition of the issuing entity's assets is
expected to change over time. Additional receivables and additional collateral
certificates may be transferred to the issuance trust or the invested amount
of an existing collateral certificate included in the issuance trust may be
increased without the payment of cash if the conditions to that transfer or


79





increase have been satisfied. New assets included in the issuance trust,
either through a transfer of assets or the reinvestment of excess Principal
Collections and other amounts treated as Principal Collections, may have
characteristics, terms and conditions that are different from those of the
receivables or collateral certificates initially included in the issuance
trust and may be of different credit quality due to differences in
underwriting criteria and payment terms. The pertinent characteristics of the
receivables in the issuance trust are described in the related prospectus
supplement. In the event collateral certificates are included in the issuance
trust, the pertinent characteristics of those collateral certificates will be
described in each related prospectus supplement.


See "Risk Factors--The composition of the issuing entity's assets may
change, which may decrease the credit quality of the assets securing your
notes. If this occurs, your receipt of payments of principal and interest may
be reduced, delayed or accelerated" in this prospectus.



DEPOSIT AND ALLOCATION OF FUNDS IN THE ISSUANCE TRUST



The indenture trustee will, at the direction of the servicer, allocate to
each series of notes the product of:


o the Floating Allocation Percentage for that series, and


o the amount of Finance Charge Collections.


The indenture trustee will also, at the direction of the servicer, allocate
to each series of notes:


o the product of the Principal Allocation Percentage for that series and
the amount of Principal Collections,


o the product of the Floating Allocation Percentage for that series and the
Default Amount, and


o the product of the Floating Allocation Percentage for that series and the
servicing fee.


The Floating Allocation Percentage and the Principal Allocation Percentage
for each series of notes will be specified in the related prospectus
supplement. Finance Charge Collections, Principal Collections, the Default
Amount and the servicing fee allocated to the holders of notes of any series
will be applied as described in the related prospectus supplement.


In the case of a series of notes having more than one class or tranche,
Principal Collections, Finance Charge Collections, the Default Amount and the
servicing fee allocated to that series of notes may be further allocated and
applied to each class or tranche of notes in the manner and order of priority
described in the related prospectus supplement.


Additional amounts may be allocated to a series, class or tranche of notes
if the noteholders of that series, class or tranche have the benefit of a
derivative agreement, a supplemental credit enhancement agreement or a
supplemental liquidity agreement. The specific terms of a derivative
agreement, supplemental credit enhancement agreement or supplemental liquidity
agreement, including how any payments made pursuant to any of these agreements
will be applied, will be included in the related prospectus supplement for any
series, class or tranche of notes that has the benefit of those agreements.


80





Upon a sale of assets in the issuance trust following (i) an event of
default and acceleration of a series, class or tranche of notes or (ii) the
legal maturity date of a series, class or tranche of notes, as described in
the related prospectus supplement and in "--Sale of Assets" in this
prospectus, the Nominal Liquidation Amount of that series, class or tranche of
notes will be reduced to zero. After such sale, Principal Collections and
Finance Charge Collections will no longer be allocated to that series, class or
tranche of notes.


The servicer will allocate to the holder of the transferor interest, the
Transferor Percentage of Finance Charge Collections, Principal Collections,
the Default Amount and the servicing fee. However, (i) if the Available
Overconcentration Account Amount for such Monthly Period is, or as a result of
such payment would become, less than the Required Overconcentration Account
Amount for such Monthly Period, Principal Collections will be deposited into
the overconcentration account before being allocated to the holder of the
transferor interest and (ii) if the Transferor Amount is, or as a result of
the allocation would become, less than the Required Transferor Amount or the
Pool Balance is, or as a result of the allocation would become, less than the
Required Pool Balance, Principal Collections will be deposited into the excess
funding account before being allocated to the holder of the transferor
interest. Finance Charge Collections allocated to the holder of the transferor
interest may be applied to cover certain shortfalls in the amount of
investment earnings (net of losses and investment expenses) on investments of
funds in certain bank accounts, such as the principal funding account, for the
benefit of noteholders to the extent specified in the related prospectus
supplement.



DEPOSITS IN COLLECTION ACCOUNT



The servicer, no later than two Business Days after each Date of Processing,
will deposit all collections received with respect to the receivables in each
Monthly Period into the collection account.


For as long as TRS or any of its affiliates remains the servicer under the
transfer and servicing agreement and any of:


(i)     the servicer maintains a short-term credit rating (which may be an
implied rating) of not less than P-1 from Moody's Investors
Service, Inc., A-1 from Standard and Poor's Ratings Services and,
if rated by Fitch, Inc., F1 from Fitch (or such other rating which
is satisfactory to such rating agency), which is currently the
case, or


(ii)    the servicer obtains a guarantee with respect to its deposit and
payment obligations under the transfer and servicing agreement (in
form and substance satisfactory to each rating agency that has
rated any outstanding series, class or tranche of notes) from a
guarantor having a short-term credit rating (which may be an
implied rating) of not less than P-1 from Moody's, A-1 from
Standard & Poor's and, if rated by Fitch, F1 from Fitch (or such
other rating which is satisfactory to such rating agency), or


(iii)   the Rating Agency Condition will have been satisfied despite the
servicer's inability to satisfy the rating requirement specified
in clause (i) above,


and for thirty Business Days following any such reduction in any such rating
or failure to satisfy the conditions specified in clause (ii) or (iii) above,
TRS, as servicer, is not required to


81





deposit collections into the collection account on the day indicated in the
preceding sentence. Instead, TRS, as servicer, may use all such collections
for its own benefit and will deposit all such collections into the collection
account on the First Note Transfer Date following the Monthly Period with
respect to which such deposit relates.


The servicer will only be required to deposit collections into the
collection account up to the aggregate amount of collections required to be
deposited into the issuing entity accounts established for all series, classes
or tranches of notes and, without duplication, required to be paid in respect
of such notes on or prior to the related payment date pursuant to the terms of
the related indenture supplement. In addition, the servicer may deduct the
servicing fee for such Monthly Period from the net amount to be deposited into
such collection account and is not required to deposit into the collection
account any amounts allocable to the holder of the transferor interest, and,
as directed by the holder, the servicer will pay those amounts to such holder
on a daily or monthly basis.


Any Principal Collections not distributed to the holder of the transferor
interest because the Available Overconcentration Account Amount does not
exceed the Required Overconcentration Account Amount (after giving effect to
any receivables or additional collateral certificates transferred to the
issuance trust on such day or any increases in the Invested Amount of an
existing collateral certificate on such day and any deposit to, or withdrawal
from, the overconcentration account made or to be made on such day) will be
deposited into the overconcentration account. Furthermore, any Principal
Collections not distributed to the holder of the transferor interest on any
day because the Transferor Amount does not exceed the Required Transferor
Amount on such day or because the Pool Balance does not exceed the Required
Pool Balance on such day (in each case, after giving effect to any receivables
or additional collateral certificates transferred to the issuance trust on
such day or any increases in the Invested Amount of an existing collateral
certificate on such day and any deposit to, or withdrawal from, the
overconcentration account made or to be made on such day) will be deposited
into the excess funding account.


In the event of the insolvency or bankruptcy of the servicer, or if certain
time periods were to pass, the issuer and the indenture trustee may lose any
perfected security interest in any Finance Charge Collections or Principal
Collections commingled with the funds of the servicer. See "Risk Factors--Some
interests may be given priority over your notes, which could cause your
receipt of payments to be delayed or reduced" in this prospectus.



REQUIRED TRANSFEROR AMOUNT



The Transferor Amount represents the amount of assets included in the
issuance trust not securing any series, class or tranche of notes. For any
Monthly Period, the Transferor Amount equals the Pool Balance as of the close
of business on the last day of such Monthly Period minus the aggregate Nominal
Liquidation Amount of all notes as of the close of business on such day. The
Transferor Amount fluctuates due to changes in the amount of principal
receivables included in the issuance trust, the aggregate Invested Amount of
the collateral certificates included in the issuance trust, the amount on
deposit in the excess funding account and the aggregate Nominal Liquidation
Amount of all notes. As a result, the Transferor Amount generally increases if
there are reductions in the Nominal Liquidation Amount of a series, class or
tranche of notes due to payments of principal of that series, class or tranche
of notes or a deposit into the principal funding account with respect to that
series, class or tranche


82





or an increase in the Pool Balance without a corresponding increase in the
Nominal Liquidation Amount of any series, classes or tranches of notes. The
Transferor Amount generally decreases as a result of the issuance of a new
series, class or tranche of notes, assuming that there is not a corresponding
increase in the issuing entity's assets. In addition, if the servicer adjusts
downward the amount of any receivable because of a rebate, refund,
unauthorized charge or billing error to an accountholder, or such receivable
was created in respect of merchandise that was refused or returned by an
accountholder, or if the servicer otherwise adjusts downward the amount of any
receivable without receiving collections therefor or without charging off such
amount as uncollectible, the Transferor Amount--and not the investors'
interest--will be reduced by the product of one minus the Discount Option
Percentage and the amount of the adjustment.


The Transferor Amount is required to be maintained at a certain minimum
level, referred to as the Required Transferor Amount. For any Monthly Period,
the Required Transferor Amount is a designated percentage, referred to as the
Required Transferor Amount Percentage, of the amount of principal receivables
included in the issuance trust as of the close of business on the last day of
such Monthly Period. The Required Transferor Amount Percentage currently is
15%.


The transferor may designate a different Required Transferor Amount
Percentage. Before reducing that percentage below 15%, however, the transferor
must provide the indenture trustee with:


o written confirmation that the Rating Agency Condition has been satisfied;
and


o an Issuer Tax Opinion.


If, at the end of any Monthly Period, the Transferor Amount for such Monthly
Period and for the prior Monthly Period is less than the Required Transferor
Amount for each such Monthly Period, the transferor is required to transfer
additional receivables or additional collateral certificates to the issuance
trust or to cause to be increased the Invested Amount of an existing
collateral certificate included in the issuance trust. See "--Addition of
Assets" in this prospectus.


If, when required to do so, the transferor is unable to transfer additional
receivables or additional collateral certificates to the issuance trust or to
cause to be increased the Invested Amount of an existing collateral
certificate included in the issuance trust, an early amortization event will
occur with respect to the notes. See "The Indenture--Early Amortization
Events" in this prospectus.


The interest in the Transferor Amount, referred to as the transferor
interest, will initially be held by the transferor, although that interest may
be transferred by a holder thereof in whole or in part subject to certain
limitations and conditions described in the trust agreement, the transfer and
servicing agreement, the indenture and the related indenture supplement. The
Transferor Amount may be evidenced either in certificated form or in
uncertificated form. Any reference in this prospectus to the transferor
interest means the interest of the transferor in the Transferor Amount as
evidenced in either certificated or uncertificated form. Currently, the
transferor interest is in uncertificated form. The Transferor Amount does not
provide credit enhancement to the notes.

REQUIRED POOL BALANCE



For any Monthly Period, the Pool Balance equals the sum of (i) the amount of
principal receivables included in the issuance trust at the end of such
Monthly Period, (ii) the aggregate Invested Amount of the collateral
certificates included in the issuance trust at the end of such Monthly Period,
and (iii) the amount on deposit in the excess funding account at the end of
such Monthly Period.


The issuance trust has a minimum pool balance requirement, referred to as
the Required Pool Balance. For any Monthly Period, the Required Pool Balance
is an amount equal to the sum of (i) for all notes in their revolving period,
the sum of the Nominal Liquidation Amounts of those notes at the end of such
Monthly Period and (ii) for all other notes, the sum of the Nominal
Liquidation Amounts of those notes at the end of the most recent revolving
period for each of those notes, excluding any notes which will be paid in full
on the applicable payment date for those notes in the following Monthly Period
and any notes that will have a Nominal Liquidation Amount of zero on the
applicable payment date for those notes in the following Monthly Period.


If, at the end of any Monthly Period, the Pool Balance is less than the
Required Pool Balance for such Monthly Period, the transferor is required to
transfer additional receivables or additional collateral certificates to the
issuance trust or to cause to be increased the Invested Amount of an existing
collateral certificate included in the issuance trust as described in
"--Addition of Assets" and "--Increases in the Invested Amount of an Existing
Collateral Certificate" in this prospectus.


If, when required to do so, the transferor is unable to transfer additional
receivables or additional collateral certificates to the issuance trust or to
cause to be increased the Invested Amount of an existing collateral
certificate included in the issuance trust, an early amortization event will
occur with respect to the notes. See "The Indenture--Early Amortization
Events" in this prospectus.



ALLOCATIONS OF AMOUNTS TO THE OVERCONCENTRATION ACCOUNT AND ALLOCATIONS OF
AMOUNTS ON DEPOSIT IN THE OVERCONCENTRATION ACCOUNT



If, for any Monthly Period, the Commercial Obligor Overconcentration Amount
is greater than zero, the servicer will deposit into the overconcentration
account the Principal Collections that otherwise would have been paid to the
holder of the transferor interest. This deposit will be in an amount equal to
the amount by which the Available Overconcentration Account Amount would be
less than the Required Overconcentration Account Amount, determined with
respect to the related Monthly Period.


If no series of notes is in an accumulation period or an amortization
period, amounts on deposit in the overconcentration account will be released
to the holder of the transferor interest to the extent that, after such
release, the Available Overconcentration Account Amount is equal to or greater
than the Required Overconcentration Account Amount. If an accumulation period
or an amortization period has commenced and is continuing with respect to any
series of notes, any funds on deposit in the overconcentration account will be
released, allocated to those series in an accumulation or an amortization
period and treated as available principal collections to the extent needed to
make principal payments due to or for the benefit of the noteholders of such
series. Any remaining amounts on deposit in the overconcentration


84





account in excess of the amount required to be treated as Principal
Collections for a Monthly Period shall be released to the holder of the
transferor interest, but only to the extent that such release would not cause
the Available Overconcentration Account Amount to be less than the Required
Overconcentration Account Amount for such Monthly Period.


Funds on deposit in the overconcentration account will be invested by the
indenture trustee, at the direction of the issuing entity, in Eligible
Investments. Any earnings (net of losses and investment expenses) earned on
amounts on deposit in the overconcentration account during any Monthly Period
will be withdrawn and treated as Finance Charge Collections for such Monthly
Period.



ALLOCATIONS OF AMOUNTS TO THE EXCESS FUNDING ACCOUNT AND ALLOCATIONS OF
AMOUNTS ON DEPOSIT IN THE EXCESS FUNDING ACCOUNT



If, at the end of any Monthly Period, (i) the Transferor Amount is, or as a
result of a payment would become, less than the Required Transferor Amount for
such Monthly Period or (ii) the Pool Balance is, or as a result of a payment
would become, less than the Required Pool Balance for such Monthly Period, the
servicer will deposit into the excess funding account (after giving effect to
any deposit to, or withdrawal from, the overconcentration account made or to
be made with respect to such date) the Principal Collections that otherwise
would have been paid to the holder of the transferor interest. This deposit
will be in an amount equal to the greater of the amount by which the
Transferor Amount would be less than the Required Transferor Amount and the
amount by which the Pool Balance would be less than the Required Pool Balance,
each determined with respect to the related Monthly Period.


If no series of notes is in an accumulation period or an amortization
period, amounts on deposit in the excess funding account will be released to
the holder of the transferor interest to the extent that, after such release,
the Transferor Amount is equal to or greater than the Required Transferor
Amount and the Pool Balance is equal to or greater than the Required Pool
Balance. If an accumulation period or amortization period has commenced and is
continuing with respect to any series of notes, any funds on deposit in the
excess funding account will be released, deposited into the collection account
and treated as Principal Collections to the extent needed to make principal
payments due to or for the benefit of the noteholders of such series. Any
remaining amounts on deposit in the excess funding account in excess of the
amount required to be treated as Principal Collections for a Monthly Period
shall be released to the holder of the transferor interest, but only to the
extent that such release would not cause the Transferor Amount to be less than
the Required Transferor Amount or the Pool Balance to be less than the
Required Pool Balance.


Funds on deposit in the excess funding account will be invested by the
indenture trustee, at the direction of the issuing entity, in Eligible
Investments. Any earnings (net of losses and investment expenses) earned on
amounts on deposit in the excess funding account during any Monthly Period
will be withdrawn and treated as Finance Charge Collections for such Monthly
Period.



INCREASES IN THE INVESTED AMOUNT OF AN EXISTING COLLATERAL CERTIFICATE



The transferor may cause to be increased the Invested Amount of any existing
collateral certificate included in the issuance trust. The Invested Amount of
an existing collateral certificate included in the issuance trust can be
increased through:


85





o the reinvestment of Principal Collections and other amounts treated as
Principal Collections received that are not required to be deposited into
a principal funding account for the benefit of a series, class or tranche
of notes, paid to the noteholders of a series, class or tranche,
deposited into the overconcentration account or the excess funding
account or used to pay shortfalls in interest on senior notes and any
other amounts specified in the related prospectus supplement;


o proceeds received in connection with the issuance of additional notes; or


o funding by the transferor, which funding may be in cash or through an
increase in the Transferor Amount.


Notwithstanding the ability to increase the Invested Amount of any existing
collateral certificate, the Invested Amount of an existing collateral
certificate will not be increased, and reinvestment in that collateral
certificate will not be permitted, if (i) an early amortization event has
occurred with respect to any notes as a result of a failure to transfer
additional assets (including additional receivables or additional collateral
certificates) to the issuance trust or a failure to cause to be increased the
Invested Amount of an existing collateral certificate included in the issuance
trust at a time when the Pool Balance for the prior Monthly Period is less
than the Required Pool Balance for the prior Monthly Period and (ii)
increasing the Invested Amount of an existing collateral certificate or
reinvesting in that collateral certificate would result in a reduction in the
allocation percentage applicable for principal collections for the existing
collateral certificate.



ADDITION OF ASSETS



The transferor (without independent verification of its authority) will
have the right, from time to time (i) to designate Additional Accounts to be
included in the issuing entity's Portfolio, (ii) to transfer one or more
collateral certificates to the issuance trust or (iii) to cause to be
increased the Invested Amount of one or more existing collateral certificates.
Subject only to the requirements for Eligible Accounts and applicable
regulatory guidelines, the account owners have the discretion to select the
accounts in any Segment of the Total Portfolio for addition to the Trust
Portfolio. Any Additional Accounts designated to the issuing entity's
Portfolio will be selected from the portfolio of accounts owned by TRS,
Centurion, FSB or any of their affiliates that is described in the related
prospectus supplement. Therefore, if Additional Accounts are to be designated,
the transferor will, under the RFC V receivables purchase agreement, request
that TRS designate accounts which qualify as Eligible Accounts to the
transferor. In turn, under each of the Centurion receivables purchase
agreement and the FSB receivables purchase agreement, TRS may request that
Centurion or FSB, as applicable, designate accounts which qualify as Eligible
Accounts to TRS. The transferor will designate those accounts to be included
in the issuing entity's Portfolio.


There are two types of Additional Accounts: New Accounts and Aggregate
Addition Accounts. A New Account is an account designated to be included in
the issuing entity's Portfolio on the date it is originated by an account
owner. An Aggregate Addition Account typically is an account that is
designated to be included in the issuing entity's Portfolio on a date other
than its origination date, and the receivables of which generally arise in (i)
additional Eligible Accounts from the portfolio of accounts owned by TRS,
Centurion, FSB or any of their affiliates that is described in the related
prospectus supplement, (ii) portfolios of


86





accounts acquired by an account owner from other charge card issuers or (iii)
any other account of a type not previously designated to be included in the
issuing entity's Portfolio.


As of the date an Additional Account is selected to be included in the
issuing entity's Portfolio, such Additional Account must be an Eligible
Account. Receivables arising in Additional Accounts, however, may not be of
the same credit quality as the receivables arising in accounts already
included in the issuing entity's Portfolio or the receivables arising in
accounts already included in the Portfolio of a master trust or other
securitization special purpose entity which has issued a collateral
certificate included in the issuance trust. Additional Accounts may have been
originated by TRS, Centurion, FSB or any of their affiliates using credit
criteria different from those which were applied by TRS, Centurion, FSB or any
of their affiliates to the accounts already included in the issuing entity's
Portfolio or the Portfolio of a master trust or other securitization special
purpose entity which has issued a collateral certificate included in the
issuance trust, or may have been acquired by TRS, Centurion, FSB or any of
their affiliates from a third-party institution which may have used different
credit criteria from those applied by TRS, Centurion, FSB or any of their
affiliates to the accounts. Consequently, the performance of such Additional
Accounts may be better or worse than the performance of the accounts already
included in the issuing entity's Portfolio or in the Portfolio of a master
trust or other securitization special purpose entity which has issued a
collateral certificate included in the issuance trust. See "Risk Factors--The
composition of the issuer's assets may change, which may decrease the credit
quality of the assets securing your notes. If this occurs, your receipt of
payments of principal and interest may be reduced, delayed or accelerated" in
this prospectus.


At the time of its transfer to the issuance trust, each additional
collateral certificate must be an Eligible Collateral Certificate. An
additional collateral certificate, however, may not be of the same credit
quality as the receivables arising in the accounts already included in the
issuing entity's Portfolio, or any existing collateral certificate included in
the issuance trust. This is because the receivables arising in the accounts
included in the Portfolio of the master trust or securitization special
purpose entity which has issued such additional collateral certificate may not
be of the same credit quality as the receivables in any of the accounts
included in the issuing entity's Portfolio or included in the Portfolio of a
master trust or other securitization special purpose entity which has issued
any such existing collateral certificate due to differences in credit
criteria. Consequently, the performance of such additional collateral
certificate may be better or worse than the performance of any receivables
arising in the accounts already included in the issuing entity's Portfolio or
any existing collateral certificate included in the issuance trust. See "Risk
Factors--The composition of the issuing entity's assets may change, which may
decrease the credit quality of the assets securing your notes. If this occurs,
your receipt of payments of principal and interest may be reduced, delayed or
accelerated" in this prospectus.


Unless each rating agency that has rated any outstanding series, class or
tranche of notes otherwise consents, the number of New Accounts and Aggregate
Addition Accounts designated to be included in the issuing entity's Portfolio
without prior rating agency notice will not exceed the Addition Limit. At the
end of each semi-annual period in which New Accounts are designated to be
included in the issuing entity's Portfolio, or more frequently if required by
any rating agency that has rated any outstanding series, class or tranche of
notes, the transferor will deliver to each such rating agency an opinion of
counsel with respect to the


87





New Accounts included as accounts during the preceding six-month period that
confirms the creation and perfection of the security interest in the
receivables in such New Accounts. If such opinion of counsel is not so
received, the ability of the transferor to designate New Accounts will be
suspended until such time as each rating agency that has rated any outstanding
series, class or tranche of notes otherwise consents in writing or such
accounts are removed from the issuing entity's Portfolio. Accounts of a nature
different than the initial accounts or of a type not previously included as an
Aggregate Addition Account may not be designated to be included in the issuing
entity's Portfolio as New Accounts.


In addition to the permitted additions described above, the transferor will
be required to transfer to the issuance trust receivables arising in
Additional Accounts, to transfer additional collateral certificates to the
issuance trust or to cause to be increased the Invested Amount of one or more
existing collateral certificates included in the issuance trust if, at the end
of any Monthly Period, (i) the Transferor Amount for that Monthly Period and
the prior Monthly Period is less than the Required Transferor Amount for each
such Monthly Period, or (ii) the Pool Balance for such Monthly Period is less
than the Required Pool Balance for such Monthly Period. In such event, the
transferor will, on or before the thirtieth Business Day after the end of such
Monthly Period (unless the Transferor Amount exceeds the Required Transferor
Amount and the Pool Balance exceeds the Required Pool Balance, in each case as
of the end of any Business Day during the period between the end of the prior
Monthly Period and such addition date), make an addition to the issuance trust
in a sufficient amount so that, after giving effect to such addition or
increase, the Transferor Amount is at least equal to the Required Transferor
Amount and the Pool Balance is at least equal to the Required Pool Balance.


When the transferor transfers receivables in Additional Accounts or
additional collateral certificates to the issuance trust or when it causes to
be increased the Invested Amount of an existing collateral certificate
included in the issuance trust, it must satisfy several conditions, including,
as applicable:


o with respect to the designation of Additional Accounts to the issuing
entity's Portfolio, delivery and acceptance by the owner trustee of a
written assignment of receivables in the Additional Accounts or of the
additional collateral certificates, as applicable;


o delivery on the required delivery date to the indenture trustee of a
computer file or microfiche list with an accurate list of all Additional
Accounts and/or a schedule with an accurate list of all additional
collateral certificates, as applicable;


o delivery to the owner trustee and the indenture trustee of a certificate
of an authorized officer to the effect that:


(i) as of the date an Additional Account is selected for designation
to the Issuance Trust Portfolio, such Additional Account is an Eligible
Account;


(ii) at the time of its transfer to the issuance trust, each
additional collateral certificate is an Eligible Collateral Certificate;


(iii) the transferor has delivered copies of the financing statements,
if necessary, to perfect the security interest of the issuing entity and
the indenture trustee in the related receivables or collateral
certificates, as applicable;


88





(iv) if daily deposits into the collection account are required as
described in "--Deposits in Collection Account" in this prospectus, the
transferor has deposited into the collection account all collections with
respect to such Additional Accounts since the applicable cut off date and
all collections with respect to such additional collateral certificates
as of the addition date;


(v) as of the addition date, the transferor is not insolvent and the
transfer of the receivables and/or the additional collateral certificates
is not made in contemplation of insolvency;


(vi) in the transferor's reasonable belief, transferring the
receivables in the Additional Accounts or the additional collateral
certificates will not have a material adverse effect on the noteholders
of any series, class or tranche of notes and will not result in the
Commercial Obligor Overconcentration Amount exceeding zero;


o if the aggregate number of Additional Accounts selected to have their
receivables transferred to the issuance trust exceeds the Addition Limit,
satisfaction of the Rating Agency Condition with respect to the proposed
addition and delivery by the transferor to each rating agency an opinion
of counsel to the effect that the transfer and servicing agreement
creates in favor of the indenture trustee a security interest in the
rights of the transferor in the receivables arising in those Additional
Accounts; and


o with respect to the transfer of additional collateral certificates to the
issuance trust, satisfaction of the Rating Agency Condition with respect
to the proposed transfer.


In addition to the periodic reports otherwise required to be filed by the
servicer with the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended,
the servicer intends to file, on behalf of the issuing entity a Report on
Form 8-K with respect to any addition to the issuance trust of receivables in
Additional Accounts or additional collateral certificates that would have a
material effect on the composition of the issuing entity's assets.



REMOVAL OF ASSETS



The transferor (without independent verification of its authority) may, but
will not be obligated to, designate accounts and the receivables arising under
those accounts for removal from the issuance trust. The removal could occur
for a number of reasons, including a determination by the transferor that the
issuance trust contains more receivables than the transferor is obligated to
retain in the issuance trust under the transfer and servicing agreement or a
determination that the transferor does not desire to obtain additional
financing through the issuance trust at such time. As long as the removal of
accounts from the issuance trust satisfies the conditions listed below, the
removed accounts may, individually or in the aggregate, be of a higher credit
quality than the accounts that remain in the issuance trust. In connection
with such a removal, the indenture trustee will be required to transfer all
receivables in those removed accounts back to the transferor, whether the
receivables already exist or arise after the designation.


The transferor's rights to removal are subject to the satisfaction of
several conditions listed in the transfer and servicing agreement, including:


o delivery to the owner trustee and the indenture trustee for execution of
a written reassignment of receivables in the removed accounts;


89





o delivery on the required delivery date to the indenture trustee of a
computer file or microfiche list containing a true and complete list of
all removed accounts;


o satisfaction of the Rating Agency Condition with respect to such removal;
and


o delivery by the issuing entity to the owner trustee and the indenture
trustee of a certificate of an authorized officer to the effect that, in
the reasonable belief of the issuing entity,


(i) no selection procedure believed to be materially adverse to, or
materially beneficial to, the interests of the noteholders of any series,
class or tranche of notes was utilized in selecting the removed accounts;
and


(ii) such removal will not have a material adverse effect on any
outstanding series, class or tranche of notes.


In any Monthly Period, there may be more than one removal of assets. In
addition, the accounts designated to be removed from the issuing entity's
Portfolio need not be selected randomly by the transferor.



DISCOUNT OPTION



The transfer and servicing agreement provides that the transferor may at any
time and from time to time designate a fixed or variable percentage, referred
to as the Discount Option Percentage, of the amount of receivables existing
and arising in all or any specified portion of the accounts in the issuing
entity's Portfolio on and after the date of such designation becomes effective
to be deemed Discount Option Receivables and treated as finance charge
receivables and collections received with respect to such receivables are
treated as Finance Charge Collections.


The receivables generated in the accounts included in the issuing entity's
Portfolio generally are not subject to monthly finance charge assessments. As
a result, in order to provide yield to the issuance trust with respect to
those receivables, the transferor has designated an initial Discount Option
Percentage of 3%. Therefore, 3% of those receivables will be deemed Discount
Option Receivables and treated as finance charge receivables and collections
received with respect to such receivables are treated as Finance Charge
Collections. The remainder of such receivables are treated as principal
receivables and collections received with respect to those receivables are
treated as Principal Collections.


The existence of Discount Option Receivables results in an increase in the
amount of finance charge receivables and Finance Charge Collections, a
reduction in the amount of principal receivables and Principal Collections and
a reduction in the Transferor Amount. See "Risk Factors--A change in the
discount option percentage may result in the payment of principal earlier or
later than expected" in this prospectus.


The aggregate amount of Discount Option Receivables outstanding on any Date
of Processing equals (i) the aggregate Discount Option Receivables at the end
of the prior Date of Processing, plus (ii) any new Discount Option Receivables
created on such Date of Processing, minus (iii) any Discount Option
Receivables Collections received on such Date of Processing. Discount Option
Receivables created on any Date of Processing will mean the product of the
amount of any Receivables created on such Date of Processing and the
applicable Discount Option Percentage.


90





After any designation of a Discount Option Percentage, pursuant to the
transfer and servicing agreement, the transferor may, without notice to or
consent of the holders of any series, class or tranche of notes, from time to
time increase, reduce or withdraw the Discount Option Percentage. The
transferor must provide 30 days prior written notice to the servicer, the
owner trustee, the indenture trustee and each rating agency of any such
designation or increase, reduction or withdrawal. Such designation or
increase, reduction or withdrawal will become effective on the date specified
therein only if:


o the transferor delivers to the owner trustee and the indenture trustee a
certificate of an authorized officer of that transferor to the effect
that, based on the facts known to that transferor at the time, such
designation or increase, reduction or withdrawal will not at the time of
its occurrence cause an early amortization event or event of default or
an event that, with notice or the lapse of time or both, would constitute
an early amortization event or event of default, to occur with respect to
any series, class or tranche of notes;


o the Rating Agency Condition is satisfied with respect to such designation
or increase, reduction or withdrawal; and


o the transferor will have delivered to the owner trustee and the indenture
trustee an Issuer Tax Opinion.



ISSUING ENTITY ACCOUNTS



The issuing entity has established issuing entity trust accounts. The
issuing entity has established a collection account for the purpose of
receiving collections on the receivables included in the issuance trust and
collections on any other assets in the issuance trust, including collections
on any collateral certificates that are included in the issuance trust at a
later date.


The issuing entity also has established an overconcentration account for the
purpose of holding Principal Collections that would otherwise be paid to the
holder of the transferor interest at a time when the Commercial Obligor
Overconcentration Amount is greater than zero and the Available
Overconcentration Account Amount is, or as a result of a payment would become,
less than the Required Overconcentration Account Amount.


In addition, the issuing entity has established an excess funding account
for the purpose of holding Principal Collections that would otherwise be paid
to the holder of the transferor interest at a time when (i) the Transferor
Amount is, or as a result of a payment would become, less than the Required
Transferor Amount or (ii) the Pool Balance is, or as a result of a payment
would become, less than the Required Pool Balance.


If so specified in the related prospectus supplement, the issuing entity may
establish additional issuing entity accounts, referred to as supplemental
accounts, for any series, class or tranche of notes.


The supplemental accounts described in this section are referred to as
issuing entity accounts. Issuing entity accounts are Eligible Deposit Accounts
and amounts maintained in issuing entity accounts may only be invested by the
indenture trustee at the written direction of the issuing entity, without
independent verification of its authority, in Eligible Investments. Each
issuing entity account currently is maintained at The Bank of New York. If at
any time


91





an issuing entity account ceases to be an Eligible Deposit Account, that
issuing entity account must be moved so that it will again be qualified as an
Eligible Deposit Account.


Each month, payments in respect of the receivables and, to the extent a
collateral certificate is included in the issuance trust, distributions on
such collateral certificate will be deposited into the collection account, and
then allocated to each series of notes, and then allocated to the applicable
series principal funding account, the accumulation reserve account, the Class
C reserve account, if applicable, and any other supplemental account, to make
payments under any applicable derivative agreements and additionally as
specified in the related prospectus supplement.



DERIVATIVE AGREEMENTS



A series, class or tranche of notes may have the benefit of one or more
derivative agreements, which may be a currency swap, interest rate swap, a
cap, a collar or a guaranteed investment contract with various counterparties.
In general, the issuing entity will receive payments from counterparties to
the derivative agreements in exchange for the issuing entity's payments to
them, to the extent required under the derivative agreements. The specific
terms of any derivative agreement applicable to a series, class or tranche of
notes and a description of the related counterparty will be included in the
related prospectus supplement. Centurion, FSB or TRS or any of their
affiliates may be counterparties to a derivative agreement.


[If a series, class or tranche of notes has the benefit of a derivative
agreement, provide information comtemplated in Item 1115(a) of Regulation AB.]


[If the aggregate significance percentage related to any entity or group of
affiliated entities providing derivative instruments is 10% or more, but less
than 20%, provide information contemplated in Item 1115(b)(1) of Regulation
AB.]


[If the aggregate significance percentage related to any entity or group of
affiliated entities providing derivative instruments is 20% or more, provide
information contemplated in Item 1115(b)(2) of Regulation AB.]



SUPPLEMENTAL CREDIT ENHANCEMENT AGREEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTAL LIQUIDITY
AGREEMENTS



A series, class or tranche of notes may have the benefit of one or more
additional forms of supplemental credit enhancement--referred to herein as
supplemental credit enhancement agreements--such as a letter of credit or
surety bond. In addition, a series, class or tranche of notes may have the
benefit of one or more forms of supplemental liquidity agreements--referred to
herein as supplemental liquidity agreements--such as a liquidity facility. The
specific terms of any supplemental credit enhancement agreement or
supplemental liquidity agreement applicable to a series, class or tranche of
notes and a description of the related provider will be included in the
related prospectus supplement. TRS, Centurion, FSB or any of their affiliates
may be providers of any supplemental credit enhancement agreement or
supplemental liquidity agreement.


[If an entity or group of affiliated entities providing credit enhancement
will be liable or contingently liable for payments representing 10% or more,
but less than 20%, of the cash flow supporting any offered class, provide
information contemplated in Item 1114(b)(1) and (b)(2)(ii) of Regulation AB.]


92





[If an entity or group of affiliated entities providing credit enhancement
will be liable or contingently liable for payments representing 20% or more of
the cash flow supporting any offered class, provide information contemplated
in Item 1114(b)(1) and (b)(2)(ii) of Regulation AB.]



SALE OF ASSETS



Assets in the issuance trust may be sold following (i) an event of default
and acceleration of a series, class or tranche of notes and (ii) the legal
maturity date for a series, class or tranche of notes. See "The
Indenture--Events of Default" in this prospectus.


If an event of default occurs and a series, class or tranche of notes is
accelerated before its legal maturity date, the issuer may sell assets if the
conditions described in "The Indenture--Events of Default" and "--Events of
Default Remedies" in this prospectus are satisfied and, with respect to
subordinated notes of a multiple tranche series, only to the extent that
payment is permitted by the subordination provisions of the senior notes of
that series. This sale will take place at the option of the indenture trustee
or at the direction of the holders of more than 66 2/3% of the outstanding
dollar principal amount of the notes of the affected series, class or tranche.


Any sale of assets in the issuance trust for a tranche of subordinated notes
of a multiple tranche series may be delayed for that tranche but not beyond
the legal maturity date of that tranche if repayment would result in
insufficient enhancement being available for the senior notes of that series
until (i) the senior notes are prefunded sufficiently, (ii) enough senior
notes are repaid, or (iii) new subordinated notes have been issued and, as a
result, the tranche of subordinated notes is no longer needed to provide the
required subordination for the senior notes of that series. In a multiple
tranche series, if a tranche of senior notes directs a sale of assets in the
issuance trust, then after the sale, that tranche will no longer be entitled
to subordination from subordinated notes of that series.


If the Nominal Liquidation Amount of a series, class or tranche of notes is
greater than zero on the legal maturity date of that series, class or tranche,
after giving effect to any allocations, deposits and payments to be made on
such date, the sale of assets in the issuance trust will take place no later
than seven Business Days following the legal maturity date of that series,
class or tranche. In a multiple tranche series, this sale of assets will take
place regardless of the subordination requirements of any senior notes of that
series. Proceeds from the sale, amounts on deposit in the issuing entity
accounts for that series, class or tranche and any other amounts available to
such noteholders will be immediately paid to the noteholders of that series,
class or tranche.


The principal amount of assets designated for sale will be an amount not to
exceed (i) the Nominal Liquidation Amount of the related series, class or
tranche of notes plus (ii) the product of the Nominal Liquidation Amount of
the related series, class or tranche of notes and the Discount Option
Percentage.


The Nominal Liquidation Amount of that series, class or tranche of notes
will be reduced to zero upon such sale even if the proceeds of that sale,
amounts on deposit in issuing entity accounts for that series, class or
tranche and any other amounts available to such noteholders are not enough to
pay all remaining amounts due on those notes. After such sale, Principal
Collections and Finance Charge Collections will no longer be allocated to that
series, class or


93





tranche of notes. The notes of that series, class or tranche will be
considered to be paid in full and the holders of that series, class or tranche
of notes will have no further right or claim and the issuing entity will have
no further obligation or liability for principal of and interest on those
notes. Noteholders of that series, class or tranche will receive the proceeds
of the sale in an amount not to exceed the outstanding dollar principal amount
of their notes, plus any accrued, past due and additional interest on such
notes. The notes of that series, class or tranche will no longer be
outstanding under the indenture (or any supplement thereto) once the sale
occurs.


After giving effect to a sale of assets in the issuance trust for a series,
class or tranche of notes, the amount of proceeds and other amounts on deposit
in the issuing entity accounts for that series, class or tranche may be less
than the outstanding dollar principal amount of that series, class or tranche.
This deficiency can arise due to unreimbursed reductions in the Nominal
Liquidation Amount of that series, class or tranche or if the sale price for
the assets was less than the outstanding dollar principal amount of that
series, class or tranche. These types of deficiencies will not be reimbursed.



REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES



The transferor will make several representations and warranties to the
issuing entity in the transfer and servicing agreement.



REGARDING NO CONFLICT



The transferor will make certain representations and warranties to the
issuing entity in the transfer and servicing agreement to the effect that,
among other things, as of each issuance date of a series, class or tranche of
notes:


o the execution and delivery by the transferor of the transfer and
servicing agreement, the receivables purchase agreement and each other
document relating to the issuance to which it is a party will not
conflict with any law or any other agreement to which the transferor is a
party; and


o all required governmental approvals in connection with the execution and
delivery by the transferor of the transfer and servicing agreement and
each other document relating to the issuance have been obtained and
remain in force and effect.



REGARDING ENFORCEABILITY



The transferor will make certain representations and warranties to the
issuing entity in the transfer and servicing agreement to the effect that,
among other things:


o as of each issuance date of a series, class or tranche of notes, the
transferor is validly existing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its
organization and has the authority to consummate the issuance;


o as of (i) each issuance date of a series, class or tranche of notes, (ii)
each date Additional Accounts are designated and their receivables
transferred to the issuance trust or one or more additional collateral
certificates are transferred to the issuance trust and (iii) each date
the Invested Amount of an existing collateral certificate included in the
issuance trust is increased, the transfer and servicing agreement and
each other


94





document relating to the issuance to which it is a party constitutes a
legal, valid and binding obligation enforceable against the transferor;
and


o as of (i) each issuance date of a series, class or tranche of notes and

(ii) each date Additional Accounts are designated and their receivables
transferred to the issuance trust or one or more additional collateral
certificates are transferred to the issuance trust, the issuing entity
has all right, title and interest in the receivables and any collateral
certificates transferred to the issuance trust by the transferor or has a
first priority perfected security interest (as defined in the applicable
UCC) in these receivables and any collateral certificates.


In the event of a material breach of any of the representations and
warranties described in the above paragraphs that has a material adverse
effect on the noteholders' interest in the receivables or collateral
certificates or the availability of the proceeds thereof to the issuing entity
(which determination will be made without regard to whether funds are then
available pursuant to any supplemental credit enhancement), either the
indenture trustee or holders of notes evidencing more than 50% of the
outstanding dollar principal amount of all notes, by written notice to the
transferor, the administrator and the servicer (and to the owner trustee and
the indenture trustee if given by such noteholders), may direct the transferor
to accept the reassignment of the receivables or the collateral certificates
included in the issuance trust within 60 days of such notice, or within such
longer period specified in such notice. The related transferor will be
obligated to accept the reassignment of such receivables or collateral
certificates on the First Note Transfer Date following the Monthly Period in
which such reassignment obligation arises. Such reassignment will not be
required to be made, however, if on any day during such applicable period, the
relevant representation and warranty shall then be true and correct in all
material respects.


The price for such reassignment will be the Reassignment Amount. On the
First Note Transfer Date following the Monthly Period in which such
reassignment obligation arises, the applicable transferor will deposit the
portion of the Reassignment Amount attributable to the applicable notes in the
collection account to be treated as Principal Collections or Finance Charge
Collections. The payment of such Reassignment Amount in immediately available
funds will be considered a payment in full of the noteholders' interest and
such funds will be distributed upon presentation and surrender of the related
notes. If the indenture trustee or holders of notes give a notice as provided
above, the obligation of the transferors to make any such deposit will
constitute the sole remedy respecting a breach of the representations and
warranties available to those noteholders or the indenture trustee on behalf
of those noteholders.


On each issuance date of a series, class or tranche of notes, the indenture
trustee will authenticate and deliver one or more notes representing that
series, class or tranche, in each case against payment to the transferor of
the net proceeds of the sale of the notes. In the case of the issuance date
for the first series of notes, the indenture trustee will register in the
issuing entity's books and records the uncertificated interests of the
transferor in the Transferor Amount.


In connection with each transfer of receivables to the issuance trust, the
computer records relating to such receivables will be marked to indicate that
those receivables have been conveyed to the issuance trust. In addition, the
issuing entity and the indenture trustee will be


95





provided with a computer file or a microfiche list containing a true and
complete list showing for each account, as of the applicable date of
designation, its account number and the aggregate amount of receivables in
such account. In connection with each transfer of a collateral certificate to
the issuance trust, the official records of the transferor will be marked to
indicate that such collateral certificate has been transferred to the issuance
trust and the issuing entity and the indenture trustee will be provided with a
list showing each collateral certificate transferred to the issuance trust.


The transferor will retain and will not deliver to the indenture trustee any
other records or agreements relating to the accounts, the receivables or any
collateral certificates. Except as set forth above, the records and agreements
relating to the accounts, the receivables and any collateral certificates will
not be segregated from those relating to other accounts, receivables or
collateral certificates, and the physical documentation relating to the
accounts, receivables or collateral certificates will not be stamped or marked
to reflect the transfer to the transferor or the issuance trust. The
transferor has filed and is required to file UCC financing statements for the
transfer of the receivables or collateral certificates to the issuance trust
meeting the requirements of applicable state law. See "Certain Legal Aspects
of the Receivables" in this prospectus.



REGARDING THE ACCOUNTS, THE RECEIVABLES AND THE COLLATERAL CERTIFICATES



Under the transfer and servicing agreement, the transferor makes
representations and warranties to the issuer to the effect that, among other
things:


o as of each applicable date on which an account is selected to be included
in the issuing entity's Portfolio, referred to in this prospectus and the
related prospectus supplement as the selection date, each account was an
Eligible Account;


o as of each applicable selection date, each of the receivables then
existing in the accounts was an Eligible Receivable;


o as of the date of creation of any new receivable, such receivable is an
Eligible Receivable; and


o as of each date on which a collateral certificate is transferred to the
issuance trust, such collateral certificate is an Eligible Collateral
Certificate.


If the transferor materially breaches any representation and warranty
described in this paragraph, and such breach remains uncured for 60 days (or
such longer period, not in excess of 120 days, as to which the servicer and
the indenture trustee agree) after the earlier to occur of the discovery of
the breach by the transferor and receipt of written notice of the breach by
the transferor, and the breach has a material adverse effect on any
noteholders' interest in that receivable or collateral certificate, all of the
Ineligible Receivables or Ineligible Collateral Certificates will be
reassigned to the transferor on the terms and conditions set forth below. In
such case, the Ineligible Receivable or the Ineligible Collateral Certificate,
as applicable, will no longer be included as part of the issuing entity's
assets and the account related to the Ineligible Receivable will no longer be
included in the issuing entity's Portfolio.


An Ineligible Receivable will be reassigned to the related transferor on or
before the Monthly Period in which such reassignment obligation arises by the
servicer deducting the portion of such Ineligible Receivable that is a
principal receivable from the aggregate amount


96





of principal receivables used to calculate the Transferor Amount and the Pool
Balance. An Ineligible Collateral Certificate shall be delivered by the
indenture trustee to the transferor with a valid assignment in the name of the
transferor, and the servicer will deduct the Invested Amount of each such
Ineligible Collateral Certificate from the Transferor Amount and the Pool
Balance. In the event that the exclusion of an Ineligible Receivable or an
Ineligible Collateral Certificate from the calculation of the Transferor
Amount or the Pool Balance would cause the Transferor Amount to be reduced
below the Required Transferor Amount or the Pool Balance to be reduced below
the Required Pool Balance, on the first payment date following the Monthly
Period in which such reassignment obligation arises, the transferor will make
a deposit in the excess funding account in immediately available funds in an
amount equal to the greater of the amount by which (x) the Transferor Amount
would be reduced below the Required Transferor Amount or (y) the Pool Balance
would be reduced below the Required Pool Balance.


The reassignment of any Ineligible Receivable or Ineligible Collateral
Certificate to the transferor, and the obligation of the transferor to make
deposits into the excess funding account as described in the preceding
paragraph, is the sole remedy respecting any breach of the representations and
warranties described in the preceding paragraphs with respect to such
receivable or collateral certificate available to the holder of notes or the
indenture trustee on behalf of those noteholders.



ADDITIONAL REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES IN THE PROSPECTUS SUPPLEMENT



The accompanying prospectus supplement may specify additional
representations and warranties made by the transferor when your notes are
issued. It is not required or anticipated that the indenture trustee will make
any initial or periodic general examination of the receivables or collateral
certificates or any records relating to the receivables or collateral
certificates for the purpose of establishing the presence or absence of
defects, the compliance by the transferor of its representations and
warranties or for any other purpose. In addition, it is not anticipated or
required that the indenture trustee will make any initial or periodic general
examination of the servicer for the purpose of establishing the compliance by
the servicer with its representations or warranties or the performance by the
servicer of its obligations under the transfer and servicing agreement or for
any other purpose. The servicer, however, will deliver to the indenture
trustee on or before March 31 of each calendar year an opinion of counsel with
respect to the validity of the interest of the indenture trustee in and to the
receivables, any collateral certificates and certain other assets of the
issuer.



CERTAIN MATTERS REGARDING THE SERVICER AND THE ADMINISTRATOR OF THE ISSUANCE
TRUST



TRS will service the receivables arising in the portfolios of consumer,
small business and corporate accounts owned by TRS, Centurion, FSB or any of
their affiliates, which are included in the issuance trust pursuant to the
transfer and servicing agreement. As compensation for the performance of its
obligations as servicer and as reimbursement for its expenses related thereto,
TRS will be entitled to a servicing fee in the amounts and at the times
specified in the related prospectus supplement.


The servicer may not resign from its obligations and duties under the
transfer and servicing agreement except:


97





(i)     upon determination that the performance of such obligations and
duties is no longer permissible under applicable law, or


(ii)    if such obligations and duties are assumed by an entity that has
satisfied the Rating Agency Condition.


No such resignation will be come effective until the indenture trustee or a
successor to the servicer has assumed the servicer's obligations and duties
under the transfer and servicing agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
servicer may assign part or all of its obligations and duties as servicer
under the transfer and servicing agreement if such assignment satisfies the
Rating Agency Condition.


Any person into which, in accordance with the transfer and servicing
agreement, the servicer may be merged or consolidated or any person resulting
from any merger or consolidation to which the servicer is a party, or any
person succeeding to the business of the servicer, will be the successor to
the servicer under the transfer and servicing agreement.


In addition, TRS or any of its affiliates will be the administrator of the
issuing entity and will agree, to the extent provided in the transfer and
servicing agreement, to provide notices and to perform on behalf of the
issuing entity all administrative obligations required by the indenture and as
described in the transfer and servicing agreement. As compensation for its
performance of the administrator's obligations under the transfer and
servicing agreement, the administrator will be entitled to a monthly fee not
to exceed $5,000, in addition to reimbursement for its liabilities and extra
out-of-pocket expenses related to its performance of the administrator's
obligations, to be paid by the transferor.



SERVICER COVENANTS



In the transfer and servicing agreement, the servicer has agreed that, as to
the receivables included in the issuance trust and the related accounts
designated to be included in the issuing entity's Portfolio, it will:


o duly satisfy all obligations on its part to be fulfilled under or in
connection with the receivables or the related accounts, and will
maintain in effect all qualifications required in order to service the
receivables or accounts, the failure to comply with which would have a
material adverse effect on the noteholders of any series, class or
tranche of notes;


o not authorize any rescission or cancellation of the receivables or any
collateral certificate, except as ordered by a court of competent
jurisdiction or other governmental authority;


o take no action to impair the rights of the issuing entity, the indenture
trustee or the noteholders of any series, class or tranche of notes in
the receivables or any collateral certificate; and


o not reschedule, revise or defer payments due on the receivables, except
in accordance with its guidelines for servicing receivables; and


o except in connection with its enforcement or collection of an account,
take no action to cause any receivables to be evidenced by any instrument
(as defined in the UCC) and, if


98





any receivable is so evidenced as a result of the servicer's action, it
shall be deemed to be an Ineligible Receivable and shall be assigned to
the servicer as provided below.


Under the terms of the transfer and servicing agreement, in the event any of
the representations, warranties or covenants of the servicer contained in the
clauses above is breached, and such breach has a material adverse effect on
the indenture trustee's or the issuing entity's interest in such receivable or
collateral certificate, as applicable and is not cured within 60 days (or such
longer period, not in excess of 150 days, as may be agreed to by the indenture
trustee and the transferor) from the earlier to occur of the discovery of such
event by the servicer, or receipt by the servicer of written notice of such
event given by the transferor or the indenture trustee, then all receivables
in the account or accounts or each collateral certificate to which such event
relates shall be assigned to the servicer on the terms and conditions set
forth below; provided, however, that such receivables will not be assigned to
the servicer if, on any day prior to the end of such 60-day or longer period:


o the relevant representation and warranty shall be true and correct, or
the relevant covenant shall have been complied with, in all material
respects, and


o the servicer shall have delivered to the transferor and the indenture
trustee an officer's certificate describing the nature of such breach and
the manner in which such breach was cured.


Such assignment and transfer will be made when the servicer deposits an
amount equal to the amount of such receivables or the Invested Amount of such
collateral certificate in the collection account on the First Note Transfer
Date following the Monthly Period during which such obligation arises. This
reassignment or transfer and assignment to the servicer constitutes the sole
remedy available to the noteholders of any series, class or tranche of notes
if such representation, warranty or covenant of the servicer is not satisfied
and the interest of the indenture trustee in any such reassigned receivables
shall be automatically assigned to the servicer.



SERVICER DEFAULT



In the event of any Servicer Default, either the indenture trustee or
noteholders evidencing more than 50% of the aggregate outstanding dollar
principal amount of all affected series of notes, by written notice to the
servicer and the owner trustee (and to the indenture trustee if given by the
noteholders) may terminate all of the rights and obligations of the servicer,
as servicer, under the transfer and servicing agreement. The indenture trustee
will appoint a new servicer. Any such termination and appointment is called a
service transfer. If the only Servicer Default is bankruptcy-, insolvency-,
receivership- or conservatorship-related, however, the bankruptcy trustee, the
receiver or the conservator for the servicer or the servicer itself as debtor-
in-possession may have the power to prevent the indenture trustee or
noteholders from appointing a successor servicer. See "Risk
Factors--Regulatory action could result in losses" in this prospectus.


The rights and interests of the transferor under the transfer and servicing
agreement and in the transferor interest will not be affected by any
termination notice or service transfer. If the indenture trustee within 60
days of receipt of a termination notice does not receive any bids from
eligible servicers and the servicer delivers an officer's certificate to the
effect that the servicer cannot in good faith cure the Servicer Default that
gave rise to the termination notice,


99





then the indenture trustee shall, except when the Servicer Default is caused
by the occurrence of certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency, conservatorship
or receivership of the servicer, offer the transferor a right of first refusal
to purchase the noteholders' interest for all series of notes. This right of
first refusal may be exercised by the transferor on the First Note Transfer
Date in the next calendar month. The purchase price for the noteholders'
interest will be equal to the sum of the amounts specified therefor for each
outstanding series of notes in the related prospectus supplements and, for any
notes offered hereby, in such prospectus supplement.


The indenture trustee shall, as promptly as possible appoint a successor
servicer. The successor servicer may be Centurion, FSB, the indenture trustee
or an entity which, at the time of its appointment as successor servicer, (1)
services a portfolio of charge or credit accounts, (2) is legally qualified
and has the capacity to service the issuing entity's Portfolio, (3) has, in
the sole determination of the indenture trustee, demonstrated the ability to
service professionally and competently a portfolio of similar accounts in
accordance with high standards of skill and care, (4) is qualified to use the
software that is then being used to service the accounts or obtains the right
to use or has its own software which is adequate to perform its duties under
the transfer and servicing agreement and other securitization agreements and

(5) has a net worth of at least $50,000,000 as of the end of its most recent
fiscal quarter.  The successor servicer shall accept its appointment by
written instrument acceptable to the indenture trustee. The successor servicer
is entitled to compensation out of collections; however, that compensation
will not be in excess of the servicing fee. See the related prospectus
supplement for a discussion of the monthly servicing fee. Because TRS, as
servicer, has significant responsibilities with respect to the servicing of
the receivables, the indenture trustee may have difficulty finding a suitable
successor servicer. Potential successor servicers may not have the capacity to
perform adequately the duties required of a successor servicer or may not be
willing to perform such duties for the amount of the servicing fee currently
payable under the applicable indenture supplement. If no successor servicer
has been appointed by the indenture trustee and has accepted such appointment
by the time the servicer ceases to act as servicer, all rights, authority,
power and obligations of the servicer under the transfer and servicing
agreement shall pass to and be vested in the indenture trustee. The Bank of
New York, the indenture trustee, does not have credit or charge card
operations. If The Bank of New York is automatically appointed as successor
servicer, it may not have the capacity to perform the duties required of a
successor servicer and current servicing compensation under the applicable
indenture supplement may not be sufficient to cover its actual costs and
expenses of servicing the receivables. Prior to any appointment of a successor
servicer, the indenture trustee will seek to obtain bids from potential
servicers meeting certain eligibility requirements set forth in the transfer
and servicing agreement to serve as a successor servicer of servicing
compensation not in excess of the servicing fee plus any amounts payable to
the holder of the transferor interest pursuant to the transfer and servicing
agreement. If the indenture trustee is legally unable to act as servicer, it
will petition a court of competent jurisdiction to appoint any established
institution qualifying as an eligible servicer as the successor servicer under
the transfer and servicing agreement. The indenture trustee will notify each
rating agency that has rated any outstanding series, class or tranche of
notes, the transferor and the administrator upon the removal of the servicer
and upon the appointment of a successor servicer.

EVIDENCE AS TO COMPLIANCE



The fiscal year for the issuance trust will end on December 31 of each year.
The servicer will file with the SEC an annual report on Form 10-K on behalf of
the issuance trust 90 days after the end of its fiscal year.


The servicer will deliver to the indenture trustee and, if required, file
with the SEC as part of an annual report on Form 10-K filed on behalf of the
issuance trust, the following documents:


o a report regarding its assessment of compliance during the preceding
fiscal year with all applicable servicing criteria set forth in relevant
SEC regulations with respect to asset-backed securities transactions
taken as a whole involving the servicer that are backed by the same types
of assets as those backing the notes;


o with respect to each assessment report described immediately above, a
report by a registered public accounting firm that attests to, and
reports on, the assessment made by the asserting party, as set forth in
relevant SEC regulations; and


o a servicer compliance certificate, signed by an authorized officer of the
servicer, to the effect that:


(i) a review of the servicer's activities during the reporting period
and of its performance under the transfer and servicing agreement has been
made under such officer's supervision.


(ii) to the best of such officer's knowledge, based on such review, the
servicer has fulfilled all of its obligations under the transfer and
servicing agreement in all material respects throughout the reporting
period or, if there has been a failure to fulfill any such obligation in
any material respect, specifying each such failure known to such officer
and the nature and status thereof.


The servicer's obligation to deliver any servicing assessment report or
attestation report and, if required, to file the same with the SEC, is limited
to those reports prepared by the servicer and, in the case of reports prepared
by any other party, those reports actually received by the servicer.


Copies of all certificates and reports furnished to the indenture trustee
may be obtained by a request in writing delivered to the indenture trustee.
Except as described above or as described in this prospectus or the related
prospectus supplement, there will not be any independent verification that any
duty or obligation to be performed by any transaction party - including the
servicer - has been performed by that party.





INDEMNIFICATION



The transfer and servicing agreement provides that the servicer will
indemnify the transferor, the issuing entity, the owner trustee and the
indenture trustee from and against any loss, liability, expense, damage or
injury suffered or sustained arising out of certain of the servicer's actions
or omissions with respect to the issuing entity pursuant to the transfer and
servicing agreement. The servicer will also indemnify the issuing entity, the
owner trustee and the indenture trustee from and against any loss, liability,
expense, damage or injury suffered or


101





sustained arising out of the administration of the issuance trust by the owner
trustee pursuant to the transfer and servicing agreement.


Except as provided in the preceding paragraph, the transfer and servicing
agreement provides that neither the transferor nor the servicer nor any of
their respective directors, officers, employees, members or agents will be
under any other liability to the issuing entity, the owner trustee, the
indenture trustee, the noteholders, any provider of supplemental credit
enhancement or any other person for any action taken, or for refraining from
taking any action, in good faith pursuant to the transfer and servicing
agreement. However, neither the transferor nor the servicer will be protected
against any liability which would otherwise be imposed by reason of willful
misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence of the transferor, the servicer or
any such person in the performance of their duties or by reason of reckless
disregard of their obligations and duties thereunder.


In addition, the transfer and servicing agreement provides that the servicer
is not under any obligation to appear in, prosecute or defend any legal action
which is not incidental to its servicing responsibilities under the transfer
and servicing agreement. The servicer may, in its sole discretion, undertake
any such legal action which it may deem necessary or desirable for the benefit
of noteholders with respect to the transfer and servicing agreement and the
rights and duties of the parties thereto and the interests of the noteholders
thereunder.



COLLECTION AND OTHER SERVICING PROCEDURES



TRS has been servicing charge card accounts and credit card accounts since
American Express began offering such accounts in 1958 and 1987, respectively.
TRS has been the servicer for the issuance trust since the issuance trust's
formation in May 2005. It has been servicing securitized credit card
receivables since 1996 in its capacity as the servicer of the American Express
Credit Account Master Trust. See "TRS, Centurion, FSB, RFC V and Credco" in
this prospectus. TRS currently is the servicer of the American Express Credit
Account Master Trust and, in the future, may be the servicer of other master
trusts or other securitization special purpose entities.


Pursuant to the transfer and servicing agreement, the servicer, whether
acting itself or through one or more subservicers, is responsible for
servicing, collecting, enforcing and administering the receivables in
accordance with customary and usual procedures for servicing similar credit or
charge receivables.


Servicing activities to be performed by the servicer include collecting and
recording payments, communicating with accountholders, investigating payment
delinquencies, providing billing and tax records to accountholders and
maintaining internal records with respect to each account. Managerial and
custodial services performed by the servicer on behalf of the issuing entity
include providing assistance in any inspections of the documents and records
relating to the accounts and receivables by the indenture trustee pursuant to
the transfer and servicing agreement, maintaining the agreements, documents
and files relating to the accounts and receivables as custodian for the
issuing entity and providing related data processing and reporting services
for noteholders and on behalf of the indenture trustee.


If TRS were to become a debtor in a bankruptcy case, a Servicer Default
would occur and TRS could be removed as servicer for the issuance trust and a
successor servicer would be


102





appointed.  See "Sources of Funds to Pay the Notes--Servicer Default" in this
prospectus for more information regarding the appointment of a successor
servicer.



OUTSOURCING OF SERVICING



Pursuant to the transfer and servicing agreement, TRS, as servicer, has the
right to delegate or outsource its duties as servicer to any person who agrees
to conduct such duties in accordance with the transfer and servicing
agreement, the applicable account guidelines and the applicable account
agreements.  TRS has outsourced certain of its servicing functions by
contracting with affiliated and unaffiliated third parties. Pursuant to a sub-
servicing agreement, TRS has contracted with Amex Card Services Company, a
Delaware corporation that is a wholly owned subsidiary of TRS, to act as
subservicer and to perform certain servicing activities consisting of credit
authorization, card fulfillment and replacement, credit operations and
collections, customer service and operation of telephone service centers,
fraud services, customer billing and remittance processing. Amex Card Services
Company also provides these services with respect to receivables that have not
been not securitized through the issuing entity. TRS also has contracted with
Centurion and FSB to perform certain limited servicing functions with respect
to the receivables arising in the accounts owned by each of Centurion and FSB,
consisting of collecting and depositing (or causing to be deposited) into the
collection account payments received in respect of such receivables and, when
appropriate, charging off as uncollectible such receivables.


The performance of certain servicing functions has been outsourced by TRS
and its affiliates to third party vendors. Functions that are performed by
outside vendors include card production and fulfillment, card replacement,
contacting customers to collect delinquent and charged-off balances,
responding to telephone service center inquiries, front end processing of
customer disputes, data entry and imaging and remittance processing. Among
other functions, TRS and its affiliates identify areas of risk, design,
develop and implement models to minimize financial exposure and maximize
customer spending, develop credit underwriting policies and procedures,
underwrite and re-underwrite accounts and formulate risk management and credit
criteria. The logic and rules inherent in the systems used by outside vendors
to route customer inquiries and to make decisions about accounts are developed
by TRS and its affiliates. Third party vendors are required to follow detailed
account management procedures and policies of TRS in connection with any
decisions made with respect to accounts with respect to which they provide
services. TRS and its affiliates regularly audit and assess the performance of
third party vendors to measure vendor quality and compliance. All third party
vendors are required to comply with the account originators' security and
information protection requirements. Decisions to retain a third party vendor
are based on cost, the ability of third parties to provide greater flexibility
to TRS and its affiliates, experience, financial stability and various other
factors.



Regulus West LLC



TRS' proprietary facilities conduct paper payment remittance processing
services. Since 1999, Regulus West LLC, a Delaware limited liability company,
also has performed paper payment remittance processing services pursuant to an
agreement with TRS. Regulus provides these services at three locations in the
United States. Regulus also provides disaster recovery services to TRS. As a
remittance processor, Regulus is responsible for, among other services,
transmitting payment information to TRS, which TRS in turn uses to update its
obligor

records. Regulus also is responsible for encoding and processing the
remittance checks received by TRS at these locations. Regulus is required to
perform the services in accordance with service levels and procedures
prescribed by TRS, and TRS regularly monitors Regulus' performance and
compliance with TRS' standards. Regulus may not subcontract any of its duties
to any third party without the prior consent of TRS, which TRS may withhold in
its sole discretion. TRS has also reserved the right to perform for itself or
have a third party perform any of the services performed by Regulus. Regulus
West LLC is a wholly owned subsidiary of Regulus Group LLC, a remittance
processing and print distribution company founded in 1995 and headquartered in
Napa, California. Regulus has provided remittance processing services to
banks, credit card issuers, telecommunications carriers, utilities and
insurance companies since its formation. Regulus is one of the largest retail
remittance processors in the United States, processing more than 45 million
payments per month.


In connection with the remittance processing conducted by TRS at its
proprietary facility, TRS also has outsourced to a vendor in India the
responsibility to manually review and balance paper remittances that cannot be
handled by TRS' automatic payment matching equipment.


Notwithstanding any such delegation or outsourcing, TRS will continue to be
liable for all of its obligations as servicer under the transfer and servicing
agreement. In certain circumstances, however, TRS could be relieved of its
duties as servicer upon the assumption of such duties by another entity. See
"--Merger or Consolidation of the Transferor or the Servicer" and "Sources of
Funds to Pay the Notes--Servicer Default" in this prospectus.


TRS and its affiliates retain the right to change various terms and
conditions of the agreements with the third party vendors, and retain the
right to change the third party vendors themselves. These changes may be the
result of several different factors, including but not limited to: expiration
of the servicing contract with the vendor, customer satisfaction, vendor
quality and financial strength, compliance with required service levels,
adherence to data protection and privacy requirements, adherence to security
standards and requirements, performance and skill evaluations, risk management
policies, and cost considerations. Accordingly, third party vendors who
provide services to TRS, its affiliates and its accountholders may change from
time to time, and noteholders will not be notified of any change. Similarly,
to the extent that the terms and conditions are altered for agreements with
third party vendors, noteholders will not be given notice of those changes.


If an affiliated or unaffiliated third party performing certain outsourced
or delegated functions were to enter bankruptcy or become insolvent, then the
servicing of the accounts in the issuing entity's Portfolio could be delayed
and payments on your notes could be accelerated, delayed or reduced.


[If an additional unaffiliated servicer will service 10% or more, but less
than 20%, of the pool assets, provide information contemplated in Item
1108(a)(2)(iii) of Regulation AB.]


[If an additional master servicer, affiliated servicer or other material
servicer upon whose responsibilities the performance of the receivables in the
trust is materially dependant will service the receivables in the trust, or if
an unaffiliated servicer will service 20% or more of the pool assets, provide
information contemplated in Item 1108(a)(3) of Regulation AB.]

ASSUMPTION OF THE TRANSFEROR'S OBLIGATIONS



The transfer and servicing agreement permits a transfer of all or a portion
of the transferor's charge accounts and the receivables arising thereunder.
This transfer may include all (but not less than all) of the transferor's
remaining interest in the receivables and any collateral certificates and its
interest in the issuance trust, together with all servicing functions and
other obligations under the transfer and servicing agreement or relating to
the transactions contemplated thereby, to another entity that may or may not
be affiliated with the transferor. Pursuant to the transfer and servicing
agreement, the transferor is permitted to assign, convey and transfer these
assets and obligations to such other entity, without the consent or approval
of the noteholders of any series, class or tranche of notes, if the following
conditions, among others, are satisfied:


(i) in a supplement to the transfer and servicing agreement, the assuming
entity expressly assumes the transferor's obligations under the transfer and
servicing agreement and each related securitization agreement;


(ii) the transferor shall have delivered to the indenture trustee and the

the servicer, each other transferor, the owner trustee and the indenture
trustee and the Rating Agency Condition shall have been satisfied


(v) the indenture trustee and the owner trustee shall have received an
opinion of counsel with respect to clause (iii) above and certain other
matters specified in the transfer and servicing agreement; and

assuming entity, the servicer, the issuing entity, the indenture trustee and
the owner trustee may enter into amendments to the transfer and servicing
agreement to permit the transfer and assumption described above without the
consent of the noteholders of any series, class or tranche of notes. After any
permitted transfer and assumption, the assuming entity will be considered a
transferor for all purposes hereof, and the transferor will have no further
liability or obligation under the transfer and servicing agreement or any
related securitization agreement.

THE INDENTURE



The notes will be issued pursuant to the terms of the indenture and a
related indenture supplement. The following discussion and the discussions
under "The Notes" in this prospectus and certain sections in the prospectus
summary summarize the material terms of the notes, the indenture and the
related indenture supplement. These summaries do not purport to be complete
and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the provisions of the
notes, the indenture and the related indenture supplement.



INDENTURE TRUSTEE



The Bank of New York, a New York banking corporation, is the indenture
trustee under the indenture for each series, class and tranche of notes issued
by the issuing entity. See "Transaction Parties--The Indenture Trustee" in
this prospectus for a description of The Bank of New York.


Under the terms of the indenture, the issuing entity has agreed to pay to
the indenture trustee reasonable compensation for performance of its duties
under the indenture. The indenture trustee has agreed to perform only those
duties specifically set forth in the indenture. Many of the duties of the
indenture trustee are described throughout this prospectus and the related
prospectus supplement. Under the terms of the indenture, the indenture
trustee's limited responsibilities include the following:


o to deliver to noteholders of record certain notices, reports and other
documents received by the indenture trustee, as required under the
indenture;


o to authenticate, deliver, cancel and otherwise administer the notes;


o to maintain custody of any collateral certificates;


o to establish and maintain necessary issuing entity accounts and to
maintain accurate records of activity in those accounts;


o to serve as the initial transfer agent, paying agent and registrar, and,
if it resigns these duties, to appoint a successor transfer agent, paying
agent and registrar;


o to invest funds in the issuing entity accounts at the direction of the
issuing entity;


o to represent the noteholders in interactions with clearing agencies and
other similar organizations;


o to distribute and transfer funds at the direction of the issuing entity,
as applicable, in accordance with the terms of the indenture;


o to periodically report on and notify noteholders of certain matters
relating to actions taken by the indenture trustee, property and funds
that are possessed by the indenture trustee, and other similar matters;
and


o to perform certain other administrative functions identified in the
indenture.


In addition, the indenture trustee has the discretion to require the issuing
entity to cure a potential event of default and to institute and maintain
suits to protect the interest of the noteholders in the receivables and any
applicable collateral certificate. The indenture trustee is not liable for any
errors of judgment as long as the errors are made in good faith and the


107





indenture trustee was not negligent. The indenture trustee is not responsible
for any investment losses to the extent that they result from Eligible
Investments.


If an event of default occurs, in addition to the responsibilities described
above, the indenture trustee will exercise its rights and powers under the
indenture to protect the interests of the noteholders using the same degree of
care and skill as a prudent person would exercise in the conduct of his or her
own affairs. If an event of default occurs and is continuing, the indenture
trustee will be responsible for enforcing the agreements and the rights of the
noteholders. See "--Events of Default Remedies" in this prospectus. The
indenture trustee may, under certain limited circumstances, have the right or
the obligation to do the following:


o demand immediate payment by the issuing entity of all principal of, and
any accrued, past due and additional interest on, the notes;


o enhance monitoring of the securitization;


o protect the interests of the noteholders in the receivables or any
collateral certificate in a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding;


o prepare and send timely notice to noteholders of the event of default;


o institute judicial proceedings for the collection of amounts due and
unpaid;


o rescind and annul a declaration of acceleration of the notes at the
direction of the noteholders following an event of default; and


o cause the issuing entity to sell assets (see "Sources of Funds to Pay the
Notes--Sale of Assets" in this prospectus).


Following an event of default, the holders of more than 66 2/3% of the
outstanding dollar principal amount of any affected series, class or tranche
of notes will have the right to direct the indenture trustee to exercise
certain remedies available to the indenture trustee under the indenture. In
such case, the indenture trustee may decline to follow the direction of those
holders only if it is advised by counsel and is provided with an opinion of
counsel to the effect that: (i) the action so directed is unlawful or
conflicts with the indenture, (ii) the action so directed would involve it in
personal liability or (iii) the action so directed would be unjustly
prejudicial to the noteholders not taking part in such direction.


If a Servicer Default occurs, in addition to the responsibilities described
above, the indenture trustee may be required to appoint a successor servicer
or to take over servicing responsibilities under the transfer and servicing
agreement. See "Sources of Funds to Pay the Notes--Servicer Default" in this
prospectus.


The indenture trustee may resign at any time by giving written notice to the
issuing entity. The issuing entity may also remove, or any noteholder who has
been a bona fide holder of a note of such series, class or tranche for at
least 6 months may, on behalf of itself and all others similarly situated,
petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of the indenture
trustee if the indenture trustee is no longer eligible to act as trustee under
the indenture (and any supplement thereto), the indenture trustee fails to
comply with the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, the indenture trustee
becomes incapable of acting with respect to any series, class or tranche of
notes, or if the indenture trustee becomes insolvent. In all such
circumstances, the issuing entity must appoint a successor indenture trustee
for the notes. Any


108





resignation or removal of the indenture trustee and appointment of a successor
indenture trustee will not become effective until the successor indenture
trustee accepts the appointment. If an instrument of acceptance by a successor
indenture trustee has not been delivered to the indenture trustee within 30
days of giving notice of resignation or removal, the indenture trustee may
petition a court of competent jurisdiction to appoint a successor indenture
trustee.


The issuing entity has agreed to pay the indenture trustee for all services
rendered.  The issuing entity will also indemnify the indenture trustee for
any loss, liability or expense incurred without negligence or bad faith on its
part, arising out of or in connection with the administration of the issuing
entity.  In certain instances, this indemnification will be higher in priority
than payments to noteholders.  See "The Indenture--Events of Default Remedies"
in this prospectus.  The indenture trustee may also be indemnified by the
servicer pursuant to the terms of the indenture.


Any successor indenture trustee will execute and deliver to the issuing
entity and its predecessor indenture trustee an instrument accepting such
appointment.  The successor indenture trustee must (i) be a corporation
organized and doing business under the laws of the United States of America or
of any state, (ii) be authorized under such laws to exercise corporate trust
powers, (iii) have a combined capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000,
subject to supervision or examination by federal or state authority, and (iv)
have a rating of at least BBB- by Standard & Poor's.  The issuing entity may
not, nor may any person directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by, or
under common control with the issuing entity, serve as indenture trustee.


The issuing entity or its affiliates may maintain accounts and other banking
or trustee relationships with the indenture trustee and its affiliates.



SECURITIES INTERMEDIARY



The Bank of New York is the securities intermediary under the indenture (and
any supplement thereto) for each series, class and tranche of notes issued by
the issuing entity.



ISSUING ENTITY COVENANTS



The issuing entity will not, among other things:


o claim any credit on or make any deduction from the principal and interest
payable on the notes, other than amounts withheld in good faith from such
payments under the Internal Revenue Code or other applicable tax law
(including foreign withholding),


o voluntarily dissolve or liquidate, or


o permit (i) the validity or effectiveness of the indenture (or any
supplement thereto) to be impaired, or permit the lien created by the
indenture (or any supplement thereto) to be amended, hypothecated,
subordinated, terminated or discharged, or permit any person to be
released from any covenants or obligations with respect to the notes
under the indenture except as may be expressly permitted by the
indenture, (ii) any lien, charge, excise, claim, security interest,
mortgage or other encumbrance (other than the lien in favor of the
indenture trustee created by the indenture (or any supplement thereto))
to be created on or extend to or otherwise arise upon or burden the
collateral transferred to the issuance trust or proceeds thereof or (iii)
the lien in favor of the


109





indenture trustee of the indenture (or any supplement thereto) not to
constitute a valid first priority security interest in the collateral
transferred to the issuance trust.


The issuing entity may not engage in any activity other than the activities
set forth in the trust agreement, the material provisions of which are
described in "Transaction Parties--The Issuing Entity" in this prospectus.


The issuing entity will also covenant that if:


o the issuing entity defaults in the payment of interest on any series,
class or tranche of notes when such interest becomes due and payable and
such default continues for a period of 35 days following the date on
which such interest became due and payable, or


o the issuing entity defaults in the payment of the principal of any
series, class or tranche of notes on its legal maturity date,


and that default continues beyond any specified grace period provided for that
series, class or tranche of notes, the issuing entity will, upon demand of the
indenture trustee, pay to the indenture trustee, for the benefit of the
holders of any such notes of the affected series, class or tranche, the whole
amount then due and payable on any such notes for principal and interest,
after giving effect to any allocation and subordination requirements described
in this prospectus and the related prospectus supplement, with interest, to
the extent that payment of such interest will be legally enforceable, upon the
overdue principal and upon overdue installments of interest. In addition, the
issuing entity will pay an amount sufficient to cover the costs and expenses
of collection, including the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements
and advances of the indenture trustee, its agents and counsel and all other
compensation due to the indenture trustee. If the issuing entity fails to pay
such amounts upon such demand, the indenture trustee may institute a judicial
proceeding for the collection of the unpaid amounts described above.



EARLY AMORTIZATION EVENTS



The issuing entity will be required to repay in whole or in part, to the
extent that funds are available for repayment after giving effect to all
allocations and reallocations and, for subordinated notes of a multiple
tranche series, to the extent payment is permitted by the subordination
provisions of the senior notes of the same series, each affected series,
class or tranche of notes upon the occurrence of an early amortization event.


Early amortization events include the following:


o the occurrence of an event of default and acceleration of the notes of a
series, class or tranche;


o for any series, class or tranche of notes, the occurrence of the expected
final payment date of such series, class or tranche of notes;


o the issuing entity becoming an "investment company" within the meaning of
the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended;


o the occurrence of certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency of the
transferor or an account owner;


110





o any account owner becomes unable for any reason to transfer receivables
to TRS, TRS becomes unable for any reason to transfer receivables to the
transferor or the transferor becomes unable for any reason to transfer
receivables to the issuance trust; and


o with respect to any series, class or tranche of notes, any additional
early amortization event specified in the related prospectus supplement.


In the case of any event described in the fourth and fifth bullet points
above, an early amortization event shall occur with respect to all outstanding
series, class or tranche of notes without any notice or other action on the
part of the owner trustee, the indenture trustee or any noteholders
immediately upon the occurrence of such event (or, in the case of clause (y)
below, immediately following the expiration of the 60-day grace period), but
only to the extent that:


(x) as of the date of such event, the average of the Monthly Pool Balance
Percentage for the immediately preceding three Monthly Periods is equal to
or greater than 10%, or


(y) as of the date of such event, the average of the Monthly Pool Balance
Percentage for the immediately preceding three Monthly Periods is less than
10%, and within 60 days following the occurrence of the related insolvency
event or inability to transfer assets, the Pool Balance is not at least
equal to the Required Pool Balance (without giving effect to principal
receivables or collateral certificates attributable to the transferor or the
account owner with respect to which the insolvency event or the inability to
transfer assets has occurred).


The amount repaid with respect to a series, class or tranche of notes will
equal the outstanding dollar principal amount of that series, class or
tranche, plus any accrued, past due and additional interest to but excluding
the date of repayment. If the amount of Finance Charge Collections and
Principal Collections allocable to the series, class or tranche of notes to be
repaid, together with funds on deposit in the applicable issuing entity
accounts and any amounts payable to the issuing entity under any applicable
derivative agreement, supplemental credit enhancement agreement or
supplemental liquidity agreement are insufficient to repay such amount in full
on the next payment date after giving effect to the subordination provisions
and all allocations and reallocations, monthly payments on the notes will
thereafter be made on each payment date until the stated principal amount of
the notes, plus any accrued, past due and additional interest, is paid in
full, or the legal maturity date of the notes occurs, whichever is earlier.
However, if so specified in the related prospectus supplement, subject to
certain exceptions, any notes that have the benefit of a derivative agreement
or other type of arrangement will not be repaid prior to such notes' expected
final payment date.


No Principal Collections will be allocated to a series, class or tranche of
notes with a Nominal Liquidation Amount of zero, even if the stated principal
amount of that series, class or tranche has not been paid in full. However,
any funds previously deposited into the applicable issuing entity accounts and
any amounts received from an applicable derivative agreement, supplemental
credit enhancement agreement or supplemental liquidity agreement will still be
available to pay principal of and interest on that series, class or tranche of
notes. In addition, if Finance Charge Collections are available, they can be
applied to reimburse reductions in the Nominal Liquidation Amount of that
series, class or tranche due to charge-offs resulting from any uncovered
Default Amount allocated to that series, class or tranche or due to
Reallocated


111





Principal Collections used to pay shortfalls in interest on senior notes and
any other amounts specified in the related prospectus supplement.


Payments on notes that are repaid as described above will be made in the
same priority as described in the related prospectus supplement. The issuing
entity will give notice to holders of the affected notes of the occurrence of
an early amortization event.



EVENTS OF DEFAULT



Each of the following events is an event of default for any affected series,
class or tranche of notes:


o for any series, class or tranche of notes, as applicable, the issuing
entity's failure, for a period of 35 days, to pay interest on such notes
when such interest becomes due and payable;


o for any series, class or tranche of notes, the issuing entity's failure
to pay the stated principal amount of such series, class or tranche of
notes on the applicable legal maturity date;


o the issuing entity's default in the performance, or breach, of any other
of its covenants or warranties in the indenture, for a period of 90 days
after the indenture trustee or the holders of at least 25% of the
aggregate outstanding dollar principal amount of the outstanding notes of
any affected series, class or tranche has provided written notice
requesting remedy of that breach, and, as a result of such default, the
interests of the related noteholders are materially and adversely
affected and continue to be materially and adversely affected during the
90-day period;


o the occurrence of certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency of the
issuing entity; or


o for any series, class or tranche of notes, any additional events of
default specified in the prospectus supplement relating to that series,
class or tranche.


Failure to pay the full stated principal amount of a note on its expected
final payment date will not constitute an event of default. An event of
default relating to one series, class or tranche of notes will not necessarily
be an event of default relating to any other series, class or tranche of
notes.


It is not an event of default if the issuing entity fails to redeem or repay
a note prior to its legal maturity date because it does not have sufficient
funds available or because payment of principal of a subordinated note is
delayed because it is necessary to provide required subordination for senior
notes.



EVENTS OF DEFAULT REMEDIES



The occurrence of an event of default involving the issuing entity's default
in the performance, or breach, of any other of its covenants or warranties in
the indenture, for a period of 90 days after receiving written notice thereof
results in an automatic acceleration of all of the notes, without notice or
demand to any person, and the issuing entity will automatically and
immediately be obligated to pay off the notes to the extent funds are
available. If other events of default occur and are continuing for any series,
class or tranche, either the indenture trustee or the holders of more than 66
2/3% of the outstanding dollar principal amount of the notes of the affected
series, class or tranche may declare by written


112





notice to the issuing entity the principal of all those outstanding notes to
be immediately due and payable. This declaration of acceleration may generally
be rescinded by the holders of more than 66 2/3% of the aggregate outstanding
dollar principal amount of outstanding notes of the affected series, class or
tranche.


If an event of default involving the issuing entity's failure to pay the
stated principal amount of a series, class or tranche of notes on the
applicable legal maturity date or the bankruptcy or insolvency of the issuing
entity occurs, either the indenture trustee or the holders of more than 66 2/
3% of the outstanding dollar principal amount of all of the outstanding notes
(treated as one class) may declare by written notice to the issuing entity the
principal of all the outstanding notes to be immediately due and payable.


If a series, class or tranche of notes is accelerated before its legal
maturity date, the indenture trustee may, and at the direction of the holders
of more than 66 2/3% of the outstanding dollar principal amount of notes of
the affected series, class or tranche at any time thereafter will, at any time
thereafter sell or direct the sale of assets in the issuance trust as provided
in the related prospectus supplement for that series, class or tranche of
notes.


In addition, a sale of assets in the issuance trust following an event of
default and acceleration of a tranche of subordinated notes of a multiple
tranche series may be delayed as described under "Sources of Funds to Pay the
Notes--Sale of Assets" in this prospectus if the payment is not permitted by
the subordination provisions of the senior notes of the same series.


If the Nominal Liquidation Amount of a series, class or tranche of notes is
greater than zero on the legal maturity date, assets will be sold, as
described in "Sources of Funds to Pay the Notes--Sale of Assets" in this
prospectus.


Upon the sale of assets in the issuance trust following (i) an event of
default and acceleration of a series, class or tranche of notes and (ii) the
legal maturity date of a series, class or tranche of notes, the Nominal
Liquidation Amount of that series, class or tranche of notes will be reduced
to zero upon such sale even if the proceeds of that sale, amounts on deposit
in issuing entity accounts for that series, class or tranche and any other
amounts available to such noteholders are not enough to pay all remaining
amounts due on those notes. After such sale, Principal Collections and Finance
Charge Collections will no longer be allocated to that series, class or
tranche of notes. The notes of that series, class or tranche will be
considered to be paid in full and the holders of that series, class or tranche
of notes will have no further right or claim and the issuing entity will have
no further obligation or liability for principal of and interest on those
notes. Noteholders of that series, class or tranche will receive the proceeds
of the sale in an amount not to exceed the outstanding dollar principal amount
of their notes, plus any accrued, past due and additional interest on such
notes. The notes of that series, class or tranche will no longer be
outstanding under the indenture (or any supplement thereto) once the sale
occurs.


After giving effect to a sale of assets for a series, class or tranche of
notes, the amount of proceeds and other amounts on deposit in the issuing
entity accounts for that series, class or tranche may be less than the
outstanding dollar principal amount of that series, class or tranche. This
deficiency can arise due to unreimbursed reductions in the Nominal Liquidation
Amount of that series, class or tranche or if the sale price for the assets
was less than the


113





outstanding dollar principal amount of that series, class or tranche. These
types of deficiencies will not be reimbursed.


Any money or other property collected by the indenture trustee in connection
with a sale of assets following an event of default and acceleration for a
series, class or tranche of notes will be applied in the following priority,
at the date fixed by the indenture trustee:


o first, to pay all compensation owed to the indenture trustee for services
rendered in connection with the indenture (and any supplement thereto);


o second, to pay the amounts of principal and interest then due and unpaid
with respect to the notes of that series, class or tranche, subject to
the allocation provisions of the transfer and servicing agreement and the
related indenture supplement;


o third, to pay any servicing fees owed to the servicer and any other fees
or expenses then owing that series, class or tranche; and


o fourth, to pay any remaining amounts to the issuing entity.


If a sale of assets in the issuance trust does not take place following an
event of default and acceleration of a series, class or tranche of notes,
then:


o The issuing entity will continue to hold the assets, and distributions on
the assets will continue to be applied in accordance with the
distribution provisions of the indenture and the related indenture
supplement.


o Principal will be paid on the accelerated series, class or tranche of
notes to the extent funds are received by the issuing entity and
available to the accelerated series, class or tranche after giving effect
to all allocations and reallocations and payment is permitted by the
subordination provisions of the senior notes of the same series.


o If the accelerated notes are a tranche of subordinated notes of a
multiple tranche series, and the subordination provisions prevent the
payment of the accelerated tranche of subordinated notes, prefunding of
the senior notes of that series will begin, as provided in the applicable
indenture supplement. Thereafter, payment will be made to the extent
provided in the applicable indenture supplement.


o On the legal maturity date of the accelerated notes, if the Nominal
Liquidation Amount of the accelerated notes is greater than zero, the
indenture trustee will direct the sale of assets as provided in the
related prospectus supplement.


The holders of more than 66 2/3% of the outstanding dollar principal amount
of any accelerated series, class or tranche of notes have the right to direct
the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy
available to the indenture trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred
on the indenture trustee. However, this right may be exercised only if the
indenture trustee is advised by counsel and is provided with an opinion of
counsel upon which it may conclusively rely to the effect that the direction
provided by the noteholders does not conflict with applicable law or the
indenture or the related indenture supplement or have a substantial likelihood
of involving the indenture trustee in personal liability. The holder of any
note will have the right to institute suit for the enforcement of payment of
principal of and interest on such note on the legal maturity date expressed in
such note, and such right will not be impaired without the consent of that
noteholder; provided, however, that the obligation


114





to pay principal of and interest on the notes or any other amount payable to
any noteholder will be without recourse to the transferor, indenture trustee,
owner trustee or any affiliate, or any officer, employee, member or director
thereof, and the obligation of the issuing entity to pay principal of and
interest on the notes or any other amount payable to any noteholder will be
subject to the allocation and payment provisions in the transfer and servicing
agreement and the applicable indenture supplement and limited to amounts
available (after giving effect to such allocation and payment provisions) from
the collateral pledged to secure the notes.


Generally, if an event of default occurs and any notes are accelerated, the
indenture trustee is not obligated to exercise any of its rights or powers
under the indenture (and any supplement thereto) unless the holders of
affected notes offer the indenture trustee reasonable indemnity. Upon
acceleration of the maturity of a series, class or tranche of notes following
an event of default, the indenture trustee will have a lien on the collateral
for those notes ranking senior to the lien of those notes for its unpaid fees
and expenses.


The indenture trustee has agreed, and the noteholders will agree, that they
will not at any time commence, or join in commencing, a bankruptcy case or
other insolvency or similar proceedings under the laws of any jurisdiction
against the issuing entity, the transferor or any master trust or other
securitization special purpose entity that has issued a collateral certificate
included in the issuance trust.



MEETINGS



If a series, class or tranche of notes are issuable in whole or in part as
bearer notes, a meeting of noteholders of the series, class or tranche of
notes may be called at any time and from time to time pursuant to the
indenture to make, give or take any action provided by the indenture.


The indenture trustee will call a meeting upon request of the issuing entity
or the holders of at least 10% in aggregate outstanding dollar principal
amount of the outstanding notes of the series, class or tranche issuable in
whole or in part as bearer notes. In any case, a meeting will be called after
notice is given to holders of notes in accordance with the indenture. The
indenture trustee may call a meeting of the holders of a series, class or
tranche of notes at any time for any purpose.


The quorum for a meeting is a majority of the holders of the outstanding
dollar principal amount of the related series, class or tranche of notes, as
the case may be, unless a different percentage is specified for approving
action taken at the meeting, in which case the quorum is such percentage.



VOTING



Any action or vote to be taken by the holders of more than 66 2/3%, or other
specified percentage, of any series, class or tranche of notes may be adopted
by the affirmative vote of the holders of more than 66 2/3%, or the applicable
other specified percentage, of the aggregate outstanding dollar principal
amount of the outstanding notes of that series, class or tranche, as the case
may be. For a description of noteholders' voting, see "Risk Factors--You may
have limited or no ability to control actions under the indenture, the
transfer and servicing agreement or a master trust pooling and servicing
agreement. This may result in, among other things, payment of principal being
accelerated when it is beneficial to you to receive payment


115





of principal on the expected final payment date, or it may result in payment
of principal not being accelerated when it is beneficial to you to receive
early payment of principal" in this prospectus.


Any action or vote taken at any meeting of holders of notes duly held in
accordance with the indenture will be binding on all holders of the affected
notes or the affected series, class or tranche of notes, as the case may be.


Notes held by the issuing entity, the transferor or any of their affiliates
will not be deemed outstanding for purposes of voting or calculating a quorum
at any meeting of noteholders.



AMENDMENTS TO THE INDENTURE AND THE INDENTURE SUPPLEMENTS



The issuing entity and the indenture trustee may amend, supplement or
otherwise modify the indenture or any indenture supplement without the consent
of any noteholder upon delivery of an Issuer Tax Opinion as described under
"--Tax Opinions for Amendments" below and, to the extent a collateral
certificate is included in the issuing entity's assets, a master trust tax
opinion with respect to the related master trust or other securitization
special purpose entity, and upon delivery by the issuing entity to the
indenture trustee of an officer's certificate to the effect that the issuing
entity reasonably believes that such amendment will not and is not reasonably
expected to (i) result in the occurrence of an early amortization event or
event of default for any series, class or tranche of notes, (ii) adversely
affect the amount of funds available to be distributed to the noteholders of
any series, class or tranche of notes or the timing of such distributions, or

(iii) adversely affect the security interest of the indenture trustee in the
collateral securing the outstanding notes in the issuance trust. Such
amendments to the indenture or any indenture supplement may:


o evidence the succession of another entity to the issuing entity, and the
assumption by such successor of the covenants of the issuing entity in
the indenture and the notes;


o add to the covenants of the issuing entity, or have the issuing entity
surrender any of its rights or powers under the indenture (or any
supplement thereto), for the benefit of the noteholders of any or all
series, classes or tranches;


o cure any ambiguity, correct or supplement any provision in the indenture
which may be inconsistent with any other provision in the indenture (or
any supplement thereto), or make any other provisions for matters or
questions arising under the indenture;


o add to the indenture certain provisions expressly permitted by the Trust
Indenture Act of 1939, as amended;


o establish any form of note, or to add to the rights of the holders of any
series, class or tranche of notes;


o provide for the acceptance of a successor indenture trustee under the
indenture for one or more series, classes or tranches of notes and add to
or change any of the provisions of the indenture as will be necessary to
provide for or facilitate the administration of the trusts under the
indenture by more than one indenture trustee;


o add any additional early amortization events or events of default
relating to any or all series, classes or tranches of notes;


116





o provide for the consolidation of any master trust and the issuing entity
into a single entity or the transfer of assets in the master trust to the
issuing entity after the termination of all series of master trust
investor certificates (other than the related collateral certificate);


o if one or more transferors are added to, or replaced under, the transfer
and servicing
agreement or a related pooling and servicing agreement, or one or more
beneficiaries are added to, or replaced under, the trust agreement, make
any necessary changes to the indenture or any other related document;


o add assets to the issuance trust;


o provide for additional or alternative forms of credit enhancement for any
series, class or tranche of notes;


o to comply with any regulatory, accounting or tax laws; or


o qualify for sale treatment under generally accepted accounting
principles.


The indenture or any indenture supplement may also be amended without the
consent of the indenture trustee or any noteholders upon delivery to the owner
trustee and the indenture trustee of an Issuer Tax Opinion as described under
"--Tax Opinions for Amendments" below and, to the extent a collateral
certificate is included in the issuing entity's assets, a master trust tax
opinion with respect to the related master trust or other securitization
special purpose entity, for the purpose of adding provisions to, or changing
in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of, the indenture or any
indenture supplement or of modifying in any manner the rights of the holders
of the notes under the indenture or any indenture supplement; provided,
however, that the issuing entity shall (i) deliver to the indenture trustee
and the owner trustee an officer's certificate to the effect that the issuing
entity reasonably believes that such amendment will not and is not reasonably
expected to (a) result in the occurrence of an early amortization event or
event of default for any series, class or tranche of notes, (b) adversely
affect the amount of funds available to be distributed to the noteholders of
any series, class or tranche of notes or the timing of such distributions, or

(c) adversely affect the security interest of the indenture trustee in the
collateral securing the outstanding notes and (ii) receive written
confirmation from each rating agency that has rated any outstanding series,
class or tranche of notes that such amendment will not result in the
reduction, qualification or withdrawal of the ratings of any outstanding notes
which it has rated.


Additionally, the indenture or any indenture supplement may also be amended
without the consent of the indenture trustee or any noteholders upon delivery
to the owner trustee and the indenture trustee of an Issuer Tax Opinion as
described under "--Tax Opinions for Amendments" below and, to the extent a
collateral certificate is included in the issuing entity's assets, a master
trust tax opinion with respect to the related master trust or other
securitization special purpose entity, to provide for (i) the establishment of
multiple asset pools and the designation of assets to be included as part of
specific asset pools or (ii) those changes necessary for compliance with
securities law requirements; provided, however, that the issuing entity shall

(i) deliver to the indenture trustee and the owner trustee an officer's
certificate to the effect that the issuing entity reasonably believes that
such amendment will not and is not reasonably expected to (a) result in the
occurrence of an early amortization event or event of default for any series,
class or tranche of notes, (b) adversely affect the amount of funds


117





available to be distributed to the noteholders of any series, class or tranche
of notes or the timing of such distributions, or (c) adversely affect the
security interest of the indenture trustee in the collateral securing the
outstanding notes and (ii) receive written confirmation from each rating
agency that has rated any outstanding series, class or tranche of notes that
such amendment will not result in the reduction, qualification or withdrawal
of the ratings of any outstanding notes which it has rated.


The indenture trustee may, but shall not be obligated to, enter into any
amendment which adversely affects the indenture trustee's rights, duties,
benefits, protections, privileges or immunities under the indenture (or any
supplement thereto).


The issuing entity and the indenture trustee, upon delivery of an Issuer Tax
Opinion as described under "--Tax Opinions for Amendments" below and, to the
extent a collateral certificate is included in the issuing entity's assets, a
master trust tax opinion with respect to the related master trust or other
securitization special purpose entity, may modify and amend the indenture or
any indenture supplement, for reasons other than those stated in the prior
paragraphs, with prior notice to each rating agency that has rated any
outstanding series, class or tranche of notes and the consent of the holders
of at least 66 2/3% of the outstanding dollar principal amount of each series,
class or tranche of notes affected by that modification or amendment. However,
if the modification or amendment would result in any of the following events
occurring, it may be made only with the consent of the holders of 100% of each
outstanding series, class or tranche of notes affected by the modification or
amendment:


o a change in any date scheduled for the payment of interest on any note or
the expected final payment date or legal maturity date of any note;


o a reduction in the stated principal amount of, or interest rate on, any
note, or a change in the method of computing the outstanding dollar
principal amount, the Adjusted Outstanding Dollar Principal Amount, or
the Nominal Liquidation Amount in a manner that is adverse to any
noteholder;


o a reduction in the amount of a discount note payable upon the occurrence
of an early amortization event or other optional or mandatory redemption
or upon the acceleration of its legal maturity date;


o an impairment of the right to institute suit for the enforcement of any
payment on any note;


o a reduction in the percentage in outstanding dollar principal amount of
the notes of any outstanding series, class or tranche, the consent of
whose holders is required for modification or amendment of the indenture,
any indenture supplement or any related agreement or for waiver of
compliance with provisions of the indenture or for waiver of defaults and
their consequences provided for in the indenture;


o a modification of any of the provisions governing the amendment of the
indenture any indenture supplement or the issuing entity's covenants not to
claim rights under any law which would affect the covenants or the
performance of the indenture or any indenture supplement, except to
increase any percentage of noteholders required to consent to any such
amendment or to provide that certain other provisions of the indenture
cannot be modified or waived without the consent of the holder of each
outstanding note affected by such modification;


118





o permission being given to create any lien or other encumbrance on the
collateral
ranking senior to the lien of the indenture;


o a change in the city or political subdivision so designated with respect
to any series, class or tranche of notes where any principal of, or
interest on, any note is payable; or


o a change in the method of computing the amount of principal of, or
interest on, any note on any date.


The holders of a majority in aggregate outstanding dollar principal amount
of the outstanding notes of an affected series, class or tranche may waive, on
behalf of the holders of all of the notes of that series, class or tranche,
compliance by the issuing entity with specified restrictive provisions of the
indenture or the related indenture supplement.


The holders of more than 66 2/3% of the aggregate outstanding dollar
principal amount of the outstanding notes of an affected series, class or
tranche may, on behalf of all holders of notes of that series, class or
tranche, waive any past default under the indenture or the indenture
supplement relating to that series, class or tranche of notes. However, the
consent of the holders of all outstanding notes of a series, class or tranche
is required to waive any past default in the payment of principal of, or
interest on, any note of that series, class or tranche or in respect of a
covenant or provision of the indenture that cannot be modified or amended
without the consent of the holders of each outstanding note of that series,
class or tranche.



TAX OPINIONS FOR AMENDMENTS



No amendment to the indenture or any indenture supplement will be effective
unless the issuing entity has delivered to the indenture trustee, the owner
trustee and each rating agency that has rated any outstanding series, class or
tranche of notes an Issuer Tax Opinion and, to the extent any collateral
certificates are included in the issuance trust, an opinion of counsel that
for federal income tax purposes (i) the amendment will not adversely affect
the tax characterization as debt of any outstanding series or class of
investor certificates issued by the related master trust or other
securitization special purpose entity that were characterized as debt at the
time of their issuance, (ii) the amendment will not cause the related master
trust or other securitization special purpose entity to be treated as an
association, or publicly traded partnership, taxable as a corporation and

(iii) the amendment will not cause or constitute an event in which gain or
loss would be recognized by any holder of investor certificates issued by the
related master trust or other securitization special purpose entity.



ADDRESSES FOR NOTICES



Notices to holders of notes will be given by mail, facsimile, or electronic
transmission, or personally delivered to the holders notes, and sent to the
addresses of the holders as they appear in the note register.



ISSUING ENTITY'S ANNUAL COMPLIANCE STATEMENT



The issuing entity will be required to furnish annually to the indenture
trustee a statement concerning its performance or fulfillment of covenants,
agreements or conditions in the indenture (or any supplement thereto) as well
as the presence or absence of defaults under the indenture (or any supplement
thereto).


119






INDENTURE TRUSTEE'S ANNUAL REPORT



To the extent required by the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, the
indenture trustee will mail each year to all registered noteholders a report
concerning:


o its eligibility and qualifications to continue as trustee under the
indenture,


o any amounts advanced by it under the indenture (or any supplement
thereto),


o the amount, interest rate and maturity date or indebtedness owing by the
issuer to it in the indenture trustee's individual capacity,


o the property and funds physically held by it as indenture trustee,


o any release or release and substitution of collateral subject to the lien
of the indenture that has not previously been reported, and


o any action taken by it that materially affects the notes and that has not
previously been reported.



LIST OF NOTEHOLDERS



Three or more holders of notes of any series, class or tranche, each of whom
has owned a note for at least six months, may, upon written request to the
indenture trustee, obtain access to the current list of noteholders of the
issuing entity for purposes of communicating with other noteholders concerning
their rights under the indenture (or any supplement thereto) or the notes. The
indenture trustee may elect not to give the requesting noteholders access to
the list if it agrees to mail the desired communication or proxy to all
applicable noteholders.



REPORTS



Monthly reports containing information on the notes and the collateral
securing the notes will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission
to the extent required by the SEC. These reports will not be sent to
noteholders. See "Where You Can Find More Information" in this prospectus for
information as to how these reports may be accessed.


These reports, which will be prepared by TRS as servicer for each series,
will include, among other things, the following information, to the extent
applicable for the related month:


o certain information regarding the activity in the issuance trust (e.g.,
beginning and end of month principal receivables, total receivables
added, total receivables removed, end of month pool balance, end of month
required pool balance, gross default amount, end of month number of
accounts, etc.);


o certain delinquency and loss information, including the annualized net
default rate;


o certain information regarding collections during the related month,
including the principal payment rate and the trust portfolio yield;


o the floating allocation percentage, shared excess finance charge
collections, the principal allocation percentage, reallocated principal
collections and shared excess principal collections;


o interest to be paid on the corresponding payment date;


o principal to be paid on the corresponding payment date, if any; and


o the nominal liquidation amount for the related series.


120





On or before January 31 of each calendar year, the paying agent, on behalf
of the indenture trustee, will furnish to each person who at any time during
the prior calendar year was a noteholder of record a statement containing the
information required to be provided by an issuer of indebtedness under the
Internal Revenue Code. See "Federal Income Tax Consequences" in this
prospectus.



CONSUMER PROTECTION LAWS



The relationship between an accountholder and credit or charge lender is
extensively regulated by federal, state and local consumer protection laws.
With respect to charge accounts owned by the banks or TRS, the most
significant federal laws include the federal Truth-in-Lending, Equal Credit
Opportunity, Fair Credit Reporting and Fair Debt Collection Practices Acts.
These statutes impose disclosure requirements before and when an account is
opened and at the end of monthly billing cycles and, in addition, limit
accountholder liability for unauthorized use, prohibit certain discriminatory
practices in extending credit or charging privileges, impose certain
limitations on the type of account-related charges that may be issued and
regulate collection practices. In addition, accountholders are entitled under
these laws to have payments and credits applied to their accounts promptly and
to require billing errors to be resolved promptly. The issuance trust may be
liable for certain violations of consumer protection laws that apply to the
receivables, either as assignee from the transferor with respect to
obligations arising before transfer of the receivables to the issuance trust
or as the party directly responsible for obligations arising after the
transfer. In addition, an accountholder may be entitled to assert such
violations by way of setoff against the obligation to pay the amount of
receivables owing. See "Risk Factors" in this prospectus. All receivables that
were not created or serviced in compliance in all material respects with the
requirements of such laws, subject to certain conditions described under
"Sources of Funds to Pay the Notes--Representations and Warranties" in this
prospectus, will be reassigned to the transferor. The servicer has also agreed
in the transfer and servicing agreement to indemnify the issuance trust, among
other things, for any liability arising from such servicing violations. For a
discussion of the issuance trust's rights if the receivables were not created
in compliance in all material respects with applicable laws, see "Sources of
Funds to Pay the Notes--Representations and Warranties" in this prospectus.


The Servicemembers Civil Relief Act allows individuals on active duty in the
military to cap the interest rate and fees on debts incurred before the call
to active duty at 6%. In addition, subject to judicial discretion, any action
or court proceeding in which an individual in military service is involved may
be stayed if the individual's rights would be prejudiced by denial of such a
stay. Currently, some accountholders with outstanding balances have been
placed on active duty in the military, and more may be placed on active duty
in the future.


Application of federal and state bankruptcy and debtor relief laws would
affect the interests of noteholders in the receivables if such laws result in
any receivables being charged off as uncollectible when there are no funds
available from supplemental credit enhancement or other sources.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECEIVABLES PURCHASE AGREEMENTS AND THE SALE AGREEMENTS



The following summarizes the material terms of the sale agreements between
Credco and TRS, the Centurion receivables purchase agreement, which is the
receivables purchase agreement between Centurion and TRS, the FSB receivables
purchase agreement, which is the receivables purchase agreement between FSB
and TRS, and the RFC V receivables purchase agreement, which is the
receivables purchase agreement between TRS and RFC V. We refer to the
Centurion receivables purchase agreement, the FSB receivables purchase
agreement and the RFC V receivables purchase agreements collectively as the
receivables purchase agreements and we refer to TRS and RFC V individually as
the purchaser and collectively as the purchasers. Forms of the sale agreements
and the receivables purchase agreements are filed as exhibits to this

SALE OF RECEIVABLES



Centurion and FSB are owners of the accounts which contain the receivables
that are purchased by TRS pursuant to the respective receivables purchase
agreement. TRS, Centurion and FSB are owners of the accounts which contain the
receivables that are purchased by RFC V pursuant to the RFC V receivables
purchase agreement and then transferred by RFC V to the trust. In connection
with the sale of receivables to TRS and RFC V, each of Centurion, FSB and TRS
has:


o filed appropriate UCC financing statements to evidence the sale to the
respective purchaser and to perfect the right, title and interest of such
purchaser in those receivables; and

designate additional accounts and sell to the respective purchaser all of
its right, title and interest in the receivables existing in the
additional accounts on the applicable addition cut-off date and in the
receivables arising thereafter in those accounts, in each case including
recoveries, all monies due or to become due, all amounts received or
receivable, all collections and all proceeds, each as it relates to such
receivables.


Pursuant to the transfer and servicing agreement, RFC V has assigned all of
its right, title and interest in the respective receivables purchase
agreement, including its right to enforce the agreement against TRS, to the
indenture trustee.


122






REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES



In each receivables purchase agreement, Centurion, FSB or TRS,
respectively, represents and warrants to the respective purchaser that, among
other things:


o it is validly existing in good standing under the applicable laws of the
applicable jurisdiction and has full power and authority to own its
properties and conduct its business;


o its execution and delivery of the receivables purchase agreement and its
performance of the transactions contemplated by that agreement will not
conflict with or result in any breach of any of the terms of any material
agreement to which it is a party or by which its properties are bound and
will not conflict with or violate any requirements of law applicable to
it; and


o all governmental authorizations, consents, orders, approvals,
registrations or declarations required to be obtained by it in connection
with its execution and delivery of, and its performance of the applicable
receivables purchase agreement, have been obtained.



REPURCHASE OBLIGATIONS



In each receivables purchase agreement, each of TRS, Centurion and FSB,
respectively, makes the following representations and warranties, among
others:


o as of the applicable cut-off date with respect to the accounts, the list
of accounts and information concerning the accounts provided by it is
accurate and complete in all material respects, with certain permitted
exceptions;


o each receivable conveyed by it to the respective purchaser has been
conveyed free and clear of any lien or encumbrance, except liens
permitted by the applicable receivables purchase agreement;

adverse to the interests of the respective purchaser have been used in
selecting the accounts.


The RFC V receivables purchase agreement provides that if TRS breaches any
of the representations and warranties described above and, as a result, RFC V
is required under the transfer and servicing agreement to accept a
reassignment of the related Ineligible Receivables transferred to the issuing
entity by RFC V, then TRS will accept reassignment of such Ineligible
Receivables and pay to RFC V an amount equal to the unpaid balance of such


123





Ineligible Receivables. The Centurion receivables purchase agreement and FSB
receivables purchase agreement provide that if Centurion or FSB, as
applicable, breaches any of the representations and warranties described above
and, as a result, TRS is required under the RFC V receivables purchase
agreement to accept a reassignment of the related Ineligible Receivables
transferred to RFC V by TRS, then Centurion or FSB, as applicable, will accept
reassignment of such Ineligible Receivables and pay to TRS an amount equal to
the unpaid balance of such Ineligible Receivables. See "--Representations and
Warranties" in this prospectus.



REASSIGNMENT OF OTHER RECEIVABLES



Each of Centurion, FSB and TRS, as applicable, also represents and warrants
in the respective receivables purchase agreement that (i) such receivables
purchase agreement and any supplemental conveyance each constitutes a legal,
valid and binding obligation of Centurion, FSB or TRS, as applicable, and (ii)
such receivables purchase agreement and any supplemental conveyance constitute
a valid sale to the respective purchaser of all right, title and interest of
Centurion, FSB or TRS, as applicable, of the receivables, including all
recoveries, all monies due or to become due, all amounts received or
receivable, all collections and all proceeds, each as it relates to such
receivables, and that the sale is perfected under the applicable UCC. If a
representation described in (i) or (ii) of the preceding sentence is not true
and correct in any material respect and as a result of the breach the
respective purchaser is required under the applicable receivables purchase
agreement to accept a reassignment of all of the receivables previously sold
by Centurion, FSB or TRS, as applicable, pursuant to such receivables purchase
agreement, Centurion, FSB or TRS, as applicable, will accept a reassignment of
those receivables. See "--Representations and Warranties" in this prospectus.
If Centurion, FSB or TRS, as applicable, is required to accept such
reassignment, Centurion, FSB or TRS, as applicable, will pay to the respective
purchaser an amount equal to the unpaid balance of the reassigned receivables.



AMENDMENTS



The receivables purchase agreements may be amended by Centurion, FSB or TRS,
as applicable, and the respective purchaser without consent of any
noteholders. No amendment, however, may be effective unless:


o written confirmation has been received by such purchaser from each rating
agency that has rated any outstanding series, class or tranche of notes
that the amendment will not result in the reduction or withdrawal of the
respective ratings of each such rating agency for any notes issued by the
issuing entity; and


o TRS will deliver an officer's certificate, dated the date of such action,
stating that it reasonably believes that the amendment will not result in
an event of default or an early amortization event.



TERMINATION



The Centurion receivables purchase agreement and the FSB receivable purchase
agreement will not terminate at least until the earlier of (i) the termination
of the issuing entity pursuant to the trust agreement, (ii) the termination of
the RFC V receivables purchase agreement and (iii) the execution of a
receivables purchase agreement between Centurion or


124





FSB and American Express Receivables Financing Corporation VI LLC, or RFC VI,
or American Express Receivables Financing Corporation VII LLC, or RFC VII,
respectively, or another wholly-owned subsidiary special purpose entity,
pursuant to which Centurion or FSB will sell receivables to RFC VI or RFC VII,
respectively, or such other entity, and RFC VI, RFC VII, or such other entity
will convey such receivables to the issuance trust. The RFC V receivable
purchase agreement will not terminate at least until the earlier of (i) the
termination of the issuer pursuant to the trust agreement and (ii) an
amendment to the transfer and servicing agreement to replace RFC V as the
transferor under the transfer and servicing agreement. Nevertheless, if a
receiver or conservator is appointed for Centurion or FSB or a bankruptcy
proceeding is commenced against TRS or certain other liquidation, bankruptcy,
insolvency or other similar events occur, Centurion, FSB or TRS, as the case
may be, will cease to transfer receivables to the respective purchaser and
promptly give notice of that event to such purchaser and the indenture
trustee, unless the bankruptcy court, receiver or conservator instructs
otherwise.



SALE FROM CREDCO



On an ongoing basis, Credco purchases from TRS, Centurion and FSB
receivables arising in unsecuritized consumer and small business charge
accounts owned by each of TRS, Centurion and FSB. In connection with the
designation of the initial accounts to the issuer's Portfolio, Credco entered
into a sale agreement with TRS, pursuant to which Credco sold to TRS all of
its right, title and interest in the receivables existing in the initial
accounts at the Initial Cut-Off Date and in the receivables thereafter arising
in those accounts, including all recoveries allocable to such receivables, all
monies due or to become due, all amounts received or receivable and all
collections and all proceeds, each as it relates to such receivables. In
connection with the designation of Aggregate Addition Accounts to the issuing
entity's Portfolio, Credco and TRS may enter into additional sale agreements
with substantially similar terms. With respect to any such sale of receivables
to TRS, Credco has filed and will file appropriate UCC financing statements to
evidence such sale to TRS.

FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES




GENERAL



The following summary describes the material United States federal income
tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of an interest in
the notes. Additional federal income tax considerations relevant to a
particular tranche may be set forth in the related prospectus supplement. The
following summary has been prepared and reviewed by Orrick, Herrington &
Sutcliffe LLP as special tax counsel to the issuing entity ("Special Tax
Counsel"). The summary is based on the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended as of the date hereof, and existing final, temporary and proposed
Treasury regulations, revenue


125





rulings and judicial decisions, all of which are subject to prospective and
retroactive changes. The summary is addressed only to original purchasers of
an interest in the notes, deals only with interests in notes held as capital
assets within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code and,
except as specifically set forth below, does not address tax consequences of
holding interests in notes that may be relevant to investors in light of their
own investment circumstances or their special tax situations, such as certain
financial institutions, tax-exempt organizations, life insurance companies,
dealers in securities, non-U.S. persons, or investors holding interests in the
notes as part of a conversion transaction, as part of a hedge or hedging
transaction, or as a position in a straddle for tax purposes. Further, this
discussion does not address alternative minimum tax consequences or any tax
consequences to holders of equity interests in a holder of an interest in a
note. Special Tax Counsel is of the opinion that the following summary of
federal income tax consequences is correct in all material respects. An
opinion of Special Tax Counsel, however, is not binding on the Internal
Revenue Service or the courts, and no ruling on any of the issues discussed
below will be sought from the Internal Revenue Service. Moreover, there are no
authorities on similar transactions involving interests issued by an entity
with terms similar to those of the notes described in this prospectus.
Further, note owners should be aware that this summary and the opinions
contained herein may not be able to be relied upon to avoid any income tax
penalties that may be imposed with respect to the notes. ACCORDINGLY, IT IS
SUGGESTED THAT PERSONS CONSIDERING THE PURCHASE OF AN INTEREST IN NOTES SHOULD
CONSULT THEIR OWN TAX ADVISORS WITH REGARD TO THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME
TAX CONSEQUENCES OF AN INVESTMENT IN AN INTEREST IN THE NOTES AND THE
APPLICATION OF UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX LAWS, AS WELL AS THE LAWS OF
ANY STATE, LOCAL OR FOREIGN TAXING JURISDICTIONS, TO THEIR PARTICULAR
SITUATIONS.



DESCRIPTION OF OPINIONS



As more fully described in this "Federal Income Tax Consequences" section,
Special Tax Counsel is of the opinion generally to the effect that the issuing
entity will not be subject to federal income tax, and further that the notes
will be characterized as debt for United States federal income tax purposes.
Additionally, Special Tax Counsel is of the opinion generally to the effect
that the statements set forth in this section, to the extent that they
constitute matters of law or legal conclusions, are correct in all material
respects.


Special Tax Counsel has not been asked to opine on any other federal income
tax matter, and the balance of this discussion does not purport to set forth
any opinion of Special Tax Counsel concerning any other particular federal
income tax matter.  For example, the discussion of original issue discount
below is a general discussion of federal income tax consequences relating to
an investment in notes that are treated as having original issue discount,
which discussion Special Tax Counsel opines is correct in all material
respects as described above; however, that discussion does not set forth any
opinion as to whether any particular tranche or series of notes will be
treated as having original issue discount.  Additionally, those matters as to
which Special Tax Counsel renders opinions should be understood to be subject
to the additional considerations in the discussions relating to those opinions
set forth below.


Special Tax Counsel has not been asked to, and does not, render any opinion
regarding the state or local income tax consequences of the purchase,
ownership and disposition of a beneficial interest in the notes. See "--State
and Local Tax Consequences" below.


126





This description of the substance of the opinions rendered by Special Tax
Counsel is not intended as a substitute for an investor's review of the
remainder of this discussion of income tax consequences, or for consultation
with its own advisors or tax return preparer.



TAX CHARACTERIZATION OF THE ISSUING ENTITY AND THE NOTES




TREATMENT OF THE ISSUING ENTITY AS AN ENTITY NOT SUBJECT TO TAX



Special Tax Counsel is of the opinion that, although no transaction closely
comparable to that contemplated herein has been the subject of any Treasury
regulation, revenue ruling or judicial decision, each of the issuing entity
and, to the extent a collateral certificate is included in the issuing
entity's assets, the related master trust or other securitization special
purpose entity will not be classified as an association or as a publicly
traded partnership taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes.
As a result, Special Tax Counsel is of the opinion that the issuing entity
will not be subject to federal income tax. However, as discussed above, this
opinion is not binding on the Internal Revenue Service and no assurance can be
given that this characterization will prevail.


The precise tax characterization of the issuing entity for federal income
tax purposes is not certain. It might be viewed as merely holding assets on
behalf of the transferor as collateral for notes issued by the transferor. On
the other hand, it could be viewed as one or more separate entities for tax
purposes issuing the notes. This distinction, however, should not have a
significant tax effect on holders of interests in notes except as stated below
under "--Possible Alternative Characterizations."



TREATMENT OF THE NOTES AS DEBT



Special Tax Counsel is of the opinion that, although no transaction closely
comparable to that contemplated herein has been the subject of any Treasury
regulation, revenue ruling or judicial decision, the notes will be
characterized as debt for United States federal income tax purposes.
Additionally, the issuing entity will agree by entering into the indenture,
and the holders of interests in notes will agree by their purchase and holding
of an interest in notes, to treat the notes as debt secured by the receivables
and other assets of the issuing entity for United States federal income tax
purposes.



POSSIBLE ALTERNATIVE CHARACTERIZATIONS



If, contrary to the opinion of Special Tax Counsel, the Internal Revenue
Service successfully asserted that a series or class of notes did not
represent debt for United States federal income tax purposes, those notes
might be treated as equity interests in the issuing entity or some other
entity for such purposes. If so treated, investors could be treated either as
partners in a partnership or, alternatively, as shareholders in a taxable
corporation for such purposes. If an investor were treated as a partner in a
partnership, it would be taxed individually on its respective share of the
partnership's income, gain, loss, deductions and credits attributable to the
partnership's ownership of the receivables and other assets and liabilities of
the partnership without regard to whether there were actual distributions of
that income. As a result, the amount, timing, character and source of items of
income and deduction of an investor could differ if its interest in notes were
held to constitute a partnership interest rather than debt. Treatment of a
holder of an interest in notes as a partner could have adverse tax
consequences to certain holders; for example, absent an applicable exemption,
income to foreign persons would be subject to United States tax and United
States tax return


127





filing and withholding requirements, and individual holders might be subject
to certain limitations on their ability to deduct their share of partnership
expenses. Alternatively, the Internal Revenue Service could contend that some
or all of the notes, or separately some of the other securities that the
issuing entity is permitted to issue (and which are permitted to constitute
debt or equity for federal income tax purposes), constitute equity in a
partnership that should be classified as a publicly traded partnership taxable
as a corporation for federal income tax purposes. Any such partnership would
be classified as a publicly traded partnership and could be taxable as a
corporation if its equity interests were traded on an "established securities
market," or are "readily tradable" on a "secondary market" or its "substantial
equivalent." The transferor intends to take measures designed to reduce the
risk that the issuing entity could be classified as a publicly traded
partnership; although the transferor expects that such measures will
ultimately be successful, certain of the actions that may be necessary for
avoiding the treatment of such other securities as "readily tradable" on a
"secondary market" or its "substantial equivalent" are not fully within the
control of the transferor. As a result, there can be no assurance that the
measures the transferor intends to take will in all circumstances be
sufficient to prevent the issuing entity from being classified as a publicly
traded partnership. If the issuing entity or any relevant master trust were
treated in whole or in part as one or more publicly traded partnerships
taxable as a corporation, corporate tax imposed with respect to such
corporation could materially reduce cash available to make payments on the
notes, and foreign investors could be subject to withholding taxes.
Additionally, no distributions from the corporation would be deductible in
computing the taxable income of the corporation, except to the extent that any
notes or other securities were treated as debt of the corporation and
distributions to the related holder of an interest in notes or other security
holders were treated as payments of interest thereon. Further, distributions
to a holder of an interest in notes not treated as holding debt would be
dividend income to the extent of the current and accumulated earnings and
profits of the corporation (possibly without the benefit of any dividends
received deduction). Prospective investors should consult their own tax
advisors with regard to the consequences of possible alternative
characterizations to them in their particular circumstances; the following
discussion assumes that the characterization of the notes as debt and the
issuing entity and any relevant master trust as entities not subject to
federal income tax is correct.



CONSEQUENCES TO HOLDERS OF AN INTEREST IN THE OFFERED NOTES




INTEREST AND ORIGINAL ISSUE DISCOUNT



Stated interest on a note will be includible in gross income as it accrues
or is received in accordance with the usual method of tax accounting of a
holder of an interest in notes. If a class of notes is issued with original
issue discount, the provisions of Sections 1271 through 1273 and 1275 of the
Internal Revenue Code will apply to those notes. Under those provisions, a
holder of an interest in such a note (including a cash basis holder) would be
required to include the original issue discount on an interest in a note in
income for federal income tax purposes on a constant yield basis, resulting in
the inclusion of original issue discount in income in advance of the receipt
of cash attributable to that income. Subject to the discussion below, an
interest in a note will be treated as having original issue discount to the
extent that its "stated redemption price" exceeds its "issue price," if such
excess equals or exceeds 0.25 percent multiplied by the weighted average life
of the note (determined by taking into account the number of complete years
following issuance until payment is made for each partial


128





principal payment). Under Section 1272(a)(6) of the Internal Revenue Code,
special provisions apply to debt instruments on which payments may be
accelerated due to prepayments of other obligations securing those debt
instruments. However, no regulations have been issued interpreting those
provisions, and the manner in which those provisions would apply to the notes
is unclear, but the application of Section 1272(a)(6) could affect the rate of
accrual of original issue discount and could have other consequences to
holders of interests in the notes. Additionally, the Internal Revenue Service
could take the position based on Treasury regulations that none of the
interest payable on an interest in a note is "unconditionally payable" and
hence that all of such interest should be included in its stated redemption
price at maturity. If sustained, such treatment should not significantly
affect tax liabilities for most holders of the notes, but prospective
investors should consult their own tax advisors concerning the impact to them
in their particular circumstances. The issuing entity intends to take the
position that interest on the notes constitutes "qualified stated interest"
and that the above consequences do not apply.



MARKET DISCOUNT



A holder of an interest in a note who purchases its interest at a discount
that exceeds any original issue discount not previously includible in income
may be subject to the "market discount" rules of Sections 1276 through 1278 of
the Internal Revenue Code. These rules provide, in part, that gain on the sale
or other disposition of a note and partial principal payments on a note are
treated as ordinary income to the extent of accrued market discount. The
market discount rules also provide for deferral of interest deductions with
respect to debt incurred to purchase or carry a note that has market discount.



MARKET PREMIUM



A holder of an interest in a note who purchases its interest at a premium
may elect to amortize the premium against interest income over the remaining
term of the note in accordance with the provisions of Section 171 of the
Internal Revenue Code.



DISPOSITION OF AN INTEREST IN THE NOTES



Subject to exceptions such as in the case of "wash sales," upon the sale,
exchange or retirement of an interest in a note, the holder of such interest
will recognize taxable gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference
between the amount realized on the disposition (other than amounts
attributable to accrued interest) and the holder's adjusted tax basis in its
interest in the note. The holder's adjusted tax basis in its interest in the
note generally will equal the cost of the interest in the note to such holder,
increased by any market or original issue discount previously included in
income by such holder with respect to the note, and decreased by the amount of
any bond premium previously amortized and any payments of principal or
original issue discount previously received by such holder with respect to
such note. Except to the extent of any accrued market discount not previously
included in income, any such gain treated as capital gain will be long-term
capital gain if the interest in the note has been held for more than one year,
and any such loss will be a capital loss, subject to limitations on
deductibility.


129






FOREIGN HOLDERS



Under United States federal income tax law now in effect, subject to
exceptions applicable to certain types of interest, payments of interest by
the issuer to a holder of an interest in a note who, as to the United States,
is a nonresident alien individual or a foreign corporation (a "foreign
person") will be considered "portfolio interest" and will not be subject to
United States federal income tax and withholding tax provided the interest is
not effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the
United States by the foreign person and the foreign person (i) is not for
United States federal income tax purposes (a) actually or constructively a "10
percent shareholder" of the transferor, the issuer or any relevant master
trust, (b) a "controlled foreign corporation" with respect to which the
transferor, the issuer or any relevant master trust is a "related person"
within the meaning of the Internal Revenue Code, or (c) a bank extending
credit pursuant to a loan agreement entered into in the ordinary course of its
trade or business, and (ii) provides the person who is otherwise required to
withhold United States tax with respect to the notes with an appropriate
statement (on IRS Form W-8BEN or a substitute form), signed under penalties of
perjury, certifying that the beneficial owner of the note is a foreign person
and providing the foreign person's name, address and certain additional
information. If a note is held through a securities clearing organization or
certain other financial institutions, the organization or institution may
provide the relevant signed statement to the withholding agent; in that case,
however, the signed statement must be accompanied by an IRS Form W-8BEN or
substitute form provided by the foreign person that owns the interest in the
note. Special rules apply to partnerships, estates and trusts, and in certain
circumstances certifications as to foreign status and other matters may be
required to be provided by partners and beneficiaries thereof. If such
interest is not portfolio interest, then it will be subject to United States
federal income and withholding tax at a rate of 30%, unless reduced or
eliminated pursuant to an applicable tax treaty or such interest is
effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the
United States and, in either case, the appropriate statement has been
provided.


Any capital gain realized on the sale, redemption, retirement or other
taxable disposition of an interest in a note by a foreign person will be
exempt from United States federal income tax and withholding tax, provided
that (i) such gain is not effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or
business in the United States by the foreign person, and (ii) in the case of
an individual foreign person, such individual is not present in the United
States for 183 days or more in the taxable year.


The U.S. Treasury Department has issued final Treasury regulations which
revise various procedural matters relating to withholding taxes. Holders of
interests in notes should consult their tax advisors regarding the procedures
whereby they may establish an exemption from withholding.



BACKUP WITHHOLDING AND INFORMATION REPORTING



Payments of principal and interest, as well as payments of proceeds from the
sale, retirement or disposition of an interest in a note, may be subject to
"backup withholding" tax under Section 3406 of the Internal Revenue Code if a
recipient of such payments fails to furnish to the payor certain identifying
information. Any amounts deducted and withheld would be allowed as a credit
against such recipient's United States federal income tax, provided
appropriate proof is provided under rules established by the Internal Revenue


130





Service. Furthermore, certain penalties may be imposed by the Internal Revenue
Service on a recipient of payments that is required to supply information but
that does not do so in the proper manner. Backup withholding will not apply
with respect to payments made to certain exempt recipients, such as
corporations and financial institutions. Information may also be required to
be provided to the Internal Revenue Service concerning payments, unless an
exemption applies. Holders of interests in the notes should consult their tax
advisors regarding their qualification for exemption from backup withholding
and information reporting and the procedure for obtaining such an exemption.


THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX DISCUSSION SET FORTH ABOVE MAY NOT BE
APPLICABLE DEPENDING UPON THE PARTICULAR TAX SITUATION OF A HOLDER OF AN
INTEREST IN THE NOTES, AND DOES NOT PURPORT TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES DESCRIBED
WITH THE DEGREE OF SPECIFICITY THAT WOULD BE PROVIDED BY A TAXPAYER'S OWN TAX
ADVISOR. ACCORDINGLY, IT IS SUGGESTED THAT PROSPECTIVE INVESTORS SHOULD
CONSULT THEIR OWN TAX ADVISORS WITH RESPECT TO THE TAX CONSEQUENCES TO THEM OF
THE PURCHASE, OWNERSHIP AND DISPOSITION OF AN INTEREST IN THE NOTES AND THE
POSSIBLE EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN FEDERAL TAX LAWS.



STATE AND LOCAL TAX CONSEQUENCES



The discussion above does not address the taxation of the issuing entity or
the tax consequences of the purchase, ownership or disposition of an interest
in the notes under any state or local tax law. It is suggested that each
investor should consult its own tax advisor regarding state and local tax
consequences.



BENEFIT PLAN INVESTORS



Benefit plans are required to comply with restrictions under the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, known as ERISA, and/or section 4975 of
the Internal Revenue Code, if they are subject to either or both sets of
restrictions. The ERISA restrictions include rules concerning prudence and
diversification of the investment of assets of a benefit plan--referred to as
plan assets. A benefit plan fiduciary should consider whether an investment by
the benefit plan in notes complies with these requirements.


In general, a benefit plan for these purposes includes:


o a plan or arrangement which provides deferred compensation or certain
health or other welfare benefits to employees;


o an employee benefit plan that is tax-qualified under the Internal Revenue
Code and provides deferred compensation to employees--such as a pension,
profit-sharing, section 401(k) or Keogh plan; and


o a collective investment fund or other entity if (i) the fund or entity
has one or more benefit plan investors and (ii) certain "look-through"
rules apply and treat the assets of the fund or entity as constituting
plan assets of the benefit plan investor.


However, a plan maintained by a governmental employer is not a benefit plan
for these purposes. Most plans maintained by religious organizations and plans
maintained by foreign employers for the benefit of employees employed outside
the United States are also not benefit plans for these purposes. A fund or
other entity--including an insurance company general


131





account--considering an investment in notes should consult its tax advisors
concerning whether its assets might be considered plan assets of benefit plan
investors under these rules.



PROHIBITED TRANSACTIONS



ERISA and Section 4975 of the Internal Revenue Code also prohibit
transactions of a specified type between a benefit plan and a party in
interest who is related in a specified manner to the benefit plan. Individual
retirement accounts and tax-qualified plans that provide deferred compensation
to employees are also subject to these prohibited transaction rules unless
they are maintained by a governmental employer or (in most cases) a religious
organization. Violation of these prohibited transaction rules may result in
significant penalties. There are statutory exemptions from the prohibited
transaction rules, and the U.S. Department of Labor has granted administrative
exemptions for specified transactions.



POTENTIAL PROHIBITED TRANSACTIONS FROM INVESTMENT IN NOTES



There are two categories of prohibited transactions that might arise from a
benefit plan's investment in notes. Fiduciaries of benefit plans contemplating
an investment in notes should carefully consider whether the investment would
violate these rules.



PROHIBITED TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN THE BENEFIT PLAN AND A PARTY IN INTEREST



The first category of prohibited transaction could arise on the grounds that
the benefit plan, by purchasing notes, was engaged in a prohibited transaction
with a party in interest. A prohibited transaction could arise, for example,
if the notes were viewed as debt of the transferor and the transferor is a
party in interest as to the benefit plan. A prohibited transaction could also
arise if TRS, the transferor, the indenture trustee, the servicer or another
party with an economic relationship to the issuing entity either:


o is involved in the investment decision for the benefit plan to purchase
notes; or


o is otherwise a party in interest as to the benefit plan.


If a prohibited transaction might result from the benefit plan's purchase of
notes, an administrative exemption from the prohibited transaction rules might
be available to permit an investment in notes. The exemptions that are
potentially available include the following prohibited transaction
class exemptions:


o 96-23, available to "in-house asset managers";


o 95-60, available to insurance company general accounts;


o 91-38, available to bank collective investment funds;


o 90-1, available to insurance company pooled separate accounts; and


o 84-14, available to "qualified professional asset managers."


However, even if the benefit plan is eligible for one of these exemptions,
the exemption may not cover every aspect of the investment by the benefit plan
that might be a prohibited transaction.



PROHIBITED TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN THE ISSUING ENTITY AND A PARTY IN INTEREST



The second category of prohibited transactions could arise if:


132





o a benefit plan acquires notes, and


o under the "look-through" rules of the U.S. Department of Labor plan asset
regulation, assets of the issuer are treated as if they were plan assets
of the benefit plan.


In this case, every transaction by the issuing entity would be treated as a
transaction by the benefit plan using its plan assets.


If assets of the issuing entity are treated as plan assets of a benefit plan
investor, a prohibited transaction could result if the issuing entity itself
engages in a transaction with a party in interest as to the benefit plan. For
example, if the issuing entity's assets are treated as assets of the benefit
plan and the issuing entity holds a credit or charge receivable that is an
obligation of a participant in that same benefit plan, then there would be a
prohibited extension of credit between the benefit plan and a party in
interest, the plan participant.


As a result, if assets of the issuing entity are treated as plan assets,
there would be a significant risk of a prohibited transaction. Moreover, the
prohibited transaction class exemptions referred to above could not be relied
on to exempt all the transactions of the issuing entity from the prohibited
transaction rules. In addition, because all the assets of the issuing entity
would be treated as plan assets, managers of those assets might be required to
comply with the fiduciary responsibility rules of ERISA.


Under an exemption in the plan asset regulation, assets of the issuing
entity would not be considered plan assets, and so this risk of prohibited
transactions should not arise, if a benefit plan purchases a note that:


o is treated as indebtedness under local law, and


o has no "substantial equity features."


The issuing entity expects that all notes offered by this prospectus will be
indebtedness under local law. Likewise, although there is no authority
directly on point, the issuing entity believes that the notes should not be
considered to have substantial equity features. As a result, the plan asset
regulation should not apply to cause assets of the issuing entity to be
treated as plan assets.



INVESTMENT BY BENEFIT PLAN INVESTORS



For the reasons described in the preceding sections, and subject to the
limitations referred to therein, benefit plans can purchase notes. However,
the benefit plan fiduciary must ultimately determine whether the requirements
of the plan asset regulation are satisfied. More generally, the fiduciary must
determine whether the benefit plan's investment in notes will result in one or
more nonexempt prohibited transactions or otherwise violate the provisions of
ERISA or the Internal Revenue Code.



TAX CONSEQUENCES TO BENEFIT PLANS



In general, assuming the notes are debt for federal income tax purposes,
interest income on notes would not be taxable to benefit plans that are tax-
exempt under the Internal Revenue Code, unless the notes were "debt-financed
property" because of borrowings by the benefit plan itself. However, if,
contrary to the opinion of Special Tax Counsel, for federal income tax
purposes, the notes are equity interests in a partnership and the partnership
is viewed as having other outstanding debt, then all or part of the interest
income on the notes would be taxable to


133





the benefit plan as "debt-financed income." Benefit plans should consult their
tax advisors concerning the tax consequences of purchasing notes.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  Overview  American Express Credit Corporation (Credco), together with its subsidiaries, is a wholly owned subsidiary of American Express Travel Related Services Company, Inc. (TRS), which is a wholly owned subsidiary of American Express Company (American Express). Both American Express and TRS are bank holding companies.  Credco is engaged in the business of financing non-interest-earning Card Member receivables arising from the use of the American Express(R) Green Card, the American Express(R) Gold Card, Platinum Card(R), Corporate Card and other American Express cards issued in the U.S. and in certain countries outside the U.S. Credco also finances certain interest-earning revolving loans generated by Card Member spending on American Express credit cards issued in non-U.S. markets, although interest-earning and revolving loans are primarily funded by subsidiaries of TRS other than Credco. American Express charge cards and American Express credit cards are collectively referred to herein as the card.  Certain of the statements in this Form 10-Q report are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Refer to the "Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" section.  Current Business Environment/Outlook  American Express' results for the first quarter of 2014 reflect increased spending by Card Members, continued low write-off rates and lower operating expenses. Billed business grew over the prior year, with higher volumes in the U.S. and internationally. Billed business and revenue growth remained solid but slowed modestly from the fourth quarter of 2013. In addition, the stronger U.S. dollar continued to put downward pressure on American Express' billed business and revenue growth.  Competition remains extremely intense across American Express' businesses. While American Express' business is diversified, the global economic environment remains challenging. In addition, any impact of potential U.S. income tax law changes or volatility in foreign exchange rates remains uncertain.  Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended March 31, 2014 and 2013  Pretax income depends primarily on the volume of Card Member receivables and loans purchased, the discount factor used to determine purchase price, interest earned, interest expense and collectability of Card Member receivables and loans purchased.  Credco's consolidated net income decreased $33 million or 30 percent for the three months ended March 31, 2014 as compared to the same period in 2013. The year-over-year decrease is primarily due to lower interest income, lower discount revenues earned from purchased Card Member receivables and loans and higher provision for losses, partially offset by lower interest expense.  Table of Contents  The following table summarizes the changes attributable to the increase (decrease) in key revenue and expense accounts for the three months ended March 31:  (Millions) 2014 2013 Discount revenue earned from purchased Card Member receivables and loans: Volume of receivables and loans purchased $ 8 $ 17 Discount rates (20 ) 25 Total $ (12 ) $ 42 Interest income from affiliates: Average loans to affiliates $ (13 ) $ 22 Interest rates (14 ) (37) Total $ (27 ) $ (15) Interest income from deposits: Average deposits outstanding $ (1 ) $ - Interest rates - (1) Total $ (1 ) $ (1) Finance revenue: Average Card Member loans outstanding $ 2 $ 1 Interest rates - (1) Total $ 2 $ - Interest expense: Average debt outstanding $ (13 ) $ 21 Interest rates (30 ) (38) Total $ (43 ) $ (17) Interest expense to affiliates: Average debt outstanding $ - $ - Interest rates - (1) Total $ - $ (1)  Discount revenue earned from purchased Card Member receivables and loans  Discount revenue decreased 8 percent or $12 million to $137 million for the three months ended March 31, 2014, as compared to $149 million for the same period in 2013. This change was primarily driven by a 4 basis points decrease in the discount rate charged on Card Member receivables and loans, partially offset by an increase in net volume of receivables and loans purchased by 6 percent or $3 billion to $56 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2014, as compared to $53 billion for the same period in 2013.  Interest income from affiliates  Interest income from affiliates decreased 23 percent or $27 million to $91 million for the three months ended March 31, 2014, as compared to $118 million for the same period in 2013. This change was primarily driven by a decrease of 49 basis points in the annualized effective interest rate charged to affiliates to 3.18 percent for the three months ended March 31, 2014 from 3.67 percent for the same period in 2013, and a decrease in average loan balances with affiliates by 11 percent or $1.4 billion to $11.5 billion for three months ended March 31, 2014 as compared to $12.9 billion for the same period in 2013.  Interest income from deposits  Interest income from deposits decreased by $1 million to nil for the three months ended March 31, 2014, primarily driven by lower average deposit balances during 2014.  Table of Contents  Finance revenue  Finance revenue increased 18 percent or $2 million to $13 million for the three months ended March 31, 2014, as compared to $11 million for the same period in 2013. This change was primarily driven by an increase in the average Card Member loan balance outstanding during 2014.  Provisions for losses  Provisions for losses increased 45 percent or $19 million to $61 million for the three months ended March 31, 2014, as compared to $42 million for the same period in 2013. This change was primarily driven by reserve builds for the three months ended March 31, 2014, as compared to reserve releases for the same period in 2013, and higher net write-offs during the three months ended March 31, 2014.  Interest expense  Interest expense decreased 26 percent or $43 million to $125 million for the three months ended March 31, 2014, as compared to $168 million for the same period in 2013. This change was primarily driven by a decrease in annualized effective interest rates on average debt outstanding by 56 basis points to 2.28 percent for the three months ended March 31, 2014, from 2.84 percent for the same period in 2013, and a decrease in average debt outstanding by 8 percent or $2 billion to $22 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2014, as compared to $24 billion for the same period in 2013.  Interest expense to affiliates  Interest expense to affiliates remained flat at $2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2014, as compared to the same period in 2013.  Other, net  The benefit recorded in other, net decreased by $10 million to a benefit of $22 million for the three months ended March 31, 2014, as compared to a benefit of $32 million for the same period in 2013. This change was primarily driven by a $4 million decrease in the forward points gain generated by foreign exchange forward contracts and a decrease in fair value hedge ineffectiveness gain of $4 million. Credco uses foreign exchange forward contracts to manage foreign exchange risk for certain cross-currency funding activities. At inception, the difference between the spot rate and the contractual forward rate, referred to as the forward points, generates gains (or losses) as a component of the derivative contract's valuation.  Income taxes  The effective tax rates for the three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013 were  Card Member Receivables and Card Member Loans  As of March 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, Credco owned $17.6 billion and $14.5 billion, respectively, of gross Card Member receivables. Card Member receivables represent amounts due on American Express and certain American Express joint venture charge card products and are recorded at the time they are purchased from the seller. Included in Card Member receivables are Credco Receivables Corporation's (CRC) purchases of the participation interests from American Express Receivables Financing Corporation VIII LLC (RFC VIII) in conjunction with TRS' securitization program. As of March 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, CRC owned approximately $5.0 billion and $2.5 billion, respectively, of such participation interests.  Gross Card Member receivables owned as of March 31, 2014 increased approximately $3.1 billion from December 31, 2013, primarily as a result of an increase in Card Member receivables purchased driven by an increase in the seller's interest in the American Express Issuance Trust II (the Charge Trust).  As of March 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, Credco owned gross Card Member loans totaling $499 million and $523 million, respectively. These loans represent revolving amounts due on American Express and certain American Express joint venture lending card products.

Historically 90 days past billing as a % of total, write-offs, net of recoveries and net loss ratio were presented for ICS and GCS.

(e) Credco's net loss ratio represents the amount of Card Member receivables owned by Credco that are written off, net of recoveries, expressed as a percentage of the volume of Card Member receivables purchased by Credco in each of the periods indicated.  Table of Contents  Loans to Affiliates  Credco's loans to affiliates represent floating-rate interest-bearing intercompany borrowings by other wholly-owned subsidiaries of TRS.  The components of loans to affiliates as of March 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013 were as follows:   (Millions) 2014 2013 American Express Services Europe Limited $ 3,217 $ 3,185 American Express Australia Limited 2,987 3,119 Amex Bank of Canada 2,444 3,161 American Express Company 640 819 American Express Co. (Mexico) S.A. de C.V. 538 535 American Express Bank (Mexico) S.A. 417 415 American Express International, Inc. 96 106 Total(a) $ 10,339 $ 11,340  (a) As of March 31, 2014, Credco had $10.3 billion of outstanding loans to affiliates, of which approximately $5.7 billion were collateralized by the underlying Card Member receivables and Card Member loans transferred with recourse and the remaining $4.6 billion were uncollateralized loans primarily with affiliated banks and American Express Company. As of December 31, 2013, Credco had $11.3 billion of outstanding loans to affiliates, of which approximately $5.8 billion were collateralized by the underlying Card Member receivables and Card Member loans transferred with recourse and the remaining $5.5 billion were uncollateralized loans primarily with affiliated banks and American Express Company.  Due from/to Affiliates  As of March 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, amounts due from affiliates were $4.2 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively. As of March 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, amounts due to affiliates were $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively. These amounts relate primarily to timing differences from the purchase of Card Member receivables, net of remittances from TRS, as well as from operating activities.  Short-term Debt to Affiliates  Short-term debt to affiliates consists primarily of master note agreements for which there is no stated term. Credco does not expect any changes to its short-term funding strategies with affiliates.  Components of short-term debt to affiliates as of March 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013 were as follows:   (Millions) 2014 2013 AE Exposure Management Ltd. $ 2,580 $ 2,541 American Express Europe LLC 1,246 261 American Express Swiss Holdings 432 419 American Express Holdings (Netherlands) C.V. 188 188 National Express Company, Inc. - 123 Other 112 51 Total $ 4,558 $ 3,583  Service Fees to Affiliates  Certain affiliates do not explicitly charge Credco a servicing fee for the servicing of receivables purchased. Instead Credco receives a lower discount rate on the receivables sold to Credco than would be the case if servicing fees were charged. If a servicing fee had been charged by these affiliates from which Credco purchases receivables, servicing fees to affiliates would have been higher by approximately $33 million for both the three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013. Correspondingly, discount revenue would have increased by approximately the same amounts in these periods.  Table of Contents  Consolidated Capital Resources and Liquidity  Credco's balance sheet management objectives are to maintain:   A broad, deep and diverse set of funding sources to finance its assets and meet operating requirements; and   Liquidity programs that enable Credco to continuously meet expected future financing obligations and business requirements for at least a 12-month period, even in the event it is unable to continue to raise new funds under its traditional funding programs during a substantial weakening in economic conditions.  Funding Strategy  American Express has in place an enterprise-wide funding policy. The principal funding objective is to maintain broad and well-diversified funding sources to allow American Express, including Credco, to meet its maturing obligations, cost-effectively finance current and future asset growth in its global businesses as well as to maintain a strong liquidity profile. The diversity of funding sources by type of debt instrument, by maturity and by investor base, among other factors, provides additional insulation from the impact of disruptions in any one type of debt, maturity or investor. The mix of Credco's funding in any period will seek to achieve cost efficiency consistent with both maintaining diversified sources and achieving its liquidity objectives. Credco's funding strategy and activities are integrated into its asset-liability management activities.  Credco, like many financial services companies, has historically relied on the debt capital markets to fulfill a substantial amount of its funding needs. It has a variety of funding sources available to access the debt capital markets, including senior unsecured debentures and commercial paper. One of the principal tenets of Credco's funding strategy is to issue debt with a wide range of maturities to distribute its refinancing requirements across future periods. Credco continues to assess its funding needs and investor demand and could change the mix of its existing sources as well as add new sources to its funding  American Express seeks to raise funds to meet the financing needs of itself and all of its subsidiaries, including Credco, including seasonal and other working capital needs, while also seeking to maintain sufficient cash and readily marketable securities that are easily convertible to cash, in order to meet the scheduled maturities of all long-term funding obligations on a consolidated basis for a 12-month period.  Credco's funding strategy is designed, among other things, to maintain appropriate and stable unsecured debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies: Dominion Bond Rating Services (DBRS), Fitch Ratings (Fitch), Moody's Investor Services (Moody's) and Standard & Poor's (S&P). Such ratings help support Credco's access to cost-effective unsecured funding as part of its overall funding strategy.  Credco's short-term ratings, long-term ratings and outlook as disclosed by the four major credit rating agencies are as follows:   Credit Short-Term Long-Term Agency Ratings Ratings Outlook DBRS R-1 (middle) A (high) Stable Fitch F1 A+ Stable Moody's Prime-1 A2 Stable S&P A-2 A- Stable  Downgrades in the ratings of Credco's unsecured debt could result in higher funding costs, as well as higher fees related to borrowings under its unused lines of credit. Declines in credit ratings could also reduce Credco's borrowing capacity in the unsecured term debt and commercial paper markets. The overall level of the funding provided by Credco to other American Express affiliates is impacted by a variety of factors, among them Credco's ratings. To the extent that Credco is subject to a higher cost of funds, whether due to an adverse ratings action or otherwise, the affiliates could continue to use, or could increase their use of, alternative sources of funding for their receivables that offer better pricing.  Table of Contents  Short-term Funding Programs  Credco's issuance and sale of commercial paper is primarily utilized for working capital needs. The amount of short-term borrowings issued in the future will depend on Credco's funding strategy, its needs and market conditions. As of March 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, Credco had nil and $0.2 billion, respectively, of commercial paper outstanding. The average commercial paper outstanding was nil and $0.1 billion during the three months ended March 31, 2014 and the year ended December 31, 2013, respectively.  Long-term Debt Programs  Long-term debt is raised through the offering of debt securities in the United States and capital markets outside the United States. Long-term debt is generally defined as any debt with an original maturity greater than 12 months.  Credco had the following long-term debt outstanding as of March 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013:   (Billions) 2014 2013 Long-term debt outstanding $ 24.0 $ 21.7 Average long-term debt $ 21.9 $ 22.3  Credco has the ability to issue debt securities under shelf registrations filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The latest shelf registration statement filed with the SEC is for an unspecified amount of debt securities. As of March 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, Credco had $16.4 billion and $14.2 billion, respectively, of debt securities outstanding, issued under the SEC registration statement. During the first quarter of 2014, Credco issued $2.3 billion dual-tranche senior unsecured debt consisting of (i) $1.3 billion of fixed-rate senior notes with a maturity of 5 years and a coupon of 2.125 percent and (ii) $1.0 billion of floating-rate senior notes with a maturity of 5 years at a rate of 3-month LIBOR plus 55 basis points.  Credco has established a program for the issuance of debt instruments outside the United States, which is listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange. The prospectus for this program expired in February 2013. Credco expects to renew the prospectus as management deems appropriate. During the three months ended March 31, 2014, no notes were issued under this program. As of both March 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, $1.2 billion of debt instruments were outstanding under this program.  Credco has also established a program in Australia for the issuance of debt securities of up to approximately $5.5 billion (AUD $6.0 billion). During the three months ended March 31, 2014, no notes were issued under this program. As of March 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, the entire amount of approximately $5.5 billion and $5.3 billion, respectively, of notes were available for issuance under this program and the outstanding notes were nil as of such dates.  Credco has also established a medium-term note program in Canada providing for the issuance, when necessary, of up to approximately $3.1 billion (CAD $3.5 billion) of notes by American Express Canada Credit Corporation (AECCC), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Credco. All notes issued by AECCC under this shelf registration are guaranteed by Credco. For the three months ended March 31, 2014, no notes were issued under this program. As of March 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, AECCC had $2.1 billion and $2.2 billion of medium-term notes outstanding under this program, respectively. The financial results of AECCC are included in the consolidated financial results of Credco.  The covenants of debt instruments issued by Credco impose the requirement that Credco maintain a minimum consolidated net worth of $50 million, which limits the amount of dividends Credco could pay to its parent. As of March 31, 2014, management believed Credco was in compliance with all restrictive covenants contained in its debt agreements. During the three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013, Credco paid $78 million and $73 million, respectively, of cash dividends to TRS. The increase in the amount of dividends is primarily driven by . . .  May 06, 2014  (c) 1995-2014 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc. All Rights Reserved
