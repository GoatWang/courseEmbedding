Calendar, Bill Pay & Danger Day℠

See Everything in One Place
Calendar, Bill Pay & Danger Day℠
Calendar
This is not your average calendar, it's your bill payment hub. You'll see everything in one place on a calendar view — your upcoming payday, what you're spending and when you spent it, your scheduled bill reminders and your upcoming payments. You can also see any impending Danger Day℠ and use Online Bill Pay, which means worrying less and making sure late payments don't happen again. Feeling better already, aren't you?
Bill Pay
Gone are the days of worrying about every bill and due date. With PNC Online Bill Pay, we'll help you stay on track. Bills are integrated with the Money Bar® and the Calendar, so you know how much money is set aside and when it's on the way out. You can schedule payments whenever you need to — or set up recurring, automatic payments for even less worry. And while the Calendar is one way to remind yourself of your obligations, we can also send you emails about upcoming due dates to keep you on top of things. You have enough deadlines. Go ahead and cross this one off.
Danger Day
We've all had those weeks when the bills outweigh the paychecks and due dates loom. Enter Danger Day. Color-coded in red (so you won't miss it), it shows up on your Calendar when your Spend account is at risk of being overdrawn. This way, you can keep ahead by moving money from Reserve or changing the day a bill is paid. Stay on time, every time.
Images for illustrative purposes only.





Next Feature: Money Bar






Money Bar®

Move Money Easily
Money Bar®
Get a bird's eye view of what your money's up to. The Money Bar puts it into three categories: Scheduled Out (the money allocated for bills and other payments), Free (money that's available to spend), and Reserve (the money you've tucked away). It's our way of making everything clearer.
Once you've got a good idea of where everything is, you can make adjustments. Need extra money for date night? Got a little left over you want to put toward that vacation? Using the Slider, you can move money back and forth between Spend and Reserve with no effort. Managing your funds is literally in your hands.
Images for illustrative purposes only.



Previous Feature: Calendar, Bill Pay & Danger DayNext Feature: Wish List





Wish List

Set Goals and Reach Them
Wish List

What's the point of working hard if you're not treating yourself once in a while, right? The Wish List is where you'll set sights on the things you want and start saving. You can put money toward each item in your Reserve account, keep track of your progress, and transfer money to Spend when you've reached your goal. And you can give certain items priority. So, if you really need a new fridge before that trip to Bora Bora, you can put money where it's needed.
And while we're on the subject, don't forget Reserve Items. They let you set aside money for future expenses and get a reminder on your Calendar.
Images for illustrative purposes only.



Previous Feature: Money BarNext Feature: Spending Zone





Spending + Budgets

Track Your Spending
Spending + Budgets

It's easy for money to fly out the door, especially when you're having fun. Spending + Budget's tools provide a simple way to see what you're spending your money on each month - and get a hold on it. Broken down into categories like Education, Restaurants, Gas and more, it allows you to set a budget for each. You can also set up to get handy reminder emails if you're close to maxing out your budget for any category. That way, you can hit the brakes before going over the edge.
Images for illustrative purposes only.




Previous Feature: Wish ListNext Feature: Savings Engine





Savings Engine®

Save Without Even Thinking About It
Savings Engine®

You can't always think about saving, especially when you're too busy spending. That's why we built the Savings Engine. It gives you three easy ways to put cash aside — even when saving is not exactly top-of-mind. With the Payday Savings rule, a predetermined amount will automatically transfer from Spend to Growth on days you've designated as pay days. Bill Pay makes it easy to transfer money to Growth whenever you pay a bill online from your Calendar. Punch the Pig® is an on-the-fly way to add money to Growth while you're banking online.
Images for illustrative purposes only.



Previous Feature: Spending ZoneNext Feature: Punch the Pig





Punch the Pig®

Saving Made Fun
Punch the Pig®

The only thing more rewarding than saving money is having a little fun doing it. That's the idea with Punch the Pig. When you're banking online, just "punch" the piggy bank and money (the amount of your choice) will transfer from your Spend account to your Growth account. (That "punch" is a "shake" for smartphone users.) Go ahead. You know you want to.
Images for illustrative purposes only.



Previous Feature: Savings EngineNext Feature: Mobile





Mobile

Master Your Money Wherever You Are
Mobile Banking

With Virtual Wallet, your bank is only as far away as your mobile device. You can bank when and where you want with the Virtual Wallet Insider app. You can use your iPhone®, Android™ or other supported mobile device, including tablets.
Our new app, Virtual Wallet Insider, offers you all the same major features found on desktop combined with exclusively mobile tools like mobile deposit and Money Bar Preview.

Credit Card

Calendar - View your credit card balance alongside your Spend account balance as well as past charges on your credit card, payments to your card, when your payments are due and when your next statement is created
Spending + Budgets - See your credit card transactions automatically sorted in to different categories to help you better understand and track your spending
Mobile - Manage your credit card on the go with our Virtual Wallet app[1]

Previous Feature: Mobile












Spend, Save and Grow
Virtual Wallet is comprised of three distinct accounts, working together as one seamless, online money management tool.



SPEND is your primary checking account.
It's designed for your everyday spending. Debit card purchases are deducted from your Spend (you can withdraw money at ATMs from any of your accounts). You’ll use Spend to pay bills by check or through Online Bill Pay. It also works in harmony with your Reserve.



GROWTH is your long-term savings account.
It functions as your secondary Overdraft Protection. The competitive interest rate[2] makes it perfect for you to build your nest egg and grow financially. Put money into your Growth to save up for life-changing purchases ahead - a car, a down payment on a house, or even a dream vacation.
 



RESERVE is your short-term savings account.
It functions as your primary Overdraft Protection — so if you're at risk of overdrawing your Spend account, money can be automatically transferred from your Reserve to your Spend at no charge. Utilize your Reserve to set aside money for upcoming expenses.



Add a PNC Credit Card.
Rewards, cash back or low interest...no matter what you are looking for in a credit card, we've got you covered. Add your PNC credit card to your Virtual Wallet to receive the same money management tools and view of your spending.

Important Legal Disclosures and Information




Offers are available from participating merchants. Your personal banking information is not shared with the merchants participating in PNC Purchase Payback. Whether you receive offers may depend on using your PNC Visa Card, or where you use your PNC Visa card to make purchases. Not everyone will get the same offer.


In order to qualify for a Relationship Rate for Premiere Money Market, you must have a linked checking account (for the Performance Checking Relationship Rate, you must have a linked Performance Checking or Virtual Wallet® with Performance Spend; for the Performance Select Checking Relationship Rate, you must have a linked Performance Select Checking or Virtual Wallet with Performance Select) and meet one of the following requirements:

Make a combination of 5 or more PIN and/or signature point-of-sale transactions (excluding cash advances) posted during the previous calendar month to your Checking account using your Visa® Debit Card or to your linked Visa Credit Card.
Have $2,000 in qualifying direct deposits ($1,000 for WorkPlace or Military Banking customers) in a linked Virtual Wallet with Performance Spend or Performance Checking during the previous calendar month.
Have $5,000 in qualifying direct deposits in a linked Virtual Wallet with Performance Select or Performance Select Checking during the previous calendar month.

(A qualifying direct deposit is a recurring electronic deposit made by an employer or an outside agency. Transfers made from one account to another or deposits made via a branch, ATM, online transfer, mobile device or the mail are not eligible to meet this requirement.)
Starting with the calendar month following when you open your Premiere Money Market account, and monthly thereafter, whether the account earns the variable Standard or Relationship Rate for the entire calendar month will be determined on the first of the month based upon the number of qualifying transactions or direct deposit requirement from the previous calendar month.

If there are changes to your linked checking account (it is closed, changed to a new account type or no longer linked to your Premiere Money Market account), you may no longer qualify for a Relationship Rate, or the rates may otherwise change to those in effect at the time of the change.


In order to qualify for the Relationship Rate for Standard Savings, you must have a linked Standard Checking, Performance Checking, Virtual Wallet® with Performance Spend, Performance Select Checking or Virtual Wallet with Performance Select and meet any one of the following requirements:

Make a combination of 5 or more PIN and/or signature point-of-sale transactions (excluding cash advances) posted during the previous calendar month to your Checking account using your Visa® Debit Card or to your linked Visa Credit Card.
Have $500 in qualifying direct deposits in a linked Standard Checking during the previous calendar month.
Have $2,000 in qualifying direct deposits ($1,000 for WorkPlace or Military Banking customers) in a linked Virtual Wallet with Performance Spend or a Performance Checking during the previous calendar month.
Have $5,000 in qualifying direct deposits in a linked Virtual Wallet with Performance Select or a Performance Select Checking during the previous calendar month.

(A qualifying debit card purchase is defined as any debit card purchase made at point of sale using your signature PIN, or a purchase made electronically or online using your debit card number, inlcuding recurring payments.)
 
Starting with the calendar month following when you open your Standard Savings account, and monthly thereafter, whether the account earns the variable Standard or Relationship Rate for the entire calendar month will be determined on the first of the month based upon the number of qualifying transactions or direct deposit requirement from the previous calendar month.

If you or we make changes to your linked checking account (it is closed, changed to a new account type or no longer linked to your Standard Savings account), you may no longer qualify for a Relationship Rate.


A qualifying direct deposit is a recurring electronic deposit made by an employer or an outside agency. Transfers made from one account to another or deposits made via a branch, ATM, online transfer, mobile device or the mail are not eligible to meet this requirement.


PNC deposit accounts include consumer checking, savings, money market, certificate of deposit, and retirement certificate of deposit. PNC loan accounts include line of credit, auto or home equity installment loan, and mortgage loan. PNC linked investment balances include investment balances from a PNC Investments account including the value of any annuities if they are reflected on the PNC Investments account statement.

Corporate & Institutional Banking
PNC competes to win in the middle market, where we are proud to be one of the leading credit providers to middle market companies across the country. PNC is in the top five syndicators of middle market loan transactions for each of the last five years.
But credit is only part of the story. Underpinning our success at building deep and lasting relationships with middle market clients is our breadth of capabilities--including extensive treasury management, capital markets and international banking services--many of which have been tailored specifically for the middle market audience.
PNC is an industry leader in many other target markets as well. Our client list includes more than two-thirds of the Fortune® 500 as well as thousands of real estate, utilities, healthcare, government, higher education and not-for-profit entities. All of these clients, including many of the nation's largest competitors in their respective specialties, benefit from PNC's deep industry knowledge and our sophisticated capital raising, treasury management and capital markets capabilities.
Whether your strategy involves growing your company with access to the right capital, or transitioning ownership to your employees or enabling a strategic direction, PNC can help. Through Harris Williams, one of the nation's largest and most successful M&A advisory teams focused exclusively on the middle market, Solebury, a premier Equity Capital Markets and Investor Relations Advisory firm, and PNC ESOP Solutions, we offer a family of capabilities and specialized advisors to provide sophisticated advice and hands-on transaction support.

BlackRock works on behalf of institutional and individual investors worldwide through a variety of equity, fixed income, liquidity and alternative investment products.

The two biggest banks based in Pittsburgh will soon debut Zelle Network.
PNC Financial Services Group Inc. and F.N.B. Corp. both confirmed on Monday that their customers will be able to send and use money through Early Warning Services’ new person-to-person payments network.

Zelle allows for funds to be sent from one bank account to another in minutes, using only a recipient’s email address or mobile number. Beginning this week, and continuing on a rolling basis over the next 12 months, Zelle will become available in the mobile banking apps of more than 30 participating financial institutions. Dollar Bank, also based in Pittsburgh, was listed among the participants, but did not reveal a time frame.




PNC said it will roll out Zelle in the coming weeks. William Demchak, chairman, president and CEO, talked about the debut on May 31 when he spoke with financial analysts at the 33rd annual Bernstein Strategic Decisions Conference in New York.
“Zelle will be embedded directly into our mobile banking experience and that means no downloads and no hassle. Zelle will be easy to access and navigate with [an] intuitive and consistent user experience, and the ability to quickly move money is only a few taps away,” Karen Larrimer, PNC’s head of retail banking and chief customer officer, said in a prepared statement. “Payments can be sent using either a registered email address or mobile number so customers never have to give out their bank account information.”




 


F.N.B. (NYSE:FNB) said its customers will have access to Zelle via its online banking and its direct mobile banking app by early 2018.
“F.N.B. has one of the most comprehensive digital product sets in the industry, and we are proud to enhance it even further with the latest in payments technology,” President and CEO Vincent Delie Jr. said in a prepared statement. “By offering Zelle through our online and mobile banking channels, we will deliver the speed and seamless experience customers expect, along with the security and convenience of working with their bank.”

History[edit]

PNC's offices in Troy, Michigan.


PNC Financial Services traces its history to the Pittsburgh Trust and Savings Company which was founded in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on April 10, 1845.[21][22] Due to the long recovery from the Great Fire of Pittsburgh, PNC was not fully operational until January 28, 1852,[23] when it opened offices at Liberty Avenue and 12th street. The bank was renamed The Pittsburgh Trust Company in 1853.[24] In 1858, the company located its corporate offices at the corner of Fifth Avenue and Wood Street in Pittsburgh where they remain to this day. The bank changed its name to First National Bank of Pittsburgh in 1863, after it became the first bank in the country to apply for a national charter[21] as part of that year's National Banking Act. It received charter #48 on August 5, 1863, with other later banks receiving charters sooner due to paperwork problems and the fact that the bank was already in business.[21][24]
By 1959, after a series of mergers, the bank had evolved into the Pittsburgh National Bank,[25] which later became the leading subsidiary of Pittsburgh National Corporation. Another branch of the current bank, the Philadelphia based Provident National Corporation, dates back to the mid-19th century.[26]
In 1982, Pittsburgh National Corporation and Provident National Corporation merged into a new entity named PNC Financial Corporation, so the acronym technically doesn't stand for anything.[27] It was the largest bank merger in American history at the time and created a company with $10.3 billion in assets.[28][29] Between 1991 and 1996, PNC purchased more than ten smaller banks and financial institutions that broadened its market base from Kentucky to the Greater New York metropolitan area.
National City acquisition[edit]
For more details on this topic, see National City acquisition by PNC.
On October 24, 2008, during the financial crisis of 2007-2008, PNC announced that it would acquire Cleveland-based National City Corp. for $5.2 billion in stock.[30] The announcement came hours after PNC sold preferred stock to the United States Treasury as part of the $700 billion bailout plan, which it repurchased within two years.[31]
The deal helped PNC double in size and to become the sixth largest bank in the United States by deposit and fifth largest by branches and made PNC the largest bank in Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Kentucky, as well as the second largest bank in Maryland and Indiana. It also greatly expanded PNC's presence in the Midwest as well as entering the Florida market. National City complemented PNC's presence, as Western Pennsylvania, Cincinnati, Ohio and Louisville, Kentucky were among the few markets before the acquisition deal in which both banks had a major presence.[32]
PNC then had its footprint stretch from New York City to St. Louis, with branches as far south as Miami and as far north as Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan on the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. PNC completed the conversion of the National City branches on June 14, 2010.[33]
Other acquisitions[edit]
PNC acquired the former United National Bancorp based in Bridgewater, New Jersey in 2004.
In 2005, PNC acquired Riggs Bank, which operated in the Washington, DC, area. Riggs had aided Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet in laundering money.[34][35]
PNC completed the acquisition of Maryland-based Mercantile Bankshares on March 2, 2007, making PNC the eighth largest bank in the United States by deposits.[35][36][37] On October 26, 2007, PNC completed the acquisition of Yardville National Bancorp, a small commercial bank centered in central New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania.[35][38] On April 4, 2008, PNC completed the acquisition of Sterling Financial Corporation, a commercial and consumer bank with accounts and branches in central Pennsylvania, northeastern Maryland and Delaware.[35][39]
On September 15, 2007, PNC Bank acquired Citizens National Bank of Laurel, Maryland.[40]

On August 14, 2009, PNC took over Dwelling House Savings & Loan and its only branch location in Pittsburgh's Hill District after Dwelling House failed and was placed under receivership by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.[41] PNC agreed to assume all of Dwelling House's assets, and the branch became a PNC branch on August 17. Dwelling House had been known in Pittsburgh to provide low-income African Americans loans that other banks would deny, and had fended off receivership from the FDIC as recently as June 2009 through community fundraisers. PNC closed the former Dwelling House branch shortly after assuming Dwelling House's assets, with accounts transferred to the pre-existing PNC branch in the Hill District.[42]
In 2011, PNC bought BankAtlantic's Tampa Bay Area branches.[43][44]
Also in 2011, PNC acquired 27 branches in the northern Atlanta suburbs with $240 million in deposits and $42 million in book value from Flagstar Bank.[45][46]
In 2012, PNC acquired RBC Bank from Royal Bank of Canada for $3.45 billion.[47][48] RBC Bank had a 426 branches in southern Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, and Florida. Of these regions, PNC had existing branches only in Florida. PNC entered growing markets in the Southeastern US, such as Birmingham, Charlotte, Norfolk/Virginia Beach (Hampton Roads), Mobile, North Florida, Richmond, Greensboro/Winston-Salem (Piedmont Triad), and Raleigh/Durham (Research Triangle). At the same time, it expanded PNC's presence in South Florida, Tampa Bay Area to Orlando, and Atlanta. This acquisition filled a gap in PNC's market footprint between northern Virginia and central Florida, adding about 900,000 customers and 483 ATM locations. It made PNC the 5th largest bank by branches behind Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Chase, and U.S. Bancorp and the 6th largest by total assets behind the aforementioned four banks and Citibank.[3]
Sale of PNC Global Investment Servicing (2010)[edit]
PNC's Global Investment Servicing subsidiary was the second-largest full-service mutual fund transfer agent in the U.S and the second-largest full service accounting & administration provider to U.S. mutual funds. PNC Global Investment Servicing had provided services to the global investment industry since 1973. With 4,700 employees, PNC Global Investment Servicing operated from the Republic of Ireland, the United States and the Cayman Islands, PNC International Bank Limited operated from Luxembourg. PNC Global Investment Servicing serviced $1.9 trillion in total assets and 58 million shareholder accounts. In 2007, PNC Global Investment Servicing Trustee & Custodial Services Limited was awarded a banking licence by financial regulators allowing it to expand further into Europe. As a result, the name changed to PNC Global Investment Servicing. PNC Global Investment Servicing was formally known as PFPC until July 2008.
In 2010, The Bank of New York Mellon acquired PNC’s Global Investment Servicing.[49] PNC had sold the division to repay funds from the Troubled Asset Relief Program, which were used for the National City acquisition.
The Tower at PNC Plaza[edit]




One PNC Plaza. PNC's former corporate headquarters in Downtown Pittsburgh.


Main article: Tower at PNC Plaza
PNC is headquartered in a modern, 40 floor, 800,000-square-foot (74,000 m2) skyscraper it built from 2012–2015, located on the corner of Fifth Avenue and Wood Street in Downtown Pittsburgh. Officially opened on October 2, 2015, the building is named The Tower at PNC Plaza, in contradistinction to the previous headquarters building, known as One PNC Plaza, and located at 249 Fifth Avenue, catercorner to the new headquarters tower. The new building continues the company's continuous presence at this location since its earliest operations.[50]
On May 23, 2011, PNC unveiled plans for the $400M project, originally intended at 40 stories.[51]
PNC owns the building and occupies all its space, except for street-level storefronts which are leased to retail tenants.
The Tower is one of the world's most environmentally friendly skyscrapers. Some of its features include a double glass facade to reduce cooling costs and promote natural airflow into the building, a high-efficiency climate-control system to heat or cool specific zones of the building as needed, and a pair of living rooftops to collect and channel rainwater and reduce heat gain. Alternative energy sources, such as fuel cells, and solar and geothermal power, are being considered in an effort to reduce carbon emissions.[52]
Harris Teeter partnership[edit]
On July 30, 2012, PNC announced plans to put ATMs in 138 Harris Teeter grocery stores in the Carolinas, plus 53 other stores.[53]
Legal issues[edit]
Overcharging of Black and Hispanic borrowers by National City[edit]
In December 2013, the Department of Justice and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau announced that they had reached an agreement with National City Bank to resolve allegations that the bank had charged Black and Hispanic borrowers higher prices for mortgages between 2002 and 2008 (before the acquisition by PNC). In the complaint, regulators claimed that National City had violated the FHA and ECOA by charging more than 75,000 borrowers higher loan rates based on their race or ethnicity rather than their risk level. National City’s lack of pricing guidelines resulted in black borrowers being charged an average of $159 more in extra upfront fees or higher interest than white borrowers. Black borrowers also paid an average of $228 more annually over the life of the loan than white borrowers. Hispanics paid $125 more upfront and $154 more annually than white borrowers. Under the terms of the settlement, PNC was required to pay victims $35 million.[54]
Leak of account information[edit]
PNC Bank was forced to reissue hundreds of debit cards to customers in March 2006 when their account information was compromised.[55]
Lawsuit from Military Channel[edit]
Also in March 2006, PNC Bank was sued by Paul Bariteau, an investor in the Military Channel. Bariteau claimed PNC let the chairman of the Military Channel make unauthorized withdrawals of millions of dollars from the channel's account for personal use. The counter-claim was that Bariteau was only trying to recoup losses from a bad investment.[56]
Securities fraud settlement[edit]
In June 2003, PNC Bank agreed to pay $115 million to settle federal securities fraud charges after one of its subsidiaries fraudulently transferred $762 million in bad loans and other venture capital investments to an AIG entity in order to conceal them from investors.[57]
Overtime claim by loan officers[edit]
In 2017, PNC agreed to pay $16 million to settle claims of overtime wages by loan officers under the Fair Labor Standards Act.[58]
Criticism[edit]
National Prearranged Services Fraud[edit]
In 2015, PNC Bank was found guilty and ordered to pay $391 million in damages for its role in an insurance scam involving prepaid funeral contracts at the now-defunct National Prearranged Services (NPS).
According to the lawsuit, funds entrusted to NPS, a St.Louis-based company that sold prepaid funerals, were diverted and embezzled would be safeguarded in a trust and backed by life insurance policies.
PNC Bank is the successor to Allegiant Bank, which served as a trustee for the company from 1998 to 2004.
Allegiant, PNC's predecessor, failed to supervise NPS's assets and allowed the company to pillage the NPS trust assets.[3]
Municipal Bonds Disclosure Violations[edit]
In 2015, PNC Bank's capital markets group violated disclosure requirements, for municipal bonds, by failing to divulge that the issuers had filed financial reports late. As a result, they were fined $500,000.[4]
Community initiatives[edit]
The corporation has sponsored a number of initiatives to improve education, health and human services, and cultural and arts activities. These include a "PNC Grow Up Great" commitment to early childhood development, the "PNC Foundation", and community development investments.[59]
Since 1984, PNC Financial Services has compiled the Christmas Price Index, a humorous economic indicator which estimates the prices of the items found in the song "The Twelve Days of Christmas".
In 2012, PNC opened the PNC Fairfax Connection, a next generation community center in Cleveland, OH.[60]

History[edit]

PNC's offices in Troy, Michigan.


PNC Financial Services traces its history to the Pittsburgh Trust and Savings Company which was founded in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on April 10, 1845.[21][22] Due to the long recovery from the Great Fire of Pittsburgh, PNC was not fully operational until January 28, 1852,[23] when it opened offices at Liberty Avenue and 12th street. The bank was renamed The Pittsburgh Trust Company in 1853.[24] In 1858, the company located its corporate offices at the corner of Fifth Avenue and Wood Street in Pittsburgh where they remain to this day. The bank changed its name to First National Bank of Pittsburgh in 1863, after it became the first bank in the country to apply for a national charter[21] as part of that year's National Banking Act. It received charter #48 on August 5, 1863, with other later banks receiving charters sooner due to paperwork problems and the fact that the bank was already in business.[21][24]
By 1959, after a series of mergers, the bank had evolved into the Pittsburgh National Bank,[25] which later became the leading subsidiary of Pittsburgh National Corporation. Another branch of the current bank, the Philadelphia based Provident National Corporation, dates back to the mid-19th century.[26]
In 1982, Pittsburgh National Corporation and Provident National Corporation merged into a new entity named PNC Financial Corporation, so the acronym technically doesn't stand for anything.[27] It was the largest bank merger in American history at the time and created a company with $10.3 billion in assets.[28][29] Between 1991 and 1996, PNC purchased more than ten smaller banks and financial institutions that broadened its market base from Kentucky to the Greater New York metropolitan area.
National City acquisition[edit]
For more details on this topic, see National City acquisition by PNC.
On October 24, 2008, during the financial crisis of 2007-2008, PNC announced that it would acquire Cleveland-based National City Corp. for $5.2 billion in stock.[30] The announcement came hours after PNC sold preferred stock to the United States Treasury as part of the $700 billion bailout plan, which it repurchased within two years.[31]
The deal helped PNC double in size and to become the sixth largest bank in the United States by deposit and fifth largest by branches and made PNC the largest bank in Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Kentucky, as well as the second largest bank in Maryland and Indiana. It also greatly expanded PNC's presence in the Midwest as well as entering the Florida market. National City complemented PNC's presence, as Western Pennsylvania, Cincinnati, Ohio and Louisville, Kentucky were among the few markets before the acquisition deal in which both banks had a major presence.[32]
PNC then had its footprint stretch from New York City to St. Louis, with branches as far south as Miami and as far north as Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan on the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. PNC completed the conversion of the National City branches on June 14, 2010.[33]
Other acquisitions[edit]
PNC acquired the former United National Bancorp based in Bridgewater, New Jersey in 2004.
In 2005, PNC acquired Riggs Bank, which operated in the Washington, DC, area. Riggs had aided Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet in laundering money.[34][35]
PNC completed the acquisition of Maryland-based Mercantile Bankshares on March 2, 2007, making PNC the eighth largest bank in the United States by deposits.[35][36][37] On October 26, 2007, PNC completed the acquisition of Yardville National Bancorp, a small commercial bank centered in central New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania.[35][38] On April 4, 2008, PNC completed the acquisition of Sterling Financial Corporation, a commercial and consumer bank with accounts and branches in central Pennsylvania, northeastern Maryland and Delaware.[35][39]
On September 15, 2007, PNC Bank acquired Citizens National Bank of Laurel, Maryland.[40]

On August 14, 2009, PNC took over Dwelling House Savings & Loan and its only branch location in Pittsburgh's Hill District after Dwelling House failed and was placed under receivership by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.[41] PNC agreed to assume all of Dwelling House's assets, and the branch became a PNC branch on August 17. Dwelling House had been known in Pittsburgh to provide low-income African Americans loans that other banks would deny, and had fended off receivership from the FDIC as recently as June 2009 through community fundraisers. PNC closed the former Dwelling House branch shortly after assuming Dwelling House's assets, with accounts transferred to the pre-existing PNC branch in the Hill District.[42]
In 2011, PNC bought BankAtlantic's Tampa Bay Area branches.[43][44]
Also in 2011, PNC acquired 27 branches in the northern Atlanta suburbs with $240 million in deposits and $42 million in book value from Flagstar Bank.[45][46]
In 2012, PNC acquired RBC Bank from Royal Bank of Canada for $3.45 billion.[47][48] RBC Bank had a 426 branches in southern Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, and Florida. Of these regions, PNC had existing branches only in Florida. PNC entered growing markets in the Southeastern US, such as Birmingham, Charlotte, Norfolk/Virginia Beach (Hampton Roads), Mobile, North Florida, Richmond, Greensboro/Winston-Salem (Piedmont Triad), and Raleigh/Durham (Research Triangle). At the same time, it expanded PNC's presence in South Florida, Tampa Bay Area to Orlando, and Atlanta. This acquisition filled a gap in PNC's market footprint between northern Virginia and central Florida, adding about 900,000 customers and 483 ATM locations. It made PNC the 5th largest bank by branches behind Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Chase, and U.S. Bancorp and the 6th largest by total assets behind the aforementioned four banks and Citibank.[3]
Sale of PNC Global Investment Servicing (2010)[edit]
PNC's Global Investment Servicing subsidiary was the second-largest full-service mutual fund transfer agent in the U.S and the second-largest full service accounting & administration provider to U.S. mutual funds. PNC Global Investment Servicing had provided services to the global investment industry since 1973. With 4,700 employees, PNC Global Investment Servicing operated from the Republic of Ireland, the United States and the Cayman Islands, PNC International Bank Limited operated from Luxembourg. PNC Global Investment Servicing serviced $1.9 trillion in total assets and 58 million shareholder accounts. In 2007, PNC Global Investment Servicing Trustee & Custodial Services Limited was awarded a banking licence by financial regulators allowing it to expand further into Europe. As a result, the name changed to PNC Global Investment Servicing. PNC Global Investment Servicing was formally known as PFPC until July 2008.
In 2010, The Bank of New York Mellon acquired PNC’s Global Investment Servicing.[49] PNC had sold the division to repay funds from the Troubled Asset Relief Program, which were used for the National City acquisition.

Main article: Tower at PNC Plaza
PNC is headquartered in a modern, 40 floor, 800,000-square-foot (74,000 m2) skyscraper it built from 2012–2015, located on the corner of Fifth Avenue and Wood Street in Downtown Pittsburgh. Officially opened on October 2, 2015, the building is named The Tower at PNC Plaza, in contradistinction to the previous headquarters building, known as One PNC Plaza, and located at 249 Fifth Avenue, catercorner to the new headquarters tower. The new building continues the company's continuous presence at this location since its earliest operations.[50]
On May 23, 2011, PNC unveiled plans for the $400M project, originally intended at 40 stories.[51]
PNC owns the building and occupies all its space, except for street-level storefronts which are leased to retail tenants.
The Tower is one of the world's most environmentally friendly skyscrapers. Some of its features include a double glass facade to reduce cooling costs and promote natural airflow into the building, a high-efficiency climate-control system to heat or cool specific zones of the building as needed, and a pair of living rooftops to collect and channel rainwater and reduce heat gain. Alternative energy sources, such as fuel cells, and solar and geothermal power, are being considered in an effort to reduce carbon emissions.[52]
Harris Teeter partnership[edit]
On July 30, 2012, PNC announced plans to put ATMs in 138 Harris Teeter grocery stores in the Carolinas, plus 53 other stores.[53]
Legal issues[edit]
Overcharging of Black and Hispanic borrowers by National City[edit]
In December 2013, the Department of Justice and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau announced that they had reached an agreement with National City Bank to resolve allegations that the bank had charged Black and Hispanic borrowers higher prices for mortgages between 2002 and 2008 (before the acquisition by PNC). In the complaint, regulators claimed that National City had violated the FHA and ECOA by charging more than 75,000 borrowers higher loan rates based on their race or ethnicity rather than their risk level. National City’s lack of pricing guidelines resulted in black borrowers being charged an average of $159 more in extra upfront fees or higher interest than white borrowers. Black borrowers also paid an average of $228 more annually over the life of the loan than white borrowers. Hispanics paid $125 more upfront and $154 more annually than white borrowers. Under the terms of the settlement, PNC was required to pay victims $35 million.[54]
Leak of account information[edit]
PNC Bank was forced to reissue hundreds of debit cards to customers in March 2006 when their account information was compromised.[55]
Lawsuit from Military Channel[edit]
Also in March 2006, PNC Bank was sued by Paul Bariteau, an investor in the Military Channel. Bariteau claimed PNC let the chairman of the Military Channel make unauthorized withdrawals of millions of dollars from the channel's account for personal use. The counter-claim was that Bariteau was only trying to recoup losses from a bad investment.[56]
Securities fraud settlement[edit]
In June 2003, PNC Bank agreed to pay $115 million to settle federal securities fraud charges after one of its subsidiaries fraudulently transferred $762 million in bad loans and other venture capital investments to an AIG entity in order to conceal them from investors.[57]
Overtime claim by loan officers[edit]
In 2017, PNC agreed to pay $16 million to settle claims of overtime wages by loan officers under the Fair Labor Standards Act.[58]
Criticism[edit]
National Prearranged Services Fraud[edit]
In 2015, PNC Bank was found guilty and ordered to pay $391 million in damages for its role in an insurance scam involving prepaid funeral contracts at the now-defunct National Prearranged Services (NPS).
According to the lawsuit, funds entrusted to NPS, a St.Louis-based company that sold prepaid funerals, were diverted and embezzled would be safeguarded in a trust and backed by life insurance policies.
PNC Bank is the successor to Allegiant Bank, which served as a trustee for the company from 1998 to 2004.
Allegiant, PNC's predecessor, failed to supervise NPS's assets and allowed the company to pillage the NPS trust assets.[3]
Municipal Bonds Disclosure Violations[edit]
In 2015, PNC Bank's capital markets group violated disclosure requirements, for municipal bonds, by failing to divulge that the issuers had filed financial reports late. As a result, they were fined $500,000.[4]
Community initiatives[edit]
The corporation has sponsored a number of initiatives to improve education, health and human services, and cultural and arts activities. These include a "PNC Grow Up Great" commitment to early childhood development, the "PNC Foundation", and community development investments.[59]
Since 1984, PNC Financial Services has compiled the Christmas Price Index, a humorous economic indicator which estimates the prices of the items found in the song "The Twelve Days of Christmas".
In 2012, PNC opened the PNC Fairfax Connection, a next generation community center in Cleveland, OH.[60]

History[edit]

PNC's offices in Troy, Michigan.


PNC Financial Services traces its history to the Pittsburgh Trust and Savings Company which was founded in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on April 10, 1845.[21][22] Due to the long recovery from the Great Fire of Pittsburgh, PNC was not fully operational until January 28, 1852,[23] when it opened offices at Liberty Avenue and 12th street. The bank was renamed The Pittsburgh Trust Company in 1853.[24] In 1858, the company located its corporate offices at the corner of Fifth Avenue and Wood Street in Pittsburgh where they remain to this day. The bank changed its name to First National Bank of Pittsburgh in 1863, after it became the first bank in the country to apply for a national charter[21] as part of that year's National Banking Act. It received charter #48 on August 5, 1863, with other later banks receiving charters sooner due to paperwork problems and the fact that the bank was already in business.[21][24]
By 1959, after a series of mergers, the bank had evolved into the Pittsburgh National Bank,[25] which later became the leading subsidiary of Pittsburgh National Corporation. Another branch of the current bank, the Philadelphia based Provident National Corporation, dates back to the mid-19th century.[26]
In 1982, Pittsburgh National Corporation and Provident National Corporation merged into a new entity named PNC Financial Corporation, so the acronym technically doesn't stand for anything.[27] It was the largest bank merger in American history at the time and created a company with $10.3 billion in assets.[28][29] Between 1991 and 1996, PNC purchased more than ten smaller banks and financial institutions that broadened its market base from Kentucky to the Greater New York metropolitan area.
National City acquisition[edit]
For more details on this topic, see National City acquisition by PNC.
On October 24, 2008, during the financial crisis of 2007-2008, PNC announced that it would acquire Cleveland-based National City Corp. for $5.2 billion in stock.[30] The announcement came hours after PNC sold preferred stock to the United States Treasury as part of the $700 billion bailout plan, which it repurchased within two years.[31]
The deal helped PNC double in size and to become the sixth largest bank in the United States by deposit and fifth largest by branches and made PNC the largest bank in Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Kentucky, as well as the second largest bank in Maryland and Indiana. It also greatly expanded PNC's presence in the Midwest as well as entering the Florida market. National City complemented PNC's presence, as Western Pennsylvania, Cincinnati, Ohio and Louisville, Kentucky were among the few markets before the acquisition deal in which both banks had a major presence.[32]
PNC then had its footprint stretch from New York City to St. Louis, with branches as far south as Miami and as far north as Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan on the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. PNC completed the conversion of the National City branches on June 14, 2010.[33]
Other acquisitions[edit]
PNC acquired the former United National Bancorp based in Bridgewater, New Jersey in 2004.
In 2005, PNC acquired Riggs Bank, which operated in the Washington, DC, area. Riggs had aided Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet in laundering money.[34][35]
PNC completed the acquisition of Maryland-based Mercantile Bankshares on March 2, 2007, making PNC the eighth largest bank in the United States by deposits.[35][36][37] On October 26, 2007, PNC completed the acquisition of Yardville National Bancorp, a small commercial bank centered in central New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania.[35][38] On April 4, 2008, PNC completed the acquisition of Sterling Financial Corporation, a commercial and consumer bank with accounts and branches in central Pennsylvania, northeastern Maryland and Delaware.[35][39]
On September 15, 2007, PNC Bank acquired Citizens National Bank of Laurel, Maryland.[40]

On August 14, 2009, PNC took over Dwelling House Savings & Loan and its only branch location in Pittsburgh's Hill District after Dwelling House failed and was placed under receivership by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.[41] PNC agreed to assume all of Dwelling House's assets, and the branch became a PNC branch on August 17. Dwelling House had been known in Pittsburgh to provide low-income African Americans loans that other banks would deny, and had fended off receivership from the FDIC as recently as June 2009 through community fundraisers. PNC closed the former Dwelling House branch shortly after assuming Dwelling House's assets, with accounts transferred to the pre-existing PNC branch in the Hill District.[42]
In 2011, PNC bought BankAtlantic's Tampa Bay Area branches.[43][44]
Also in 2011, PNC acquired 27 branches in the northern Atlanta suburbs with $240 million in deposits and $42 million in book value from Flagstar Bank.[45][46]
In 2012, PNC acquired RBC Bank from Royal Bank of Canada for $3.45 billion.[47][48] RBC Bank had a 426 branches in southern Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, and Florida. Of these regions, PNC had existing branches only in Florida. PNC entered growing markets in the Southeastern US, such as Birmingham, Charlotte, Norfolk/Virginia Beach (Hampton Roads), Mobile, North Florida, Richmond, Greensboro/Winston-Salem (Piedmont Triad), and Raleigh/Durham (Research Triangle). At the same time, it expanded PNC's presence in South Florida, Tampa Bay Area to Orlando, and Atlanta. This acquisition filled a gap in PNC's market footprint between northern Virginia and central Florida, adding about 900,000 customers and 483 ATM locations. It made PNC the 5th largest bank by branches behind Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Chase, and U.S. Bancorp and the 6th largest by total assets behind the aforementioned four banks and Citibank.[3]
Sale of PNC Global Investment Servicing (2010)[edit]
PNC's Global Investment Servicing subsidiary was the second-largest full-service mutual fund transfer agent in the U.S and the second-largest full service accounting & administration provider to U.S. mutual funds. PNC Global Investment Servicing had provided services to the global investment industry since 1973. With 4,700 employees, PNC Global Investment Servicing operated from the Republic of Ireland, the United States and the Cayman Islands, PNC International Bank Limited operated from Luxembourg. PNC Global Investment Servicing serviced $1.9 trillion in total assets and 58 million shareholder accounts. In 2007, PNC Global Investment Servicing Trustee & Custodial Services Limited was awarded a banking licence by financial regulators allowing it to expand further into Europe. As a result, the name changed to PNC Global Investment Servicing. PNC Global Investment Servicing was formally known as PFPC until July 2008.
In 2010, The Bank of New York Mellon acquired PNC’s Global Investment Servicing.[49] PNC had sold the division to repay funds from the Troubled Asset Relief Program, which were used for the National City acquisition.
The Tower at PNC Plaza[edit]




One PNC Plaza. PNC's former corporate headquarters in Downtown Pittsburgh.


Main article: Tower at PNC Plaza
PNC is headquartered in a modern, 40 floor, 800,000-square-foot (74,000 m2) skyscraper it built from 2012–2015, located on the corner of Fifth Avenue and Wood Street in Downtown Pittsburgh. Officially opened on October 2, 2015, the building is named The Tower at PNC Plaza, in contradistinction to the previous headquarters building, known as One PNC Plaza, and located at 249 Fifth Avenue, catercorner to the new headquarters tower. The new building continues the company's continuous presence at this location since its earliest operations.[50]
On May 23, 2011, PNC unveiled plans for the $400M project, originally intended at 40 stories.[51]
PNC owns the building and occupies all its space, except for street-level storefronts which are leased to retail tenants.
The Tower is one of the world's most environmentally friendly skyscrapers. Some of its features include a double glass facade to reduce cooling costs and promote natural airflow into the building, a high-efficiency climate-control system to heat or cool specific zones of the building as needed, and a pair of living rooftops to collect and channel rainwater and reduce heat gain. Alternative energy sources, such as fuel cells, and solar and geothermal power, are being considered in an effort to reduce carbon emissions.[52]
Harris Teeter partnership[edit]
On July 30, 2012, PNC announced plans to put ATMs in 138 Harris Teeter grocery stores in the Carolinas, plus 53 other stores.[53]
Legal issues[edit]
Overcharging of Black and Hispanic borrowers by National City[edit]
In December 2013, the Department of Justice and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau announced that they had reached an agreement with National City Bank to resolve allegations that the bank had charged Black and Hispanic borrowers higher prices for mortgages between 2002 and 2008 (before the acquisition by PNC). In the complaint, regulators claimed that National City had violated the FHA and ECOA by charging more than 75,000 borrowers higher loan rates based on their race or ethnicity rather than their risk level. National City’s lack of pricing guidelines resulted in black borrowers being charged an average of $159 more in extra upfront fees or higher interest than white borrowers. Black borrowers also paid an average of $228 more annually over the life of the loan than white borrowers. Hispanics paid $125 more upfront and $154 more annually than white borrowers. Under the terms of the settlement, PNC was required to pay victims $35 million.[54]
Leak of account information[edit]
PNC Bank was forced to reissue hundreds of debit cards to customers in March 2006 when their account information was compromised.[55]
Lawsuit from Military Channel[edit]
Also in March 2006, PNC Bank was sued by Paul Bariteau, an investor in the Military Channel. Bariteau claimed PNC let the chairman of the Military Channel make unauthorized withdrawals of millions of dollars from the channel's account for personal use. The counter-claim was that Bariteau was only trying to recoup losses from a bad investment.[56]
Securities fraud settlement[edit]
In June 2003, PNC Bank agreed to pay $115 million to settle federal securities fraud charges after one of its subsidiaries fraudulently transferred $762 million in bad loans and other venture capital investments to an AIG entity in order to conceal them from investors.[57]
Overtime claim by loan officers[edit]
In 2017, PNC agreed to pay $16 million to settle claims of overtime wages by loan officers under the Fair Labor Standards Act.[58]
Criticism[edit]
National Prearranged Services Fraud[edit]
In 2015, PNC Bank was found guilty and ordered to pay $391 million in damages for its role in an insurance scam involving prepaid funeral contracts at the now-defunct National Prearranged Services (NPS).
According to the lawsuit, funds entrusted to NPS, a St.Louis-based company that sold prepaid funerals, were diverted and embezzled would be safeguarded in a trust and backed by life insurance policies.
PNC Bank is the successor to Allegiant Bank, which served as a trustee for the company from 1998 to 2004.
Allegiant, PNC's predecessor, failed to supervise NPS's assets and allowed the company to pillage the NPS trust assets.[3]
Municipal Bonds Disclosure Violations[edit]
In 2015, PNC Bank's capital markets group violated disclosure requirements, for municipal bonds, by failing to divulge that the issuers had filed financial reports late. As a result, they were fined $500,000.[4]
Community initiatives[edit]
The corporation has sponsored a number of initiatives to improve education, health and human services, and cultural and arts activities. These include a "PNC Grow Up Great" commitment to early childhood development, the "PNC Foundation", and community development investments.[59]
Since 1984, PNC Financial Services has compiled the Christmas Price Index, a humorous economic indicator which estimates the prices of the items found in the song "The Twelve Days of Christmas".
In 2012, PNC opened the PNC Fairfax Connection, a next generation community center in Cleveland, OH.[60]

History[edit]

PNC's offices in Troy, Michigan.


PNC Financial Services traces its history to the Pittsburgh Trust and Savings Company which was founded in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on April 10, 1845.[21][22] Due to the long recovery from the Great Fire of Pittsburgh, PNC was not fully operational until January 28, 1852,[23] when it opened offices at Liberty Avenue and 12th street. The bank was renamed The Pittsburgh Trust Company in 1853.[24] In 1858, the company located its corporate offices at the corner of Fifth Avenue and Wood Street in Pittsburgh where they remain to this day. The bank changed its name to First National Bank of Pittsburgh in 1863, after it became the first bank in the country to apply for a national charter[21] as part of that year's National Banking Act. It received charter #48 on August 5, 1863, with other later banks receiving charters sooner due to paperwork problems and the fact that the bank was already in business.[21][24]
By 1959, after a series of mergers, the bank had evolved into the Pittsburgh National Bank,[25] which later became the leading subsidiary of Pittsburgh National Corporation. Another branch of the current bank, the Philadelphia based Provident National Corporation, dates back to the mid-19th century.[26]
In 1982, Pittsburgh National Corporation and Provident National Corporation merged into a new entity named PNC Financial Corporation, so the acronym technically doesn't stand for anything.[27] It was the largest bank merger in American history at the time and created a company with $10.3 billion in assets.[28][29] Between 1991 and 1996, PNC purchased more than ten smaller banks and financial institutions that broadened its market base from Kentucky to the Greater New York metropolitan area.
National City acquisition[edit]
For more details on this topic, see National City acquisition by PNC.
On October 24, 2008, during the financial crisis of 2007-2008, PNC announced that it would acquire Cleveland-based National City Corp. for $5.2 billion in stock.[30] The announcement came hours after PNC sold preferred stock to the United States Treasury as part of the $700 billion bailout plan, which it repurchased within two years.[31]
The deal helped PNC double in size and to become the sixth largest bank in the United States by deposit and fifth largest by branches and made PNC the largest bank in Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Kentucky, as well as the second largest bank in Maryland and Indiana. It also greatly expanded PNC's presence in the Midwest as well as entering the Florida market. National City complemented PNC's presence, as Western Pennsylvania, Cincinnati, Ohio and Louisville, Kentucky were among the few markets before the acquisition deal in which both banks had a major presence.[32]
PNC then had its footprint stretch from New York City to St. Louis, with branches as far south as Miami and as far north as Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan on the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. PNC completed the conversion of the National City branches on June 14, 2010.[33]
Other acquisitions[edit]
PNC acquired the former United National Bancorp based in Bridgewater, New Jersey in 2004.
In 2005, PNC acquired Riggs Bank, which operated in the Washington, DC, area. Riggs had aided Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet in laundering money.[34][35]
PNC completed the acquisition of Maryland-based Mercantile Bankshares on March 2, 2007, making PNC the eighth largest bank in the United States by deposits.[35][36][37] On October 26, 2007, PNC completed the acquisition of Yardville National Bancorp, a small commercial bank centered in central New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania.[35][38] On April 4, 2008, PNC completed the acquisition of Sterling Financial Corporation, a commercial and consumer bank with accounts and branches in central Pennsylvania, northeastern Maryland and Delaware.[35][39]
On September 15, 2007, PNC Bank acquired Citizens National Bank of Laurel, Maryland.[40]

On August 14, 2009, PNC took over Dwelling House Savings & Loan and its only branch location in Pittsburgh's Hill District after Dwelling House failed and was placed under receivership by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.[41] PNC agreed to assume all of Dwelling House's assets, and the branch became a PNC branch on August 17. Dwelling House had been known in Pittsburgh to provide low-income African Americans loans that other banks would deny, and had fended off receivership from the FDIC as recently as June 2009 through community fundraisers. PNC closed the former Dwelling House branch shortly after assuming Dwelling House's assets, with accounts transferred to the pre-existing PNC branch in the Hill District.[42]
In 2011, PNC bought BankAtlantic's Tampa Bay Area branches.[43][44]
Also in 2011, PNC acquired 27 branches in the northern Atlanta suburbs with $240 million in deposits and $42 million in book value from Flagstar Bank.[45][46]
In 2012, PNC acquired RBC Bank from Royal Bank of Canada for $3.45 billion.[47][48] RBC Bank had a 426 branches in southern Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, and Florida. Of these regions, PNC had existing branches only in Florida. PNC entered growing markets in the Southeastern US, such as Birmingham, Charlotte, Norfolk/Virginia Beach (Hampton Roads), Mobile, North Florida, Richmond, Greensboro/Winston-Salem (Piedmont Triad), and Raleigh/Durham (Research Triangle). At the same time, it expanded PNC's presence in South Florida, Tampa Bay Area to Orlando, and Atlanta. This acquisition filled a gap in PNC's market footprint between northern Virginia and central Florida, adding about 900,000 customers and 483 ATM locations. It made PNC the 5th largest bank by branches behind Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Chase, and U.S. Bancorp and the 6th largest by total assets behind the aforementioned four banks and Citibank.[3]
Sale of PNC Global Investment Servicing (2010)[edit]
PNC's Global Investment Servicing subsidiary was the second-largest full-service mutual fund transfer agent in the U.S and the second-largest full service accounting & administration provider to U.S. mutual funds. PNC Global Investment Servicing had provided services to the global investment industry since 1973. With 4,700 employees, PNC Global Investment Servicing operated from the Republic of Ireland, the United States and the Cayman Islands, PNC International Bank Limited operated from Luxembourg. PNC Global Investment Servicing serviced $1.9 trillion in total assets and 58 million shareholder accounts. In 2007, PNC Global Investment Servicing Trustee & Custodial Services Limited was awarded a banking licence by financial regulators allowing it to expand further into Europe. As a result, the name changed to PNC Global Investment Servicing. PNC Global Investment Servicing was formally known as PFPC until July 2008.
In 2010, The Bank of New York Mellon acquired PNC’s Global Investment Servicing.[49] PNC had sold the division to repay funds from the Troubled Asset Relief Program, which were used for the National City acquisition.
The Tower at PNC Plaza[edit]




One PNC Plaza. PNC's former corporate headquarters in Downtown Pittsburgh.


Main article: Tower at PNC Plaza
PNC is headquartered in a modern, 40 floor, 800,000-square-foot (74,000 m2) skyscraper it built from 2012–2015, located on the corner of Fifth Avenue and Wood Street in Downtown Pittsburgh. Officially opened on October 2, 2015, the building is named The Tower at PNC Plaza, in contradistinction to the previous headquarters building, known as One PNC Plaza, and located at 249 Fifth Avenue, catercorner to the new headquarters tower. The new building continues the company's continuous presence at this location since its earliest operations.[50]
On May 23, 2011, PNC unveiled plans for the $400M project, originally intended at 40 stories.[51]
PNC owns the building and occupies all its space, except for street-level storefronts which are leased to retail tenants.
The Tower is one of the world's most environmentally friendly skyscrapers. Some of its features include a double glass facade to reduce cooling costs and promote natural airflow into the building, a high-efficiency climate-control system to heat or cool specific zones of the building as needed, and a pair of living rooftops to collect and channel rainwater and reduce heat gain. Alternative energy sources, such as fuel cells, and solar and geothermal power, are being considered in an effort to reduce carbon emissions.[52]
Harris Teeter partnership[edit]
On July 30, 2012, PNC announced plans to put ATMs in 138 Harris Teeter grocery stores in the Carolinas, plus 53 other stores.[53]
Legal issues[edit]
Overcharging of Black and Hispanic borrowers by National City[edit]
In December 2013, the Department of Justice and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau announced that they had reached an agreement with National City Bank to resolve allegations that the bank had charged Black and Hispanic borrowers higher prices for mortgages between 2002 and 2008 (before the acquisition by PNC). In the complaint, regulators claimed that National City had violated the FHA and ECOA by charging more than 75,000 borrowers higher loan rates based on their race or ethnicity rather than their risk level. National City’s lack of pricing guidelines resulted in black borrowers being charged an average of $159 more in extra upfront fees or higher interest than white borrowers. Black borrowers also paid an average of $228 more annually over the life of the loan than white borrowers. Hispanics paid $125 more upfront and $154 more annually than white borrowers. Under the terms of the settlement, PNC was required to pay victims $35 million.[54]
Leak of account information[edit]
PNC Bank was forced to reissue hundreds of debit cards to customers in March 2006 when their account information was compromised.[55]
Lawsuit from Military Channel[edit]
Also in March 2006, PNC Bank was sued by Paul Bariteau, an investor in the Military Channel. Bariteau claimed PNC let the chairman of the Military Channel make unauthorized withdrawals of millions of dollars from the channel's account for personal use. The counter-claim was that Bariteau was only trying to recoup losses from a bad investment.[56]
Securities fraud settlement[edit]
In June 2003, PNC Bank agreed to pay $115 million to settle federal securities fraud charges after one of its subsidiaries fraudulently transferred $762 million in bad loans and other venture capital investments to an AIG entity in order to conceal them from investors.[57]
Overtime claim by loan officers[edit]
In 2017, PNC agreed to pay $16 million to settle claims of overtime wages by loan officers under the Fair Labor Standards Act.[58]
Criticism[edit]
National Prearranged Services Fraud[edit]
In 2015, PNC Bank was found guilty and ordered to pay $391 million in damages for its role in an insurance scam involving prepaid funeral contracts at the now-defunct National Prearranged Services (NPS).
According to the lawsuit, funds entrusted to NPS, a St.Louis-based company that sold prepaid funerals, were diverted and embezzled would be safeguarded in a trust and backed by life insurance policies.
PNC Bank is the successor to Allegiant Bank, which served as a trustee for the company from 1998 to 2004.
Allegiant, PNC's predecessor, failed to supervise NPS's assets and allowed the company to pillage the NPS trust assets.[3]
Municipal Bonds Disclosure Violations[edit]
In 2015, PNC Bank's capital markets group violated disclosure requirements, for municipal bonds, by failing to divulge that the issuers had filed financial reports late. As a result, they were fined $500,000.[4]
Community initiatives[edit]
The corporation has sponsored a number of initiatives to improve education, health and human services, and cultural and arts activities. These include a "PNC Grow Up Great" commitment to early childhood development, the "PNC Foundation", and community development investments.[59]
Since 1984, PNC Financial Services has compiled the Christmas Price Index, a humorous economic indicator which estimates the prices of the items found in the song "The Twelve Days of Christmas".
In 2012, PNC opened the PNC Fairfax Connection, a next generation community center in Cleveland, OH.[60]

History[edit]

PNC's offices in Troy, Michigan.


PNC Financial Services traces its history to the Pittsburgh Trust and Savings Company which was founded in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on April 10, 1845.[21][22] Due to the long recovery from the Great Fire of Pittsburgh, PNC was not fully operational until January 28, 1852,[23] when it opened offices at Liberty Avenue and 12th street. The bank was renamed The Pittsburgh Trust Company in 1853.[24] In 1858, the company located its corporate offices at the corner of Fifth Avenue and Wood Street in Pittsburgh where they remain to this day. The bank changed its name to First National Bank of Pittsburgh in 1863, after it became the first bank in the country to apply for a national charter[21] as part of that year's National Banking Act. It received charter #48 on August 5, 1863, with other later banks receiving charters sooner due to paperwork problems and the fact that the bank was already in business.[21][24]
By 1959, after a series of mergers, the bank had evolved into the Pittsburgh National Bank,[25] which later became the leading subsidiary of Pittsburgh National Corporation. Another branch of the current bank, the Philadelphia based Provident National Corporation, dates back to the mid-19th century.[26]
In 1982, Pittsburgh National Corporation and Provident National Corporation merged into a new entity named PNC Financial Corporation, so the acronym technically doesn't stand for anything.[27] It was the largest bank merger in American history at the time and created a company with $10.3 billion in assets.[28][29] Between 1991 and 1996, PNC purchased more than ten smaller banks and financial institutions that broadened its market base from Kentucky to the Greater New York metropolitan area.
National City acquisition[edit]
For more details on this topic, see National City acquisition by PNC.
On October 24, 2008, during the financial crisis of 2007-2008, PNC announced that it would acquire Cleveland-based National City Corp. for $5.2 billion in stock.[30] The announcement came hours after PNC sold preferred stock to the United States Treasury as part of the $700 billion bailout plan, which it repurchased within two years.[31]
The deal helped PNC double in size and to become the sixth largest bank in the United States by deposit and fifth largest by branches and made PNC the largest bank in Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Kentucky, as well as the second largest bank in Maryland and Indiana. It also greatly expanded PNC's presence in the Midwest as well as entering the Florida market. National City complemented PNC's presence, as Western Pennsylvania, Cincinnati, Ohio and Louisville, Kentucky were among the few markets before the acquisition deal in which both banks had a major presence.[32]
PNC then had its footprint stretch from New York City to St. Louis, with branches as far south as Miami and as far north as Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan on the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. PNC completed the conversion of the National City branches on June 14, 2010.[33]
Other acquisitions[edit]
PNC acquired the former United National Bancorp based in Bridgewater, New Jersey in 2004.
In 2005, PNC acquired Riggs Bank, which operated in the Washington, DC, area. Riggs had aided Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet in laundering money.[34][35]
PNC completed the acquisition of Maryland-based Mercantile Bankshares on March 2, 2007, making PNC the eighth largest bank in the United States by deposits.[35][36][37] On October 26, 2007, PNC completed the acquisition of Yardville National Bancorp, a small commercial bank centered in central New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania.[35][38] On April 4, 2008, PNC completed the acquisition of Sterling Financial Corporation, a commercial and consumer bank with accounts and branches in central Pennsylvania, northeastern Maryland and Delaware.[35][39]
On September 15, 2007, PNC Bank acquired Citizens National Bank of Laurel, Maryland.[40]

On August 14, 2009, PNC took over Dwelling House Savings & Loan and its only branch location in Pittsburgh's Hill District after Dwelling House failed and was placed under receivership by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.[41] PNC agreed to assume all of Dwelling House's assets, and the branch became a PNC branch on August 17. Dwelling House had been known in Pittsburgh to provide low-income African Americans loans that other banks would deny, and had fended off receivership from the FDIC as recently as June 2009 through community fundraisers. PNC closed the former Dwelling House branch shortly after assuming Dwelling House's assets, with accounts transferred to the pre-existing PNC branch in the Hill District.[42]
In 2011, PNC bought BankAtlantic's Tampa Bay Area branches.[43][44]
Also in 2011, PNC acquired 27 branches in the northern Atlanta suburbs with $240 million in deposits and $42 million in book value from Flagstar Bank.[45][46]
In 2012, PNC acquired RBC Bank from Royal Bank of Canada for $3.45 billion.[47][48] RBC Bank had a 426 branches in southern Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, and Florida. Of these regions, PNC had existing branches only in Florida. PNC entered growing markets in the Southeastern US, such as Birmingham, Charlotte, Norfolk/Virginia Beach (Hampton Roads), Mobile, North Florida, Richmond, Greensboro/Winston-Salem (Piedmont Triad), and Raleigh/Durham (Research Triangle). At the same time, it expanded PNC's presence in South Florida, Tampa Bay Area to Orlando, and Atlanta. This acquisition filled a gap in PNC's market footprint between northern Virginia and central Florida, adding about 900,000 customers and 483 ATM locations. It made PNC the 5th largest bank by branches behind Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Chase, and U.S. Bancorp and the 6th largest by total assets behind the aforementioned four banks and Citibank.[3]
Sale of PNC Global Investment Servicing (2010)[edit]
PNC's Global Investment Servicing subsidiary was the second-largest full-service mutual fund transfer agent in the U.S and the second-largest full service accounting & administration provider to U.S. mutual funds. PNC Global Investment Servicing had provided services to the global investment industry since 1973. With 4,700 employees, PNC Global Investment Servicing operated from the Republic of Ireland, the United States and the Cayman Islands, PNC International Bank Limited operated from Luxembourg. PNC Global Investment Servicing serviced $1.9 trillion in total assets and 58 million shareholder accounts. In 2007, PNC Global Investment Servicing Trustee & Custodial Services Limited was awarded a banking licence by financial regulators allowing it to expand further into Europe. As a result, the name changed to PNC Global Investment Servicing. PNC Global Investment Servicing was formally known as PFPC until July 2008.
In 2010, The Bank of New York Mellon acquired PNC’s Global Investment Servicing.[49] PNC had sold the division to repay funds from the Troubled Asset Relief Program, which were used for the National City acquisition.
The Tower at PNC Plaza[edit]




One PNC Plaza. PNC's former corporate headquarters in Downtown Pittsburgh.


Main article: Tower at PNC Plaza
PNC is headquartered in a modern, 40 floor, 800,000-square-foot (74,000 m2) skyscraper it built from 2012–2015, located on the corner of Fifth Avenue and Wood Street in Downtown Pittsburgh. Officially opened on October 2, 2015, the building is named The Tower at PNC Plaza, in contradistinction to the previous headquarters building, known as One PNC Plaza, and located at 249 Fifth Avenue, catercorner to the new headquarters tower. The new building continues the company's continuous presence at this location since its earliest operations.[50]
On May 23, 2011, PNC unveiled plans for the $400M project, originally intended at 40 stories.[51]
PNC owns the building and occupies all its space, except for street-level storefronts which are leased to retail tenants.
The Tower is one of the world's most environmentally friendly skyscrapers. Some of its features include a double glass facade to reduce cooling costs and promote natural airflow into the building, a high-efficiency climate-control system to heat or cool specific zones of the building as needed, and a pair of living rooftops to collect and channel rainwater and reduce heat gain. Alternative energy sources, such as fuel cells, and solar and geothermal power, are being considered in an effort to reduce carbon emissions.[52]
Harris Teeter partnership[edit]
On July 30, 2012, PNC announced plans to put ATMs in 138 Harris Teeter grocery stores in the Carolinas, plus 53 other stores.[53]
Legal issues[edit]
Overcharging of Black and Hispanic borrowers by National City[edit]
In December 2013, the Department of Justice and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau announced that they had reached an agreement with National City Bank to resolve allegations that the bank had charged Black and Hispanic borrowers higher prices for mortgages between 2002 and 2008 (before the acquisition by PNC). In the complaint, regulators claimed that National City had violated the FHA and ECOA by charging more than 75,000 borrowers higher loan rates based on their race or ethnicity rather than their risk level. National City’s lack of pricing guidelines resulted in black borrowers being charged an average of $159 more in extra upfront fees or higher interest than white borrowers. Black borrowers also paid an average of $228 more annually over the life of the loan than white borrowers. Hispanics paid $125 more upfront and $154 more annually than white borrowers. Under the terms of the settlement, PNC was required to pay victims $35 million.[54]
Leak of account information[edit]
PNC Bank was forced to reissue hundreds of debit cards to customers in March 2006 when their account information was compromised.[55]
Lawsuit from Military Channel[edit]
Also in March 2006, PNC Bank was sued by Paul Bariteau, an investor in the Military Channel. Bariteau claimed PNC let the chairman of the Military Channel make unauthorized withdrawals of millions of dollars from the channel's account for personal use. The counter-claim was that Bariteau was only trying to recoup losses from a bad investment.[56]
Securities fraud settlement[edit]
In June 2003, PNC Bank agreed to pay $115 million to settle federal securities fraud charges after one of its subsidiaries fraudulently transferred $762 million in bad loans and other venture capital investments to an AIG entity in order to conceal them from investors.[57]
Overtime claim by loan officers[edit]
In 2017, PNC agreed to pay $16 million to settle claims of overtime wages by loan officers under the Fair Labor Standards Act.[58]
Criticism[edit]
National Prearranged Services Fraud[edit]
In 2015, PNC Bank was found guilty and ordered to pay $391 million in damages for its role in an insurance scam involving prepaid funeral contracts at the now-defunct National Prearranged Services (NPS).
According to the lawsuit, funds entrusted to NPS, a St.Louis-based company that sold prepaid funerals, were diverted and embezzled would be safeguarded in a trust and backed by life insurance policies.
PNC Bank is the successor to Allegiant Bank, which served as a trustee for the company from 1998 to 2004.
Allegiant, PNC's predecessor, failed to supervise NPS's assets and allowed the company to pillage the NPS trust assets.[3]
Municipal Bonds Disclosure Violations[edit]
In 2015, PNC Bank's capital markets group violated disclosure requirements, for municipal bonds, by failing to divulge that the issuers had filed financial reports late. As a result, they were fined $500,000.[4]
Community initiatives[edit]
The corporation has sponsored a number of initiatives to improve education, health and human services, and cultural and arts activities. These include a "PNC Grow Up Great" commitment to early childhood development, the "PNC Foundation", and community development investments.[59]
Since 1984, PNC Financial Services has compiled the Christmas Price Index, a humorous economic indicator which estimates the prices of the items found in the song "The Twelve Days of Christmas".
In 2012, PNC opened the PNC Fairfax Connection, a next generation community center in Cleveland, OH.[60]

History[edit]

PNC's offices in Troy, Michigan.


PNC Financial Services traces its history to the Pittsburgh Trust and Savings Company which was founded in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on April 10, 1845.[21][22] Due to the long recovery from the Great Fire of Pittsburgh, PNC was not fully operational until January 28, 1852,[23] when it opened offices at Liberty Avenue and 12th street. The bank was renamed The Pittsburgh Trust Company in 1853.[24] In 1858, the company located its corporate offices at the corner of Fifth Avenue and Wood Street in Pittsburgh where they remain to this day. The bank changed its name to First National Bank of Pittsburgh in 1863, after it became the first bank in the country to apply for a national charter[21] as part of that year's National Banking Act. It received charter #48 on August 5, 1863, with other later banks receiving charters sooner due to paperwork problems and the fact that the bank was already in business.[21][24]
By 1959, after a series of mergers, the bank had evolved into the Pittsburgh National Bank,[25] which later became the leading subsidiary of Pittsburgh National Corporation. Another branch of the current bank, the Philadelphia based Provident National Corporation, dates back to the mid-19th century.[26]
In 1982, Pittsburgh National Corporation and Provident National Corporation merged into a new entity named PNC Financial Corporation, so the acronym technically doesn't stand for anything.[27] It was the largest bank merger in American history at the time and created a company with $10.3 billion in assets.[28][29] Between 1991 and 1996, PNC purchased more than ten smaller banks and financial institutions that broadened its market base from Kentucky to the Greater New York metropolitan area.

On October 24, 2008, during the financial crisis of 2007-2008, PNC announced that it would acquire Cleveland-based National City Corp. for $5.2 billion in stock.[30] The announcement came hours after PNC sold preferred stock to the United States Treasury as part of the $700 billion bailout plan, which it repurchased within two years.[31]
The deal helped PNC double in size and to become the sixth largest bank in the United States by deposit and fifth largest by branches and made PNC the largest bank in Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Kentucky, as well as the second largest bank in Maryland and Indiana. It also greatly expanded PNC's presence in the Midwest as well as entering the Florida market. National City complemented PNC's presence, as Western Pennsylvania, Cincinnati, Ohio and Louisville, Kentucky were among the few markets before the acquisition deal in which both banks had a major presence.[32]
PNC then had its footprint stretch from New York City to St. Louis, with branches as far south as Miami and as far north as Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan on the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. PNC completed the conversion of the National City branches on June 14, 2010.[33]
Other acquisitions[edit]
PNC acquired the former United National Bancorp based in Bridgewater, New Jersey in 2004.
In 2005, PNC acquired Riggs Bank, which operated in the Washington, DC, area. Riggs had aided Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet in laundering money.[34][35]
PNC completed the acquisition of Maryland-based Mercantile Bankshares on March 2, 2007, making PNC the eighth largest bank in the United States by deposits.[35][36][37] On October 26, 2007, PNC completed the acquisition of Yardville National Bancorp, a small commercial bank centered in central New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania.[35][38] On April 4, 2008, PNC completed the acquisition of Sterling Financial Corporation, a commercial and consumer bank with accounts and branches in central Pennsylvania, northeastern Maryland and Delaware.[35][39]
On September 15, 2007, PNC Bank acquired Citizens National Bank of Laurel, Maryland.[40]

On August 14, 2009, PNC took over Dwelling House Savings & Loan and its only branch location in Pittsburgh's Hill District after Dwelling House failed and was placed under receivership by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.[41] PNC agreed to assume all of Dwelling House's assets, and the branch became a PNC branch on August 17. Dwelling House had been known in Pittsburgh to provide low-income African Americans loans that other banks would deny, and had fended off receivership from the FDIC as recently as June 2009 through community fundraisers. PNC closed the former Dwelling House branch shortly after assuming Dwelling House's assets, with accounts transferred to the pre-existing PNC branch in the Hill District.[42]
In 2011, PNC bought BankAtlantic's Tampa Bay Area branches.[43][44]
Also in 2011, PNC acquired 27 branches in the northern Atlanta suburbs with $240 million in deposits and $42 million in book value from Flagstar Bank.[45][46]
In 2012, PNC acquired RBC Bank from Royal Bank of Canada for $3.45 billion.[47][48] RBC Bank had a 426 branches in southern Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, and Florida. Of these regions, PNC had existing branches only in Florida. PNC entered growing markets in the Southeastern US, such as Birmingham, Charlotte, Norfolk/Virginia Beach (Hampton Roads), Mobile, North Florida, Richmond, Greensboro/Winston-Salem (Piedmont Triad), and Raleigh/Durham (Research Triangle). At the same time, it expanded PNC's presence in South Florida, Tampa Bay Area to Orlando, and Atlanta. This acquisition filled a gap in PNC's market footprint between northern Virginia and central Florida, adding about 900,000 customers and 483 ATM locations. It made PNC the 5th largest bank by branches behind Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Chase, and U.S. Bancorp and the 6th largest by total assets behind the aforementioned four banks and Citibank.[3]
Sale of PNC Global Investment Servicing (2010)[edit]
PNC's Global Investment Servicing subsidiary was the second-largest full-service mutual fund transfer agent in the U.S and the second-largest full service accounting & administration provider to U.S. mutual funds. PNC Global Investment Servicing had provided services to the global investment industry since 1973. With 4,700 employees, PNC Global Investment Servicing operated from the Republic of Ireland, the United States and the Cayman Islands, PNC International Bank Limited operated from Luxembourg. PNC Global Investment Servicing serviced $1.9 trillion in total assets and 58 million shareholder accounts. In 2007, PNC Global Investment Servicing Trustee & Custodial Services Limited was awarded a banking licence by financial regulators allowing it to expand further into Europe. As a result, the name changed to PNC Global Investment Servicing. PNC Global Investment Servicing was formally known as PFPC until July 2008.
In 2010, The Bank of New York Mellon acquired PNC’s Global Investment Servicing.[49] PNC had sold the division to repay funds from the Troubled Asset Relief Program, which were used for the National City acquisition.
The Tower at PNC Plaza[edit]




One PNC Plaza. PNC's former corporate headquarters in Downtown Pittsburgh.


Main article: Tower at PNC Plaza
PNC is headquartered in a modern, 40 floor, 800,000-square-foot (74,000 m2) skyscraper it built from 2012–2015, located on the corner of Fifth Avenue and Wood Street in Downtown Pittsburgh. Officially opened on October 2, 2015, the building is named The Tower at PNC Plaza, in contradistinction to the previous headquarters building, known as One PNC Plaza, and located at 249 Fifth Avenue, catercorner to the new headquarters tower. The new building continues the company's continuous presence at this location since its earliest operations.[50]
On May 23, 2011, PNC unveiled plans for the $400M project, originally intended at 40 stories.[51]
PNC owns the building and occupies all its space, except for street-level storefronts which are leased to retail tenants.
The Tower is one of the world's most environmentally friendly skyscrapers. Some of its features include a double glass facade to reduce cooling costs and promote natural airflow into the building, a high-efficiency climate-control system to heat or cool specific zones of the building as needed, and a pair of living rooftops to collect and channel rainwater and reduce heat gain. Alternative energy sources, such as fuel cells, and solar and geothermal power, are being considered in an effort to reduce carbon emissions.[52]
Harris Teeter partnership[edit]
On July 30, 2012, PNC announced plans to put ATMs in 138 Harris Teeter grocery stores in the Carolinas, plus 53 other stores.[53]
Legal issues[edit]
Overcharging of Black and Hispanic borrowers by National City[edit]
In December 2013, the Department of Justice and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau announced that they had reached an agreement with National City Bank to resolve allegations that the bank had charged Black and Hispanic borrowers higher prices for mortgages between 2002 and 2008 (before the acquisition by PNC). In the complaint, regulators claimed that National City had violated the FHA and ECOA by charging more than 75,000 borrowers higher loan rates based on their race or ethnicity rather than their risk level. National City’s lack of pricing guidelines resulted in black borrowers being charged an average of $159 more in extra upfront fees or higher interest than white borrowers. Black borrowers also paid an average of $228 more annually over the life of the loan than white borrowers. Hispanics paid $125 more upfront and $154 more annually than white borrowers. Under the terms of the settlement, PNC was required to pay victims $35 million.[54]
Leak of account information[edit]
PNC Bank was forced to reissue hundreds of debit cards to customers in March 2006 when their account information was compromised.[55]
Lawsuit from Military Channel[edit]
Also in March 2006, PNC Bank was sued by Paul Bariteau, an investor in the Military Channel. Bariteau claimed PNC let the chairman of the Military Channel make unauthorized withdrawals of millions of dollars from the channel's account for personal use. The counter-claim was that Bariteau was only trying to recoup losses from a bad investment.[56]
Securities fraud settlement[edit]
In June 2003, PNC Bank agreed to pay $115 million to settle federal securities fraud charges after one of its subsidiaries fraudulently transferred $762 million in bad loans and other venture capital investments to an AIG entity in order to conceal them from investors.[57]
Overtime claim by loan officers[edit]
In 2017, PNC agreed to pay $16 million to settle claims of overtime wages by loan officers under the Fair Labor Standards Act.[58]
Criticism[edit]
National Prearranged Services Fraud[edit]
In 2015, PNC Bank was found guilty and ordered to pay $391 million in damages for its role in an insurance scam involving prepaid funeral contracts at the now-defunct National Prearranged Services (NPS).
According to the lawsuit, funds entrusted to NPS, a St.Louis-based company that sold prepaid funerals, were diverted and embezzled would be safeguarded in a trust and backed by life insurance policies.
PNC Bank is the successor to Allegiant Bank, which served as a trustee for the company from 1998 to 2004.
Allegiant, PNC's predecessor, failed to supervise NPS's assets and allowed the company to pillage the NPS trust assets.[3]
Municipal Bonds Disclosure Violations[edit]
In 2015, PNC Bank's capital markets group violated disclosure requirements, for municipal bonds, by failing to divulge that the issuers had filed financial reports late. As a result, they were fined $500,000.[4]
Community initiatives[edit]
The corporation has sponsored a number of initiatives to improve education, health and human services, and cultural and arts activities. These include a "PNC Grow Up Great" commitment to early childhood development, the "PNC Foundation", and community development investments.[59]
Since 1984, PNC Financial Services has compiled the Christmas Price Index, a humorous economic indicator which estimates the prices of the items found in the song "The Twelve Days of Christmas".
In 2012, PNC opened the PNC Fairfax Connection, a next generation community center in Cleveland, OH.[60]

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score
A


Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

The Zacks Equity Research reports, or ZER for short, are our in-house, independently produced research reports.
The ever popular one-page Snapshot reports are generated for virtually every single Zacks Ranked stock. It's packed with all of the company's key stats and salient decision making information. Including the Zacks Rank, Zacks Industry Rank, Style Scores, the Price, Consensus & Surprise chart, graphical estimate analysis and how a stocks stacks up to its peers.
The detailed multi-page Analyst report does an even deeper dive on the company's vital statistics. In addition to all of the proprietary analysis in the Snapshot, the report also visually displays the four components of the Zacks Rank (Agreement, Magnitude, Upside and Surprise); provides a comprehensive overview of the company business drivers, complete with earnings and sales charts; a recap of their last earnings report; and a bulleted list of reasons to buy or sell the stock. It also includes an industry comparison table to see how your stock compares to its expanded industry, and the S&P 500.
Researching stocks has never been so easy or insightful as with the ZER Analyst and Snapshot reports.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Manage Your Financial Life
Life doesn't get any less complicated — especially when it comes to your money. Virtual Wallet gives you one clear picture of your money, so you can understand it, stay in control, plan for the future and reach your goals.
















Take A Fresh Look at Your Money
Virtual Wallet's unique online and mobile features give you an instant snapshot of your situation, so you can better understand your money.

Calendar, Bill Pay & Danger Day℠

See Everything in One Place
Calendar, Bill Pay & Danger Day℠
Calendar
This is not your average calendar, it's your bill payment hub. You'll see everything in one place on a calendar view — your upcoming payday, what you're spending and when you spent it, your scheduled bill reminders and your upcoming payments. You can also see any impending Danger Day℠ and use Online Bill Pay, which means worrying less and making sure late payments don't happen again. Feeling better already, aren't you?
Bill Pay
Gone are the days of worrying about every bill and due date. With PNC Online Bill Pay, we'll help you stay on track. Bills are integrated with the Money Bar® and the Calendar, so you know how much money is set aside and when it's on the way out. You can schedule payments whenever you need to — or set up recurring, automatic payments for even less worry. And while the Calendar is one way to remind yourself of your obligations, we can also send you emails about upcoming due dates to keep you on top of things. You have enough deadlines. Go ahead and cross this one off.
Danger Day
We've all had those weeks when the bills outweigh the paychecks and due dates loom. Enter Danger Day. Color-coded in red (so you won't miss it), it shows up on your Calendar when your Spend account is at risk of being overdrawn. This way, you can keep ahead by moving money from Reserve or changing the day a bill is paid. Stay on time, every time.
Images for illustrative purposes only.





Next Feature: Money Bar






Money Bar®

Move Money Easily
Money Bar®
Get a bird's eye view of what your money's up to. The Money Bar puts it into three categories: Scheduled Out (the money allocated for bills and other payments), Free (money that's available to spend), and Reserve (the money you've tucked away). It's our way of making everything clearer.
Once you've got a good idea of where everything is, you can make adjustments. Need extra money for date night? Got a little left over you want to put toward that vacation? Using the Slider, you can move money back and forth between Spend and Reserve with no effort. Managing your funds is literally in your hands.
Images for illustrative purposes only.



Previous Feature: Calendar, Bill Pay & Danger DayNext Feature: Wish List





Wish List

Set Goals and Reach Them
Wish List

What's the point of working hard if you're not treating yourself once in a while, right? The Wish List is where you'll set sights on the things you want and start saving. You can put money toward each item in your Reserve account, keep track of your progress, and transfer money to Spend when you've reached your goal. And you can give certain items priority. So, if you really need a new fridge before that trip to Bora Bora, you can put money where it's needed.
And while we're on the subject, don't forget Reserve Items. They let you set aside money for future expenses and get a reminder on your Calendar.
Images for illustrative purposes only.



Previous Feature: Money BarNext Feature: Spending Zone





Spending + Budgets

Track Your Spending
Spending + Budgets

It's easy for money to fly out the door, especially when you're having fun. Spending + Budget's tools provide a simple way to see what you're spending your money on each month - and get a hold on it. Broken down into categories like Education, Restaurants, Gas and more, it allows you to set a budget for each. You can also set up to get handy reminder emails if you're close to maxing out your budget for any category. That way, you can hit the brakes before going over the edge.
Images for illustrative purposes only.




Previous Feature: Wish ListNext Feature: Savings Engine





Savings Engine®

Save Without Even Thinking About It
Savings Engine®

You can't always think about saving, especially when you're too busy spending. That's why we built the Savings Engine. It gives you three easy ways to put cash aside — even when saving is not exactly top-of-mind. With the Payday Savings rule, a predetermined amount will automatically transfer from Spend to Growth on days you've designated as pay days. Bill Pay makes it easy to transfer money to Growth whenever you pay a bill online from your Calendar. Punch the Pig® is an on-the-fly way to add money to Growth while you're banking online.
Images for illustrative purposes only.



Previous Feature: Spending ZoneNext Feature: Punch the Pig





Punch the Pig®

Saving Made Fun
Punch the Pig®

The only thing more rewarding than saving money is having a little fun doing it. That's the idea with Punch the Pig. When you're banking online, just "punch" the piggy bank and money (the amount of your choice) will transfer from your Spend account to your Growth account. (That "punch" is a "shake" for smartphone users.) Go ahead. You know you want to.
Images for illustrative purposes only.



Previous Feature: Savings EngineNext Feature: Mobile





Mobile

Master Your Money Wherever You Are
Mobile Banking

With Virtual Wallet, your bank is only as far away as your mobile device. You can bank when and where you want with the Virtual Wallet Insider app. You can use your iPhone®, Android™ or other supported mobile device, including tablets.
Our new app, Virtual Wallet Insider, offers you all the same major features found on desktop combined with exclusively mobile tools like mobile deposit and Money Bar Preview.

Putting It All Together
Credit Card

Include your current PNC credit card in your Virtual Wallet and experience helpful features such as:

Calendar - View your credit card balance alongside your Spend account balance as well as past charges on your credit card, payments to your card, when your payments are due and when your next statement is created
Spending + Budgets - See your credit card transactions automatically sorted in to different categories to help you better understand and track your spending
Mobile - Manage your credit card on the go with our Virtual Wallet app[1]

Previous Feature: Mobile












Spend, Save and Grow
Virtual Wallet is comprised of three distinct accounts, working together as one seamless, online money management tool.



SPEND is your primary checking account.
It's designed for your everyday spending. Debit card purchases are deducted from your Spend (you can withdraw money at ATMs from any of your accounts). You’ll use Spend to pay bills by check or through Online Bill Pay. It also works in harmony with your Reserve.



GROWTH is your long-term savings account.
It functions as your secondary Overdraft Protection. The competitive interest rate[2] makes it perfect for you to build your nest egg and grow financially. Put money into your Growth to save up for life-changing purchases ahead - a car, a down payment on a house, or even a dream vacation.
 



RESERVE is your short-term savings account.
It functions as your primary Overdraft Protection — so if you're at risk of overdrawing your Spend account, money can be automatically transferred from your Reserve to your Spend at no charge. Utilize your Reserve to set aside money for upcoming expenses.



Add a PNC Credit Card.
Rewards, cash back or low interest...no matter what you are looking for in a credit card, we've got you covered. Add your PNC credit card to your Virtual Wallet to receive the same money management tools and view of your spending.

Offers are available from participating merchants. Your personal banking information is not shared with the merchants participating in PNC Purchase Payback. Whether you receive offers may depend on using your PNC Visa Card, or where you use your PNC Visa card to make purchases. Not everyone will get the same offer.


In order to qualify for a Relationship Rate for Premiere Money Market, you must have a linked checking account (for the Performance Checking Relationship Rate, you must have a linked Performance Checking or Virtual Wallet® with Performance Spend; for the Performance Select Checking Relationship Rate, you must have a linked Performance Select Checking or Virtual Wallet with Performance Select) and meet one of the following requirements:

Make a combination of 5 or more PIN and/or signature point-of-sale transactions (excluding cash advances) posted during the previous calendar month to your Checking account using your Visa® Debit Card or to your linked Visa Credit Card.

(A qualifying direct deposit is a recurring electronic deposit made by an employer or an outside agency. Transfers made from one account to another or deposits made via a branch, ATM, online transfer, mobile device or the mail are not eligible to meet this requirement.)
Starting with the calendar month following when you open your Premiere Money Market account, and monthly thereafter, whether the account earns the variable Standard or Relationship Rate for the entire calendar month will be determined on the first of the month based upon the number of qualifying transactions or direct deposit requirement from the previous calendar month.

If there are changes to your linked checking account (it is closed, changed to a new account type or no longer linked to your Premiere Money Market account), you may no longer qualify for a Relationship Rate, or the rates may otherwise change to those in effect at the time of the change.

Starting with the calendar month following when you open your Standard Savings account, and monthly thereafter, whether the account earns the variable Standard or Relationship Rate for the entire calendar month will be determined on the first of the month based upon the number of qualifying transactions or direct deposit requirement from the previous calendar month.

If you or we make changes to your linked checking account (it is closed, changed to a new account type or no longer linked to your Standard Savings account), you may no longer qualify for a Relationship Rate.


A qualifying direct deposit is a recurring electronic deposit made by an employer or an outside agency. Transfers made from one account to another or deposits made via a branch, ATM, online transfer, mobile device or the mail are not eligible to meet this requirement.


PNC deposit accounts include consumer checking, savings, money market, certificate of deposit, and retirement certificate of deposit.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
