TD Asset Management:

General Disclosures:

TD Mutual Funds:
Commissions, trailing commissions, management fees and expenses all may be associated with mutual fund investments. Please read the fund facts and prospectus, which contains detailed investment information, before investing. The indicated rates of return (other than for each money market fund) are the historical annual compounded total returns for the period indicated including changes in unit value and reinvestment of distributions. The indicated rate of return for each money market fund is an annualized historical yield based on the seven-day period ended as indicated and annualized in the case of effective yield by compounding the seven day return and does not represent an actual one year return. The indicated rates of return do not take into account sales, redemption, distribution or optional charges or income taxes payable by any unitholder that would have reduced returns. Mutual funds are not covered by the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation or by any other government deposit insurer and are not guaranteed or insured. Their values change frequently. There can be no assurances that a money market fund will be able to maintain its net asset value per unit at a constant amount or that the full amount of your investment will be returned to you. Past performance may not be repeated.
TD ETFs are qualified for sale in the provinces and territories of Canada. This site does not constitute an offer or solicitation to residents of the U.S. or the U.K. or anyone in any other jurisdiction in which such an offer or solicitation is not authorized or to any person to whom it is unlawful to make such a solution.
Commissions, management fees and expenses all may be associated with investments in exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Please read the prospectus or the summary document(s) before investing. ETFs are not guaranteed, their values change frequently and past performance may not be repeated. ETF units are bought and sold at market price on a stock exchange and brokerage commissions will reduce returns. TD ETFs do not seek to return any predetermined amount at maturity. Index returns do not represent TD ETF returns. The indicated rates of return are the historical total returns for the periods including changes in unit value and reinvestment of all distributions and do not take into account redemption, commission charges or income taxes payable by any unitholder that would have reduced returns. Past performance may not be repeated.
		
The performance of an Index fund is expected to be lower than the performance of its respective index. Investors cannot invest directly in an index. Comparisons to indices have limitations because indices have volatility and other material characteristics that may differ from a particular mutual fund.
Target distribution rates are based on Net Asset Value (NAV) per unit (PU) for the Fund(s). The target distribution rates will change with the changes in the series NAVPU or monthly distribution per unit. This is a target distribution only, is not guaranteed, may be adjusted from time to time without notice and is not a prediction of future distributions. The most recent actual monthly distributions per unit are available on the TDAM website at tdassetmanagement.com 
The payment of distributions should not be confused with a fund’s performance, rate of return or yield. If a distribution paid by a fund is greater than the performance of the fund, the difference will be deducted from your invested capital.
Capital gains taxes deferred will be payable when the units of a fund are sold or to some extent when their adjusted cost base goes below zero. Return of capital (ROC) distributions do not constitute part of a fund’s rate of return or yield. ROC reduces the adjusted cost base of the units to which it relates.
Graphs are only used to illustrate the effects of the compound growth rate and do not reflect future values of any fund or returns on investment of any fund.
Regulatory restrictions limit publishing performance returns for funds or portfolios with a history of less than one year.
Mutual fund strategies and current holdings are subject to change.
For funds that are purchased under the Low Sales Charge 2 (LSC2) option, once securities acquired under this purchase option are held for periods greater than 4 years, the maximum annual trail commission rate that can be paid to your dealer may automatically increase to the maximum annual trail commission rate payable under the front-end load option for the same fund.

TD Guaranteed Investment Funds II Disclosure:
TD Guaranteed Investment Funds II ("TD GIF II") policies are Individual Variable Insurance Contracts issued by ivariTM and are managed by TDAM. ivari is the issuer of the TD GIF II contract. As of March 11th, 2009, TD GIF II was closed to new policies and as of April 15th, 2009, all existing policies were closed to additional deposits.
A complete description of the key features of TD GIF II is contained in the TD GIF II Annuity Policy and Information Folder. In the event of any discrepancy between the Annuity Policy and Information Folder and this document, the Annuity Policy and Information Folder take precedence. Any amount that is allocated to a segregated fund is invested at the risk of the Contract Owner and may increase or decrease in value. When entering into an Individual Variable Insurance Contract, and purchasing TD GIF II, investors are depositing money to their contract and are not buying units of the TD Mutual Funds and therefore do not possess any of the rights and privileges of the unitholders of such funds. The performance of the TD GIF II will be slightly less than that of the underlying TD Mutual Funds due to the cost of the guarantee and benefit feature. Past performance is not indicative of future performance and investment returns will fluctuate. TD Mutual Funds are offered by TDAM, a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Toronto-Dominion Bank. TMivari and the ivari logos are trademarks of ivari Canada ULC. ivari is licensed to use such marks.
TD ETFs:
Commissions, management fees and expenses all may be associated with investments in exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Please read the prospectus or the summary document(s) before investing. ETFs are not guaranteed, their values change frequently and past performance may not be repeated. ETF units are bought and sold at market price on a stock exchange and brokerage commissions will reduce returns. TD ETFs do not seek to return any predetermined amount at maturity. Index returns do not represent TD ETF returns. The indicated rates of return are the historical total returns for the periods including changes in unit value and reinvestment of all distributions and do not take into account, redemption, commission charges or income taxes payable by any unitholder that would have reduced returns. Past performance may not be repeated.
Index returns are shown for comparative purposes only. Indexes are unmanaged and their returns do not include any sales charges or fees as such costs would lower performance. It is not possible to invest directly in an index.
Graphs are only used to illustrate the effects of the compound growth rate and do not reflect future values of any fund or returns on investment of any fund.
Regulatory restrictions limit publishing performance returns for funds or portfolios with a history of less than one year.
Fund strategies and current holdings are subject to change.
TD ETFs are managed by TD Asset Management Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Toronto-Dominion Bank.

I. Digital Wallet Terms of Use for TD Bank Customers (Canada)
This document contains the terms and conditions (“Terms”) that apply when you add, attempt to add, use or keep any eligible debit card, credit card, or other payment card (each, a "Payment Card") issued by TD Bank in a digital wallet or any other electronic payment system into which your Payment Card may be enrolled or added by you ("Wallet") on any mobile or wearable device, tablet, watch or other device (each a "Device") that supports the Wallet. These Terms are a legal agreement, so please read them carefully. The words “you” and “your” mean a TD Bank Account holder, an authorized user on a credit card Account (an "Authorized User"), or anyone that you allow to use your Device. The words “we”, “us”, “our”, and “TD Bank” mean The Toronto-Dominion Bank and its affiliates in Canada. "Account" means the account associated with the Payment Card.
1.	Accepting These Terms: By selecting "I agree", it means you have read and agree to these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, you must not add, attempt to add, use or keep the Payment Card in the Wallet. 
2.	Other Terms and Conditions That Apply to Your Account Still Apply. The terms of each account agreement and other agreements that apply to your Payment Card and Account including any amendments (collectively, your “Account Agreement”) supplement these Terms. The Account Agreement continues to apply to your Payment Card and Account including when you add your Payment Card or use it in the Wallet. The Account Agreement may describe, for example, the applicable fees, interest, and other terms and conditions that apply when you use a Payment Card. Nothing in these Terms changes your responsibilities under the Account Agreement. In the event of any conflict between these Terms and your Account Agreement, your Account Agreement applies. You understand that your use of the Wallet will also be subject to agreements or terms of use with the relevant Wallet provider ("Wallet Provider") or other third parties such as wireless companies or data service providers ("Other Third Parties"). TD Bank is not responsible for the Wallet Provider or Other Third Parties, and in no event shall such terms and conditions between you and the Wallet Provider or any Other Third Party be binding on TD Bank or impose any additional obligations, or obligations inconsistent with the terms and conditions of these Terms, upon TD Bank whatsoever.
3.	Using a Payment Card in the Wallet. If you want to add a Payment Card to the Wallet, you must follow the procedures adopted by the Wallet Provider and any further procedures we adopt. You understand that not all Payment Cards are eligible to be added to the Wallet. We may not allow you to add a Payment Card to the Wallet if we cannot authenticate the Payment Card or if we otherwise suspect that there may be fraud associated with the Payment Card or the Account. The Wallet allows you and anyone else who has access to and use of your Device to make purchases using a Payment Card that has been added to the Wallet wherever the Wallet is accepted, subject to Payment Card activation and pre-set limits (which are subject to change). When you use your Payment Card through the Wallet to transact with a merchant, it is the same as if you swiped, inserted, waved, tapped or otherwise presented your physical Payment Card or signed the credit card slip or electronic signature device presented by the merchant and/or inputted your personal identification number to transact. Wallet transactions will be added to your credit card Account billing statement or, in the case of debit card transactions, your transaction history and Account statements (as applicable). You are financially responsible for all such transactions and associated interest charges and fees in accordance with the Account Agreement. The Wallet may not be accepted outside of Canada or at all places where your Payment Card is accepted. Please remember if you are using a Payment Card in the Wallet that requires you to activate the Payment Card, you may have to activate the Payment Card before using it in the Wallet. With respect to an Account, each Account holder and Authorized User may add their Payment Card to the Wallet to allow them to use and make purchases on the Account using the Wallet on their own Device, and you will be responsible for all such transactions in accordance with the Account Agreement. 
4.	Applicable Fees. We do not charge you fees for adding a Payment Card to the Wallet. Please review the Account Agreement for any fees, interest, or other charges that apply to your Account. In addition, the Wallet Provider or Other Third Parties may charge you service fees when you use your Device or the Wallet.
5.	TD Bank is NOT Responsible for the Use or Function of the Wallet. TD Bank is not the provider of the Wallet and is not responsible for its use and function. We are only responsible for the Payment Card as set out in the Account Agreement. You should contact the Wallet Provider’s customer service if you have questions about how to use the Wallet or if you experience problems with the Wallet. We are not responsible for any failure of the Wallet or your inability to use a Wallet for any transaction. We are also not responsible for any loss, injury or inconvenience you suffer as a result of (a) any damage or vulnerabilities to your Device that may be directly or indirectly caused by the Wallet; (b) a merchant refusing to accept the Wallet; or (c) any actions or omissions of the Wallet Provider or any Other Third Party.
6.	Your Responsibility to Keep Your Payment Card and Wallet Credentials Secure and Notify Us of Errors or Fraud. You agree to protect and keep confidential all information required for you to access your Device and the Wallet, respectively, and all information required to make purchases with a Payment Card using the Wallet on your Device, including without limitation, your User ID, passwords, passcodes and/or verification questions, if applicable, and any other information used to authenticate you to provide access to your Device and the Wallet (the "Wallet Credentials"). If you share your Wallet Credentials or Device with others (including without limitation, by allowing others to enroll their fingerprint, set up a passcode on your Device or otherwise), they may be able to access your Device and the Wallet to make purchases with your Payment Card through the Wallet, view transactions on your Device (including by way of Notifications, which may be visible on your Device without any requirement for you to enter a login or password), or otherwise obtain your personal information. You must contact us immediately if you believe there are errors or if you suspect fraud or unauthorized use of your Payment Card. We will investigate and where appropriate resolve any potential error or fraudulent purchase on your Payment Card as set out in your Account Agreement. We will not be liable for any losses you incur except as specifically described in the Account Agreement or as otherwise provided by law. Before you sell, give away, or dispose of your Device, you must remove the Payment Card from the Wallet by following the Wallet Provider's procedures for removal, otherwise the Payment Card may be available to the person who obtains your Device and you will be responsible for any transactions completed. If your Device is lost or stolen, you must contact TD Bank immediately.
7.	Security of the Wallet. In addition to your efforts to keep your Wallet Credentials secure and confidential, we take reasonable steps to help ensure that information we send to others about your use of a Payment Card in the Wallet is sent to them in a secure manner. However, the Wallet Provider is responsible for the security of information that you provide to it or that is stored in the Wallet. We are not responsible if there is a security breach affecting any information stored in the Wallet or sent from the Wallet. However, in the unlikely event you experience an Account loss resulting from a transaction through the Wallet that you did not authorize or for which you are not responsible under these Terms or any other terms or agreement with us, you will be reimbursed for such Account losses provided you have met your security responsibilities and otherwise complied with your Account Agreement.
8.	We Can Block, Suspend, or Cancel Your Use of a Payment Card. We can block you or Authorized User(s) from adding an eligible Payment Card to the Wallet, suspend your or your Authorized User(s)' ability to use an eligible Payment Card to make purchases using the Wallet, or cancel entirely your or your Authorized User(s)' ability to continue to use a Payment Card in the Wallet. We may take these actions at any time and for any reason without notice or liability to you, such as if we suspect fraud with your Payment Card or Account, if you have an overdue or negative balance on your Account, if directed to do so by the Wallet Provider, a regulator, or the applicable payment card network associated with your Payment Card (such as Visa, MasterCard or Interac), if use of the Payment Card in the Wallet would interfere with, degrade the performance of, or adversely affect any products, services or software of TD Bank or others, or if applicable laws change or where otherwise required by applicable law. You may remove a Payment Card from the Wallet by following the Wallet Provider's procedures for removal.
9.	Notifications. You may receive notifications on your Device upon completing transactions using your Payment Card, including transactions linked to both your physical card and the Wallet (each a "Notification"). You may turn off Notifications at any time by adjusting the settings in the operating system of your Device. We are not responsible for any failure to provide you with information (including Notifications) through the Wallet at any time or for any reason. You should not rely on Notifications to confirm the final amount of any transaction as there could be transactions for amounts that are different than your final purchase when it is posted to your Account. For more information, please see our FAQs at https://td.intelliresponse.com/tdapp/. 
10.	Our Commitment to Your Privacy. We are committed to respecting the privacy of your information and we will not collect, use or disclose your information in a manner that is inconsistent with the TD Privacy Agreement, TD Privacy Code or TD Mobile Apps Privacy Code (which may be updated from time to time), available at https://www.td.com/privacy-and-security/privacy-and-security/index.jsp. The Wallet Provider may handle your information differently, so please review the Wallet Provider's applicable agreements and privacy policy that apply to their Wallet for information as to how the Wallet Provider will collect, use and disclose your personal information. We are not responsible for any loss, injury or other harm you suffer in connection with the Wallet Provider’s use of your information. 
11.	Your Personal Information. You agree that we may exchange information about you (such as your name, Payment Card and transactional data) and technical data (such as device identifier, IP address and location) with the applicable Wallet Provider and/or the payment card network associated with your Payment Card, to facilitate adding a Payment Card to the Wallet, to complete any purchase you make using a Payment Card through the Wallet, to make transactional information available to you in the Wallet (for example, to display transactions linked to both your physical card and the Wallet), for internal analytics and reporting, to help manage fraud, security and error, or to assist the Wallet Provider in improving its products. 
12.	Feedback. To the extent you provide any ideas, requests, feedback, reports, suggestions, recommendations or other information to us, in writing, orally, by demonstration or otherwise, regarding your use of the Wallet ("Feedback"), you grant to us, our contractors and third party service providers, a fully paid-up, royalty free, perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, assignable without consent license to make, use, sell, copy, transmit, modify, display, perform, derivative works of, distribute (directly or indirectly) and otherwise fully commercially exploit, including the right to sublicense, such Feedback in connection with our products and services or otherwise. You waive any and all moral rights you may have in the Feedback in favour of us. 
13.	We May Change these Terms at Any Time. We may change these Terms at any time. We will post changes to the Terms and indicate the effective date of the changes on www.td.com/to-our-customers or by other means. The date of the most recent change to these Terms is shown at the top of these Terms. Your continued use of the Payment Card in the Wallet will be taken as your acknowledgement and agreement to be bound by changes to these Terms. If you do not accept a change to these Terms, you must remove all Payment Cards from the Wallet. You agree to check www.td.com/to-our-customers for updates to these Terms from time to time. 
14.	Terms Drawn Up in English. It is the express wish of the parties that these Terms and any directly or indirectly related documents be drawn up in English. Les parties ont exprimé la volonté expresse que les présentes modalités et tous les documents s'y rattachant directement ou indirectement soient rédigés en anglais.

CHERRY HILL, NJ, March 31, 2016 /PRNewswire/ - TD Asset Management (TDAM) today announced plans to adjust its money fund lineup to address regulatory changes adopted by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in July 2014. The adjustments are summarized below and will take effect on October 14, 2016.  Throughout this process, our primary goal is to provide investors with a broad spectrum of product choices for liquidity management with little to no disruption.
Government Money Market Funds








In the government money market fund category, the following products will be offered:

TDAM U.S. Government Portfolio 
TDAM Institutional U.S. Government Fund 
TDAM Institutional Treasury Obligations Money Market Fund

Under the SEC's new rules, a government money market fund must invest at least 99.5% of its total assets in U.S. government securities, cash, or repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. government securities or cash. Historically, TDAM has managed its government and Treasury funds consistent with this new requirement and will continue to do so. Government and Treasury money market funds are exempt from new requirements for liquidity fees and redemption gates, although they could voluntarily adopt fees and/or gates in the future upon prior notice to shareholders. TDAM does not intend to impose liquidity fees or redemption gates on any of its government or Treasury funds. Finally, government funds will continue to use the amortized cost method of valuation to transact at a stable net asset value (NAV) of $1.00 per share. 
Retail Money Market Funds
In the retail money market fund category, the following products will be offered:

TDAM Money Market Portfolio 
TDAM Municipal Portfolio 
TDAM California Municipal Money Market Portfolio 
TDAM New York Municipal Money Market Portfolio

Retail money market funds are defined under the new rules as funds that have policies and procedures reasonably designed to limit all beneficial owners to natural persons, whether investing directly or through an omnibus account held at a custodian. Retail money market funds will continue to transact at a stable NAV of $1.00 per share, but will be subject to liquidity fees and redemption gates. 
Institutional Money Market Funds
Prime and municipal money market funds that are available to institutional investors must transact at a floating NAV and will be subject to liquidity fees and redemption gates.  TDAM will offer the following floating NAV products:

TDAM Institutional Money Market Fund 
TDAM Institutional Municipal Money Market Fund

Many of the changes set out above will require approval from the funds' board of directors and disclosure in the funds' registration statements. Therefore, the changes will not take effect until the necessary approvals have been obtained and the disclosures have been filed.  TDAM's plan announced today should help investors move ahead with their liquidity planning solutions.
