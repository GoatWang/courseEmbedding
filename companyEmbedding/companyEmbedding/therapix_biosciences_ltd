How Venezuela chaos could spark oil rally OPEC has failed to achieve 
              
              Political and economic turmoil in Venezuela could fuel a rise in oil prices—something the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, despite it’s efforts to cut back production, hasn’t been able to do.

Company 

AboutAbout Therapix Biosciences — Company Overview


Therapix Biosciences Ltd. (NASDAQ: TRPX; TASE: THXBY) is an emerging specialty pharma­ceu­tical company which develops unique cannabi­noid technolo­gies for the treat­ment of central nervous system (CNS) disor­ders.
Therapix is engaged in two drug devel­op­ment programs based on repur­posing an FDA, approved synthetic cannabi­noid (dronabinol):

THX-TS01 for the treat­ment of symptoms related to Tourette Syndrome (TS), and;


THX-ULD01 targeted to the high value and under-served market of mild cogni­tive impair­ment (MCI)/

Therapix has filed for Orphan Drug Designation for its THX-TS01 program formu­la­tion, which provides for a seven-year exclu­sive marketing period in the United States. Therapix also intends to pursue Orphan Drug Designation in Europe.
In a letter dated September 29, 2016, the FDA informed Therapix that its request cannot be granted at this time, and is being held in abeyance until and subject to the company providing the FDA with additional infor­ma­tion pertaining to the overall preva­lence of TS in both children and adults, and further clinical data to support Therapix’s scien­tific ratio­nale for its request for orphan drug desig­na­tion within 12 months. Therapix intends to respond within the 12 month period, or during any exten­sion thereof.
For its near-term THX-TS01 devel­op­ment program, and the longer term THK-ULD01 program targeted to MCI, Therapix is pursuing a 505 (b)(2) regula­tory strategy for FDA approval.
Therapix is also devel­oping unique cannabi­noid delivery technolo­gies to improve drug admin­is­tra­tion, including nasal and sublin­gual delivery methods for THC, with formu­la­tions designed to increase efficacy compared with standard oral admin­is­tra­tion via inges­tion.
Approvals for indica­tions such as TS and MCI may lead to appli­ca­tions in several additional thera­peutic indica­tions, including pain, cancer, anti-inﬂammatory, derma­tology, and psychi­atric disor­ders.

Therapix Biosciences and the 
Hannover Medical School Enter into an Investigator-initiated Clinical Trial 
Agreement to Assess the Effect of TXH-TS01 in Patients with Tourette Syndrome 






TEL AVIV, Israel, /PRNewswire/ -- Therapix Biosciences Ltd. (NASDAQ:
TRPX) ("Therapix"), 
a specialty clinical stage pharmaceutical company specializing in the 
development of cannabinoid-based drugs, today announced that it entered into a 
trial agreement with the Hannover Medical School to conduct a proof-of-concept 
Phase II clinical study with its lead compound, THX-TS01, for patients suffering 
from Tourette Syndrome.

As previously reported, this investigator initiated study, is projected to be 
initiated during the third quarter of 2017, subject to receiving necessary 
regulatory approvals in Germany. The study will be conducted at Hannover Medical 
School in Germany under the leadership of principal investigator, Professor 
Kirsten Muller-Vahl. The study will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo 
controlled cross-over proof-of-concept Phase II clinical study to evaluate the 
safety, tolerability and efficacy of up to twice daily oral THX-TS01 in treating 
adults with Tourette Syndrome (the "Hannover Study"). Each subject will be 
randomized to receive either THX-TS01 or placebo in a 1:1 ratio via oral 
administration. A total of 20 patients will be evaluated in a cross-over design. 
In the first stage, the patients will be randomized to either treatment or 
placebo and will 
be treated for a duration of 13 weeks. Afterwards, the patients will be 
crossed-over and will be treated for an additional 13 weeks; patients who 
initially received placebo will receive treatment and vice versa. The primary 
endpoint of the Hannover Study is to evaluate the safety, tolerance and efficacy 
of THX-TS01. The primary efficacy endpoint will be measured according to Yale 
Global Tic Severity Scale Total Tic Score, a widely-accepted index for assessing 
symptom severity and frequency. In addition, the effect of THX-TS01 will be 
evaluated by several secondary endpoints, including additional scales for 
measuring tics severity as well as other mental disorders that often accompany 
Tourette Syndrome, including OCD and ADHD.

"The therapeutic effect of THC in several CNS-related indications has long been 
established and my lab at Hannover Medical Schools feels fortunate to have been 
centrally involved in that research," stated Professor Kirsten Muller-Vahl, 
department of Psychiatry, Socialpsychiatry and Psychotherapy and head of the 
Tourette outpatient clinic at Hannover Medical School. Professor Muller-Vahl 
continued, "This robust study that we are embarking upon with Therapix 
Biosciences will assess the potential synergistic effect of THC in combination 
with PEA, in what my esteemed colleague Professor Raphael Mechoulam coined the 
'Entourage Effect' many years ago. We're enthusiastic to be conducting this 
study, and optimistic about its findings," concluded Professor Muller-Vahl.

Dr. Elran Haber, Therapix's Chief Executive Officer, stated "We're excited to 
embark upon the Hannover Study. Hannover Medical School is well regarded as a 
center of excellence in this area of research, and Professor Muller-Vahl is a 
recognized key opinion leader in both cannabinoid-based therapeutics and 
Tourette Syndrome." Dr. Haber concluded, "We're optimistic that the Hannover 
Study, in conjunction with our currently ongoing study at Yale University, will 
support earlier research done with cannabinoid-based therapies and may suggest 
that THX-TS01 is a safe and efficacious treatment for this highly debilitating 
disease with high unmet medical need."

About Therapix Biosciences:

Therapix Biosciences Ltd. is a specialty clinical-stage pharmaceutical company 
led by an experienced team of senior executives and scientists, focused on 
creating and enhancing a portfolio of technologies and assets based on 
cannabinoid pharmaceuticals. With this focus, the company is currently engaged 
in two internal drug development programs based on repurposing an FDA approved 
synthetic cannabinoid (dronabinol): THX-TS01 targets to the treatment of 
Tourette's syndrome; and THX-ULD01 targets the high-value and under-served 
market of mild cognitive impairments. Please visit our website for more 
information at www.therapixbio.com.

About THX-TS01:

THX-TS01 is a combination drug candidate for the treatment of Tourette Syndrome 
and it is based on two components: (1) dronabinol, the active ingredient in an 
FDA approved synthetic analog of tetrahydrocannabinol ("THC"), which is the 
psychoactive molecule in the cannabis plant, and (2) Palmitoylethanolamide 
("PEA"), which is an endogenous fatty acid amide that belongs to the class of 
nuclear factor agonists, which are proteins that regulate the expression of 
genes. The combination of THC and PEA may induce a reaction known as the 
"entourage effect." The basic tenet of the entourage effect is that cannabinoids 
work together, or possess synergy, and affect the body in a mechanism similar to 
the body's own cannabinoid system, which is a group of molecules and receptors 
in the brain that mediates the psychoactive effects of cannabis. This entourage 
effect may account for the pharmacological actions of PEA. Based on an activity 
enhancement of other physiological compounds, PEA may indirectly stimulate the 
cannabinoid receptors by potentiating their affinity for a receptor or by 
inhibiting their metabolic degradation, and by doing so, may increase the uptake 
of cannabinoid compounds, such as THC. Thus, it is speculated that the presence 
of the PEA molecule likely increases the efficacy of orally administered THC, 
while reducing the required dosage and decreasing associated deleterious adverse 
events.

About Tourette Syndrome:

Tourette Syndrome is a neuropsychiatric disorder, characterized by physical 
(motor) tics and vocal (phonic) tics. Motor or phonic tics are sudden, brief, 
intermittent, involuntary or semi-voluntary movements or sounds, respectively. 
They typically consist of brief, coordinated, repetitive movements, gestures, or 
utterances that mimic fragments of normal behavior. The tics associated with 
Tourette Syndrome can have significant effects on the academic and social 
development of children as well as affecting their overall self-esteem and 
mental health. Although the majority of children experience a decrease in their 
tics during adolescence, the worst symptoms are usually experienced by adults 
with intractable Tourette Syndrome.

About Therapix Biosciences Ltd:

Therapix Biosciences:
Specialty pharmaceutical company developing unique cannabinoid technologies in 
treatment of central nervous system disorders

About Therapix Biosciences — Company Overview

Therapix Biosciences Ltd. (NASDAQ: TRPX) is an emerging specialty pharmaceutical 
company developing unique cannabinoid technologies in treatment of central 
nervous system (CNS) disorders.

Therapix is engaged in two drug development programs based on repurposing an 
FDA, approved synthetic cannabinoid (dronabinol):

THX-TS01: for the treatment of symptoms related to Tourette Syndrome (TS), and 
THX-ULD01: targeted to the high value and under-served market of mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI)

Therapix has filed for Orphan Drug Designation for its THX-TS01 program 
formulation, which provides for a seven-year exclusive marketing period in the 
United States. Therapix also intends to pursue Orphan Drug Designation in 
Europe.

In a letter dated September 29, 2016, the FDA informed us that our request 
cannot be granted at this time, and is being held in abeyance until and subject 
to us providing the FDA additional information pertaining to the overall 
prevalence of TS in both children and adults, and further clinical data to 
support our scientific rationale for our request for orphan drug designation 
within 12 months. We intend to respond within the 12 month period, or during any 
extension thereof

For its near-term THX-TS01 development program and the longer term THK-ULD01 
program targeted to MCI, Therapix is pursuing a 505 (b)(2) regulatory strategy 
for FDA approval.

Therapix is also developing unique cannabinoid delivery technologies to improve 
drug administration, including nasal and sublingual delivery methods for THC, 
with formulations designed to increase efficacy compared with standard oral 
administration.

Approvals for indications such as TS and MCI may lead to applications in several 
additional therapeutic indications, including pain, cancer, anti-inﬂammatory, 
dermatology, and psychiatric disorders.

Repurposing Approved Cannabinoids for New Indications:

Using FDA approved compound: Dronabinol (biosynthetic THC)

Effective as stand-alone or in combination

Significant benefits of cannabis shown in multiple indications: CNS, pain, 
cancer, anti-inflammatory, dermatology, psychiatric disorders

TWO CLINICAL PROGRAMS TO TREAT UNDERSERVED CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM DISORDERS

THX-TS01: for the treatment of symptoms related to Tourette Syndrome (TS). 
Several studies show the beneficial effects of THC in treatment of TS patients.

The THX-TS01 program takes a unique approach to cannabinoid formulation using 
the “Entourage Effect.” THX-TS01 is a combination drug based on dronabinol, an 
FDA approved synthetic analog of THC, and PEA, PEA is naturally occurring in 
various food sources such as egg yolk, soybeans and milk. In parts of Europe, 
PEA derived products (e.g., NormastŽ and PelvilenŽ) have been marketed as a food 
for special medical purposes. In April 2015, Health Canada added PEA to its list 
of Natural Health Products, a class of health products which includes vitamins, 
mineral supplements, herbal preparations, traditional and homeopathic medicines, 
probiotics and enzymes.

Therapix is seeking orphan drug designation to treat TS.

In a letter dated September 29, 2016, the FDA informed us that our request 
cannot be granted at this time, and is being held in abeyance until and subject 
to us providing the FDA additional information pertaining to the overall 
prevalence of TS in both children and adults, and further clinical data to 
support our scientific rationale for our request for orphan drug designation 
within 12 months. We intend to respond within the 12 month period, or during any 
extension thereof.

THX-ULD01: targeted to the high value and under-served market of mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI), using a unique and proprietary drug development platform: The 
“Ultra Low-Dose.”

Pipeline 

Both programs use a 505 (b)(2) regulatory strategy based on prior FDA approval 
of dronabinol. The 505 (b)(2) strategy entails a relatively low 
scientific-technological risk compared with development of new chemical 
entities, combined with relatively low development costs and fast time to 
market.

Therapix is developing unique nasal and sub-lingual delivery and formulations to 
optimize efficacy of active cannabinoid compounds. Nasal and sub-lingual 
administration of THC has been shown to be superior to oral administration.

Approvals for indications such as TS and MCI may lead to applications in several 
additional therapeutic indications, including pain, cancer, anti-inflammatory, 
dermatology, and psychiatric disorders.

THX-TS01: THC and PEA Formulation for the Treatment of Tourette Syndrome

Tourette Syndrome (TS) is a neuropsychiatric disorder with increased prevalence 
among children. According to the 2011–2012 National Survey on Children’s Health, 
one out of every 360 children in the US have been diagnosed with TS, and about 
35,000 children have moderate or severe TS. Symptoms are physical and vocal tics 
that can be disabling and associated with hyperactivity, anger control problems, 
sleep disorders, and obsessive compulsive behavior. Current pharmacological 
treatments have very limited efficacy and are almost always accompanied by 
severe side effects. Medications used to treat TS, such as antipsychotic drugs, 
Alpha Adrenergic Agonists used for hypertension and migraine headaches, and 
anticonvulsant drugs, often have black box warnings for serious hazards.

UNIQUE APPROACH

Several studies show the beneficial effects of THC in treatment of TS patients. 
The THX-TS01 program takes a unique approach to cannabinoid formulation using 
the “Entourage Effect,” in which Endocannabinoid system constituents work 
synergistically together. The Entourage technology is licensed by Therapix.

The Therapix THX-TS01 compound is a combination drug based on:

Dronabinol (synthetic THC), the psychoactive molecule in the cannabis plant. 
Cannabinoids such as synthetic THC are used in treating a wide range of medical 
conditions, such as pain reduction, anti-inflammation, and reduction or 
prevention of nausea. They are used by cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy 
and for mental health conditions such as anxiety and posttraumatic stress 
disorder.

PEA is naturally occurring in various food sources such as egg yolk, soybeans 
and milk. In parts of Europe, PEA derived products (e.g., NormastŽ and PelvilenŽ) 
have been marketed as a food for special medical purposes. In April 2015, Health 
Canada added PEA to its list of Natural Health Products, a class of health 
products which includes vitamins, mineral supplements, herbal preparations, 
traditional and homeopathic medicines, probiotics and enzymes.

“ENTOURAGE EFFECT”

The “Entourage Effect” was first described by Professor Raphael Mechoulam in 
1998. Professor Mechoulam, a world renowned expert on pharmaceutical 
cannabinoids and member of the Therapix Medical Advisory Board. Based on 
Therapix 
research 
and preclinical studies, dronabinol and PEA have been shown to work better 
together than use of THC or PEA alone. PEA is in the endocannabioid family and 
is believed to be a pain reliever and anti-inflammatory agent. Combining PEA 
with dronabinol may stimulate cannabinoid receptors, inhibit metabolic 
degradation, and thus increase uptake of THC. The overall benefits of the PEA 
combination are considered to be an increase in efficiency of oral 
administration, enabling a decrease in dosage and lowering of side effects and 
adverse events.

Therapix is seeking orphan drug designation for its compound.

THX-ULD01: Ultra-Low Dose THC to Improve Cognitive Abilities 

Therapix is developing THX-ULD01, a new, ultra-low dose formulation of 
dronabinol, combined with sublingual and nasal delivery methods, to provide a 
treatment for Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). MCI is a pre-Alzheimer’s 
condition associated with problems with memory, language, thinking and judgement. 
MCI is a widespread condition that increases with age at a rate of 10% among 
70–79 year-olds and 25% among 80–89 year-olds. There is no FDA approved 
treatment for MCI.

Therapix has compelling preclinical animal data demonstrating that ultra-low 
dose dronabinol improves cognitive abilities. Recent studies have found that an 
ultra-low dose of THC protects the brain from long-term cognitive impairment 
which may be caused by lack of oxygen supply, seizures or use of drugs. Studies 
also suggest that ultra-low doses of THC cause animals to improve performance in 
behavioral tests that measure learning and memory.

Therapix plans to initiate a prospective, open label, randomized Phase IIa 
clinical trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of THX-ULD01 in 
treating patients with cognitive impairment. The primary efficacy endpoint of 
this trial will be change from baseline to end of 6-weeks in the Computerized 
Neurocognitive Battery, or CNB. CNB measures the performance, accuracy and speed 
of specific neurobehavioral domains using previously validated tests. Secondary 
efficacy end points will demonstrate safety and tolerability of THX-ULD01 and 
evaluate the benefit of THX-ULD01 on patient mood, anxiety and overall quality 
of life using the Hamilton scale.

Therapix is building a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on significantly 
enhancing FDA-approved dronabinol for the treatment of Tourette Syndrome and 
Mild Cognitive Impairment.

AboutAbout Therapix Biosciences — Company Overview


Therapix Biosciences Ltd. (NASDAQ: TRPX; TASE: THXBY) is an emerging specialty pharma­ceu­tical company which develops unique cannabi­noid technolo­gies for the treat­ment of central nervous system (CNS) disor­ders.
Therapix is engaged in two drug devel­op­ment programs based on repur­posing an FDA, approved synthetic cannabi­noid (dronabinol):

THX-TS01 for the treat­ment of symptoms related to Tourette Syndrome (TS), and;


THX-ULD01 targeted to the high value and under-served market of mild cogni­tive impair­ment (MCI)/

Therapix has filed for Orphan Drug Designation for its THX-TS01 program formu­la­tion, which provides for a seven-year exclu­sive marketing period in the United States. Therapix also intends to pursue Orphan Drug Designation in Europe.
In a letter dated September 29, 2016, the FDA informed Therapix that its request cannot be granted at this time, and is being held in abeyance until and subject to the company providing the FDA with additional infor­ma­tion pertaining to the overall preva­lence of TS in both children and adults, and further clinical data to support Therapix’s scien­tific ratio­nale for its request for orphan drug desig­na­tion within 12 months. Therapix intends to respond within the 12 month period, or during any exten­sion thereof.
For its near-term THX-TS01 devel­op­ment program, and the longer term THK-ULD01 program targeted to MCI, Therapix is pursuing a 505 (b)(2) regula­tory strategy for FDA approval.
Therapix is also devel­oping unique cannabi­noid delivery technolo­gies to improve drug admin­is­tra­tion, including nasal and sublin­gual delivery methods for THC, with formu­la­tions designed to increase efficacy compared with standard oral admin­is­tra­tion via inges­tion.
Approvals for indica­tions such as TS and MCI may lead to appli­ca­tions in several additional thera­peutic indica­tions, including pain, cancer, anti-inﬂammatory, derma­tology, and psychi­atric disor­ders.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.
