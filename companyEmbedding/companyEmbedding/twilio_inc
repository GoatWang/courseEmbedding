API vendor is beefing up existing products and introducing new ones. But something else also stood out: Twilio has redefined its product marketing, which in turn spotlights the very essence of communications platform as a service, or CPaaS.








If you want to develop a product or service that needs access to communication that involves humans, you can develop these features on top of a CPaaS vendor. In the CPaaS market, Twilio is the leader in terms of revenue, sales, number of customers and number of developers who use its product.
Up until last month, you could have been one of two vendors in the CPaaS market. A horizontal vendor added more and more communications tools -- starting with voice and SMS, maybe, and adding IP messaging, video and other services.
A vertical vendor served a very specific communication medium and would beef up the offering around it, usually by adding more tools to make the capability more robust. For example, a vertical vendor would offer video calling, then add group calling, and later recording and broadcasting.






The only alternative for vertical vendors was trying to move up the food chain by offering bigger pieces of the product. Vendors, for instance, would add widgets or ready-made applications for common use cases their customers were seeking, such as a video conference or webinar application. The idea was to appeal to nondevelopers by offering not only an API, but something they could use immediately.
For some vendors, this approach meant pivoting out of the pure CPaaS market. SightCall, for instance, started as a communications API provider, but has since focused on visual-assistance contact centers, leaving its CPaaS roots behind.

Shifting to a layered approach in the CPaaS market
Last year, if you looked at Twilio's representation of its product line, you'd see a classic horizontal approach. Twilio's strategy was a set of building blocks that could be used for anything, with little relation to one another, each serving its own purpose. This approach could add more building blocks in the future for additional communication means.
But at its developer conference last month, Twilio introduced a different paradigm, spending much of the keynote speech explaining this shift. Twilio's products now fit in one of three layers: Super Network, Programmable Communications Cloud and the Engagement Cloud.






The Super Network layer is about basic connectivity via various networks, which includes connectivity to PSTN, programmable SIM cards, Session Initiation Protocol trunking and other points.
The Programmable Communications Cloud is where most CPaaS vendors focus today, as they offer voice, SMS and similar capabilities. As a developer, you decide on the specific communications channel you want to use and ask for a specific action to take place -- for example, "Send an SMS to a phone number."
The Engagement Cloud is more nuanced. It is a higher level of abstraction where Twilio decided to wrap certain best practices it has seen across its customers and their behaviors. In the Engagement Cloud, Twilio is delivering four separate products: Authy, which handles authentication; Notify, which sends application-to-person messages; TaskRouter, which handles queuing; and Proxy, which connects people across groups.
These products are multichannel in nature. You can ask to send a notification to a user, but how this notification is handled -- whether it's via SMS, push notification or a social messaging service -- is decided by the product itself.


Converging fragmented channels
These days, we communicate via SMS, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Line, Snapchat and many other services. In a world where fragmentation is increasing the number of channels, the ability to work across channels is almost mandatory.

The Twilio Engagement Cloud could help alleviate this fragmentation and redefine CPaaS. Instead of developers thinking functionally on every possible option, CPaaS is becoming multichannel or omnichannel. CPaaS can offer developers the ability to design and develop interactions suitable for the requirements they see in front of them.
This approach is also Twilio's attempt to differentiate itself and maintain its prices at a time when new competitors are emerging in the CPaaS market.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures


      To provide investors and others with additional information regarding
      Twilio’s results, the following non-GAAP financial measures are
      disclosed: non-GAAP gross profit and gross margin, non-GAAP operating
      expenses, non-GAAP loss from operations and operating margin, non-GAAP
      net loss attributable to common stockholders, non-GAAP net loss per
      share attributable to common stockholders, basic and diluted, and
      non-GAAP weighted-average shares used to compute non-GAAP net loss per
      share attributable to common stockholders, basic and diluted.
    

Non-GAAP Gross Profit and Non-GAAP Gross Margin. Twilio
      defines non-GAAP gross profit and non-GAAP gross margin as GAAP gross
      profit and GAAP gross margin, respectively, adjusted to exclude
      stock-based compensation and amortization of acquired intangibles.
    

Non-GAAP Operating Expenses. Twilio defines non-GAAP
      operating expenses (including categories of operating expenses) as GAAP
      operating expenses (and categories of operating expenses) adjusted to
      exclude, as applicable, stock-based compensation, amortization of
      acquired intangibles, acquisition-related expenses, release of tax
      liabilities upon obligation settlement, gain on lease termination, and
      payroll taxes related to stock-based compensation.
    

Non-GAAP Loss from Operations and Non-GAAP Operating Margin.
Twilio defines non-GAAP loss from operations and non-GAAP operating
      margin as GAAP loss from operations and GAAP operating margin,
      respectively, adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation, amortization
      of acquired intangibles, acquisition-related expenses, release of tax
      liabilities upon obligation settlement, gain on lease termination, and
      payroll taxes related to stock-based compensation.
    

Non-GAAP Net Loss Attributable to Common Stockholders and Non-GAAP
      Net Loss Per Share Attributable to Common Stockholders, Basic and
      Diluted. Twilio defines non-GAAP net loss attributable to common
      stockholders and non-GAAP net loss per share attributable to common
      stockholders, basic and diluted, as GAAP net loss attributable to common
      stockholders and GAAP net loss per share attributable to common
      stockholders, basic and diluted, respectively, adjusted to exclude
      stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangibles,
      acquisition-related expenses, release of tax liabilities upon obligation
      settlement, gain on lease termination, and payroll taxes related to
      stock-based compensation, and, in the case of non-GAAP net loss per
      share attributable to common stockholders, basic and diluted, amounts
      attributable to convertible preferred stock.
    

      In order to calculate non-GAAP net loss per share attributable to common
      stockholders, basic and diluted, Twilio uses a non-GAAP weighted-average
      share count. Twilio defines non-GAAP weighted-average shares used to
      compute non-GAAP net loss per share attributable to common stockholders,
      basic and diluted, as GAAP weighted average shares used to compute net
      loss per share attributable to common stockholders, basic and diluted,
      adjusted to reflect the conversion of convertible preferred stock
      outstanding into Class B common stock as if it had occurred at the
      beginning of the period.
    

      Twilio’s management uses the foregoing non-GAAP financial information,
      collectively, to evaluate its ongoing operations and for internal
      planning and forecasting purposes. Twilio’s management believes that
      non-GAAP financial information, when taken collectively, may be helpful
      to investors because it provides consistency and comparability with past
      financial performance, facilitates period-to-period comparisons of
      results of operations, and assists in comparisons with other companies,
      many of which use similar non-GAAP financial information to supplement
      their GAAP results. Non-GAAP financial information is presented for
      supplemental informational purposes only, and should not be considered a
      substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP,
      and may be different from similarly-titled non-GAAP measures used by
      other companies. Whenever Twilio uses a non-GAAP financial measure, a
      reconciliation is provided to the most directly comparable financial
      measure stated in accordance with GAAP. Investors are encouraged to
      review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of
      these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP
      financial measures.
    

      With respect to Twilio’s guidance as provided under “Outlook” above,
      Twilio has not reconciled its expectations as to non-GAAP loss from
      operations to GAAP loss from operations or non-GAAP net loss per share
      to GAAP net loss per share because stock-based compensation expense
      cannot be reasonably calculated or predicted at this time. Accordingly,
      a reconciliation is not available without unreasonable effort.
    

Operating Metrics


Twilio reviews a number of operating metrics to evaluate its business,
      measure performance, identify trends, formulate business plans, and make
      strategic decisions. These include the number of Active Customer
      Accounts, Base Revenue, and the Dollar-Based Net Expansion Rate.
    

Number of Active Customer Accounts. Twilio believes that
      the number of Active Customer Accounts is an important indicator of the
      growth of its business, the market acceptance of its platform and future
      revenue trends. Twilio defines an Active Customer Account at the end of
      any period as an individual account, as identified by a unique account
      identifier, for which Twilio has recognized at least $5 of revenue in
      the last month of the period. Twilio believes that use of its platform
      by customers at or above the $5 per month threshold is a stronger
      indicator of potential future engagement than trial usage of its
      platform or usage at levels below $5 per month. A single organization
      may constitute multiple unique Active Customer Accounts if it has
      multiple account identifiers, each of which is treated as a separate
      Active Customer Account.
    

Base Revenue. Twilio monitors Base Revenue as one of the
      more reliable indicators of future revenue trends. Base Revenue consists
      of all revenue other than revenue from large Active Customer Accounts
      that have never entered into 12-month minimum revenue commitment
      contracts with Twilio, which the Company refers to as Variable Customer
      Accounts. While almost all of Twilio’s customers exhibit some level of
      variability in the usage of its products, based on the experience of
      Twilio’s management, Twilio believes that Variable Customer Accounts are
      more likely to have significant fluctuations in usage of its products
      from period to period, and therefore that revenue from Variable Customer
      Accounts may also fluctuate significantly from period to period. This
      behavior is best evidenced by the decision of such customers not to
      enter into contracts with Twilio that contain minimum revenue
      commitments, even though they may spend significant amounts on the use
      of the Company’s products and they may be foregoing more favorable terms
      often available to customers that enter into committed contracts with
      Twilio. This variability adversely affects Twilio’s ability to rely upon
      revenue from Variable Customer Accounts when analyzing expected trends
      in future revenue.
    

      For historical periods through March 31, 2016, Twilio defined a Variable
      Customer Account as an Active Customer Account that (i) had never signed
      a minimum revenue commitment contract with the Company for a term of at
      least 12 months and (ii) has met or exceeded 1% of the Company’s revenue
      in any quarter in the periods presented through March 31, 2016. To allow
      for consistent period-to-period comparisons, in the event a customer
      qualified as a Variable Customer Account as of March 31, 2016, or a
      previously Variable Customer Account ceased to be an Active Customer
      Account as of such date, Twilio included such customer as a Variable
      Customer Account in all periods presented. For reporting periods
      starting with the three months ended June 30, 2016, Twilio defines a
      Variable Customer Account as a customer account that (a) has been
      categorized as a Variable Customer Account in any prior quarter, as well
      as (b) any new customer account that (i) has never signed a minimum
      revenue commitment contract with Twilio for a term of at least 12 months
      and (ii) meets or exceeds 1% of the Company’s revenue in a quarter. Once
      a customer account is deemed to be a Variable Customer Account in any
      period, they remain a Variable Customer Account in subsequent periods
      unless they enter into a minimum revenue commitment contract with Twilio
      for a term of at least 12 months.
    

Dollar-Based Net Expansion Rate. Twilio’s ability to drive
      growth and generate incremental revenue depends, in part, on the
      Company’s ability to maintain and grow its relationships with existing
      Active Customer Accounts and to increase their use of the platform. An
      important way in which Twilio tracks its performance in this area is by
      measuring the Dollar-Based Net Expansion Rate for Active Customer
      Accounts, other than Variable Customer Accounts. Twilio’s Dollar-Based
      Net Expansion Rate increases when such Active Customer Accounts increase
      their usage of a product, extend their usage of a product to new
      applications or adopt a new product. Twilio’s Dollar-Based Net Expansion
      Rate decreases when such Active Customer Accounts cease or reduce their
      usage of a product or when the Company lowers usage prices on a product.
      As our customers grow their businesses and extend the use of our
      platform, they sometimes create multiple customer accounts with us for
      operational or other reasons. As such, for reporting periods starting
      with the three months ended December 31, 2016, when we identify a
      significant customer organization (defined as a single customer
      organization generating more than 1% of revenue in a quarterly reporting
      period) that has created a new Active Customer Account, this new Active
      Customer Account is tied to, and revenue from this new Active Customer
      Account is included with, the original Active Customer Account for the
      purposes of calculating this metric. Twilio believes that measuring
      Dollar-Based Net Expansion Rate on revenue generated from Active
      Customer Accounts, other than Variable Customer Accounts, provides a
      more meaningful indication of the performance of the Company’s efforts
      to increase revenue from existing customer accounts.
    

      Twilio’s Dollar-Based Net Expansion Rate compares the revenue from
      Active Customer Accounts, other than Variable Customer Accounts, in a
      quarter to the same quarter in the prior year. To calculate the
      Dollar-Based Net Expansion Rate, the Company first identifies the cohort
      of Active Customer Accounts, other than Variable Customer Accounts, that
      were Active Customer Accounts in the same quarter of the prior year. The
      Dollar-Based Net Expansion Rate is the quotient obtained by dividing the
      revenue generated from that cohort in a quarter, by the revenue
      generated from that same cohort in the corresponding quarter in the
      prior year. When Twilio calculates Dollar-Based Net Expansion Rate for
      periods longer than one quarter, it uses the average of the applicable
      quarterly Dollar-Based Net Expansion Rates for each of the quarters in
      such period.
