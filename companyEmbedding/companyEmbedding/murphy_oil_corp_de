Recruitment Fraud






















Contact UsRoyalty Owners








Careers

Recruitment Fraud
What is Recruitment Fraud?
Recruitment fraud generally uses online services such as email, websites, or chat rooms to present fraudulent employment solicitations. Recruitment fraud schemes can take many forms which may change over time. Common recruitment fraud scams include the following:
Establishment of a counterfeit website featuring the oil and gas company’s name, logo, and certain contact information. The perpetrators of this type of fraud hope internet users will log on to the site and submit personal information on the recruiting Web page or call a bogus contact number, which will result in the caller receiving excessive long-distance charges.
Sending emails purporting to be from the oil and gas company. These emails will request the recipient to reply with an email containing personal information or to log onto a counterfeit Web site and submit personal information.
Sending emails purporting to be from independent recruiters. These emails will request the payment of money in order to secure a position with the oil and gas company or to cover travel expenses or visa fees. The purported recruiters are fraudulent and will retain the money without providing any promised services.
Protections against Recruitment Fraud
To identify and avoid recruitment fraud, please keep the following in mind:Murphy Oil (or any of the organizations that recruit on behalf of Murphy Oil) never asks for any money from applicants. Applicants are never asked to pay for travel, immigration, or other fees or expenses. Murphy Oil will never request copies of passports, driver's licenses, credit cards, or other forms of personal identification by email.
Murphy Oil email addresses always end in "@murphyoilcorp.com." Any email purporting to be from Murphy Oil which uses a different format is not genuine. Murphy Oil will never request a prospective applicant to email information to an email address not ending in "@murphyoilcorp.com.”
Murphy Oil's website always begin with the following:

http://www.murphyoilcorp.com/

Any other format is not genuine. Murphy Oil will never request a prospective applicant to visit a website with any address other than the one listed above.

About Murphy Exploration & Production Company - USA

   Irish name, American focus. Murphy Exploration & Production - USA, a subsidiary of integrated oil giant Murphy Oil, is engaged in oil and gas exploration and production, primarily in the Eagle Ford shale play in South Texas, as well as in oil and gas fields located in the Gulf of Mexico, and onshore in Louisiana. Murphy Exploration & Production - USA reported proved reserves of 214.7 million barrels of oil and 185 billion cu. ft. of natural gas in 2013. The Eagle Ford play accounted for 185.3 million barrels of proved oil reserves and 104 billion cubic feet of proved natural gas reserves.
   Operations

   In 2013 Murphy Exploration & Production - USA produced 48,400 barrels of oil per day and 53 million cu. ft. of natural gas per day (about 36% of the parent company's total worldwide oil and 13% of its gas production volumes).
  

   Murphy Oil  got 31% of its total production in the US from Gulf of Mexico fields (and two-thirds of that from three fields -- Medusa, Front Runner, and Thunder Hawk).
  

   US proved oil reserves were revised upwards in 2013 thanks to  better well performance in the Eagle Ford Shale area in South Texas, conversion of proved wet gas reserves to proved oil reserves that include natural gas liquids, and minor additoons to several fields in the Gulf of Mexico. US proved natural gas reserves saw negative revisions due to the conversion of proved wet gas reserves to proved residual gas reserves.
  
Geographic Reach
 Murphy Oil's oil and natural gas assets include six operated fields and five non-operated fields in the US in seven producing fields in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico.
  
Financial Performance

   There are no separate financials for the company; however Murphy Oil reported that US oil, gas liquids, and natural gas revenues grew by 74% in 2013, thanks to higher volumes and an increase in liquids and gas prices, partially offset by lower oil prices.
  

   Oil production increased from 26,090 barrels per day in 2012 to 48,387 barrels per day in 2013. The 85% jump in volume came from  drilling and other operations in the Eagle Ford Shale.
  

   Murphy Exploration & Production Company - USA accounted for about 34% of its parent company's total revenues in 2013.
  
Strategy

   Once focused on the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, Murphy Exploration & Production - USA has found the Eagle Ford Shale to been its most lucrative oil patch in recent years. The company has acquired rights to 182,000,000 gross acres in the Eagle Ford Shale unconventional oil and gas play, and had ten active drilling rigs operating in the play in 2013. It stays active in the Gulf of Mexico, however, with two to three exploration wells per year.
  

   The parent company's development expenditures in 2013 included $1.5 billion for the drilling and completion program in the Eagle Ford Shale, compared to $230.9 million for fields in the Gulf of Mexico (including Dalmatian which starts up in 2014); $157 million for synthetic oil operations; and $140 million for heavy oil at Seal in Western Canada.
  
Company Background

   Murphy Exploration & Production - USA first moved into the deepwater Gulf of Mexico in 1996. The Medusa and Habanero fields were both placed onstream in 2003.
  

   At the Murphy-operated Thunder Hawk field (37.5%) located in Mississippi Canyon in the Gulf of Mexico, the company and its and partners are developing a stand-alone semi-submersible floating production unit with a production capacity of 45,000 barrels a day. The first oil from the platform is scheduled to come online in 2009.

MURPHY OIL CORPORATION ANNOUNCES PRELIMINARY FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL YEAR 2016 FINANCIAL AND OPERATING RESULTS 


﻿


EL DORADO, Arkansas, January 25, 2017 – Murphy Oil Corporation (NYSE: MUR) today announced its preliminary financial and operating results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2016, including a net loss of $64 million, or $0.37 per diluted share. 


Operating and financial highlights for the fourth quarter and full year 2016 include:



 ·



Produced volumes of 168 Mboepd in the fourth quarter and 176 Mboepd for full year


 ·



Spent $605 million on capital investments for full year, excluding acquisitions 


 ·



Lowered lease operating expense per barrel by approximately 15 percent year-over-year, excluding Syncrude 


 ·



Reduced selling and general expenses by approximately 14 percent year-over-year


 ·



Generated $1.2 billion cash from non-core asset divestitures during the year


 ·



Continued streamlining onshore portfolio by entering into an agreement to divest Canadian heavy oil asset at Seal 


 ·



Expanded exploration portfolio by farming into a successfully drilled prospect in the Gulf of Mexico as well as capturing a block in Mexico’s deepwater bid round

FOURTH QUARTER 2016 FINANCIAL RESULTS


Murphy incurred a net loss of $64 million, or $0.37 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter 2016. The company reported an adjusted loss, which excludes both the results of discontinued operations and certain other items that affect comparability of results between periods, of $27 million, or $0.16 per diluted share. Details for fourth quarter results can be found in the attached schedules.


During the quarter, the company recorded a $24 million after tax estimated redetermination expense related to an expected reduction in the company’s working interest covering the period from inception through year-end 2016 at the non-operated Kakap-Gumusut field in Block K Malaysia. The company expects to incur additional redetermination expense during 2017 for the period from the beginning of the year until the redetermination process is finalized, and the final adjustment will be settled in cash. The company is assuming that its working interest will be lowered, however, the amount of the reduction is not final until approved by Malaysian regulatory authorities.

mur_10k_2017-02-24_9_9Financial - ExpenseExploration expenses were $42.7 million less in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to lower geological and geophysical costs and lower exploration costs in other foreign areas.
mur_10k_2017-02-24_7_90Financial - ExpenseLowered selling and general expenses by approximately 14 percent year-over-year.
mur_10k_2017-02-24_9_10Financial - ExpenseSelling and general expenses in 2015 decreased by nearly 16% from 2014 as the Company implemented key organizational changes including lowering staffing levels by over 20% from end of the prior year.
mur_10k_2017-02-24_19_55Revenue - ProductAlthough the estimation of reserves and future production is uncertain, the Company believes that its estimates are reasonable however, there have been cases where actual production volumes were higher or lower than projected and the timing was different than the original projection.
mur_10k_2017-02-24_22_66Other - OtherThe most important of these assumptions for the retirement plans involve the discount rate used to measure future plan obligations and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets.
mur_10k_2017-02-24_9_7Financial - ExpenseLease operating expenses declined $257.6 million in 2015 compared to 2014 essentially due to sale of interests in Malaysia, lower service costs, cost saving initiatives and a lower average foreign exchange rate in Canada.
mur_10k_2017-02-24_11_18Other - OtherLower oil production in 2016 in Malaysia was primarily attributable to natural well decline at most fields, partially offset by higher production at Kakap.
mur_10k_2017-02-24_23_75Financial - ExpenseFuture required payments and the amount of liabilities recorded on the balance sheet associated with the plans could be unfavorably affected if the discount rate declines, the actual return on plan assets falls below the assumed return, or the health care cost trend rate increase is higher than expected.
mur_10k_2017-02-24_9_6Financial - IncomeInterest and other income in 2015 was $43.6 million above 2014 levels primarily due to higher profits realized on changes in foreign exchange rates during 2015.
mur_10k_2017-02-24_23_77Financial - ExpenseAs described above, the Companys retirement and postretirement expenses are sensitive to certain assumptions, primarily related to discount rates and assumed return on plan assets.
mur_10k_2017-02-24_9_5Revenue - ProductGain on sale of assets was $15.3 million higher in 2015, primarily associated with a pretax gain of $155.1 million generated on the 2015 sale of 10% of the Companys oil and gas assets in Malaysia compared to $144.8 million gain on sale of 20% on these assets in 2014.
mur_10k_2017-02-24_10_12Financial - IncomeThe 2016 period was favorably affected by deferred tax benefits recognized related to the Canadian asset dispositions and income tax benefits on investments in foreign exploration areas.
mur_10k_2017-02-24_17_33Other - OtherEstimated reserves are subject to future revision, certain of which could be substantial, based on the availability of additional information, including: reservoir performance, new geological and geophysical data, additional drilling, technological advancements, price changes and other economic factors.
mur_10k_2017-02-24_22_67Financial - ExpenseFor the retiree medical and insurance plans, the most important assumptions are the discount rate for future plan obligations and the health care cost trend rate.
mur_10k_2017-02-24_16_26Other - OtherOil and gas proved reserves  Oil and gas proved reserves are defined by the SEC as those quantities of oil and gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations before the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether a deterministic method or probabilistic method is used for the estimation.
mur_10k_2017-02-24_12_20Revenue - ProductThe Company decommissioned the Milford Haven refinery units and completed the sale of its remaining downstream assets in the U.K. in the second quarter of 2015 for cash proceeds of $5.5 million.
mur_10k_2017-02-24_19_60Other - OtherFuture marketing or operating decisions, such as closing or selling certain assets, and future regulatory or tax changes could also impact the Companys conclusion about potential asset impairment.

What Is Delaware Franchise Tax?
When Is It Due?
How Do I Calculate My Franchise Tax?
Do I Need to Submit Anything Else With My Payment?
Is My Franchise Tax the Same As My Annual Registered Agent Fee?
What Do I Do After Paying My Franchise Tax?




What Is Delaware Franchise Tax?
The Franchise Tax is the fee imposed by the state of Delaware for the right or privilege to own a Delaware company. The tax has no bearing on income or company activity—it is simply required by the state of Delaware to maintain the good standing status of your company.
 
The term "Franchise Tax" does not imply that your company is a franchise business. 



When Is It Due?
The due date of your tax varies, depending on your company type.
 
The Franchise Tax for a corporation is due by March 1 of every year. If the tax is not paid on or before March 1, the state imposes a $125 late penalty, plus a monthly interest fee of 1.5 percent.
 
The Franchise Tax for a Delaware LLC is due by June 1 of every year. The limited partnership (LP) Franchise Tax is also due by June 1 of every year. If the tax is not paid on or before June 1, the state imposes a $200 late penalty, plus a monthly interest fee of 1.5 percent.
 
Corporations, LLCs and LPs are taxed in arrears, meaning the tax due by each due date is for the previous calendar year.



How Do I Calculate My Franchise Tax?
The Franchise Tax for a Delaware limited liability company (LLC) or Delaware limited partnership (LP) is a flat annual rate of $300 as of July 1, 2014.
 
The Franchise Tax for a corporation is a little more complicated. It is based on your corporation type and the number of authorized shares your company has. The total cost of the Franchise Tax is comprised of an annual report fee and the actual tax due.
 
A non-stock/non-profit company is considered exempt with the state of Delaware. This type of company does not pay the annual tax but must file and pay the annual report fee. The annual report fee is $25 per year.
 
A corporation having 5,000 authorized shares or less is considered a minimum stock corporation. The annual report fee is $50 and the tax is $175 as of July 1, 2014, for a total of $225 per year.
 
A corporation having 5,001 authorized shares or more is considered a maximum stock corporation. The annual report fee is $50 and the tax would be somewhere between $200 and $180,000 per year.
 
There are two methods to calculate a maximum stock company's Franchise Tax. They are:


The Authorized Shares Method
 
The state of Delaware uses this method to initially calculate your taxes. This method is calculated based on the number of authorized shares. The calculation is as follows:

5,000 shares or less: $175 (as of July 1, 2014)
5,001 - 10,000 shares: $250 (as of July 1, 2014)
Additional 10,000 shares or portion thereof: add $75
The maximum annual tax is $180,000

 
Don't forget to add the $50 annual report fee to the Franchise Tax after it is calculated.
 


The Assumed Par Value Capital Method
The state of Delaware allows you to pay the lower of the two calculation methods. Therefore, if you receive a bill from Delaware for tens of thousands of dollars, it may be in your best interest to try calculating your Franchise Tax with the assumed par value capital method.
 
In order to utilize this filing method, you will need to provide the company's total gross assets (as reported on the Form 1120, Schedule L) and the total number of issued shares. Many times the tax is then calculated to the minimum payment of $350 Franchise Tax plus the $50 annual report fee.
 
The calculation used for this method is more complex. Please contact our office if you would like a copy of the calculation emailed to you. We will be happy to help you with this calculation.



How Do I Pay My Franchise Tax?
We make it easy to pay your Franchise Tax online.
 
As your Registered Agent,we will send you tax reminders both by mail and email, well in advance of the due date. We offer a tax filing service for a small fee of $49 plus your Franchise Tax. We also offer an online discounted filing fee that ranges from $29 to $59, depending on when the online payment is submitted.
 
Payments can be submitted via our online Franchise Tax payment form.
 
You can also email or fax (302- 645-1280) us your LLC/LP Franchise Tax worksheet or your corporation Franchise Tax worksheet. If you would like to make your payment by phone, call us at 800-345-2677, Ext. 6904.
 
 
 




 
Do I Need to Submit Anything Else With My Payment?
Yes. Corporations must complete an annual report along with their Franchise Tax payment. This report must list the company's physical address (not a P.O. box and not your Registered Agent's address); the name and physical address of at least one director; and, if there are any officers, the name, title and physical address of one of the officers.
 
If the tax is being calculated with the assumed par value capital method, the gross assets and issued shares are also to be listed. If you decide to pay your Delaware Franchise Tax for a corporation with us over the phone, the annual report would then need to be separately submitted to us by email, fax or mail.



Is My Franchise Tax the Same As My Annual Registered Agent Fee?
The Delaware Franchise Tax and the Registered Agent Fee are two separate, unrelated fees. The annual Franchise Tax is imposed by the state of Delaware. The annual Registered Agent Fee is paid to Harvard Business Services, Inc. to act as an agent for your entity in the state .
 
Our annual Registered Agent Fee is $50 per year, and is due on the anniversary month of the formation of your company.  It is the lowest Registered Agent fee in the industry, and it is guaranteed to remain fixed at $50 per year, as long as the fee is paid on time and your company remains in good standing with the state of Delaware.
 
Learn more about the Delaware Franchise Tax in this short video:
 




 
What Do I Do After Paying My Franchise Tax?
After paying Franchise Tax, many business owners require a Delaware Certificate of Good Standing.
 
A Certificate of Good Standing is a document sent directly from the Delaware Secretary of State certifying the date the company was formed in the state of Delaware, that the company is current with all Delaware taxes and that the company is in good standing.
 
This is not the same as your annual report and will not mention internal company information, such as director or officer details.
 
We can assist you in obtaining this document. To purchase a Certificate of Good Standing, please visit our Good Standing order page.
 
If you have any additional questions or concerns about the Delaware Franchise Tax, please feel free to call 1-800-345-2677, Ext. 6904 or email us.

Delaware Certificate of Good Standing

Order Your Certificate Now 
The Delaware Certificate of Good Standing is also known as a Certificate of Existence.
 
It is a letter provided by the Delaware Secretary of State that declares that a company is in good standing with the state. It specifically lists the incorporation date, good standing status for a corporation or LLC and whether taxes are current for a corporation or LLC.

(If you already know you need to order a Delaware Certificate of Good Standing, please visit our Delaware Certificate of Good Standing order page. If you'd like to learn more, read on.)
 
Typically, a Certificate of Good Standing is required in order to open a corporate bank account, purchase or sell real estate, obtain a loan, obtain a Certificate of Authority to operate in another state, merge with another company and more.
 
Since the certified document verifies that a company is in good standing on the date it was issued, authorities will generally accept it as proof that the business is valid for 30-60 days after the issue date. Beyond 60 days, however, a new Certificate of Good Standing may need to be ordered.
 
Please click the buttons below to view a sample of a Delaware Certificate of Good Standing—with and without an Apostille.
 

 

Due to the time sensitivity of the Certificate, it is better to order one when you know you'll need it. If you are in a hurry, we can obtain a Certificate for you in two hours if necessary.
 
This certificate can be issued only for companies in good standing with the state of Delaware. If your company owes Delaware Franchise Taxes, they must be paid in full before we can order your Certificate of Good Standing.
 
You may email customer support, call 1-800-345-2677 or live chat with a specialist to determine if your company owes a tax balance.
 
To order a Certificate of Good Standing for your corporation or LLC, please view our pricing options, which start at $99, and then click on the yellow button below:
