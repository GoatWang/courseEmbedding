About Encore

Encore Capital Group is an international specialty finance company with operations in 11 countries. Our subsidiaries purchase portfolios of consumer receivables from major banks, credit unions, utility providers, and municipalities, and partner with individuals as they repay their obligations and work toward financial recovery.
Subsidiaries include Midland Credit Management, which purchases and services unsecured consumer debt in the US;  Grove Capital Management, and Cabot Credit Management, which acquire and service consumer debt in the United Kingdom,  Rep. of Ireland and Spain; Lucania Gestión, a leader in the Spanish debt collection industry; Baycorp, a company at the forefront of debt purchasing and contingency collections in Australia and New Zealand and Refinancia, which services distressed consumer debt in Colombia and Peru.
Encore’s success is fueled by our demonstrated commitment to conducting business ethically and in ways that support consumers’ financial recovery, sophisticated and widespread use of analytics, significant investments in data and behavioral science, and cost advantages provided by our highly efficient operating model and proven investment strategy.
In 2011, Encore and Midland Credit Management unveiled the industry’s first and only Consumer Bill of Rights, which codifies the company’s commitment to respectful consumer treatment. We strive every day to treat consumers with dignity and respect as they work toward financial recovery. Some of the tenets of our Consumer Bill of Rights include contacting consumers in a timely and effective manner, resolving accounts quickly and honestly, forgiveness of debt in times of hardship, collection practices that preserve dignity, and fair and reasonable use of litigation. In 2016, updates were made to the Consumer Bill of Rights to further reflect Encore’s consumer-centric practices. The expanded Consumer Bill of Rights not only contains Encore’s policy toward ceasing collections for active duty military personnel, but also includes provisions for maximizing consumer understanding of their obligations, enhanced consumer disclosures, a debt validation period that goes beyond the current legal requirement, and a grace period before commencing credit reporting of debt.
In 2013, Encore Capital Group launched our global Corporate Social Responsibility program, which demonstrates the company’s commitment to support our employees and communities through volunteerism, financial donations and strategic nonprofit partnerships.
Encore’s Consumer Credit Research Institute (CCRI), is an effort to support data-driven research analyzing the impact of public policy on the availability and affordability of credit to consumers. In the past, CCRI has partnered with leading universities, not-for-profit institutions, and policy agencies to research consumer financial behavior, explore the ways in which consumers get into financial trouble, and look for ways to break the cycle of chronic debt that can lead to financial distress.
Headquartered in San Diego, Encore is a publicly traded NASDAQ Global Select company (ticker symbol: ECPG) and a component stock of the Russell 2000, the S&P SmallCap 600, and the Wilshire 4500. The company collected more than $1.7 billion in 2015.
The company’s US operations include facilities in San Diego; Phoenix; St. Cloud, MN; Troy, MI; New Freedom, PA; and Roanoke, VA.
More information about Encore’s Cabot Credit Management subsidiary, including information about its quarterly and annual financial results, can be found at www.cabotcm.com.

Encore Capital Group, Inc., and subsidiaries form the largest publicly traded debt buyer by revenue in the United States.[2][3]:235[4] They purchase "portfolios of defaulted consumer receivables from major banks, credit unions, and utility providers,"[5] and recover collectable debt from these accounts. Jake Halpern author of Bad Paper, described Encore Capital as a "behemoth" in the American debt-industry complex.[6] At the corporate level debt collection is highly profitable and Encore Capital enjoyed soaring revenues from $316 million in 2009 to $773 million in 2013.[6] The firm is a publicly traded NASDAQ Global Select company, a component stock of the Russell 2000, the S&P SmallCap 600, and the Wilshire 4500.
Their business model is highly lucrative as debt-collectors "buy huge swaths of soured bills from lenders for pennies on the dollar."[7] From 2007 to 2012 in New York State alone, Encore Capital and its subsidiaries filed more than 239,000 lawsuits and in 2013 alone collected $564.7 million in legal collections.[7]

History[edit]
Encore Capital Group’s wholly owned operating subsidiary, Midland Credit Management, Inc., was founded in 1953 and was incorporated in Kansas in September 1953. In 1998, an investor group led by Nelson Peltz and Peter May (members of Triarc Companies, Inc. management) and Kerry Packer of Consolidated Press International Holdings Limited, acquired a majority interest in its operations. In 1999, the group formed a holding company, MCM Capital Group, Inc., later renamed Encore Capital Group, Inc. in April 2002. The company was incorporated in Delaware in April 1999 as MCM Capital Group, Inc. and changed its name to Encore Capital Group, Inc. in April 2002. The company completed its initial public offering of 2,250,000 shares of common stock in July 1999.[8] In June, 2013, Encore acquired Asset Acceptance Corporation ( NASDAQ: AACC), another large publicly held debt buyer based in Warren, Michigan. This increased the size of Encore Capital.[9] In 2013, Encore began a series of acquisitions of international debt buying companies. These include Cabot Credit Management in the UK and Ireland, Refinancia S.A. in Colombia and Peru, Mexico with other Latin America locations, and Baycorp Holdings in Australia.
Regulatory Action[edit]
In September 2015, both Encore and Portfolio Recovery Associates, the United States two largest publicly held debt buyers were charged with violating the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act by filing "lawsuits against consumers without having the intent to prove many of the debts, winning the vast majority of the lawsuits by default when consumers failed to defend themselves."[4] U.S. federal regulators - Consumer Financial Protection Bureau imposed an enforcement action on Encore for pressuring borrowers "to pay with false statements, with lawsuits and with the use of using so-called robo-signed court documents."[10] According to the New York Times Encore must pay "$42 million in consumer refunds and a $10 million penalty" and an injunction to "stop collections on debts totaling more than $125 million."[10] In New York State Encore and other debt buyers were filing lawsuits against customers to collect debts in hundreds of court cases which included "generic testimony" or relied on robo-signed bogus affidavits compared to the robo-signing controversy in the 2010 United States foreclosure crisis. At the same time "preventing those same consumers from using the courts to challenge the companies’ tactics."[7] In response to the enforcement action imposed on Encore Capital Group by the CEO Kenneth A. Vecchione claimed that its debt collection practices were not improper and that the C.F.P.B. was "subjecting companies to its own interpretations that have never been codified or adopted."[10]
Business[edit]
According to their 2012 SEC filing, Encore "purchases portfolios of defaulted consumer receivables at deep discounts to face value and uses a variety of channels to maximize collections from these portfolios. In addition, the firm provides bankruptcy support services to some companies in the financial services industry; through their wholly owned subsidiary, Ascension Capital Group, Inc. ("Ascension")."[11]
In 2009 Encore Capital filed 448,000 lawsuits.[3]:235[12]:39
Locations[edit]
Encore Capital Group is based in San Diego, California, with additional sites in Arizona, Minnesota, Texas, Michigan, India, and Costa Rica In addition, the international subsidiaries operate in their own countries. It employs about 3,400 people (as of December, 2015 across these locations, and also has a large third-party network of collection agents and litigators in the United States.
Leadership team[edit]
Ashish Masih is Encore Capital Group's President and Chief Executive Officer.
Financials[edit]
In 2010, the firm paid $362 million, to purchase $10.9 billion in face value of debt. In 2011, it paid $386.9 million to purchase $11.7 billion in face value of debt,[1] Of this $386.9 million, $346.3 million was credit card portfolios, $1.6 million consumer bankruptcy accounts, and $38.9 million telecom accounts.
The Company's revenue increased 22.5% in 2011 to $467.4 million.[1] Gross collections increased to $761.2 million in 2011, a 26% increase from 2010. Collection sites accounted for $336.0 million, while legal collections accounted for $377.5 million. External collection agency forwarding accounted for $47.7 million in gross collections.
Encore's 2015 SEC filings report revenues of $1.2 billion dollars for calendar year ending in December 31, 2015, and $1.1 billion for 2014.
Litigation Practices[edit]
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, an official site of the United States government, reported on September 2, 2015 that the nation's two largest debt buyers, Encore and Portfolio Recovery Associates, violated the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act by filing "lawsuits against consumers without having the intent to prove many of the debts, winning the vast majority of the lawsuits by default when consumers failed to defend themselves."[4]
Already by 2010 the Wall Street Journal was investigating litigation practices as a business plan for large, publicly traded debt buyers like Encore.[2] Journalist Jessica Silver-Greenberg reported that the modern debt-buying industry was created in response to the savings-and-loan crisis.[2]

"Lawmakers established the Resolution Trust Corp. to shutter failed thrifts and auction other assets to buyers. By the mid-1990s, the RTC sold more than $450 billion in these assets. Over time, some buyers of such assets shifted to a new source of profit: charged-off credit-card debt and other consumer debt.
— Wall Street Journal 2010

In 2009 alone Encore Capital filed 448,000 lawsuits[3]:235[12]:39— the most filed by any company in the United States that year.[2]

"Encore posted $33 million in profit last year, up 139% from 2008. While the Standard and Poor's 500-stock index rose 23.5% in 2009, Encore's stock soared 142%. Between 2007 and 2008, the company scooped up $20 billion in charged-off loans for $695.9 million. In order to wring more cash from debt, Encore increasingly has turned to the courts. Lawsuits are filed by a network of outside law firms. Last year, Encore paid $112.6 million for legal collection, which brought in $233 million. Once Encore sues, it is virtually assured a win, says Mr. Black, the company's CEO. Roughly 94% of collection cases filed against borrowers result in default judgments in favor of the debt buyer, according to industry estimates. The majority of borrowers don't have a lawyer, some don't know they are even being sued, and others don't appear in court, say judges."
— Wall Street Journal 2010

January 2015[edit]
New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman sued Encore (Midland’s parent company) over shoddy practices and forced Encore to pay a $675,000 penalty and vacate more than 4,500 court judgments against borrowers.[7] Mr. Schneiderman added,

"New York has laws in place to ensure no one can prey on consumers, and debt collectors are required to follow those rules...[T]oday’s settlement ensures that thousands of New Yorkers will see millions in relief from debts that were not enforceable in the first place."
— New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman January 2015

Robo signing lawsuits[edit]
According to a New York Times article, In September 2015, U.S. federal regulators - Consumer Financial Protection Bureau - ordered the two big debt-collecting agencies, Encore Capital Group and Portfolio Recovery Associates, to "pay a combined $79 million in refunds and penalties, to stop collections on debts totaling $128 million and to change their debt collection practices."[10] Robo-signing refers to the use of false and misleading affidavits signed by debt-collecting agency staff claiming personal knowledge of an alleged debt that are then used in court. On August 11, 2009 the Northern District of Ohio court issued a landmark ruling that robo-signing affidavits in debt-collection violates the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA). In the 2009 case the debt-collector employees had "been signing between 200 and 400 computer-generated affidavits per day for use in debt-collection actions, without personal knowledge of the accounts."[13]

"The bureau said the companies bought the rights to collect debts that were potentially inaccurate, lacked documentation or were legally unenforceable, and tried to collect the money without verifying the debt. The bureau said the companies pressured borrowers to pay with false statements, with lawsuits and with the use of so-called robo-signed court documents."
— New York Times, September 9, 2015

Context[edit]
Illegal robo-signing tactics used by debt-collectors were first uncovered through a 2008 affidavit signed by Midland Credit Management debt-collection agency employee "claimed personal knowledge that Andrea Brent owed a debt of over $4,000 to Midland Funding." This affidavit was used to file a debt-collection against Brent. Brent brought a class-action counterclaim against Midland "alleging violations of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA) and state common law because the attached affidavit was signed "without personal knowledge of the facts asserted."[13] By June 2008 the case was removed to the Northern District of Ohio. On August 11, 2009, Northern District of Ohio issued a "self-described 'landmark ruling,' holding that 'robo-signing' affidavits in debt-collection actions violates the FDCPA." "The court found the affidavit to be false and misleading under the FDCPA due to the false attestation of personal knowledge. As it turns out, Midland employees had been signing between 200 and 400 computer-generated affidavits per day for use in debt-collection actions, without personal knowledge of the accounts."[13]
The 2013 case Vassalle v. Midland Funding LLC, 11-3814, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit (Cincinnati) was held to determine if Encore Capital Group used illegal collection tactics to collect funds from 1.44 million consumers.[13][14] The suit alleged that Encore's Midland Funding unit's used affidavits approved by staff without personal knowledge of their validity, a process commonly known as "Robo-Signing."[15] A negotiated settlement of $5.2 million was objected to by the FTC,[16] American Association of Retired Persons (AARP), the National Consumer Law Center and 38 U.S. state attorneys general. In February 2013 the settlement was overturned by the 6th circuit court of appeals, who described the final payout of $17.38 per litigant as "perfunctory at best." The court also objected to the negotiated one year injunction on the grounds that the firm's subsidiaries would then be "free to resume its predatory practices."[17] The ruling reversed the decision of Judge David A. Katz of Toledo and returned the case to him for further proceedings.[18]
On 4/16/14 the Attorneys General of 32 states objected to the revised proposed class settlement, stating that it was "a thinly veiled attempt to revive the original settlement" and that it "provides no meaningful value to unnamed class members, and, in fact, it leaves them in a significantly worse position."[13]

According to the New York Times, in 2015 a subsidiary of Midland Funding — which was not licensed to collect debt in Maryland — a subunit of the Encore Capital Group, sued hundreds of Baltimore residents.[20] "Some of them said they did not even owe any money, or their debt had long expired and was not legally collectible, according to a review of court records."[20]

Their business model is highly lucrative as debt-collectors "buy huge swaths of soured bills from lenders for pennies on the dollar."[7] From 2007 to 2012 in New York State alone, Encore Capital and its subsidiaries filed more than 239,000 lawsuits and in 2013 alone collected $564.7 million in legal collections.[7]

History[edit]
Encore Capital Group’s wholly owned operating subsidiary, Midland Credit Management, Inc., was founded in 1953 and was incorporated in Kansas in September 1953. In 1998, an investor group led by Nelson Peltz and Peter May (members of Triarc Companies, Inc. management) and Kerry Packer of Consolidated Press International Holdings Limited, acquired a majority interest in its operations. In 1999, the group formed a holding company, MCM Capital Group, Inc., later renamed Encore Capital Group, Inc. in April 2002. The company was incorporated in Delaware in April 1999 as MCM Capital Group, Inc. and changed its name to Encore Capital Group, Inc. in April 2002. The company completed its initial public offering of 2,250,000 shares of common stock in July 1999.[8] In June, 2013, Encore acquired Asset Acceptance Corporation ( NASDAQ: AACC), another large publicly held debt buyer based in Warren, Michigan. This increased the size of Encore Capital.[9] In 2013, Encore began a series of acquisitions of international debt buying companies. These include Cabot Credit Management in the UK and Ireland, Refinancia S.A. in Colombia and Peru, Mexico with other Latin America locations, and Baycorp Holdings in Australia.
Regulatory Action[edit]
In September 2015, both Encore and Portfolio Recovery Associates, the United States two largest publicly held debt buyers were charged with violating the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act by filing "lawsuits against consumers without having the intent to prove many of the debts, winning the vast majority of the lawsuits by default when consumers failed to defend themselves."[4] U.S. federal regulators - Consumer Financial Protection Bureau imposed an enforcement action on Encore for pressuring borrowers "to pay with false statements, with lawsuits and with the use of using so-called robo-signed court documents."[10] According to the New York Times Encore must pay "$42 million in consumer refunds and a $10 million penalty" and an injunction to "stop collections on debts totaling more than $125 million."[10] In New York State Encore and other debt buyers were filing lawsuits against customers to collect debts in hundreds of court cases which included "generic testimony" or relied on robo-signed bogus affidavits compared to the robo-signing controversy in the 2010 United States foreclosure crisis. At the same time "preventing those same consumers from using the courts to challenge the companies’ tactics."[7] In response to the enforcement action imposed on Encore Capital Group by the CEO Kenneth A. Vecchione claimed that its debt collection practices were not improper and that the C.F.P.B. was "subjecting companies to its own interpretations that have never been codified or adopted."[10]
Business[edit]
According to their 2012 SEC filing, Encore "purchases portfolios of defaulted consumer receivables at deep discounts to face value and uses a variety of channels to maximize collections from these portfolios. In addition, the firm provides bankruptcy support services to some companies in the financial services industry; through their wholly owned subsidiary, Ascension Capital Group, Inc. ("Ascension")."[11]
In 2009 Encore Capital filed 448,000 lawsuits.[3]:235[12]:39
Locations[edit]
Encore Capital Group is based in San Diego, California, with additional sites in Arizona, Minnesota, Texas, Michigan, India, and Costa Rica In addition, the international subsidiaries operate in their own countries. It employs about 3,400 people (as of December, 2015 across these locations, and also has a large third-party network of collection agents and litigators in the United States.
Leadership team[edit]
Ashish Masih is Encore Capital Group's President and Chief Executive Officer.
Financials[edit]
In 2010, the firm paid $362 million, to purchase $10.9 billion in face value of debt. In 2011, it paid $386.9 million to purchase $11.7 billion in face value of debt,[1] Of this $386.9 million, $346.3 million was credit card portfolios, $1.6 million consumer bankruptcy accounts, and $38.9 million telecom accounts.
The Company's revenue increased 22.5% in 2011 to $467.4 million.[1] Gross collections increased to $761.2 million in 2011, a 26% increase from 2010. Collection sites accounted for $336.0 million, while legal collections accounted for $377.5 million. External collection agency forwarding accounted for $47.7 million in gross collections.
Encore's 2015 SEC filings report revenues of $1.2 billion dollars for calendar year ending in December 31, 2015, and $1.1 billion for 2014.
Litigation Practices[edit]
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, an official site of the United States government, reported on September 2, 2015 that the nation's two largest debt buyers, Encore and Portfolio Recovery Associates, violated the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act by filing "lawsuits against consumers without having the intent to prove many of the debts, winning the vast majority of the lawsuits by default when consumers failed to defend themselves."[4]
Already by 2010 the Wall Street Journal was investigating litigation practices as a business plan for large, publicly traded debt buyers like Encore.[2] Journalist Jessica Silver-Greenberg reported that the modern debt-buying industry was created in response to the savings-and-loan crisis.[2]

"Lawmakers established the Resolution Trust Corp. to shutter failed thrifts and auction other assets to buyers. By the mid-1990s, the RTC sold more than $450 billion in these assets. Over time, some buyers of such assets shifted to a new source of profit: charged-off credit-card debt and other consumer debt.
— Wall Street Journal 2010

In 2009 alone Encore Capital filed 448,000 lawsuits[3]:235[12]:39— the most filed by any company in the United States that year.[2]

"Encore posted $33 million in profit last year, up 139% from 2008. While the Standard and Poor's 500-stock index rose 23.5% in 2009, Encore's stock soared 142%. Between 2007 and 2008, the company scooped up $20 billion in charged-off loans for $695.9 million. In order to wring more cash from debt, Encore increasingly has turned to the courts. Lawsuits are filed by a network of outside law firms. Last year, Encore paid $112.6 million for legal collection, which brought in $233 million. Once Encore sues, it is virtually assured a win, says Mr. Black, the company's CEO. Roughly 94% of collection cases filed against borrowers result in default judgments in favor of the debt buyer, according to industry estimates. The majority of borrowers don't have a lawyer, some don't know they are even being sued, and others don't appear in court, say judges."
— Wall Street Journal 2010

January 2015[edit]
New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman sued Encore (Midland’s parent company) over shoddy practices and forced Encore to pay a $675,000 penalty and vacate more than 4,500 court judgments against borrowers.[7] Mr. Schneiderman added,

"New York has laws in place to ensure no one can prey on consumers, and debt collectors are required to follow those rules...[T]oday’s settlement ensures that thousands of New Yorkers will see millions in relief from debts that were not enforceable in the first place."
— New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman January 2015

Robo signing lawsuits[edit]
According to a New York Times article, In September 2015, U.S. federal regulators - Consumer Financial Protection Bureau - ordered the two big debt-collecting agencies, Encore Capital Group and Portfolio Recovery Associates, to "pay a combined $79 million in refunds and penalties, to stop collections on debts totaling $128 million and to change their debt collection practices."[10] Robo-signing refers to the use of false and misleading affidavits signed by debt-collecting agency staff claiming personal knowledge of an alleged debt that are then used in court. On August 11, 2009 the Northern District of Ohio court issued a landmark ruling that robo-signing affidavits in debt-collection violates the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA). In the 2009 case the debt-collector employees had "been signing between 200 and 400 computer-generated affidavits per day for use in debt-collection actions, without personal knowledge of the accounts."[13]

"The bureau said the companies bought the rights to collect debts that were potentially inaccurate, lacked documentation or were legally unenforceable, and tried to collect the money without verifying the debt. The bureau said the companies pressured borrowers to pay with false statements, with lawsuits and with the use of so-called robo-signed court documents."
— New York Times, September 9, 2015

Context[edit]
Illegal robo-signing tactics used by debt-collectors were first uncovered through a 2008 affidavit signed by Midland Credit Management debt-collection agency employee "claimed personal knowledge that Andrea Brent owed a debt of over $4,000 to Midland Funding." This affidavit was used to file a debt-collection against Brent. Brent brought a class-action counterclaim against Midland "alleging violations of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA) and state common law because the attached affidavit was signed "without personal knowledge of the facts asserted."[13] By June 2008 the case was removed to the Northern District of Ohio. On August 11, 2009, Northern District of Ohio issued a "self-described 'landmark ruling,' holding that 'robo-signing' affidavits in debt-collection actions violates the FDCPA." "The court found the affidavit to be false and misleading under the FDCPA due to the false attestation of personal knowledge. As it turns out, Midland employees had been signing between 200 and 400 computer-generated affidavits per day for use in debt-collection actions, without personal knowledge of the accounts."[13]
The 2013 case Vassalle v. Midland Funding LLC, 11-3814, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit (Cincinnati) was held to determine if Encore Capital Group used illegal collection tactics to collect funds from 1.44 million consumers.[13][14] The suit alleged that Encore's Midland Funding unit's used affidavits approved by staff without personal knowledge of their validity, a process commonly known as "Robo-Signing."[15] A negotiated settlement of $5.2 million was objected to by the FTC,[16] American Association of Retired Persons (AARP), the National Consumer Law Center and 38 U.S. state attorneys general. In February 2013 the settlement was overturned by the 6th circuit court of appeals, who described the final payout of $17.38 per litigant as "perfunctory at best." The court also objected to the negotiated one year injunction on the grounds that the firm's subsidiaries would then be "free to resume its predatory practices."[17] The ruling reversed the decision of Judge David A. Katz of Toledo and returned the case to him for further proceedings.[18]
On 4/16/14 the Attorneys General of 32 states objected to the revised proposed class settlement, stating that it was "a thinly veiled attempt to revive the original settlement" and that it "provides no meaningful value to unnamed class members, and, in fact, it leaves them in a significantly worse position."[13]

History[edit]
Encore Capital Group’s wholly owned operating subsidiary, Midland Credit Management, Inc., was founded in 1953 and was incorporated in Kansas in September 1953. In 1998, an investor group led by Nelson Peltz and Peter May (members of Triarc Companies, Inc. management) and Kerry Packer of Consolidated Press International Holdings Limited, acquired a majority interest in its operations.

Litigation Practices[edit]
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, an official site of the United States government, reported on September 2, 2015 that the nation's two largest debt buyers, Encore and Portfolio Recovery Associates, violated the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act by filing "lawsuits against consumers without having the intent to prove many of the debts, winning the vast majority of the lawsuits by default when consumers failed to defend themselves."[4]

In 2009 alone Encore Capital filed 448,000 lawsuits[3]:235[12]:39— the most filed by any company in the United States that year.[2]

"Encore posted $33 million in profit last year, up 139% from 2008. While the Standard and Poor's 500-stock index rose 23.5% in 2009, Encore's stock soared 142%. Between 2007 and 2008, the company scooped up $20 billion in charged-off loans for $695.9 million. In order to wring more cash from debt, Encore increasingly has turned to the courts. Lawsuits are filed by a network of outside law firms. Last year, Encore paid $112.6 million for legal collection, which brought in $233 million. Once Encore sues, it is virtually assured a win, says Mr. Black, the company's CEO. Roughly 94% of collection cases filed against borrowers result in default judgments in favor of the debt buyer, according to industry estimates. The majority of borrowers don't have a lawyer, some don't know they are even being sued, and others don't appear in court, say judges."

Robo signing lawsuits[edit]
According to a New York Times article, In September 2015, U.S. federal regulators - Consumer Financial Protection Bureau - ordered the two big debt-collecting agencies, Encore Capital Group and Portfolio Recovery Associates, to "pay a combined $79 million in refunds and penalties, to stop collections on debts totaling $128 million and to change their debt collection practices."[10] Robo-signing refers to the use of false and misleading affidavits signed by debt-collecting agency staff claiming personal knowledge of an alleged debt that are then used in court. On August 11, 2009 the Northern District of Ohio court issued a landmark ruling that robo-signing affidavits in debt-collection violates the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA). In the 2009 case the debt-collector employees had "been signing between 200 and 400 computer-generated affidavits per day for use in debt-collection actions, without personal knowledge of the accounts."[13]

"The bureau said the companies bought the rights to collect debts that were potentially inaccurate, lacked documentation or were legally unenforceable, and tried to collect the money without verifying the debt. The bureau said the companies pressured borrowers to pay with false statements, with lawsuits and with the use of so-called robo-signed court documents."

Illegal robo-signing tactics used by debt-collectors were first uncovered through a 2008 affidavit signed by Midland Credit Management debt-collection agency employee "claimed personal knowledge that Andrea Brent owed a debt of over $4,000 to Midland Funding." This affidavit was used to file a debt-collection against Brent. Brent brought a class-action counterclaim against Midland "alleging violations of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA) and state common law because the attached affidavit was signed "without personal knowledge of the facts asserted."[13] By June 2008 the case was removed to the Northern District of Ohio.

As it turns out, Midland employees had been signing between 200 and 400 computer-generated affidavits per day for use in debt-collection actions, without personal knowledge of the accounts."[13]
The 2013 case Vassalle v. Midland Funding LLC, 11-3814, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit (Cincinnati) was held to determine if Encore Capital Group used illegal collection tactics to collect funds from 1.44 million consumers.[13][14] The suit alleged that Encore's Midland Funding unit's used affidavits approved by staff without personal knowledge of their validity, a process commonly known as "Robo-Signing."[15] A negotiated settlement of $5.2 million was objected to by the FTC,[16] American Association of Retired Persons (AARP), the National Consumer Law Center and 38 U.S. state attorneys general. In February 2013 the settlement was overturned by the 6th circuit court of appeals, who described the final payout of $17.38 per litigant as "perfunctory at best." The court also objected to the negotiated one year injunction on the grounds that the firm's subsidiaries would then be "free to resume its predatory practices."[17] The ruling reversed the decision of Judge David A. Katz of Toledo and returned the case to him for further proceedings.[18]
On 4/16/14 the Attorneys General of 32 states objected to the revised proposed class settlement, stating that it was "a thinly veiled attempt to revive the original settlement" and that it "provides no meaningful value to unnamed class members, and, in fact, it leaves them in a significantly worse position."[13]

Encore Capital Group, Inc., and subsidiaries form the largest publicly traded debt buyer by revenue in the United States.[2][3]:235[4] They purchase "portfolios of defaulted consumer receivables from major banks, credit unions, and utility providers,"[5] and recover collectable debt from these accounts. Jake Halpern author of Bad Paper, described Encore Capital as a "behemoth" in the American debt-industry complex.[6] At the corporate level debt collection is highly profitable and Encore Capital enjoyed soaring revenues from $316 million in 2009 to $773 million in 2013.[6] The firm is a publicly traded NASDAQ Global Select company, a component stock of the Russell 2000, the S&P SmallCap 600, and the Wilshire 4500.
Their business model is highly lucrative as debt-collectors "buy huge swaths of soured bills from lenders for pennies on the dollar."[7] From 2007 to 2012 in New York State alone, Encore Capital and its subsidiaries filed more than 239,000 lawsuits and in 2013 alone collected $564.7 million in legal collections.[7]

History[edit]
Encore Capital Group’s wholly owned operating subsidiary, Midland Credit Management, Inc., was founded in 1953 and was incorporated in Kansas in September 1953. In 1998, an investor group led by Nelson Peltz and Peter May (members of Triarc Companies, Inc. management) and Kerry Packer of Consolidated Press International Holdings Limited, acquired a majority interest in its operations. In 1999, the group formed a holding company, MCM Capital Group, Inc., later renamed Encore Capital Group, Inc. in April 2002. The company was incorporated in Delaware in April 1999 as MCM Capital Group, Inc. and changed its name to Encore Capital Group, Inc. in April 2002. The company completed its initial public offering of 2,250,000 shares of common stock in July 1999.[8] In June, 2013, Encore acquired Asset Acceptance Corporation ( NASDAQ: AACC), another large publicly held debt buyer based in Warren, Michigan. This increased the size of Encore Capital.[9] In 2013, Encore began a series of acquisitions of international debt buying companies. These include Cabot Credit Management in the UK and Ireland, Refinancia S.A. in Colombia and Peru, Mexico with other Latin America locations, and Baycorp Holdings in Australia.
Regulatory Action[edit]
In September 2015, both Encore and Portfolio Recovery Associates, the United States two largest publicly held debt buyers were charged with violating the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act by filing "lawsuits against consumers without having the intent to prove many of the debts, winning the vast majority of the lawsuits by default when consumers failed to defend themselves."[4] U.S. federal regulators - Consumer Financial Protection Bureau imposed an enforcement action on Encore for pressuring borrowers "to pay with false statements, with lawsuits and with the use of using so-called robo-signed court documents."[10] According to the New York Times Encore must pay "$42 million in consumer refunds and a $10 million penalty" and an injunction to "stop collections on debts totaling more than $125 million."[10] In New York State Encore and other debt buyers were filing lawsuits against customers to collect debts in hundreds of court cases which included "generic testimony" or relied on robo-signed bogus affidavits compared to the robo-signing controversy in the 2010 United States foreclosure crisis. At the same time "preventing those same consumers from using the courts to challenge the companies’ tactics."[7] In response to the enforcement action imposed on Encore Capital Group by the CEO Kenneth A. Vecchione claimed that its debt collection practices were not improper and that the C.F.P.B. was "subjecting companies to its own interpretations that have never been codified or adopted."[10]
Business[edit]
According to their 2012 SEC filing, Encore "purchases portfolios of defaulted consumer receivables at deep discounts to face value and uses a variety of channels to maximize collections from these portfolios. In addition, the firm provides bankruptcy support services to some companies in the financial services industry; through their wholly owned subsidiary, Ascension Capital Group, Inc. ("Ascension")."[11]
In 2009 Encore Capital filed 448,000 lawsuits.[3]:235[12]:39
Locations[edit]
Encore Capital Group is based in San Diego, California, with additional sites in Arizona, Minnesota, Texas, Michigan, India, and Costa Rica In addition, the international subsidiaries operate in their own countries. It employs about 3,400 people (as of December, 2015 across these locations, and also has a large third-party network of collection agents and litigators in the United States.
Leadership team[edit]
Ashish Masih is Encore Capital Group's President and Chief Executive Officer.
Financials[edit]
In 2010, the firm paid $362 million, to purchase $10.9 billion in face value of debt. In 2011, it paid $386.9 million to purchase $11.7 billion in face value of debt,[1] Of this $386.9 million, $346.3 million was credit card portfolios, $1.6 million consumer bankruptcy accounts, and $38.9 million telecom accounts.
The Company's revenue increased 22.5% in 2011 to $467.4 million.[1] Gross collections increased to $761.2 million in 2011, a 26% increase from 2010. Collection sites accounted for $336.0 million, while legal collections accounted for $377.5 million. External collection agency forwarding accounted for $47.7 million in gross collections.
Encore's 2015 SEC filings report revenues of $1.2 billion dollars for calendar year ending in December 31, 2015, and $1.1 billion for 2014.
Litigation Practices[edit]
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, an official site of the United States government, reported on September 2, 2015 that the nation's two largest debt buyers, Encore and Portfolio Recovery Associates, violated the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act by filing "lawsuits against consumers without having the intent to prove many of the debts, winning the vast majority of the lawsuits by default when consumers failed to defend themselves."[4]
Already by 2010 the Wall Street Journal was investigating litigation practices as a business plan for large, publicly traded debt buyers like Encore.[2] Journalist Jessica Silver-Greenberg reported that the modern debt-buying industry was created in response to the savings-and-loan crisis.[2]

"Lawmakers established the Resolution Trust Corp. to shutter failed thrifts and auction other assets to buyers. By the mid-1990s, the RTC sold more than $450 billion in these assets. Over time, some buyers of such assets shifted to a new source of profit: charged-off credit-card debt and other consumer debt.
— Wall Street Journal 2010

In 2009 alone Encore Capital filed 448,000 lawsuits[3]:235[12]:39— the most filed by any company in the United States that year.[2]

"Encore posted $33 million in profit last year, up 139% from 2008. While the Standard and Poor's 500-stock index rose 23.5% in 2009, Encore's stock soared 142%. Between 2007 and 2008, the company scooped up $20 billion in charged-off loans for $695.9 million. In order to wring more cash from debt, Encore increasingly has turned to the courts. Lawsuits are filed by a network of outside law firms. Last year, Encore paid $112.6 million for legal collection, which brought in $233 million. Once Encore sues, it is virtually assured a win, says Mr. Black, the company's CEO. Roughly 94% of collection cases filed against borrowers result in default judgments in favor of the debt buyer, according to industry estimates. The majority of borrowers don't have a lawyer, some don't know they are even being sued, and others don't appear in court, say judges."
— Wall Street Journal 2010

January 2015[edit]
New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman sued Encore (Midland’s parent company) over shoddy practices and forced Encore to pay a $675,000 penalty and vacate more than 4,500 court judgments against borrowers.[7] Mr. Schneiderman added,

"New York has laws in place to ensure no one can prey on consumers, and debt collectors are required to follow those rules...[T]oday’s settlement ensures that thousands of New Yorkers will see millions in relief from debts that were not enforceable in the first place."
— New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman January 2015

Robo signing lawsuits[edit]
According to a New York Times article, In September 2015, U.S. federal regulators - Consumer Financial Protection Bureau - ordered the two big debt-collecting agencies, Encore Capital Group and Portfolio Recovery Associates, to "pay a combined $79 million in refunds and penalties, to stop collections on debts totaling $128 million and to change their debt collection practices."[10] Robo-signing refers to the use of false and misleading affidavits signed by debt-collecting agency staff claiming personal knowledge of an alleged debt that are then used in court. On August 11, 2009 the Northern District of Ohio court issued a landmark ruling that robo-signing affidavits in debt-collection violates the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA). In the 2009 case the debt-collector employees had "been signing between 200 and 400 computer-generated affidavits per day for use in debt-collection actions, without personal knowledge of the accounts."[13]

"The bureau said the companies bought the rights to collect debts that were potentially inaccurate, lacked documentation or were legally unenforceable, and tried to collect the money without verifying the debt. The bureau said the companies pressured borrowers to pay with false statements, with lawsuits and with the use of so-called robo-signed court documents."
— New York Times, September 9, 2015

Context[edit]
Illegal robo-signing tactics used by debt-collectors were first uncovered through a 2008 affidavit signed by Midland Credit Management debt-collection agency employee "claimed personal knowledge that Andrea Brent owed a debt of over $4,000 to Midland Funding." This affidavit was used to file a debt-collection against Brent. Brent brought a class-action counterclaim against Midland "alleging violations of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA) and state common law because the attached affidavit was signed "without personal knowledge of the facts asserted."[13] By June 2008 the case was removed to the Northern District of Ohio. On August 11, 2009, Northern District of Ohio issued a "self-described 'landmark ruling,' holding that 'robo-signing' affidavits in debt-collection actions violates the FDCPA." "The court found the affidavit to be false and misleading under the FDCPA due to the false attestation of personal knowledge. As it turns out, Midland employees had been signing between 200 and 400 computer-generated affidavits per day for use in debt-collection actions, without personal knowledge of the accounts."[13]
The 2013 case Vassalle v. Midland Funding LLC, 11-3814, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit (Cincinnati) was held to determine if Encore Capital Group used illegal collection tactics to collect funds from 1.44 million consumers.[13][14] The suit alleged that Encore's Midland Funding unit's used affidavits approved by staff without personal knowledge of their validity, a process commonly known as "Robo-Signing."[15] A negotiated settlement of $5.2 million was objected to by the FTC,[16] American Association of Retired Persons (AARP), the National Consumer Law Center and 38 U.S. state attorneys general. In February 2013 the settlement was overturned by the 6th circuit court of appeals, who described the final payout of $17.38 per litigant as "perfunctory at best." The court also objected to the negotiated one year injunction on the grounds that the firm's subsidiaries would then be "free to resume its predatory practices."[17] The ruling reversed the decision of Judge David A. Katz of Toledo and returned the case to him for further proceedings.[18]
On 4/16/14 the Attorneys General of 32 states objected to the revised proposed class settlement, stating that it was "a thinly veiled attempt to revive the original settlement" and that it "provides no meaningful value to unnamed class members, and, in fact, it leaves them in a significantly worse position."[13]

History[edit]
Encore Capital Group’s wholly owned operating subsidiary, Midland Credit Management, Inc., was founded in 1953 and was incorporated in Kansas in September 1953. In 1998, an investor group led by Nelson Peltz and Peter May (members of Triarc Companies, Inc. management) and Kerry Packer of Consolidated Press International Holdings Limited, acquired a majority interest in its operations. In 1999, the group formed a holding company, MCM Capital Group, Inc., later renamed Encore Capital Group, Inc. in April 2002. The company was incorporated in Delaware in April 1999 as MCM Capital Group, Inc. and changed its name to Encore Capital Group, Inc. in April 2002. The company completed its initial public offering of 2,250,000 shares of common stock in July 1999.[8] In June, 2013, Encore acquired Asset Acceptance Corporation ( NASDAQ: AACC), another large publicly held debt buyer based in Warren, Michigan. This increased the size of Encore Capital.[9] In 2013, Encore began a series of acquisitions of international debt buying companies. These include Cabot Credit Management in the UK and Ireland, Refinancia S.A. in Colombia and Peru, Mexico with other Latin America locations, and Baycorp Holdings in Australia.
Regulatory Action[edit]
In September 2015, both Encore and Portfolio Recovery Associates, the United States two largest publicly held debt buyers were charged with violating the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act by filing "lawsuits against consumers without having the intent to prove many of the debts, winning the vast majority of the lawsuits by default when consumers failed to defend themselves."[4] U.S. federal regulators - Consumer Financial Protection Bureau imposed an enforcement action on Encore for pressuring borrowers "to pay with false statements, with lawsuits and with the use of using so-called robo-signed court documents."[10] According to the New York Times Encore must pay "$42 million in consumer refunds and a $10 million penalty" and an injunction to "stop collections on debts totaling more than $125 million."[10] In New York State Encore and other debt buyers were filing lawsuits against customers to collect debts in hundreds of court cases which included "generic testimony" or relied on robo-signed bogus affidavits compared to the robo-signing controversy in the 2010 United States foreclosure crisis. At the same time "preventing those same consumers from using the courts to challenge the companies’ tactics."[7] In response to the enforcement action imposed on Encore Capital Group by the CEO Kenneth A. Vecchione claimed that its debt collection practices were not improper and that the C.F.P.B. was "subjecting companies to its own interpretations that have never been codified or adopted."[10]
Business[edit]
According to their 2012 SEC filing, Encore "purchases portfolios of defaulted consumer receivables at deep discounts to face value and uses a variety of channels to maximize collections from these portfolios. In addition, the firm provides bankruptcy support services to some companies in the financial services industry; through their wholly owned subsidiary, Ascension Capital Group, Inc. ("Ascension")."[11]
In 2009 Encore Capital filed 448,000 lawsuits.[3]:235[12]:39

Leadership team[edit]
Ashish Masih is Encore Capital Group's President and Chief Executive Officer.
Financials[edit]
In 2010, the firm paid $362 million, to purchase $10.9 billion in face value of debt. In 2011, it paid $386.9 million to purchase $11.7 billion in face value of debt,[1] Of this $386.9 million, $346.3 million was credit card portfolios, $1.6 million consumer bankruptcy accounts, and $38.9 million telecom accounts.
The Company's revenue increased 22.5% in 2011 to $467.4 million.[1] Gross collections increased to $761.2 million in 2011, a 26% increase from 2010. Collection sites accounted for $336.0 million, while legal collections accounted for $377.5 million. External collection agency forwarding accounted for $47.7 million in gross collections.
Encore's 2015 SEC filings report revenues of $1.2 billion dollars for calendar year ending in December 31, 2015, and $1.1 billion for 2014.
Litigation Practices[edit]
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, an official site of the United States government, reported on September 2, 2015 that the nation's two largest debt buyers, Encore and Portfolio Recovery Associates, violated the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act by filing "lawsuits against consumers without having the intent to prove many of the debts, winning the vast majority of the lawsuits by default when consumers failed to defend themselves."[4]
Already by 2010 the Wall Street Journal was investigating litigation practices as a business plan for large, publicly traded debt buyers like Encore.[2] Journalist Jessica Silver-Greenberg reported that the modern debt-buying industry was created in response to the savings-and-loan crisis.[2]

"Lawmakers established the Resolution Trust Corp. to shutter failed thrifts and auction other assets to buyers. By the mid-1990s, the RTC sold more than $450 billion in these assets. Over time, some buyers of such assets shifted to a new source of profit: charged-off credit-card debt and other consumer debt.
— Wall Street Journal 2010

In 2009 alone Encore Capital filed 448,000 lawsuits[3]:235[12]:39— the most filed by any company in the United States that year.[2]

"Encore posted $33 million in profit last year, up 139% from 2008. While the Standard and Poor's 500-stock index rose 23.5% in 2009, Encore's stock soared 142%. Between 2007 and 2008, the company scooped up $20 billion in charged-off loans for $695.9 million. In order to wring more cash from debt, Encore increasingly has turned to the courts. Lawsuits are filed by a network of outside law firms. Last year, Encore paid $112.6 million for legal collection, which brought in $233 million. Once Encore sues, it is virtually assured a win, says Mr. Black, the company's CEO. Roughly 94% of collection cases filed against borrowers result in default judgments in favor of the debt buyer, according to industry estimates. The majority of borrowers don't have a lawyer, some don't know they are even being sued, and others don't appear in court, say judges."
— Wall Street Journal 2010

January 2015[edit]
New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman sued Encore (Midland’s parent company) over shoddy practices and forced Encore to pay a $675,000 penalty and vacate more than 4,500 court judgments against borrowers.[7] Mr. Schneiderman added,

"New York has laws in place to ensure no one can prey on consumers, and debt collectors are required to follow those rules...[T]oday’s settlement ensures that thousands of New Yorkers will see millions in relief from debts that were not enforceable in the first place."
— New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman January 2015

Robo signing lawsuits[edit]
According to a New York Times article, In September 2015, U.S. federal regulators - Consumer Financial Protection Bureau - ordered the two big debt-collecting agencies, Encore Capital Group and Portfolio Recovery Associates, to "pay a combined $79 million in refunds and penalties, to stop collections on debts totaling $128 million and to change their debt collection practices."[10] Robo-signing refers to the use of false and misleading affidavits signed by debt-collecting agency staff claiming personal knowledge of an alleged debt that are then used in court. On August 11, 2009 the Northern District of Ohio court issued a landmark ruling that robo-signing affidavits in debt-collection violates the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA). In the 2009 case the debt-collector employees had "been signing between 200 and 400 computer-generated affidavits per day for use in debt-collection actions, without personal knowledge of the accounts."[13]

"The bureau said the companies bought the rights to collect debts that were potentially inaccurate, lacked documentation or were legally unenforceable, and tried to collect the money without verifying the debt. The bureau said the companies pressured borrowers to pay with false statements, with lawsuits and with the use of so-called robo-signed court documents."
— New York Times, September 9, 2015

Context[edit]
Illegal robo-signing tactics used by debt-collectors were first uncovered through a 2008 affidavit signed by Midland Credit Management debt-collection agency employee "claimed personal knowledge that Andrea Brent owed a debt of over $4,000 to Midland Funding." This affidavit was used to file a debt-collection against Brent. Brent brought a class-action counterclaim against Midland "alleging violations of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA) and state common law because the attached affidavit was signed "without personal knowledge of the facts asserted."[13] By June 2008 the case was removed to the Northern District of Ohio. On August 11, 2009, Northern District of Ohio issued a "self-described 'landmark ruling,' holding that 'robo-signing' affidavits in debt-collection actions violates the FDCPA." "The court found the affidavit to be false and misleading under the FDCPA due to the false attestation of personal knowledge. As it turns out, Midland employees had been signing between 200 and 400 computer-generated affidavits per day for use in debt-collection actions, without personal knowledge of the accounts."[13]
The 2013 case Vassalle v. Midland Funding LLC, 11-3814, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit (Cincinnati) was held to determine if Encore Capital Group used illegal collection tactics to collect funds from 1.44 million consumers.[13][14] The suit alleged that Encore's Midland Funding unit's used affidavits approved by staff without personal knowledge of their validity, a process commonly known as "Robo-Signing."[15] A negotiated settlement of $5.2 million was objected to by the FTC,[16] American Association of Retired Persons (AARP), the National Consumer Law Center and 38 U.S. state attorneys general. In February 2013 the settlement was overturned by the 6th circuit court of appeals, who described the final payout of $17.38 per litigant as "perfunctory at best." The court also objected to the negotiated one year injunction on the grounds that the firm's subsidiaries would then be "free to resume its predatory practices."[17] The ruling reversed the decision of Judge David A. Katz of Toledo and returned the case to him for further proceedings.[18]
On 4/16/14 the Attorneys General of 32 states objected to the revised proposed class settlement, stating that it was "a thinly veiled attempt to revive the original settlement" and that it "provides no meaningful value to unnamed class members, and, in fact, it leaves them in a significantly worse position."[13]

Encore Capital Group, Inc., and subsidiaries form the largest publicly traded debt buyer by revenue in the United States.[2][3]:235[4] They purchase "portfolios of defaulted consumer receivables from major banks, credit unions, and utility providers,"[5] and recover collectable debt from these accounts. Jake Halpern author of Bad Paper, described Encore Capital as a "behemoth" in the American debt-industry complex.[6] At the corporate level debt collection is highly profitable and Encore Capital enjoyed soaring revenues from $316 million in 2009 to $773 million in 2013.[6] The firm is a publicly traded NASDAQ Global Select company, a component stock of the Russell 2000, the S&P SmallCap 600, and the Wilshire 4500.
Their business model is highly lucrative as debt-collectors "buy huge swaths of soured bills from lenders for pennies on the dollar."[7] From 2007 to 2012 in New York State alone, Encore Capital and its subsidiaries filed more than 239,000 lawsuits and in 2013 alone collected $564.7 million in legal collections.[7]

History[edit]
Encore Capital Group’s wholly owned operating subsidiary, Midland Credit Management, Inc., was founded in 1953 and was incorporated in Kansas in September 1953. In 1998, an investor group led by Nelson Peltz and Peter May (members of Triarc Companies, Inc. management) and Kerry Packer of Consolidated Press International Holdings Limited, acquired a majority interest in its operations. In 1999, the group formed a holding company, MCM Capital Group, Inc., later renamed Encore Capital Group, Inc. in April 2002. The company was incorporated in Delaware in April 1999 as MCM Capital Group, Inc. and changed its name to Encore Capital Group, Inc. in April 2002. The company completed its initial public offering of 2,250,000 shares of common stock in July 1999.[8] In June, 2013, Encore acquired Asset Acceptance Corporation ( NASDAQ: AACC), another large publicly held debt buyer based in Warren, Michigan. This increased the size of Encore Capital.[9] In 2013, Encore began a series of acquisitions of international debt buying companies. These include Cabot Credit Management in the UK and Ireland, Refinancia S.A. in Colombia and Peru, Mexico with other Latin America locations, and Baycorp Holdings in Australia.
Regulatory Action[edit]
In September 2015, both Encore and Portfolio Recovery Associates, the United States two largest publicly held debt buyers were charged with violating the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act by filing "lawsuits against consumers without having the intent to prove many of the debts, winning the vast majority of the lawsuits by default when consumers failed to defend themselves."[4] U.S. federal regulators - Consumer Financial Protection Bureau imposed an enforcement action on Encore for pressuring borrowers "to pay with false statements, with lawsuits and with the use of using so-called robo-signed court documents."[10] According to the New York Times Encore must pay "$42 million in consumer refunds and a $10 million penalty" and an injunction to "stop collections on debts totaling more than $125 million."[10] In New York State Encore and other debt buyers were filing lawsuits against customers to collect debts in hundreds of court cases which included "generic testimony" or relied on robo-signed bogus affidavits compared to the robo-signing controversy in the 2010 United States foreclosure crisis. At the same time "preventing those same consumers from using the courts to challenge the companies’ tactics."[7] In response to the enforcement action imposed on Encore Capital Group by the CEO Kenneth A. Vecchione claimed that its debt collection practices were not improper and that the C.F.P.B. was "subjecting companies to its own interpretations that have never been codified or adopted."[10]

In addition, the firm provides bankruptcy support services to some companies in the financial services industry; through their wholly owned subsidiary, Ascension Capital Group, Inc.

In 2010, the firm paid $362 million, to purchase $10.9 billion in face value of debt. In 2011, it paid $386.9 million to purchase $11.7 billion in face value of debt,[1] Of this $386.9 million, $346.3 million was credit card portfolios, $1.6 million consumer bankruptcy accounts, and $38.9 million telecom accounts.

Litigation Practices[edit]
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, an official site of the United States government, reported on September 2, 2015 that the nation's two largest debt buyers, Encore and Portfolio Recovery Associates, violated the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act by filing "lawsuits against consumers without having the intent to prove many of the debts, winning the vast majority of the lawsuits by default when consumers failed to defend themselves."[4]

In 2009 alone Encore Capital filed 448,000 lawsuits[3]:235[12]:39— the most filed by any company in the United States that year.[2]

"Encore posted $33 million in profit last year, up 139% from 2008. While the Standard and Poor's 500-stock index rose 23.5% in 2009, Encore's stock soared 142%. Between 2007 and 2008, the company scooped up $20 billion in charged-off loans for $695.9 million. In order to wring more cash from debt, Encore increasingly has turned to the courts. Lawsuits are filed by a network of outside law firms. Last year, Encore paid $112.6 million for legal collection, which brought in $233 million. Once Encore sues, it is virtually assured a win, says Mr. Black, the company's CEO. Roughly 94% of collection cases filed against borrowers result in default judgments in favor of the debt buyer, according to industry estimates. The majority of borrowers don't have a lawyer, some don't know they are even being sued, and others don't appear in court, say judges."

Robo signing lawsuits[edit]

On August 11, 2009 the Northern District of Ohio court issued a landmark ruling that robo-signing affidavits in debt-collection violates the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA). In the 2009 case the debt-collector employees had "been signing between 200 and 400 computer-generated affidavits per day for use in debt-collection actions, without personal knowledge of the accounts."[13]

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades. Our calculations are based on comprehensive, delayed quotes.      Stock Money Flow    Uptick/Downtick Trade Ratio  0 2    0.63      Net Money Flow ($)  -62,660    Money flow gives a snapshot of relative buying and selling pressure in a stock.

The most recent short interest data has been released for the 10/31/2016 settlement date, which shows a 881,857 share decrease in total short interest for Encore Capital Group Inc , to 6,775,608, a decrease of 11.52% since 10/14/2016. Total short interest is just one way to look at short data; another metric that we here at Dividend Channel find particularly useful is the "days to cover" metric because it considers both the total shares short and the average daily volume of shares traded.

Encore Capital Group, Inc., and subsidiaries form the largest publicly traded debt buyer by revenue in the United States.[2][3]:235[4] They purchase "portfolios of defaulted consumer receivables from major banks, credit unions, and utility providers,"[5] and recover collectable debt from these accounts. Jake Halpern author of Bad Paper, described Encore Capital as a "behemoth" in the American debt-industry complex.[6] At the corporate level debt collection is highly profitable and Encore Capital enjoyed soaring revenues from $316 million in 2009 to $773 million in 2013.[6] The firm is a publicly traded NASDAQ Global Select company, a component stock of the Russell 2000, the S&P SmallCap 600, and the Wilshire 4500.
Their business model is highly lucrative as debt-collectors "buy huge swaths of soured bills from lenders for pennies on the dollar."[7] From 2007 to 2012 in New York State alone, Encore Capital and its subsidiaries filed more than 239,000 lawsuits and in 2013 alone collected $564.7 million in legal collections.[7]

History[edit]
Encore Capital Group’s wholly owned operating subsidiary, Midland Credit Management, Inc., was founded in 1953 and was incorporated in Kansas in September 1953. In 1998, an investor group led by Nelson Peltz and Peter May (members of Triarc Companies, Inc. management) and Kerry Packer of Consolidated Press International Holdings Limited, acquired a majority interest in its operations. In 1999, the group formed a holding company, MCM Capital Group, Inc., later renamed Encore Capital Group, Inc. in April 2002. The company was incorporated in Delaware in April 1999 as MCM Capital Group, Inc. and changed its name to Encore Capital Group, Inc. in April 2002. The company completed its initial public offering of 2,250,000 shares of common stock in July 1999.[8] In June, 2013, Encore acquired Asset Acceptance Corporation ( NASDAQ: AACC), another large publicly held debt buyer based in Warren, Michigan. This increased the size of Encore Capital.[9] In 2013, Encore began a series of acquisitions of international debt buying companies. These include Cabot Credit Management in the UK and Ireland, Refinancia S.A. in Colombia and Peru, Mexico with other Latin America locations, and Baycorp Holdings in Australia.
Regulatory Action[edit]
In September 2015, both Encore and Portfolio Recovery Associates, the United States two largest publicly held debt buyers were charged with violating the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act by filing "lawsuits against consumers without having the intent to prove many of the debts, winning the vast majority of the lawsuits by default when consumers failed to defend themselves."[4] U.S. federal regulators - Consumer Financial Protection Bureau imposed an enforcement action on Encore for pressuring borrowers "to pay with false statements, with lawsuits and with the use of using so-called robo-signed court documents."[10] According to the New York Times Encore must pay "$42 million in consumer refunds and a $10 million penalty" and an injunction to "stop collections on debts totaling more than $125 million."[10] In New York State Encore and other debt buyers were filing lawsuits against customers to collect debts in hundreds of court cases which included "generic testimony" or relied on robo-signed bogus affidavits compared to the robo-signing controversy in the 2010 United States foreclosure crisis. At the same time "preventing those same consumers from using the courts to challenge the companies’ tactics."[7] In response to the enforcement action imposed on Encore Capital Group by the CEO Kenneth A. Vecchione claimed that its debt collection practices were not improper and that the C.F.P.B. was "subjecting companies to its own interpretations that have never been codified or adopted."[10]
Business[edit]
According to their 2012 SEC filing, Encore "purchases portfolios of defaulted consumer receivables at deep discounts to face value and uses a variety of channels to maximize collections from these portfolios. In addition, the firm provides bankruptcy support services to some companies in the financial services industry; through their wholly owned subsidiary, Ascension Capital Group, Inc. ("Ascension")."[11]

Financials[edit]
In 2010, the firm paid $362 million, to purchase $10.9 billion in face value of debt. In 2011, it paid $386.9 million to purchase $11.7 billion in face value of debt,[1] Of this $386.9 million, $346.3 million was credit card portfolios, $1.6 million consumer bankruptcy accounts, and $38.9 million telecom accounts.
The Company's revenue increased 22.5% in 2011 to $467.4 million.[1] Gross collections increased to $761.2 million in 2011, a 26% increase from 2010. Collection sites accounted for $336.0 million, while legal collections accounted for $377.5 million. External collection agency forwarding accounted for $47.7 million in gross collections.
Encore's 2015 SEC filings report revenues of $1.2 billion dollars for calendar year ending in December 31, 2015, and $1.1 billion for 2014.
Litigation Practices[edit]
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, an official site of the United States government, reported on September 2, 2015 that the nation's two largest debt buyers, Encore and Portfolio Recovery Associates, violated the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act by filing "lawsuits against consumers without having the intent to prove many of the debts, winning the vast majority of the lawsuits by default when consumers failed to defend themselves."[4]
Already by 2010 the Wall Street Journal was investigating litigation practices as a business plan for large, publicly traded debt buyers like Encore.[2] Journalist Jessica Silver-Greenberg reported that the modern debt-buying industry was created in response to the savings-and-loan crisis.[2]

"Lawmakers established the Resolution Trust Corp. to shutter failed thrifts and auction other assets to buyers. By the mid-1990s, the RTC sold more than $450 billion in these assets. Over time, some buyers of such assets shifted to a new source of profit: charged-off credit-card debt and other consumer debt.
— Wall Street Journal 2010

In 2009 alone Encore Capital filed 448,000 lawsuits[3]:235[12]:39— the most filed by any company in the United States that year.[2]

"Encore posted $33 million in profit last year, up 139% from 2008. While the Standard and Poor's 500-stock index rose 23.5% in 2009, Encore's stock soared 142%. Between 2007 and 2008, the company scooped up $20 billion in charged-off loans for $695.9 million. In order to wring more cash from debt, Encore increasingly has turned to the courts. Lawsuits are filed by a network of outside law firms. Last year, Encore paid $112.6 million for legal collection, which brought in $233 million. Once Encore sues, it is virtually assured a win, says Mr. Black, the company's CEO. Roughly 94% of collection cases filed against borrowers result in default judgments in favor of the debt buyer, according to industry estimates. The majority of borrowers don't have a lawyer, some don't know they are even being sued, and others don't appear in court, say judges."
— Wall Street Journal 2010

January 2015[edit]
New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman sued Encore (Midland’s parent company) over shoddy practices and forced Encore to pay a $675,000 penalty and vacate more than 4,500 court judgments against borrowers.[7] Mr. Schneiderman added,

"New York has laws in place to ensure no one can prey on consumers, and debt collectors are required to follow those rules...[T]oday’s settlement ensures that thousands of New Yorkers will see millions in relief from debts that were not enforceable in the first place."
— New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman January 2015

Robo signing lawsuits[edit]
According to a New York Times article, In September 2015, U.S. federal regulators - Consumer Financial Protection Bureau - ordered the two big debt-collecting agencies, Encore Capital Group and Portfolio Recovery Associates, to "pay a combined $79 million in refunds and penalties, to stop collections on debts totaling $128 million and to change their debt collection practices."[10] Robo-signing refers to the use of false and misleading affidavits signed by debt-collecting agency staff claiming personal knowledge of an alleged debt that are then used in court. On August 11, 2009 the Northern District of Ohio court issued a landmark ruling that robo-signing affidavits in debt-collection violates the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA). In the 2009 case the debt-collector employees had "been signing between 200 and 400 computer-generated affidavits per day for use in debt-collection actions, without personal knowledge of the accounts."[13]

"The bureau said the companies bought the rights to collect debts that were potentially inaccurate, lacked documentation or were legally unenforceable, and tried to collect the money without verifying the debt. The bureau said the companies pressured borrowers to pay with false statements, with lawsuits and with the use of so-called robo-signed court documents."
— New York Times, September 9, 2015

Context[edit]
Illegal robo-signing tactics used by debt-collectors were first uncovered through a 2008 affidavit signed by Midland Credit Management debt-collection agency employee "claimed personal knowledge that Andrea Brent owed a debt of over $4,000 to Midland Funding." This affidavit was used to file a debt-collection against Brent. Brent brought a class-action counterclaim against Midland "alleging violations of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA) and state common law because the attached affidavit was signed "without personal knowledge of the facts asserted."[13] By June 2008 the case was removed to the Northern District of Ohio. On August 11, 2009, Northern District of Ohio issued a "self-described 'landmark ruling,' holding that 'robo-signing' affidavits in debt-collection actions violates the FDCPA." "The court found the affidavit to be false and misleading under the FDCPA due to the false attestation of personal knowledge. As it turns out, Midland employees had been signing between 200 and 400 computer-generated affidavits per day for use in debt-collection actions, without personal knowledge of the accounts."[13]
The 2013 case Vassalle v. Midland Funding LLC, 11-3814, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit (Cincinnati) was held to determine if Encore Capital Group used illegal collection tactics to collect funds from 1.44 million consumers.[13][14] The suit alleged that Encore's Midland Funding unit's used affidavits approved by staff without personal knowledge of their validity, a process commonly known as "Robo-Signing."[15] A negotiated settlement of $5.2 million was objected to by the FTC,[16] American Association of Retired Persons (AARP), the National Consumer Law Center and 38 U.S. state attorneys general. In February 2013 the settlement was overturned by the 6th circuit court of appeals, who described the final payout of $17.38 per litigant as "perfunctory at best." The court also objected to the negotiated one year injunction on the grounds that the firm's subsidiaries would then be "free to resume its predatory practices."[17] The ruling reversed the decision of Judge David A. Katz of Toledo and returned the case to him for further proceedings.[18]
On 4/16/14 the Attorneys General of 32 states objected to the revised proposed class settlement, stating that it was "a thinly veiled attempt to revive the original settlement" and that it "provides no meaningful value to unnamed class members, and, in fact, it leaves them in a significantly worse position."[13]

Encore Capital Group, Inc., and subsidiaries form the largest publicly traded debt buyer by revenue in the United States.[2][3]:235[4] They purchase "portfolios of defaulted consumer receivables from major banks, credit unions, and utility providers,"[5] and recover collectable debt from these accounts. Jake Halpern author of Bad Paper, described Encore Capital as a "behemoth" in the American debt-industry complex.[6] At the corporate level debt collection is highly profitable and Encore Capital enjoyed soaring revenues from $316 million in 2009 to $773 million in 2013.[6] The firm is a publicly traded NASDAQ Global Select company, a component stock of the Russell 2000, the S&P SmallCap 600, and the Wilshire 4500.
Their business model is highly lucrative as debt-collectors "buy huge swaths of soured bills from lenders for pennies on the dollar."[7] From 2007 to 2012 in New York State alone, Encore Capital and its subsidiaries filed more than 239,000 lawsuits and in 2013 alone collected $564.7 million in legal collections.[7]

History[edit]
Encore Capital Group’s wholly owned operating subsidiary, Midland Credit Management, Inc., was founded in 1953 and was incorporated in Kansas in September 1953. In 1998, an investor group led by Nelson Peltz and Peter May (members of Triarc Companies, Inc. management) and Kerry Packer of Consolidated Press International Holdings Limited, acquired a majority interest in its operations. In 1999, the group formed a holding company, MCM Capital Group, Inc., later renamed Encore Capital Group, Inc. in April 2002. The company was incorporated in Delaware in April 1999 as MCM Capital Group, Inc. and changed its name to Encore Capital Group, Inc. in April 2002. The company completed its initial public offering of 2,250,000 shares of common stock in July 1999.[8] In June, 2013, Encore acquired Asset Acceptance Corporation ( NASDAQ: AACC), another large publicly held debt buyer based in Warren, Michigan. This increased the size of Encore Capital.[9] In 2013, Encore began a series of acquisitions of international debt buying companies. These include Cabot Credit Management in the UK and Ireland, Refinancia S.A. in Colombia and Peru, Mexico with other Latin America locations, and Baycorp Holdings in Australia.
Regulatory Action[edit]
In September 2015, both Encore and Portfolio Recovery Associates, the United States two largest publicly held debt buyers were charged with violating the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act by filing "lawsuits against consumers without having the intent to prove many of the debts, winning the vast majority of the lawsuits by default when consumers failed to defend themselves."[4] U.S. federal regulators - Consumer Financial Protection Bureau imposed an enforcement action on Encore for pressuring borrowers "to pay with false statements, with lawsuits and with the use of using so-called robo-signed court documents."[10] According to the New York Times Encore must pay "$42 million in consumer refunds and a $10 million penalty" and an injunction to "stop collections on debts totaling more than $125 million."[10] In New York State Encore and other debt buyers were filing lawsuits against customers to collect debts in hundreds of court cases which included "generic testimony" or relied on robo-signed bogus affidavits compared to the robo-signing controversy in the 2010 United States foreclosure crisis. At the same time "preventing those same consumers from using the courts to challenge the companies’ tactics."[7] In response to the enforcement action imposed on Encore Capital Group by the CEO Kenneth A. Vecchione claimed that its debt collection practices were not improper and that the C.F.P.B. was "subjecting companies to its own interpretations that have never been codified or adopted."[10]
Business[edit]
According to their 2012 SEC filing, Encore "purchases portfolios of defaulted consumer receivables at deep discounts to face value and uses a variety of channels to maximize collections from these portfolios. In addition, the firm provides bankruptcy support services to some companies in the financial services industry; through their wholly owned subsidiary, Ascension Capital Group, Inc. ("Ascension")."[11]
In 2009 Encore Capital filed 448,000 lawsuits.[3]:235[12]:39
Locations[edit]
Encore Capital Group is based in San Diego, California, with additional sites in Arizona, Minnesota, Texas, Michigan, India, and Costa Rica In addition, the international subsidiaries operate in their own countries. It employs about 3,400 people (as of December, 2015 across these locations, and also has a large third-party network of collection agents and litigators in the United States.
Leadership team[edit]
Ashish Masih is Encore Capital Group's President and Chief Executive Officer.
Financials[edit]
In 2010, the firm paid $362 million, to purchase $10.9 billion in face value of debt. In 2011, it paid $386.9 million to purchase $11.7 billion in face value of debt,[1] Of this $386.9 million, $346.3 million was credit card portfolios, $1.6 million consumer bankruptcy accounts, and $38.9 million telecom accounts.
The Company's revenue increased 22.5% in 2011 to $467.4 million.[1] Gross collections increased to $761.2 million in 2011, a 26% increase from 2010. Collection sites accounted for $336.0 million, while legal collections accounted for $377.5 million. External collection agency forwarding accounted for $47.7 million in gross collections.
Encore's 2015 SEC filings report revenues of $1.2 billion dollars for calendar year ending in December 31, 2015, and $1.1 billion for 2014.
Litigation Practices[edit]
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, an official site of the United States government, reported on September 2, 2015 that the nation's two largest debt buyers, Encore and Portfolio Recovery Associates, violated the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act by filing "lawsuits against consumers without having the intent to prove many of the debts, winning the vast majority of the lawsuits by default when consumers failed to defend themselves."[4]
Already by 2010 the Wall Street Journal was investigating litigation practices as a business plan for large, publicly traded debt buyers like Encore.[2] Journalist Jessica Silver-Greenberg reported that the modern debt-buying industry was created in response to the savings-and-loan crisis.[2]

"Lawmakers established the Resolution Trust Corp. to shutter failed thrifts and auction other assets to buyers. By the mid-1990s, the RTC sold more than $450 billion in these assets. Over time, some buyers of such assets shifted to a new source of profit: charged-off credit-card debt and other consumer debt.
— Wall Street Journal 2010

In 2009 alone Encore Capital filed 448,000 lawsuits[3]:235[12]:39— the most filed by any company in the United States that year.[2]

"Encore posted $33 million in profit last year, up 139% from 2008. While the Standard and Poor's 500-stock index rose 23.5% in 2009, Encore's stock soared 142%. Between 2007 and 2008, the company scooped up $20 billion in charged-off loans for $695.9 million. In order to wring more cash from debt, Encore increasingly has turned to the courts. Lawsuits are filed by a network of outside law firms. Last year, Encore paid $112.6 million for legal collection, which brought in $233 million. Once Encore sues, it is virtually assured a win, says Mr. Black, the company's CEO. Roughly 94% of collection cases filed against borrowers result in default judgments in favor of the debt buyer, according to industry estimates. The majority of borrowers don't have a lawyer, some don't know they are even being sued, and others don't appear in court, say judges."

"New York has laws in place to ensure no one can prey on consumers, and debt collectors are required to follow those rules...[T]oday’s settlement ensures that thousands of New Yorkers will see millions in relief from debts that were not enforceable in the first place."

Robo signing lawsuits[edit]
According to a New York Times article, In September 2015, U.S. federal regulators - Consumer Financial Protection Bureau - ordered the two big debt-collecting agencies, Encore Capital Group and Portfolio Recovery Associates, to "pay a combined $79 million in refunds and penalties, to stop collections on debts totaling $128 million and to change their debt collection practices."[10] Robo-signing refers to the use of false and misleading affidavits signed by debt-collecting agency staff claiming personal knowledge of an alleged debt that are then used in court. On August 11, 2009 the Northern District of Ohio court issued a landmark ruling that robo-signing affidavits in debt-collection violates the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA). In the 2009 case the debt-collector employees had "been signing between 200 and 400 computer-generated affidavits per day for use in debt-collection actions, without personal knowledge of the accounts."[13]

"The bureau said the companies bought the rights to collect debts that were potentially inaccurate, lacked documentation or were legally unenforceable, and tried to collect the money without verifying the debt. The bureau said the companies pressured borrowers to pay with false statements, with lawsuits and with the use of so-called robo-signed court documents."
— New York Times, September 9, 2015

Context[edit]
Illegal robo-signing tactics used by debt-collectors were first uncovered through a 2008 affidavit signed by Midland Credit Management debt-collection agency employee "claimed personal knowledge that Andrea Brent owed a debt of over $4,000 to Midland Funding." This affidavit was used to file a debt-collection against Brent. Brent brought a class-action counterclaim against Midland "alleging violations of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA) and state common law because the attached affidavit was signed "without personal knowledge of the facts asserted."[13] By June 2008 the case was removed to the Northern District of Ohio. On August 11, 2009, Northern District of Ohio issued a "self-described 'landmark ruling,' holding that 'robo-signing' affidavits in debt-collection actions violates the FDCPA." "The court found the affidavit to be false and misleading under the FDCPA due to the false attestation of personal knowledge. As it turns out, Midland employees had been signing between 200 and 400 computer-generated affidavits per day for use in debt-collection actions, without personal knowledge of the accounts."[13]
The 2013 case Vassalle v. Midland Funding LLC, 11-3814, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit (Cincinnati) was held to determine if Encore Capital Group used illegal collection tactics to collect funds from 1.44 million consumers.[13][14] The suit alleged that Encore's Midland Funding unit's used affidavits approved by staff without personal knowledge of their validity, a process commonly known as "Robo-Signing."[15] A negotiated settlement of $5.2 million was objected to by the FTC,[16] American Association of Retired Persons (AARP), the National Consumer Law Center and 38 U.S. state attorneys general. In February 2013 the settlement was overturned by the 6th circuit court of appeals, who described the final payout of $17.38 per litigant as "perfunctory at best." The court also objected to the negotiated one year injunction on the grounds that the firm's subsidiaries would then be "free to resume its predatory practices."[17] The ruling reversed the decision of Judge David A. Katz of Toledo and returned the case to him for further proceedings.[18]
On 4/16/14 the Attorneys General of 32 states objected to the revised proposed class settlement, stating that it was "a thinly veiled attempt to revive the original settlement" and that it "provides no meaningful value to unnamed class members, and, in fact, it leaves them in a significantly worse position."[13]

Encore Capital Group, Inc., and subsidiaries form the largest publicly traded debt buyer by revenue in the United States.[2][3]:235[4] They purchase "portfolios of defaulted consumer receivables from major banks, credit unions, and utility providers,"[5] and recover collectable debt from these accounts. Jake Halpern author of Bad Paper, described Encore Capital as a "behemoth" in the American debt-industry complex.[6] At the corporate level debt collection is highly profitable and Encore Capital enjoyed soaring revenues from $316 million in 2009 to $773 million in 2013.[6] The firm is a publicly traded NASDAQ Global Select company, a component stock of the Russell 2000, the S&P SmallCap 600, and the Wilshire 4500.
Their business model is highly lucrative as debt-collectors "buy huge swaths of soured bills from lenders for pennies on the dollar."[7] From 2007 to 2012 in New York State alone, Encore Capital and its subsidiaries filed more than 239,000 lawsuits and in 2013 alone collected $564.7 million in legal collections.[7]

History[edit]
Encore Capital Group’s wholly owned operating subsidiary, Midland Credit Management, Inc., was founded in 1953 and was incorporated in Kansas in September 1953. In 1998, an investor group led by Nelson Peltz and Peter May (members of Triarc Companies, Inc. management) and Kerry Packer of Consolidated Press International Holdings Limited, acquired a majority interest in its operations. In 1999, the group formed a holding company, MCM Capital Group, Inc., later renamed Encore Capital Group, Inc. in April 2002. The company was incorporated in Delaware in April 1999 as MCM Capital Group, Inc. and changed its name to Encore Capital Group, Inc. in April 2002. The company completed its initial public offering of 2,250,000 shares of common stock in July 1999.[8] In June, 2013, Encore acquired Asset Acceptance Corporation ( NASDAQ: AACC), another large publicly held debt buyer based in Warren, Michigan. This increased the size of Encore Capital.[9] In 2013, Encore began a series of acquisitions of international debt buying companies. These include Cabot Credit Management in the UK and Ireland, Refinancia S.A. in Colombia and Peru, Mexico with other Latin America locations, and Baycorp Holdings in Australia.
Regulatory Action[edit]
In September 2015, both Encore and Portfolio Recovery Associates, the United States two largest publicly held debt buyers were charged with violating the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act by filing "lawsuits against consumers without having the intent to prove many of the debts, winning the vast majority of the lawsuits by default when consumers failed to defend themselves."[4] U.S. federal regulators - Consumer Financial Protection Bureau imposed an enforcement action on Encore for pressuring borrowers "to pay with false statements, with lawsuits and with the use of using so-called robo-signed court documents."[10] According to the New York Times Encore must pay "$42 million in consumer refunds and a $10 million penalty" and an injunction to "stop collections on debts totaling more than $125 million."[10] In New York State Encore and other debt buyers were filing lawsuits against customers to collect debts in hundreds of court cases which included "generic testimony" or relied on robo-signed bogus affidavits compared to the robo-signing controversy in the 2010 United States foreclosure crisis. At the same time "preventing those same consumers from using the courts to challenge the companies’ tactics."[7] In response to the enforcement action imposed on Encore Capital Group by the CEO Kenneth A. Vecchione claimed that its debt collection practices were not improper and that the C.F.P.B. was "subjecting companies to its own interpretations that have never been codified or adopted."[10]
Business[edit]
According to their 2012 SEC filing, Encore "purchases portfolios of defaulted consumer receivables at deep discounts to face value and uses a variety of channels to maximize collections from these portfolios. In addition, the firm provides bankruptcy support services to some companies in the financial services industry; through their wholly owned subsidiary, Ascension Capital Group, Inc. ("Ascension")."[11]
In 2009 Encore Capital filed 448,000 lawsuits.[3]:235[12]:39
Locations[edit]
Encore Capital Group is based in San Diego, California, with additional sites in Arizona, Minnesota, Texas, Michigan, India, and Costa Rica In addition, the international subsidiaries operate in their own countries. It employs about 3,400 people (as of December, 2015 across these locations, and also has a large third-party network of collection agents and litigators in the United States.
Leadership team[edit]
Ashish Masih is Encore Capital Group's President and Chief Executive Officer.
Financials[edit]
In 2010, the firm paid $362 million, to purchase $10.9 billion in face value of debt. In 2011, it paid $386.9 million to purchase $11.7 billion in face value of debt,[1] Of this $386.9 million, $346.3 million was credit card portfolios, $1.6 million consumer bankruptcy accounts, and $38.9 million telecom accounts.
The Company's revenue increased 22.5% in 2011 to $467.4 million.[1] Gross collections increased to $761.2 million in 2011, a 26% increase from 2010. Collection sites accounted for $336.0 million, while legal collections accounted for $377.5 million. External collection agency forwarding accounted for $47.7 million in gross collections.
Encore's 2015 SEC filings report revenues of $1.2 billion dollars for calendar year ending in December 31, 2015, and $1.1 billion for 2014.
Litigation Practices[edit]
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, an official site of the United States government, reported on September 2, 2015 that the nation's two largest debt buyers, Encore and Portfolio Recovery Associates, violated the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act by filing "lawsuits against consumers without having the intent to prove many of the debts, winning the vast majority of the lawsuits by default when consumers failed to defend themselves."[4]
Already by 2010 the Wall Street Journal was investigating litigation practices as a business plan for large, publicly traded debt buyers like Encore.[2] Journalist Jessica Silver-Greenberg reported that the modern debt-buying industry was created in response to the savings-and-loan crisis.[2]

"Lawmakers established the Resolution Trust Corp. to shutter failed thrifts and auction other assets to buyers. By the mid-1990s, the RTC sold more than $450 billion in these assets. Over time, some buyers of such assets shifted to a new source of profit: charged-off credit-card debt and other consumer debt.
— Wall Street Journal 2010

In 2009 alone Encore Capital filed 448,000 lawsuits[3]:235[12]:39— the most filed by any company in the United States that year.[2]

"Encore posted $33 million in profit last year, up 139% from 2008. While the Standard and Poor's 500-stock index rose 23.5% in 2009, Encore's stock soared 142%. Between 2007 and 2008, the company scooped up $20 billion in charged-off loans for $695.9 million. In order to wring more cash from debt, Encore increasingly has turned to the courts. Lawsuits are filed by a network of outside law firms. Last year, Encore paid $112.6 million for legal collection, which brought in $233 million. Once Encore sues, it is virtually assured a win, says Mr. Black, the company's CEO. Roughly 94% of collection cases filed against borrowers result in default judgments in favor of the debt buyer, according to industry estimates. The majority of borrowers don't have a lawyer, some don't know they are even being sued, and others don't appear in court, say judges."
— Wall Street Journal 2010

January 2015[edit]
New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman sued Encore (Midland’s parent company) over shoddy practices and forced Encore to pay a $675,000 penalty and vacate more than 4,500 court judgments against borrowers.[7] Mr. Schneiderman added,

"New York has laws in place to ensure no one can prey on consumers, and debt collectors are required to follow those rules...[T]oday’s settlement ensures that thousands of New Yorkers will see millions in relief from debts that were not enforceable in the first place."
— New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman January 2015

Robo signing lawsuits[edit]
According to a New York Times article, In September 2015, U.S. federal regulators - Consumer Financial Protection Bureau - ordered the two big debt-collecting agencies, Encore Capital Group and Portfolio Recovery Associates, to "pay a combined $79 million in refunds and penalties, to stop collections on debts totaling $128 million and to change their debt collection practices."[10] Robo-signing refers to the use of false and misleading affidavits signed by debt-collecting agency staff claiming personal knowledge of an alleged debt that are then used in court. On August 11, 2009 the Northern District of Ohio court issued a landmark ruling that robo-signing affidavits in debt-collection violates the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA). In the 2009 case the debt-collector employees had "been signing between 200 and 400 computer-generated affidavits per day for use in debt-collection actions, without personal knowledge of the accounts."[13]

"The bureau said the companies bought the rights to collect debts that were potentially inaccurate, lacked documentation or were legally unenforceable, and tried to collect the money without verifying the debt. The bureau said the companies pressured borrowers to pay with false statements, with lawsuits and with the use of so-called robo-signed court documents."

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
