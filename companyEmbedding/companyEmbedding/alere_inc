Recruitment Fraud Alert
Recently we discovered incidents of fraudulent parties posing as Alere employees or recruiters, seeking to engage with job-seekers on various online job search sites. These unauthorized individuals are using Alere’s name and logo – and in some cases the images and titles of Alere executives – as a way to solicit up-front fees from interested job-seekers.
Please know that Alere does not conduct interviews via chat rooms or text messaging, charge candidates an advance fee of any kind, nor do we offer positions of employment without undergoing a thorough recruiting process. Please also note that any correspondence with regard to employment would come from an authorized alere.com email address.
If you receive unsolicited offers of employment from someone claiming to work for, or be affiliated with Alere, we recommend that you do not respond to their inquiries, do not open any attachments or click on any hyperlinks. If you have further questions as to the validity of a correspondence you have received, you can also seek confirmation by contacting us at MyRecruiter@alere.com.

Alere Inc. is a global manufacturer of rapid point-of-care diagnostic tests. The company was founded in 2001 and is headquartered in Waltham, Massachusetts.[2][3] As of January 2017, the company has a market capitalization of $3.47 billion with an enterprise value of $5.9 billion.[1] The company was formerly known as Inverness Medical Innovations, Inc. and changed its name to Alere Inc. in 2010.[2]
History[edit]
The company was founded in 1991 by Ron Zwanziger under the Name SelfCare, which went public in 1996. The company changed its name from SelfCare to Inverness Medical Technology (IMT) in 2000. One year later, it sold its diabetes business to Johnson & Johnson, and split off a new company called Inverness Medical Innovations. That company subsequently expanded its business by acquiring many companies, including Unipath, Clondiag, Ionian Technologies, TwistDx, Wampole Laboratories, Ostex International, Binax, Biosite, HemoSense, Cholestech, Redwood Toxicology, Concateno, BBI Holdings, eScreen, Standard Diagnostics, and hhh Axis-Shield.
In 2007, Alere entered into a joint venture, named Swiss Precision Diagnostics, with Procter & Gamble for the sales and marketing of its consumer diagnostics products.
In 2009, Alere won two awards in the 16th Annual National Health Information program, which recognizes the U.S.’s best consumer health information programs and materials.[4]
In 2010, the company changed its name to Alere and began trading under the ticker ALR in NYSE.[5]
In 2013, the company completed the acquisition of Epocal, Inc.[6]
In July 2014 Ron Zwanziger resigned as CEO and COO Namal Nawana took over as interim CEO.
In September 2014, Zwanziger offered to take the company private for $3.82 billion.[7]
In October 2014, the Board of Directors voted and instated Namal Nawana as the permanent CEO of Alere, Inc.
In early 2015, Alere divested its Alere Health management activities to Optum.
In February 2016, Abbott Laboratories announced it would acquire Alere Inc for $5.8 billion.[8][9] However, in April, Abbott requested of Alere that this deal be terminated, a proposal rejected by Alere's board of directors.[10]
Business[edit]
Alere operates three business units focused on cardiometabolic, infectious disease, and toxicology testing.[2] The company pioneers in manufacturing rapid point-of-care diagnostic tests and provides products to healthcare professionals and patients worldwide.[11]
In 2004, the company launched the world's first digital pregnancy test under Clearblue® Digital Pregnancy Test.
In 2010, Alere launched the Alere CD4 analyser, the world’s first to provide absolute CD4 results at the Point of Care, making the management of HIV patients easier and more effective.
October 2012, the company received a warning from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for its inadequate response to FDA’s earlier observations on its manufacturing process of the Triage products.[12][13]
In 2014 Alere received clearance from US FDA for the Alere i Influenza A&B, a rapid molecular point-of-care test to detect and differentiate Influenza A&B virus in less than 15 minutes. In Jan 2015, Alere received US CLIA waiver for the Alere i Influenza test. In April 2015, Alere received FDA clearance for its second test on the Alere i platform, the Alere i Strep A test for Group A Streptococcus, which provides results in 8 minutes or less.
In March 2015 Alere received IVD CE mark for Alere q HIV analyser, a fully automated nucleic acid testing platform which brings the power of molecular testing to bench tops in any healthcare setting.
In August 2016 Alere received FDA Clearance for Alere i RSV Rapid Molecular Test which detects RSV infections in 13 minutes or less.[14]
In 2016 the U.S. Justice Department launched an investigation into Alere's role in potential Medicaid and Medicare fraud.[15][16]

The Company's segments include professional diagnostics, consumer diagnostics, and corporate and other. The professional diagnostics segment includes an array of diagnostic test products and other in vitro diagnostic tests marketed to medical professionals and laboratories for detection of diseases and conditions within its areas of focus. The consumer diagnostics segment consists primarily of manufacturing operations related to its role as the exclusive manufacturer of products for SPD Swiss Precision Diagnostics (SPD), its joint venture with The Procter & Gamble Company (P&G).The Company's professional diagnostic solutions allow patients and their healthcare providers to work together to manage patients' conditions over the continuum of care, from the hospital to home. Professional diagnostics solutions are designed to assist medical professionals in both preventative and interventional medicine, and include testing and monitoring performed in hospitals, laboratories and doctors' offices and patient self-testing, which it defines as testing or monitoring performed at home under the supervision of a medical professional. Professional diagnostic products provide for qualitative or quantitative analysis of patient samples for evidence of a specific medical condition, disease state or toxicological state or to measure response to therapy. Within professional diagnostics, the Company focuses on point-of-care, diagnostic testing and the patient self-testing and patient self-management markets. The point-of-care market for diagnostic products includes all areas where a patient is assessed or diagnosed, including hospitals, laboratories, physician offices, specialized mobile clinics, emergency rooms, rapid-response laboratories and patient health screening locations.The Company's professional diagnostic products include point-of-care and laboratory tests within the infectious disease, cardiometabolic disease and toxicology markets, as well as patient self-testing services.

Medical Devices Market Research Reports & Industry Analysis


Medical devices are durable and disposable in nature.  These devices can be used for a wide variety of conditions for surgical procedures, home health care, clinical settings or in the medical office setting.  A medical device is an instrument, apparatus, implant, in vitro reagent or anything similar which can be used to diagnose, prevent or treat a disease within the body.  It can be as simple as a tongue depressor, medical thermometer or disposable gloves.  It can also be as complex as a computer which can assist in medical testing, an implant like a stent or a prosthesis.  Globally, the medical device market is over $209 billion.  
 Medical devices are classified in one of three regulatory classes, the classification is dependent on the intended use of the device and indications for use.  The US accounts for approximately 38% of the global medical device market.  China, Japan, Russia and Brazil have the most stringent regulatory compliance for medical devices. Research can be found within market research industry reports which will further outline economic industry trends, device regulation globally and challenges facing medical device leaders.
