                    My family loves this area! Located near the intersection of Cherry St Extension and Young Road. Very quiet with zero 'through' traffic, very friendly neighbors, and easy to get to Cherry St, Peach St, 38th St, I-90, and I-79. 
Nice mix of older homes and newer construction with a few lots still available for new homes.
Be sure to be in town for the neighborhood's Fourth of July party! Great food and a first row seat to a fantastic fireworks display!

                    Small town feel with big City ideas. The Downtown area is growing with great shops, Taverns, Hotel, Restaurants, Micro Breweries, Leinie Lodge Gift Shop and Brewery. Enjoy the custom wall murals located throughout Chippewa's Historic Downtown or hike/bike through the Irvine Park zoo, small parks or 318 acres of trails. Venture to the outskirts towards the township of Lafayette and enjoy our 6,024 acre Lake Wissota. Lake Wissota State Park is also a great destination for swimming, hiking/biking, camping, geocaching and all the winter activities it offers.
