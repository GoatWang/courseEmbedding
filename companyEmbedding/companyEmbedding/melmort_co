Better Posture, More Comfort… Anytime, Anywhere. GSeat.
The GSeat provides you the most comfortable place to sit no matter where you are. The slight forward slope enables optimal lumbar curvature for ideal posture. The memory foam base gives support and the gel layer over the top disperses pressure in all of the places you need it most.
Based on split rail bike seat technology, our patented integrated handle creates the center relieved groove which completely eliminates all soft tissue pressure and suspends the tailbone.  The patented “hassle free” handle lets you take your comfort with you wherever you go.

Choose Your Comfort!
The GSeat product line comes in a variety of styles and sizes designed for your ultimate comfort!
MADE WITH OUR EXCLUSIVE DYNAMIC DENSITY TECHNOLOGY!


 







    Gelco Products uses a visco-elastic gel that disperses pressure at the point of contact. The gel maintains its shape better than foam products and because the gel never “bottoms out” and less material is needed to achieve a high degree of comfort.

By incorporating functional design with quality materials, Gelco Products creates comfort-enhancing products that reduce pressure and increase comfort.    ×


    The slight forward slope helps you sit with good posture and helps to keep your low back in a natural and healthy alignment.  This natural alignment helps to avoid back pain and fatigue.      ×


    The center relieved groove is inspired by the “split rail” bike seat design and is meant to relieve all pressure on soft tissues and the tailbone.    ×


    The patented, integrated “hassle free” handle makes it easy to take your GSeat anywhere you go.  Better Posture, More Comfort…anywhere anytime    ×

Corynne Pless added this to My Houzz: Eye Candy Colors Fill an 1800s New Orleans VictorianThe kitchen leads into a colorful living room, connected to a sunroom through original French doors. The family considers their sunroom a bonus room, where built-ins and a plush sofa allow for reading and relaxing. Kim commissioned the playful children's portraits from local artist Sarah Ashley Longshore.Becky Dietrich, Interior Designer added this to Give Your Home a History by Telling Your StoryThese fantastic paintings hark back to the tradition of family portraits, but with a new and whimsical spin.  You can't help but grin when you see them.Bryan Anthony added this to 5 New Orleans Homes to Get You in the Mardi Gras SpiritThe kitchen leads into a colorful living room, connected to a sunroom through original French doors.

Whether you’re enjoying family game night or entertaining guests during a party, there is no better place to congregate with family and friends than the living room or family room. True to its name, it's the space where you and your family truly live; you watch movies, read stories, roughhouse and maybe get some homework done. As the focal point of the home, it’s meant to be comfortable, with a cozy fireplace, practical furniture, fully stocked bookshelves and, of course, a nice big-screen TV. Because it's where you’ll spend most of your time, it is important to truly love and be inspired by your   living spaces.
