    1.5 Specific dsDNA Quantification UV/VIS-based cDrop™ Method vs Picogreen® Fluorescent Assay

  Precise quantification and normalization of isolated genomic DNA is critical for advanced molecular testing in life science research and molecular diagnostics. UV-Vis based quantification has long been the method of choice, mainly because of its convenience. However, determining the DNA concentration based on the absorbance at 260nm suffers from interference of components such as RNA, proteins and phenols. Alternative methods, such as the PicoGreen® based Quant-iT™ assay, based on fluorescence enhancement upon binding with dsDNA have been developed to address this issue.

    1.3 Micro-volume Protein Quantification using the DropSense96 Droplet Plate Reader

  The measurement of protein concentration in aqueous samples is an important assay in biochemistry research and protein production facilities. Spectrophotometric protein quantification assays are commonly used methods to rapidly determine the concentration of a protein. They utilize the direct UV absorbance of the protein at 280nm in combination with its extinction coefficient or an indirect dye-based methods like BCA, Lowry and Bradford assays.

    1.2 DropSense96 and its DropPlates, a Versatile Tool for Nucleic Acid and Protein Droplet Quantification

  As the demand for molecular tests increases, automated systems for biomolecule isolation and sample analysis are becoming popular. These facilitate integration of the complete molecular test in a full automatic set-up with liquid robots and bar-coded sample tracking resulting in a significant higher throughput while minimizing tedious manual repetitive tasks. The Trinean technology is a unique combination of the DropSense96 droplet plate reader, the 96well DropPlate microfuidic consumables and the DropQuant analytical software enabling direct quantification of small biomolecule samples in these high throughput, automated workflow.

    1.14 Droplet UV/VIS Quantification of Native Proteins in Biopharmaceutical Processing

  Biopharmaceuticals are mainly produced by microbial fermentation or in animal cell cultures. As a consequence, a cascade of procedures including purification and characterization are required throughout the processing chain to obtain the protein at the desired level of purity and potency. Within these processes, quantification of the protein of interest is mandatory at critical steps to maintain confidence in the processing
results and fidelity in the end product.

    1.20 Quantification of His-tagged IgG antibodies after IMAC Ni-column purification

  Trinean introduces a new cDrop™ application suited for the quantification (OD280) of IgG antibodies and derivatives like Fab fragments during purification by IMAC Ni-columns using imidazole-containing buffers.

    Dye-free quantification of Oragene®/saliva DNA extracts using the Trinean DropSense96® Droplet Reader and cDrop™ Spectral Analysis Software

  Saliva samples collected with Oragene® self-collection kits from DNA Genotek offer a non-invasive and proven method for accessing high quality and quantity DNA for genomic testing and analysis. Proper quantification of the extracted DNA is a critical step
for most downstream applications. Trinean has developed a specific quantification protocol for DNA from Oragene/saliva samples using the DropSense96® droplet reader and the cDrop™ spectral decomposition software. A comparative analysis using a PicoGreen® fluorescent quantification assay shows a comparable specificity for dsDNA quantification. Since the read-out
of 96 samples with the DropSense96 is performed in 5 minutes without any prior mixing or incubation, this technology is a viable alternative to fluorescent quantification assays.

    1.17 Maxwell®16 Blood purification Kit App and Maxwell®16 LEV Blood DNA Kit App

  A spectral content profiling application on the cDrop™ software is available for quantification and contamination analysis of DNA isolations from blood using the Maxwell® 16 Blood DNA purification Kit and The Maxwell®16 LEV Blood DNA Kit. In this note we describe how to use this application and how to export and interpret the results.

    1.7 Quantifying Amplicons in Non-Purified PCR Reactions: Direct Assessment of Product Yield

  The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a fundamental tool in molecular biology and clinical testing. Most genetic tests rely upon the power of PCR to enrich specific target-sequences prior to analysis. Analytical methods like sequencing are relatively expensive and labs want to minimize the resources spent on samples that don't meet the requirements of concentration and quality to deliver a reliable result.

    1.19 Qiagen® EZ1 Tissue DNA app

  A spectral content profiling application on the cDrop™ software is available for quantification and contamination analysis of DNA isolations from cells using the Qiagen® EZ1 Tissue DNA kit. In this note we describe how to use this application and how to export and interpret the results.

    1.10 cDrop Protocol for TRIzol RNA Extract Quantification and Content QC

  This cDrop protocol is developed for specific RNA quantification of extracts from a variety of sample origins (human, animal, plant) using extraction kits based on the
one-step extraction method using a guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol- chloroform reagent-mix developed by Chomczynski (1). Commercial available variants include the TRIzol® kit (Invitrogen), TRI Reagent® (MRC), RNAzolTM (MRC) and RNA STAT-60TM (Tel-Test).

    All-Purpose Protein Sample QC Using a Novel Micro-Volume Platform with Spectral Content Profiling Software

  Accurate total protein quantitation of purified proteins, cell lysates, affinity-column fractions or other complex protein samples is crucial for robust biochemical testing during biopharmaceutical development as well as production. As the presence of chemicals doesn't allow simple A280 protein quantification, more labor-intensive alternatives for quantification are used. Examples are the colorimetric Bradford or BCA assay, which negate to a large extent the presence of contaminants but require multiple steps and show variation depending on the sample composition and time point of measuring within the ongoing reaction.

    Precise Nucleic Acid Quantification Using Lab-on-a-chip Spectroscopy and the cDrop Quantification Algorithm

  Precise quantification and quality control of isolated genomic DNA is critical for the success of downstream applications such as next-generation sequencing. Traditionally, two quantification methods have been used routinely: (1) UV/Vis spectroscopy and (2) fluorescence-based assays (i.e. PicoGreen) that utilize DNA intercalating agents.

    Sample Processing for the UK Biobank Genotyping Project

  A project was initiated in 2013 to perform SNP genotyping on all UK Biobank participants. The aim of the project (which was to be completed within an 18-24 month timeframe) was to generate high quality genotype data and to make these data available for researchers, via the UK Biobank Showcase system. This poster describes the sample processing workflow, presents a comparison between the two quantification methods used in the project (Trinean DropSense® 96 and PicoGreen) and provides a summary of the genotyping metrics for the (approx.) first 180,000 samples analysed.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35
50
100




Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year




How many days after the end-of-quarter date before doing the backtest? (0 - 60) 

DAYS





      Or use day whenever the filing was submitted to the SEC
      (or the last filing when using a group of funds):
Starting Quarter

      By default backtester will test your strategy using all available dates going back to 2001 (for subscribers only).
      You can optionally adjust when the backtest actually starts.
