	the account value as of the close of business on the last day of the previous
	calendar year.  The RMD rules also
	contain a minimum benefit rule which may require a larger annual RMD
	amount, particularly when distributions are made over the joint lives of the
	Owner and an individual other than his or her spouse.  RMDs also can be made in the form of annuity
	payments that satisfy the rules set forth in regulations under the Code
	relating to RMDs, including incidental benefit restrictions.
