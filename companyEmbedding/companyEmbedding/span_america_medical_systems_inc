Span-America Acquires M.C. Healthcare Products Inc.




Expects Acquisition to be Accretive to Fiscal 2012 Earnings






December 09, 2011 12:37 PM Eastern Standard Time



GREENVILLE, S.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Span-America Medical Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ: SPAN) announced today that 
      it has acquired substantially all the assets of M.C. Healthcare Products 
      Inc. (MCHP). MCHP, located in Beamsville, Ontario, Canada, is a 
      privately-owned manufacturer and marketer of medical bed frames and 
      related products for the long term care market.
    


      “We are excited about combining M.C. Healthcare with Span-America to 
      leverage our product solutions and marketing opportunities in the long 
      term care market,” stated Jim Ferguson, president and chief executive 
      officer of Span-America. Ferguson says the move will expand the 
      company’s market potential by bundling a robust line of medical bed 
      frames with Span-America’s broad line of branded therapeutic support 
      surfaces. “M.C. Healthcare’s product line fits very well with our 
      current medical business,” he said. “We already sell to many of the same 
      customers, attend the same trade shows and have similar sales and 
      marketing efforts.” The company expects the acquisition to be accretive 
      to its earnings in fiscal 2012.
    

      MCHP reported sales of CDN $12.2 million and operating profit of CDN 
      $170,000, which includes non-recurring and owner-related expenses of CDN 
      $1.5 million and CDN $84,000 in depreciation and amortization for the 
      fiscal year ended July 31, 2011.
    

      Under the terms of the transaction, Span-America acquired, through a 
      wholly-owned subsidiary, substantially all of the assets of MCHP for CDN 
      $8.0 million cash plus 100,000 shares of Span-America common stock. The 
      purchase price is subject to certain working capital adjustments as set 
      forth in the acquisition agreement. Span-America will fund the 
      acquisition through a combination of cash on hand and proceeds from a 
      renewal of its $10 million revolving credit facility that includes a 
      temporary line-of-credit increase from $10 million to $13 million. The 
      assets purchased consist primarily of accounts receivable, inventory, 
      manufacturing equipment and intellectual property. Liabilities assumed 
      consist primarily of ordinary course accounts payable and accruals. The 
      transaction is expected to result in goodwill of approximately CDN $6.5 
      million.
    

      Span-America will operate MCHP under the registered business name M.C. 
      Healthcare Products, a division of Span Medical Products Canada Inc. 
      (Span-Canada), which is a newly formed British Columbia corporation and 
      wholly-owned subsidiary of Span-America Medical Systems, Inc. 
      Span-Canada will operate the business from MCHP’s 50,000 square foot 
      manufacturing and showroom facility in Beamsville, Ontario under a 
      five-year lease agreement with an option to buy or continue the lease at 
      the end of the lease term.
    

      MCHP has 54 employees and 17 independent manufacturer’s representatives. 
      Span-Canada will offer continued employment to all current MCHP 
      employees under substantially the same terms and conditions as they are 
      currently employed, with the exception of the president and majority 
      shareholder who is retiring. MCHP’s manufacturing employees are 
      represented by the Sheet Metal Workers’ International Association, Local 
      Union #540. Span-Canada will assume MCHP’s responsibilities under the 
      collective agreement currently in place and will become the successor 
      employer for purposes of that agreement. In addition, Span-Canada will 
      offer to engage the manufacturer’s representatives under the same terms 
      and conditions under which they are currently engaged.

Span-America Medical Systems, Inc. Agrees to Be Acquired by Savaria Corporation | Business Wire
























































Span-America Medical Systems, Inc. Agrees to Be Acquired by 
      Savaria Corporation




All-Cash Tender Offer of $29 Per Share






May 01, 2017 03:30 PM Eastern Daylight Time



GREENVILLE, S.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Span-America Medical Systems, Inc. (“Span-America”) (NASDAQ:SPAN) 
      announced today that it has reached an agreement to be acquired by 
      Savaria Corporation, an Alberta, Canada corporation (“Savaria”) 
      (TSX:SIS). Savaria intends to acquire Span-America by way of an all-cash 
      tender offer for $29 per share, or approximately $80.2 million. The 
      transaction is expected to close in the second calendar quarter of 2017.
    


      Tom Henrion, Chairman of Span-America’s board of directors, said, “The 
      Board of Directors of Span-America unanimously approved the proposed 
      acquisition of Span-America by Savaria. The proposed all-cash tender 
      offer of $29 per share represents an immediate and substantial cash 
      value as well as a significant premium over our stock price, and we 
      believe it fully values the company for our shareholders. Savaria’s 
      offer reflects the value that our management and employee team has 
      created for our shareholders. All of Span-America’s board members and 
      senior managers have agreed to tender their shares in the tender offer.”
    

      Founded in 1979, Savaria provides accessibility solutions for the 
      elderly and physically challenged to increase their mobility and 
      independence. Savaria designs, manufactures, distributes and installs 
      accessibility equipment, such as stair lifts for straight and curved 
      stairs, vertical and inclined wheelchair lifts, elevators for home and 
      commercial use, as well as patient lifts. In addition, it converts and 
      adapts vehicles to be wheelchair accessible. It also operates a network 
      of franchisees and corporate stores through which new and recycled 
      accessibility equipment is sold and, in certain locations, vehicle 
      conversions are performed. Savaria records close to 60% of its revenue 
      outside Canada, primarily in the United States. It operates a sales 
      network of some 400 retailers and affiliates in North America and 
      employs some 500 people. Its principal places of business are located in 
      Laval, Quebec, Brampton, Ontario, and Huizhou, China.
    

Structure and Terms


      Under the terms of the transaction, Span-America shareholders will 
      receive $29 in cash per share. This represents a premium of 33% to 
      Span-America’s closing share price on NASDAQ on April 28, 2017, the last 
      full trading day prior to the announcement date of the Transaction, and 
      a premium of 33% to Span-America’s 20-day volume weighted average 
      closing price, calculated as at April 28, 2017. Savaria has indicated 
      that it will finance the transaction with cash on hand, a financing 
      commitment from National Bank of Canada and a Canadian equity private 
      placement of subscription receipts.
    

      The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including 
      receipt of two-thirds of Span-America’s shares on a fully diluted basis 
      in a tender offer to Span-America’ shareholders. All of the members of 
      Span-America’s board of directors and its senior officers have entered 
      into tender support agreements with Savaria committing, subject to 
      certain conditions and exceptions, to tender (without a right of 
      withdrawal) all of their Span-America shares, constituting in aggregate 
      approximately 15.9% of its outstanding shares. Following the successful 
      completion of the tender offer, Savaria will acquire all remaining 
      shares not tendered in the tender offer through a second-step merger at 
      the same price per share as that payable under the offer. The 
      transaction is expected to close in the second calendar quarter of 2017.

      from low-cost foreign imports, (n) changes in relationships with large 
      customers or key suppliers, (o) uncertainty about whether or not we will 
      be awarded or continue to be awarded one-time seasonal promotions with 
      major retailers, which can have a large impact on annual revenues and 
      earnings, (p) the impact of competitive products and pricing, 
      (q) government reimbursement changes in the medical market, (r) FDA and 
      Health Canada regulation of medical device manufacturing, and (s) other 
      risk factors detailed in Span-America’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for 
      the fiscal year ended October 1, 2016 and other filings with the SEC,

PressureGuard® Custom Care® Convertible Series 




Air is the star 
The revolutionary part of the PressureGuardŽ Custom CareŽ Convertible and Convertible LAL surfaces starts deep within the surface, in the Star Chamber air cylinders. Far more than foam-filled "air" systems, the Star Chamber design creates a true air system that is constantly filled with air - whether or not the surface is powered. 

air is a superior pressure redistribution and immersion medium
cross-connected elasticized reservoirs absorb peaks to mimic powered flotation
four body-length air cylinders provide greater air displacement and better weight distribution than typical side-to-side cylinder configurations
the points of the star-shaped core ensure maximum air volume
the closed air system requires no refilling or maintenance for 5 years
Air superiority
While they can be somewhat effective, foam-filled systems are limited by physics. But true air therapy provides the pathway to dramatically improved outcomes. It all starts with what's on the inside. 




 
Foam: a solid


inhibits ideal pressure redistribution
limits active therapies


a typical foam-filled air sector:


is only 5% air by volume provides only 5% support from air 
derives 95% support from foam 


 

Air: a fluid


facilitates ideal pressure redistribution
maximizes active therapies
a Star Chamber air cylinder:


is 60% air by volume provides 92% support from air
derives only 8% support from foam

PressureGuard® Easy Air 




Low-air-loss Therapy with Alternating Pressure
Best performance. None of the compromises.
Clinicians choose low air loss systems to address maceration, the weakening of
the skin due to excess moisture.
The new PressureGuard Easy Air is independently documented to outperform every
leading low air loss system in this key performance area. 
Remarkably, it does so with none of the compromises low air loss users have come to accept, thanks to its exclusive Air Diffusion Matrix technology and PressureGuard air/foam design.
Easy Air won't lose inflation in a power outage. Its stable surface won't "swallow
up" the user. And its Safety Edge won't collapse like air-only mattresses can, making transfers safer. It won't
make the user too hot or too cold, either.
Ultra-simple to set up, clean and use. Dial sets the comfort level. "On/off"
buttons control air flow and alternating pressure feature. 
Weight limit: 500 lbs. on standard model
Mattress weight: 22 lbs.
Warranty: 2-years, non-prorated.
The PressureGuardŽ Easy Air is recognized for reimbursement under Medicare Code: E0277.
Related Products: 
Easy Air LR with Lateral Rotation
Easy Air XL for the users up to 1000 lbs.

PressureGuard® APM² 





Alternating Pressure or Lateral Rotation at the Flip of a Switch!   Now with Shear Transfer Zones and Digital Control Unit.




With its two distinct therapy modes,
the PressureGuardŽ APM˛ gives you twice the treatment options. Twice the
flexibility. Twice the value.  And now enhanced cover and control unit features as well. 



The APM˛ has been an
industry-leading air therapy solution for more than a decade, based in large
part on its documented superiority vs. typical, roll-up treatment
surfacesš.  An upgraded cover design
and control unit now provide even greater immersion, envelopment, shear reduction,
treatment flexibility, caregiver ergonomics and user comfort.
The covers enhanced features include the unique design of the anti-microbial bi-directional stretch cover made with Spans superior LifeSpanŽ fabric.  
LifeSpanŽ is extremely durable and cleanable and delivers outstanding resistance to chemical breakdown caused by bleach and other harsh disinfectants with its polycarbonate-fortified coating
Change instantly and easily from alternating pressure to basic lateral rotation with a single, recessed toggle switch. Requires no disconnecting or exchanging of air lines.
 
The dependable digital control unit is lightweight and quiet.  The easy-to-use, white multi-functional control unit provides simple, indexed comfort adjustment and a selectable audible alarm.  A timed (20 minute) Auto Firm mode facilitates caregiving activities such as transfers, ADLs and CPR and then returns to its previously selected mode.. 

 Alternate Mode changes loading in
a 10-minute cycle of either alternating pressure or lateral rotation therapy as
selected at the mattress.  Float mode
provides powered flotation therapy. 

Indicator lights for Low pressure
and Power Failure give users assurance-at-a-glance of proper function.
 
 
Weight limit: 350 lbs.
Mattress weight: 20 lbs.
Control Unit weight: 6.3 lbs., UL
listed.
Warranty: 18-months (all components)

Surfaces Overview 




Span-America offers a full line of powered and non-powered support surfaces and overlays to address both Treatment and Prevention of pressure ulcers. Our PressureGuardŽ and Geo-MattressŽ mattresses, and our varied line of Geo-MattŽ and Delta foam overlays and traditional air mattresses give the clinician the needed options in addressing integrity of the skin and deep tissues.






 

Treatment
Among specialty support surfaces PressureGuardŽ stands apart. All treatment products
 are packed with technical innovations combining the effectiveness of an
 air flotation system with the unmatched stability and safety of a
multi-component engineered foam shell.  



 

Prevention
Span-America provides a variety of Geo-MattressŽ foam mattresses and
Geo-MattŽ overlay options.  All include outstanding features for pressure redistribution, shear relief and pressure ulcer prevention. 



 

Bariatric
From The Safety Edge to the Geo-MattŽ, PressureGuardŽ products meet the special needs of the bariatric client.
 Packed with unique features regarding key risk factors that increase
when obesity impedes in-bed mobility and proper transfers.  


 

Recessed Deck models
Five distinct Span surfaces share a series of patented design features engineered specifically to overcome the restrictive nature of the recessed deck bed with its V-shaped deck.  A key feature is an adaptation of Spans proprietary Safety Edge two-piece bolster system. 



 

In-Home Styles 
For clients receiving in-home treatment, Span-America introduces
In-Home versions of three popular PressureGuardŽ mattresses. Styled with a
 less institutional
appearance, these In-Home Styles are available in king, queen, full, full long,
or dual (split) king sizes.

PressureGuard® APM² 





Alternating Pressure or Lateral Rotation at the Flip of a Switch!   Now with Shear Transfer Zones and Digital Control Unit.




With its two distinct therapy modes,
the PressureGuardŽ APM˛ gives you twice the treatment options. Twice the
flexibility. Twice the value.  And now enhanced cover and control unit features as well. 



The APM˛ has been an
industry-leading air therapy solution for more than a decade, based in large
part on its documented superiority vs. typical, roll-up treatment
surfacesš.  An upgraded cover design
and control unit now provide even greater immersion, envelopment, shear reduction,
treatment flexibility, caregiver ergonomics and user comfort.
The covers enhanced features include the unique design of the anti-microbial bi-directional stretch cover made with Spans superior LifeSpanŽ fabric.  
LifeSpanŽ is extremely durable and cleanable and delivers outstanding resistance to chemical breakdown caused by bleach and other harsh disinfectants with its polycarbonate-fortified coating
Change instantly and easily from alternating pressure to basic lateral rotation with a single, recessed toggle switch. Requires no disconnecting or exchanging of air lines.
 
The dependable digital control unit is lightweight and quiet.  The easy-to-use, white multi-functional control unit provides simple, indexed comfort adjustment and a selectable audible alarm.  A timed (20 minute) Auto Firm mode facilitates caregiving activities such as transfers, ADLs and CPR and then returns to its previously selected mode.. 

 Alternate Mode changes loading in
a 10-minute cycle of either alternating pressure or lateral rotation therapy as
selected at the mattress.  Float mode
provides powered flotation therapy. 

Indicator lights for Low pressure
and Power Failure give users assurance-at-a-glance of proper function.
 
 
Weight limit: 350 lbs.
Mattress weight: 20 lbs.
Control Unit weight: 6.3 lbs., UL
listed.
Warranty: 18-months (all components)

Custom Care Convertable
Custom Care Convertable LAL






PressureGuard® Custom Care® Convertible Series 




Air is the star 
The revolutionary part of the PressureGuardŽ Custom CareŽ Convertible and Convertible LAL surfaces starts deep within the surface, in the Star Chamber air cylinders. Far more than foam-filled "air" systems, the Star Chamber design creates a true air system that is constantly filled with air - whether or not the surface is powered. 

air is a superior pressure redistribution and immersion medium
cross-connected elasticized reservoirs absorb peaks to mimic powered flotation
four body-length air cylinders provide greater air displacement and better weight distribution than typical side-to-side cylinder configurations
the points of the star-shaped core ensure maximum air volume
the closed air system requires no refilling or maintenance for 5 years
Air superiority
While they can be somewhat effective, foam-filled systems are limited by physics. But true air therapy provides the pathway to dramatically improved outcomes. It all starts with what's on the inside. 




 
Foam: a solid


inhibits ideal pressure redistribution
limits active therapies


a typical foam-filled air sector:


is only 5% air by volume provides only 5% support from air 
derives 95% support from foam 


 

Air: a fluid


facilitates ideal pressure redistribution
maximizes active therapies
a Star Chamber air cylinder:


is 60% air by volume provides 92% support from air
derives only 8% support from foam

PressureGuard® Easy Air 




Low-air-loss Therapy with Alternating Pressure
Best performance. None of the compromises.
Clinicians choose low air loss systems to address maceration, the weakening of
the skin due to excess moisture.
The new PressureGuard Easy Air is independently documented to outperform every
leading low air loss system in this key performance area. 
Remarkably, it does so with none of the compromises low air loss users have come to accept, thanks to its exclusive Air Diffusion Matrix technology and PressureGuard air/foam design.
Easy Air won't lose inflation in a power outage. Its stable surface won't "swallow
up" the user. And its Safety Edge won't collapse like air-only mattresses can, making transfers safer. It won't
make the user too hot or too cold, either.
Ultra-simple to set up, clean and use. Dial sets the comfort level. "On/off"
buttons control air flow and alternating pressure feature. 
Weight limit: 500 lbs. on standard model
Mattress weight: 22 lbs.
Warranty: 2-years, non-prorated.
The PressureGuardŽ Easy Air is recognized for reimbursement under Medicare Code: E0277.

Surfaces Overview 




Span-America offers a full line of powered and non-powered support surfaces and overlays to address both Treatment and Prevention of pressure ulcers. Our PressureGuardŽ and Geo-MattressŽ mattresses, and our varied line of Geo-MattŽ and Delta foam overlays and traditional air mattresses give the clinician the needed options in addressing integrity of the skin and deep tissues.






 

Treatment
Among specialty support surfaces PressureGuardŽ stands apart. All treatment products
 are packed with technical innovations combining the effectiveness of an
 air flotation system with the unmatched stability and safety of a
multi-component engineered foam shell.  



 

Prevention
Span-America provides a variety of Geo-MattressŽ foam mattresses and
Geo-MattŽ overlay options.  All include outstanding features for pressure redistribution, shear relief and pressure ulcer prevention. 



 

Bariatric
From The Safety Edge to the Geo-MattŽ, PressureGuardŽ products meet the special needs of the bariatric client.
 Packed with unique features regarding key risk factors that increase
when obesity impedes in-bed mobility and proper transfers.  


 

Recessed Deck models
Five distinct Span surfaces share a series of patented design features engineered specifically to overcome the restrictive nature of the recessed deck bed with its V-shaped deck.  A key feature is an adaptation of Spans proprietary Safety Edge two-piece bolster system. 



 

In-Home Styles 
For clients receiving in-home treatment, Span-America introduces
In-Home versions of three popular PressureGuardŽ mattresses. Styled with a
 less institutional
appearance, these In-Home Styles are available in king, queen, full, full long,
or dual (split) king sizes.
