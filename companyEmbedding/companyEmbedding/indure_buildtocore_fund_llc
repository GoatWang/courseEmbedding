Led by a management team working collaboratively since 20003, National Real Estate Advisors has honed a specialized build-to-core strategy and established a unique open-end real estate fund to invest in modern assets, located in major U.S. urban markets. The company takes a patient, long-term investment view, developing and re-developing properties at appropriate points in the real estate cycle, always seeking to create modern, technologically advanced assets for its portfolios, to outperform older properties competing for tenants.  Operating throughout the entire capital stack, National invests equity and lends debt—providing its development partners a range of flexible financing solutions—preferred equity, mezzanine debt, senior debt, construction loans, and credit enhancements. Relationships with many leading developers give National opportunities to participate in some of the country’s most recognized projects, while the company can also utilize in-house expertise to develop projects on its own or with others. While seeking to ensure quality construction in often complex projects, National has delivered solid long-term returns for its pension fund clients.




 
As of 12/31/2016.


1. Registration as an investment advisor does not imply any level of skill or training.


2. Net assets under management are calculated using the fair market value of investments plus cash and other assets and liabilities.


National has operated as an investment advisor since January 2010.  In addition, National’s key managing members generally worked together at National’s predecessor firm, NEBF Real Estate from 2000 through 2010.

* This undertaking does not affect any limits Section 102(a) of the National Securities Markets
Improvement Act of 1996 ("NSMIA") [Pub. L. No. 104-290, 110 Stat. 3416 (Oct. 11, 1996)] imposes on the ability of States to
require information. As a result, if the securities that are the subject of this Form D are "covered securities" for purposes
of NSMIA, whether in all instances or due to the nature of the offering that is the subject of this Form D, States cannot
routinely require offering materials under this undertaking or otherwise and can require offering materials only to the
extent NSMIA permits them to do so under NSMIA's preservation of their anti-fraud authority.
