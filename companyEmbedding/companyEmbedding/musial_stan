Stanley Frank Musial (/ˈmjuːziəl/ or /ˈmjuːʒəl/; born Stanisław Franciszek Musiał; November 21, 1920 – January 19, 2013), nicknamed Stan the Man, was an American Major League Baseball (MLB) outfielder and first baseman. He spent 22 seasons playing for the St. Louis Cardinals, from 1941 to 1944 and 1946 to 1963. Widely considered to be one of the greatest and most consistent hitters in baseball history,[1] Musial was a first-ballot inductee into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1969, and was also selected to the St. Louis Cardinals Hall of Fame in the inaugural class of 2014.
Musial batted .331 over the course of his career and set National League (NL) records for career hits (3,630), runs batted in (1,951), games played (3,026), at bats (10,972), runs scored (1,949) and doubles (725), his 475 career home runs then ranked second in NL history behind Mel Ott's total of 511. His 6,134 total bases remained a major league record until surpassed by Hank Aaron, and his hit total still ranks fourth all-time, and is the highest by any player who spent his career with only one team. A seven-time batting champion with identical totals of 1,815 hits at home and 1,815 hits on the road, he was named the National League's (NL) Most Valuable Player (MVP) three times and led St. Louis to three World Series championships. He also shares the major league record for the most All-Star Games played (24) with Hank Aaron and Willie Mays.[a] [2]
Musial was born in Donora, Pennsylvania, where he frequently played baseball informally or in organized settings, and eventually played on the baseball team at Donora High School. Signed to a professional contract by the St. Louis Cardinals as a pitcher in 1938, Musial was converted into an outfielder prior to his major league debut in 1941. Noted for his unique batting stance, he quickly established himself as a consistent and productive hitter. In his first full season, 1942, the Cardinals won the World Series. The following year, he led the NL in six different offensive categories and earned his first MVP award. He was also named to the NL All-Star squad for the first time; he appeared in every All-Star game in every subsequent season he played.[3] Musial won his second World Series championship in 1944, then missed the entire 1945 season while serving in the Navy.
After completing his military service during the war, Musial returned to baseball in 1946 and resumed his consistent hitting. That year he earned his second MVP award and third World Series title. His third MVP award came in 1948, when he finished one home run short of winning baseball's Triple Crown. After struggling offensively in 1959, Musial used a personal trainer to help maintain his productivity until he decided to retire in 1963. At the time of his retirement, he held or shared 17 major league records, 29 National League records, and nine All-Star Game records. Ironically, in 1964, the season following his retirement, the Cardinals went on to defeat the New York Yankees in an epic 7-game clash, for St. Louis' first World Series championship in nearly two decades (a team which included future Hall of Famer Lou Brock performing what would have likely been Musial's left field duties).[4] In addition to overseeing businesses, such as a restaurant both before and after his playing career, Musial served as the Cardinals' general manager in 1967, winning the pennant and World Series, then quitting that position. He also became noted for his harmonica playing, a skill he acquired during his playing career. Known for his modesty and sportsmanship, Musial was selected for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team in 1999. In February 2011, President Barack Obama presented Musial with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, one of the highest civilian awards that can be bestowed on a person by the United States government.

Early life[edit]
Musial was born in Donora, Pennsylvania, the fifth of the six children (four girls and two boys) of Lukasz and Mary (Lancos) Musiał (/ˈmuːʃaʊ/, MOO-show).[5] His mother was of Carpatho-Rusyn descent and his father was a Polish immigrant who chose the name Stanisław Franciszek for his first son, though his father always referred to Musial using the Polish nickname Stasiu, pronounced "Stashu".[5][6] Musial frequently played baseball with his brother Ed and other friends during his childhood, and considered Lefty Grove his favorite ballplayer.[7][8] Musial also had the benefit of learning about baseball from his neighbor Joe Barbao, a former minor league pitcher.[9] When he enrolled in school, his name was formally changed to Stanley Frank Musial.[5]
At age 15 Musial joined the Donora Zincs, a semi-professional team managed by Barbao.[10] In his Zincs debut he pitched 6 innings and struck out 13 batters, all of them adults.[10] Musial also played one season on the newly revived Donora High School baseball team, where one of his teammates was Buddy Griffey, father of MLB player Ken Griffey, Sr. and grandfather to Ken Griffey, Jr.[11][12] Baseball statistician Bill James described the younger Griffey, in comparison to Musial, as "the second-best left-handed hitting, left-handed throwing outfielder ever born in Donora, Pennsylvania, on November 21."[13] His exploits as a rising player in Pennsylvania earned him the nickname "The Donora Greyhound".[14]
Musial also played basketball and was offered an athletic scholarship in that sport by the University of Pittsburgh.[10][15] Meanwhile, the St. Louis Cardinals had scouted Musial as a pitcher and, in 1937, offered him a professional contract after a workout with their Class D Penn State League affiliate.[16] Musial's father initially resisted the idea of his son pursuing a baseball career, but reluctantly gave his consent after lobbying by both Musial and his mother.[17] Musial also credited his school librarian Helen Kloz for pointing out that baseball was his dream and advising him to pursue it professionally.[17] In what was then a common practice, the Cardinals did not file the contract with the baseball commissioner's office until June 1938. This preserved Musial's amateur eligibility, and he was still able to participate in high school sports, leading Donora High School's basketball team to a playoff appearance.[18] He then reported to the Cardinals' Class D affiliate in West Virginia, the Williamson Red Birds.[19][20]
Professional baseball career[edit]
Minor leagues (1938–41)[edit]
Musial's rookie year with Williamson in 1938 was a period of adjustment both on and off the field. He began gaining more in-depth knowledge about baseball strategy[21] while posting a 6–6 win–loss record and a 4.66 earned run average (ERA), to go along with a .258 batting average.[22] Off the field, he experienced feelings of homesickness while learning to live comfortably and independently on his $65-per-month salary.[21] Musial finished his high school education before returning to Williamson in spring 1939. That season his numbers improved to a 9–2 record, a 4.30 ERA, and a .352 batting average.[23][24]
Musial spent the 1940 season with the Cardinals' other Class D team, the Daytona Beach Islanders, where he developed a lifelong friendship with manager Dickie Kerr.[25] His pitching skills improved under the guidance of Kerr, who also recognized his hitting talent, playing him in the outfield between pitching starts.[26] On May 25, 1940, Musial married fellow Donora resident, Lillian "Lil" Labash, in Daytona Beach, and the couple's first child followed in August.[27] During late August, Musial suffered a shoulder injury while playing in the outfield, and later made an early exit as the starting pitcher in a 12–5 playoff game loss.[28] For a while Musial considered leaving baseball entirely, complaining that he could not afford to support himself and his wife on the $16 a week pay. Kerr talked him out of it, and even took the Musials into his own home to relieve the financial burden. To repay the debt Musial bought Kerr a $20,000 home in Houston in 1958.[29] In 113 games in 1940 he hit .311, while compiling an 18–5 pitching record that included 176 strikeouts and 145 walks.[30][31]
Musial was assigned to the Class AA Columbus Red Birds to begin 1941, though manager, Burt Shotton, and Musial himself quickly realized that the previous year's injury had considerably weakened his arm.[32] He was reassigned to the Class C Springfield Cardinals as a full-time outfielder, and he later credited manager Ollie Vanek for displaying confidence in his hitting ability.[33] During 87 games with Springfield, Musial hit a league-leading .379 before being promoted to the Rochester Red Wings of the International League.[34] He was noted for his unique batting stance, a crouch in which his back was seemingly square to the pitcher.[35] This stance was later described by pitcher Ted Lyons as "a kid peeking around the corner to see if the cops were coming".[36] According to a 1950 description by author Tom Meany, "The bent knees and the crouch give him the appearance of a coiled spring, although most pitchers think of him as a coiled rattlesnake."[37] Musial continued to play well in Rochester—in one three-game stretch, he had 11 hits. He was called up to the Cardinals for the last two weeks of the 1941 season.[38]
Major leagues (1941–44)[edit]




Musial's statue outside of Busch Stadium captures his signature batting stance.


Musial made his major league debut during the second game of a doubleheader at Sportsman's Park on September 17, 1941.[39] The Cardinals were in the midst of a pennant race with the Brooklyn Dodgers; in 12 games, Musial collected 20 hits for a .426 batting average.[40] Despite Musial's late contributions, the Cardinals finished two and one-half games behind the 100-game-winning Dodgers.[41]
Cardinals manager Billy Southworth used Musial as a left fielder to begin 1942, sometimes lifting him for a pinch-hitter against left-handed pitching.[42] Musial was hitting .315 by late June,[43] as the Cardinals resumed battling the Dodgers for first place in the National League (NL).[44] The Cardinals took sole possession of first place on September 13, and when Musial caught a fly ball to end the first game of a doubleheader on September 27 they clinched the pennant with their 105th win.[45] He finished the season with a .315 batting average and 72 runs batted in (RBI) in 140 games. Musial received national publicity when he was named by St. Louis Post-Dispatch sports editor J. Roy Stockton as his choice for Rookie of the Year in a Saturday Evening Post article.[46][47]
The Cardinals played the American League champion New York Yankees in the 1942 World Series.[48] Representing the winning run at home plate in the bottom of the ninth inning of Game 1 at Sportsman's Park, Musial grounded out with the bases loaded to end the game .[49] Musial's first hit of the Series was an RBI single that provided the margin of victory in Game 2, allowing the Cardinals to tie the Series.[50] Over the next three games at Yankee Stadium, Musial had three more hits as the Cardinals defeated the Yankees in the Series four games to one.[51] Musial batted .222 for the Series, with two runs scored.[52]
Musial's 1943 season started with a brief contract holdout in spring training.[53] He made the National League All-Star team for the first time as a starting left fielder and got a double in the All-Star Game on July 13.[53] He finished the season leading the major leagues in hitting with a .357 batting average and led the NL in hits (220), doubles (48), triples (20), total bases (347), on-base percentage (.425), and slugging percentage (.562).[54] This performance earned him his first NL Most Valuable Player Award, ahead of teammate and catcher Walker Cooper (.318 batting average).[54] After romping to another NL pennant by 18 games, the Cardinals again faced the Yankees in the 1943 World Series.[55] Musial had a single in the Cardinals' Game 1 loss, and scored a run in a Game 2 win.[55] The Cardinals did not win another game in the Series, but the loser's bonus share paid to each Cardinals player ($4,321.99) still amounted to nearly two-thirds of Musial's regular season salary.[56]
United States involvement in World War II began to impinge on Musial's baseball career in 1944, as he underwent a physical examination in prelude to possible service in the armed forces.[57] He ultimately remained with the Cardinals for the entire season, posting a .347 batting average with 197 hits.[58][59] The Cardinals claimed the NL pennant for the third consecutive season, and faced St. Louis's other major league team, the Browns, in the 1944 World Series.[60] The Browns took a 2–1 lead, while Musial hit .250 with zero RBI.[61] He broke out in Game 4 with a two-run home run, single, double, and a walk as part of a 5–1 Cardinals win.[61] The Cardinals went on to defeat the Browns in six games, and Musial posted a .304 batting average for the Series.[62][63]
Sojourn in the U.S. Navy (1945–46)[edit]
Musial enlisted in the United States Navy on January 23, 1945, during World War II. He was initially assigned to noncombat duty at the Naval Training Station in Bainbridge, Maryland.[64] In June 1945, he was assigned to Special Services in Hawaii, and was assigned to a ferry launch unit to bring back damaged ship crews entering Pearl Harbor where he was able to play baseball every afternoon in the naval base's eight-team league.[65] After being granted emergency leave to see his ailing father in January 1946, he was briefly assigned to the Philadelphia Navy Yard before his honorable discharge from the Navy as a Seaman Second Class in March 1946.[65][66]
In 2007, Musial received the Navy Memorial's Lone Sailor Award, which honors Navy veterans who have excelled in civilian life.

1946–49[edit]


"Every time Stan came up they chanted, 'Here comes the man!'"

—Cardinals traveling secretary Leo Ward relates Dodger fans' nickname for Musial to sportswriter Bob Broeg[67]
Rejoining the Cardinals under new manager Eddie Dyer, Musial posted a .388 batting average by the middle of May 1946.[68] He also became close friends with new teammate Red Schoendienst, who had joined the Cardinals during Musial's absence in 1945.[69] During the season, Musial (who was under contract to the Cardinals for $13,500 in 1946) was offered a five-year, $125,000 contract, plus a $50,000 bonus, to join the Mexican League.[70] He declined the offer, and after manager Dyer spoke to club owner Sam Breadon, Musial was given a $5,000 raise later in 1946.[71]
It was also during the 1946 season that Musial acquired his nickname of Stan the Man.[67] During the June 23 game against the Dodgers at Ebbets Field, St. Louis Post-Dispatch sportswriter Bob Broeg heard Dodger fans chanting whenever Musial came to bat, but could not understand the words.[67][72] Later that day over dinner, Broeg asked Cardinals traveling secretary Leo Ward if he had understood what the Dodger fans had been chanting.[67] Ward said, "Every time Stan came up they chanted, 'Here comes the man!'" "'That man,' you mean", Broeg said. "No, the man", replied Ward.[67] Broeg mentioned this story in his Post-Dispatch column, and Musial was thereafter known as Stan "The Man".[67]




Musial on the cover of Baseball Digest, September 1948


In June 1946, Dyer began to use Musial as a first baseman.[73] The Cardinals finished the season tied with the Dodgers,[74] prompting a three-game playoff for the pennant. Musial's Game 1 triple and Game 2 double contributed to the Cardinals' two-games-to-none series victory.[75] Facing the Boston Red Sox, the Cardinals won the 1946 World Series four games to three,[76] as Musial had six hits and four RBI.[77] He batted .365 for the season and won his second NL MVP Award, receiving 22 out of a possible 24 first-place votes, finishing ahead of Brooklyn's Dixie Walker (.319 batting average).[78]
Musial began the 1947 season by hitting .146 in April.[79] On May 9, team doctor Dr. Robert Hyland confirmed a previous diagnosis of appendicitis, while discovering that Musial was concurrently suffering from tonsillitis.[80] He received treatment, but did not have either his appendix or tonsils surgically removed until after the season ended.[81] Despite his health woes, he finished the year with a batting average of .312.[82]
Fully recovered from his ailments, Musial recorded his 1,000th career hit on April 25, 1948.[83] After a May 7 St. Louis Globe-Democrat article criticized baseball players for appearing in cigarette advertisements, he made a personal decision to never again appear in such ads.[84] By June 24, his batting average was .408, prompting Brooklyn pitcher Preacher Roe to comically announce his new method for retiring Musial: "Walk him on four pitches and pick him off first."[85] Given a mid-season pay raise by new Cardinals owner Robert E. Hannegan for his outstanding performance, Musial hit a home run in the All-Star Game.[86] On September 22, he registered five hits in a game for the fourth time in the season, tying a mark set by Ty Cobb in 1922.[87]


"He missed tying for the top in homers by one rained out home run. If it had counted, he would have won the Triple Crown that year...and in addition have been the only player of this century to lead the league in runs, hits, double, triples, and slugging percentage. What a year!"

—Sportswriter Bob Broeg, on Musial's 1948 season[88]
Musial finished the 1948 season leading the major leagues in batting average (.376), hits (230), doubles (46), triples (18), total bases (429), and slugging percentage (.702).[89] Winning the NL batting title by a 43-point margin, with an on-base percentage lead of 27 points and a 138-point slugging percentage margin—the latter being the largest gap since Rogers Hornsby's 1925 season—Musial became the first player to win three NL MVP awards.[89] If a home run he hit during a rained out game had been counted in his season totals, he would have won the Triple Crown by leading the NL in batting average, home runs, and runs batted in.[89][90]
Anticipating life after his baseball career, Musial began the first of several business partnerships with Julius "Biggie" Garagnani in January 1949, opening "Stan Musial & Biggie's" restaurant.[91][92] He approached the 1949 season with the intent to try to hit more home runs, stating he had hit 39 the previous season "without trying".[93] His new focus on hitting for power backfired, as pitchers began using the outside part of the plate to induce him to ground out to the first or second baseman.[93] Musial soon stopped focusing on hitting home runs and resumed his consistent offensive production by the end of May.[93] He received his sixth consecutive All-Star player selection and finished the season leading the NL in hits (207) while playing in every game.[94] However, the Cardinals, with 96 wins, finished one game behind the Dodgers.[95]
In the late 1940s, when baseball was slowly becoming integrated, Musial—along with his roommate Red Schoendienst—would be lauded by newcomers such as Dodgers' pitcher Don Newcombe for their tolerance. "They never...had the need to sit in the dugout and call a black guy a bunch of names", Newcombe said, "because he was trying to change the game and make it what it should have been in the first place, a game for all people."[96]
1950–54[edit]
Musial began the 1950s by posting a .350 batting average before participating in the 1950 All-Star Game, where in fan balloting he was the NL's number two choice.[97] He had the longest hitting streak of his career during the 1950 season—a 30-game stretch that ended on July 27.[97] With the Cardinals falling 14 games out of first place by September, manager Dyer used him at first base and all three outfield positions.[97][98] New Cardinals manager Marty Marion led the team to a third-place finish in 1951, while Musial was named The Sporting News Major League Player of the Year.[99]


"No man has ever been a perfect ballplayer. Stan Musial, however, is the closest to being perfect in the game today.... He plays as hard when his club is away out in front of a game as he does when they're just a run or two behind."

—Ty Cobb, on Musial in a 1952 Life magazine article[100]
National media attention inadvertently turned to Musial a month before the 1952 season began, after Ty Cobb wrote an article regarding modern baseball players that was published in Life magazine.[100] Cobb singled out Musial and Phil Rizzuto as the only players "who can be mentioned in the same breath with the oldtime greats".[100] Cobb went on to refer to Musial as "a better player than Joe DiMaggio was in his prime."[100] In response, Musial displayed his characteristic modesty, saying, "Cobb is baseball's greatest. I don't want to contradict him, but I can't say that I was ever as good as Joe DiMaggio."[100]
The only major league pitching appearance of Musial's career occurred as a publicity stunt during the last Cardinals home game of the 1952 season.[101][102] Manager Eddie Stanky had a reluctant Musial pitch to Frank Baumholtz, the runner-up to Musial for the best batting average in the NL that season.[101] With Baumholtz batting right-handed for the first time in his career, Musial's first pitch was hit so hard it ricocheted off the shin of third baseman Solly Hemus and into the left field corner.[101] The play was ruled an error, and Musial was embarrassed enough by his complicity in the gimmick to avoid pitching again for the remainder of his career.[101]
The Cardinals franchise was up for sale in early 1953, and Musial and Schoendienst advised their friend and fellow duck-hunter Gussie Busch to consider buying the team.[103] Busch used the resources of the Anheuser-Busch company to purchase the Cardinals, keeping Musial in St. Louis by averting the possibility of a move by the team to another city.[103][104] The 1953 season marked Musial's 10th NL All-Star selection, and the 12th consecutive time he finished a major league season with a batting average above .300.[46][105]
Musial accomplished another historical feat on May 2, 1954, in a doubleheader in St. Louis against the New York Giants: he hit three home runs in the first contest, then added two more in the second to become the first major leaguer to hit five home runs in a doubleheader.[106] In addition to his five home runs, he also hit a single in the first game, setting a new record of 21 total bases for a doubleheader.[106] The only player besides Musial to hit five home runs in a doubleheader is Nate Colbert, who achieved the feat in 1972.[107]
1955–59[edit]
Musial made his 12th NL All-Star appearance in 1955 as a reserve player, when Cincinnati's Ted Kluszewski outpolled him by 150,000 votes to get on the starting lineup at first base.[108] Musial entered the game as a pinch hitter in the fourth inning, and played left field as the game entered extra innings.[109] Leading off the bottom of the 12th, he hit a home run to give the NL a 6–5 victory.[109]




Musial in 1957


The 1956 season marked another milestone for Musial, when he broke Mel Ott's NL record for extra-base hits on August 12.[110] Earlier that season, Cardinals general manager "Trader Frank" Lane began negotiations to trade him for Philadelphia pitcher Robin Roberts.[111] When Cardinals owner Gussie Busch learned of the possible move, he made it clear that Musial was not available for any trade.[112] Instead, Lane dealt Musial's close friend Schoendienst to the New York Giants; an upset Musial made no immediate comment to the press.[113]
On June 11, 1957, Musial tied the NL record for consecutive games played with his 822nd, a streak that began on the last day of the 1951 season.[114] Despite ballot stuffing by Cincinnati Reds fans, he was selected and played in the All-Star Game held at Sportsman's Park.[115] When he overextended his swing while batting during a game on August 23, Musial fractured a bone in his left shoulder socket and tore muscles over his collarbone.[116] He was unable to play again until September 8, ending his consecutive games-played streak at 895.[116] He finished 1957 as Sports Illustrated's "Sportsman of the Year".[117]


"Line drive! Into left field! Hit number three thousand! A run has scored! Musial around first, on his way to second with a double. Holy Cow! He came through!"

—Harry Caray's radio play-by-play call of Musial's 3,000th major league hit[118]
Musial signed one of the first $100,000 contracts in NL history on January 29, 1958. (According to Baseball Almanac, Hank Greenberg was the first with Pittsburgh in 1947.)[119] He quickly demonstrated a return on the investment by sharing with Willie Mays the inaugural (and for the only time in Musial's career) NL Player of the Month in May (no such award was given in April until 1969) batting .374, with 4 HR, and 16 RBI. Also that month, as he was approaching the 3,000-hit milestone in his major league career, he expressed a desire to record the hit in St. Louis.[120] He ultimately reached the mark with a pinch-hit, sixth inning RBI double at Chicago's Wrigley Field on May 13.[121][122] The eighth major league player to reach 3,000 hits, and the first to reach the milestone with an extra-base hit, Musial was greeted at St. Louis Union Station that evening by roughly 1,000 fans.[123] Finishing the season in sixth place, the Cardinals embarked on an exhibition tour of Japan, winning 14 of 16 games against top players from the Central and Pacific Japanese Leagues.[124]
Taking a new approach to preparation for the 1959 season, Musial was given permission to report late to spring training so that he might conserve his energy for the duration of the year.[125] Musial, at 6 feet (180 cm) tall, had maintained a weight of around 175 pounds (79 kg) throughout his career. He reported to spring training approximately 10 pounds (4.5 kg) overweight and in substandard physical condition.[126][127] He began the season with one hit in 15 at-bats.[127] Despite his early offensive struggles, he single-handedly spoiled potential no-hitters on April 16 and 19.[127] A game-winning home run on May 7 made him the first major league player ever with 400 home runs and 3,000 hits.[127] As he continued to hit at a relatively low pace, his playing time was limited by Cardinals manager Solly Hemus at various points during the season.[128] Seeking more revenue for the players' pension fund, Major League Baseball held two All-Star games in a season for the first time through 1962.[129] Musial made his 16th All-Star appearance (16th season)[3] and pinch-hit in both contests, flying out in the July 7 game and drawing a walk in the August 3 game.[129] He finished the season with 115 regular game appearances, a .255 batting average, 37 runs, and a slugging percentage of .428.[46]
During the 1959 season, John F. Kennedy approached Musial about supporting Kennedy's campaign for President, citing their close ages. Musial campaigned for Kennedy later that year and became a supporter of the Democrat.[130]
On June 30, 1959, Musial was the batter in one of the oddest plays in baseball history. In a game between the Cardinals and Chicago Cubs, he was at the plate with a count of 3–1. Bob Anderson's next pitch was errant, evading catcher Sammy Taylor and rolling all the way to the backstop. Umpire Vic Delmore called ball four, even as Anderson and Taylor contended that Musial had foul tipped the ball. Because the ball was still in play and Delmore was embroiled in an argument with the catcher and pitcher, Musial kept running in attempt to make second base. Seeing that Musial was trying for second, Alvin Dark ran to the backstop to retrieve the ball. The ball wound up in the hands of field announcer Pat Pieper, but Dark ended up getting it back anyway. Absentmindedly, however, Delmore pulled out a new ball and gave it to Taylor. Anderson finally noticed that Musial was trying for second, took the new ball, and threw it to second baseman Tony Taylor. Anderson's throw flew over Taylor's head into the outfield. Dark, at the same time that Anderson threw the new ball, threw the original ball to shortstop Ernie Banks. Musial did not see Dark's throw and only noticed Anderson's ball fly over the second baseman's head, so he tried to go to third base. On his way there, he was tagged by Banks, and after a delay he was ruled out.[131]
1960–63[edit]
Based on his 1959 performance, Musial accepted a pay cut in 1960 from his previous $100,000 salary to $80,000.[132] He was eager to prove that his mediocre performance was the result of improper physical conditioning, and he enlisted the help of Walter Eberhardt, Saint Louis University's director of physical education.[133] In June 1960, newspaper articles began speculating that Musial would soon retire, yet he finished the season with a .275 batting average.[46][134] He addressed the speculation in September, confirming that he would play again in 1961. His .288 batting average that season reaffirmed his decision.[46][135] In 1962, Musial posted a .330 batting average, good for third in the batting race, with 19 homers and 82 RBI. As a pinch-hitter, he had 14 base hits in 19 at-bats (.737).[136] Along the way, he established new NL career marks for hits, RBI, and runs scored. That same year on July 8, the 41-year-old Musial became the oldest player ever to hit three home runs in one game.





Stan Musial's number 6 was retired by the St. Louis Cardinals in 1963.


The Cardinals began 1963 by winning 10 of their first 15 games, as Musial posted a .237 batting average.[137] He set a new major league record for career extra-base hits on May 8 and improved his batting average to .277 by the end of the month.[138] Making his 20th All-Star appearance[3] and 24th All-Star Game appearance on July 9, 1963, he pinch-hit in the fifth inning.[138] Asked by general manager Bing Devine on July 26 what his plans were, Musial said that he would retire at season's end.[139] He waited until the Cardinals team picnic on August 12 to publicly announce his decision, hopeful he could retire on a winning note.[140]
Musial became a grandfather for the first time in the early hours of September 10; later that day, he hit a home run in his first at-bat.[141] After sweeping a doubleheader on September 15, the Cardinals had won 19 of their last 20 games, and were one game behind the Los Angeles Dodgers.[141] The Dodgers then swept the Cardinals in a three-game series in St. Louis and clinched the NL pennant on September 25.[142] Musial's last game, on September 29, 1963, was preceded by an hour-long retirement ceremony.[143] Speakers at the event included baseball commissioner Ford Frick, Cardinals broadcaster Harry Caray, and Cardinals owner Gussie Busch, who announced that Musial's uniform number "6" would be retired by the team.[143] During the game, Musial recorded a single in the fourth inning, then hit a single to right field that scored teammate Curt Flood in the sixth.[144] Cardinals manager Johnny Keane brought in Gary Kolb as a pinch-runner for Musial, bringing his major league career to an end.[144] Just as he had recorded two base hits in his major league debut, Musial finished his last game with two hits, as well.[144] Musial finished with the all-time National League hits record and second to only Ty Cobb on the all-time Major League list. Musial's last career hit was out of reach of Cincinnati Reds second baseman Pete Rose, who would go on to break Cobb's record to become baseball's all-time hit king.


"All Musial represents is more than two decades of sustained excellence and complete decency as a human being."

—Broadcaster Bob Costas, on Musial[35]
At the time of his retirement, Musial held or shared 17 major league records, 29 NL records, and nine All-Star Game records.[145] Among those records, he ranked as the major league career leader in extra-base hits (1,377) and total bases (6,134).[144] He also held NL career marks in categories such as hits (3,630), games played (3,026), doubles (725), and RBI (1,951).[144] He finished his career with 475 home runs despite never having led the NL in the category.[144] Jerry Lansche speculates Musial would likely have become the second player, after Babe Ruth, with 2,000 RBI, and would have exceeded 500 career home runs had he not served in the military.[146] His lowest full season RBI output before the war was 72 (in 1942) and as he needed only 49 RBI to reach 2,000 for his full career, he certainly would have exceeded 2,000 RBI by playing without injury in 1945. His home run production is a different story and it is highly unlikely he would have reached 500. He did not hit more than 13 home runs in any season before he entered the navy and did not hit as many as 25 (the number he would have needed to become a 500 career homer club member) until 1948, 3 years after returning to baseball from World War II. His career hit total was evenly split between 1,815 hits at home and 1,815 hits on the road.[36] Steven R. Bullock speculates that it is possible that without military service Musial might have continued playing to attempt to exceed Ty Cobb's career hit record of 4,191.[146] Even if Musial had hit safely 207 times (the average of his hits in the 2 years before and the 2 years after his service in the navy) in 1945, he still would have been 354 hits short of tying Ty. His hit total in his last season at age 42 was only 86; even if he could have had 103 hits a season (the average of his last 5 seasons) he would have had to play to age 47 to attain the hits record.
He was the first major league player to appear in more than 1,000 games at two different positions, registering 1,896 games in the outfield and 1,016 at first base.[147] Since Musial's retirement in 1963, Tony Gwynn has been the only player to finish his career with a higher lifetime batting average. Hank Aaron has been the only player to surpass his record of 6,134 total bases.
In Musial's 3,026 major league appearances, he was never ejected from a game.[148] Speaking about his quiet reputation within the sport's history, sportscaster Bob Costas said, "He didn't hit a homer in his last at-bat; he hit a single. He didn't hit in 56 straight games. He married his high school sweetheart and stayed married to her. ... All Musial represents is more than two decades of sustained excellence and complete decency as a human being."[35]
Post-playing career and family life[edit]
Musial was named a vice president of the St. Louis Cardinals in September 1963, and he remained in that position until after the 1966 season.[149] From February 1964 to January 1967, he also served as President Lyndon Johnson's physical fitness adviser, a part-time position created to promote better fitness among American citizens.[150] Before the 1967 season began, the Cardinals named Musial the team's general manager, and he oversaw the club's World Series championship that year.[149] He won the allegiance of Cardinals players by making fair offers from the outset of player-contract negotiations and creating an in-stadium babysitting service so players' wives could attend games.[151] His longtime business partner Biggie Garagnani died in June 1967, prompting Musial to devote more time to managing his restaurant and other business interests.[152] He came to realize that the detail-oriented desk job was not his forte. He consequently decided to step down as general manager, before even completing a full year on the job.[152]
Musial—like Phil Linz—was noted for his harmonica playing, which included his rendition of "Take Me Out to the Ball Game".[153] Through the 1990s, he frequently played the harmonica at public gatherings, such as the annual Baseball Hall of Fame induction ceremony and various charity events.[154] He performed on the television show Hee Haw and in 1994 recorded 18 songs that were sold in tandem with a harmonica-playing instruction booklet.[154]
Even though Musial left Donora after high school, he retained close ties to the town throughout the rest of his life. He maintained membership in local social clubs, and regularly sent a local doctor boxes of autographed baseballs, with the town's mayor using some for United Way fundraising.[155] Musial also gave free meals at the restaurant he owned in St. Louis to any customers who presented valid ID proving they were Donora residents.[156]
Musial met Lillian Susan Labash, the daughter of a local grocer,[155] in Donora when both were 15, and married her in St. Paul's Catholic Church in Daytona Beach, Florida on May 25, 1940. They had four children: son Richard, and daughters Gerry, Janet, and Jeanie.[148][157] Lillian Musial died at 91, on May 3, 2012; their marriage had lasted for almost 72 years.[158] In his final years, Musial suffered from Alzheimer's disease.
Honors and recognition[edit]


"Here stands baseball's perfect warrior. Here stands baseball's perfect knight."

—Quote inscribed on the base of Musial's statue, attributed to former commissioner Ford Frick[159]
On August 4, 1968, a statue of Musial was erected outside of Busch Memorial Stadium on the northeast grounds of the St. Louis stadium.[152] The statue was moved from its original location to the west side of the new Busch Stadium for its first season in 2006, where it became a popular meeting place for generations of Cardinals fans.[160] Musial's statue is inscribed with a quote attributed to former baseball commissioner Ford Frick: "Here stands baseball's perfect warrior. Here stands baseball's perfect knight."[152]
Musial was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility in 1969, when he was named on 93.2 percent of the ballots.[161] On June 14, 1973 he was the first inductee into the National Polish-American Hall of Fame, housed at St. Mary's College in Orchard Lake, Michigan. In 1989, he was inducted into the St. Louis Walk of Fame.[162] Five years later, a baseball field was named after him in his hometown of Donora.[163] He was ranked tenth on The Sporting News' list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players published in 1998.[164] He was also one of the 30 players selected to the Major League Baseball All-Century Team, added by a special committee after he finished 11th in fan voting among outfielders.[165] In 2000, he was inducted into the Hall of Famous Missourians, and a bronze bust depicting him is on permanent display in the rotunda of the Missouri State Capitol.[166] In January, 2014, the Cardinals announced Musial among 22 former players and personnel to be inducted into the St. Louis Cardinals Hall of Fame Museum for the inaugural class of 2014.[167]




President Barack Obama awards the 2010 Presidential Medal of Freedom to Stan Musial in a ceremony in the East Room of the White House February 15, 2011.


Nearly two decades after Musial retired, baseball statistician Bill James and the sabermetrics movement began providing new ways of comparing players across baseball history.[168] In 2001, James ranked Musial the tenth-greatest baseball player in history, and the second-best left fielder of all time.[169] According to Baseball-Reference.com, he ranks fifth all-time among hitters on the Black Ink Test, and third all-time on the Gray Ink Test—measures designed to compare players of different eras.[46][170] He ranks first on Baseball-Reference's Hall of Fame Monitor Test, and is tied for second in the Hall of Fame Career Standards Test.[46] Despite his statistical accomplishments, he is sometimes referred to as the most underrated or overlooked athlete in modern American sports history.[171][172] For instance, in his analysis of baseball's under- and overrated players in 2007, sportswriter Jayson Stark said, "I can't think of any all-time great in any sport who gets left out of more who's-the-greatest conversations than Stan Musial."[171]
Musial threw out the first pitch in the fifth game of the 2006 World Series and delivered the ceremonial first pitch ball to President Barack Obama at the 2009 Major League Baseball All-Star Game.[173] A "Stan the Man" day was held in his honor by the Cardinals on May 18, 2008.[174] In 2010, another one of the Cardinals' greatest sluggers, Albert Pujols, whose nickname was "El Hombre", said he didn't want to be called "The Man", even in Spanish, because "There is one man that gets that respect, and that is Stan Musial." [96] Also in 2010, the Cardinals launched a campaign to build support for awarding Musial the Presidential Medal of Freedom for his lifetime of achievement and service.[175] The campaign realized its goal, and on February 15, 2011, Musial was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Barack Obama[176][177] who called him "an icon untarnished, a beloved pillar of the community, a gentleman you'd want your kids to emulate."[178]
On October 17, 2012, Musial made his final appearance at Busch Stadium, riding in a golf cart around the warning track before Game 4 of the National League Championship Series. Musial stopped at both dugouts and greeted San Francisco Giants manager Bruce Bochy and Cardinals manager Mike Matheny. The Cardinals would go on to win Game 4 by a score of 8-3, but lost the pennant to the eventual World Series champion Giants.

Death[edit]
On January 19, 2013, Musial died at age 92 of natural causes at his home in Ladue, Missouri, on the same day that fellow MLB Hall of Fame inductee Earl Weaver passed away.[181][182] Musial was surrounded by his family as he died peacefully. Cardinals owner Bill DeWitt, Jr. released the following statement:

We have lost the most beloved member of the Cardinals family. Stan Musial was the greatest player in Cardinals history and one of the best players in the history of baseball. The entire Cardinals organization extends its sincere condolences to Stan's family, including his children Richard, Gerry, Janet and Jean, as well as his eleven grandchildren and twelve great grandchildren. We join fans everywhere in mourning the loss of our dear friend and reflect on how fortunate we all are to have known 'Stan the Man'.[183]

Upon hearing the news of his death, fans gathered and began an impromptu memorial at his statue outside Busch Stadium; the Cardinals issued a release saying the memorial would be left in place for some time.[184] In a laudatory obituary, The New York Times quoted famed New York manager Leo Durocher: "There is only one way to pitch to Musial—under the plate."[185]
Missouri Governor Jay Nixon commented: "Stan Musial was a great American hero who—with the utmost humility—inspired us all to aim high and dream big. The world is emptier today without him, but far better to have known him. The legacy of 'baseball's perfect warrior' will endure and inspire generations to come."[186]
St. Louis Mayor Francis Slay tweeted: "Sad as we are, we are fortunate to have had Stan in STL for so long, and are also glad that Stan and Lil are together again." He ordered flags at half-mast in the city.[187]
"Major League Baseball has lost one of its true legends in Stan Musial, a Hall of Famer in every sense and a man who led a great American life", Commissioner Bud Selig said. "He was the heart and soul of the historic St. Louis Cardinals franchise for generations, and he served his country during World War II. A recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2011, Stan's life embodies baseball's unparalleled history and why this game is the national pastime."[188]
Thousands of fans braved cold temperatures on January 24 for a public visitation at the Cathedral Basilica of Saint Louis, where Musial lay in state, dressed in his trademark cardinal-red blazer and with a harmonica in his lapel pocket, flanked by a Navy honor guard. A private funeral Mass was held on Saturday, January 26, 2013, at the New Cathedral in St. Louis, televised locally by KTVI and KPLR as well as Fox Sports Midwest on pay-television. New York's Cardinal Timothy Dolan, who in his first episcopal post served as an auxiliary bishop of the Archdiocese of Saint Louis, was the principal celebrant, and Knoxville's Bishop Richard F. Stika, Musial's former parish priest, was the homilist.[189] Bob Costas gave the principal eulogy, calling him "the genuine hero who as the years and decades passed, and disillusionment came from other directions, never once let us down", and quoting fellow Cooperstown honoree Mickey Mantle, who once said that Musial "was a better player than me because he was a better man than me".[190] Following the funeral, Musial's family led a procession from the New Cathedral to Busch Stadium, where they laid a memorial wreath at his statue. Once the wreath was placed and Musial's family began to walk back to their vehicles, the hundreds of Cardinal fans gathered for the wreath ceremony gave both Musial and his family one final salute. That salute was the fans singing "Take Me Out to the Ball Game" before Musial was taken to his final place of rest.
Musial was the last living member of the Cardinals team that won the 1942 World Series. At the time of his death, no living players had played on an earlier World Series-winning team.
The Stan Musial Veterans Memorial Bridge in St. Louis (carries  I‑70) was built in his memorial.
Legacy[edit]
As a reflection of his popularity, Musial has had infrastructure named after him. In May 2011 the Pennsylvania State Senate changed the name of the bridge that carries the C. Vance Deicas Memorial Highway (S.R. 1077) over the Monongahela River from Donora-Monessen Bridge to Stan Musial Bridge after Musial who was a native of the area.[191] In October 2013 the St. Louis Fire Department started operating a fireboat named after Musial.[192] In July 2013, the new Interstate 70 bridge over the Mississippi River between Illinois and Missouri at St. Louis received the official name of "Stan Musial Veterans Memorial Bridge"[193]

Stanley Frank Musial (/ˈmjuːziəl/ or /ˈmjuːʒəl/; born Stanisław Franciszek Musiał; November 21, 1920 – January 19, 2013), nicknamed Stan the Man, was an American Major League Baseball (MLB) outfielder and first baseman. He spent 22 seasons playing for the St. Louis Cardinals, from 1941 to 1944 and 1946 to 1963. Widely considered to be one of the greatest and most consistent hitters in baseball history,[1] Musial was a first-ballot inductee into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1969, and was also selected to the St. Louis Cardinals Hall of Fame in the inaugural class of 2014.
Musial batted .331 over the course of his career and set National League (NL) records for career hits (3,630), runs batted in (1,951), games played (3,026), at bats (10,972), runs scored (1,949) and doubles (725), his 475 career home runs then ranked second in NL history behind Mel Ott's total of 511. His 6,134 total bases remained a major league record until surpassed by Hank Aaron, and his hit total still ranks fourth all-time, and is the highest by any player who spent his career with only one team. A seven-time batting champion with identical totals of 1,815 hits at home and 1,815 hits on the road, he was named the National League's (NL) Most Valuable Player (MVP) three times and led St. Louis to three World Series championships. He also shares the major league record for the most All-Star Games played (24) with Hank Aaron and Willie Mays.[a] [2]
Musial was born in Donora, Pennsylvania, where he frequently played baseball informally or in organized settings, and eventually played on the baseball team at Donora High School. Signed to a professional contract by the St. Louis Cardinals as a pitcher in 1938, Musial was converted into an outfielder prior to his major league debut in 1941. Noted for his unique batting stance, he quickly established himself as a consistent and productive hitter. In his first full season, 1942, the Cardinals won the World Series. The following year, he led the NL in six different offensive categories and earned his first MVP award. He was also named to the NL All-Star squad for the first time; he appeared in every All-Star game in every subsequent season he played.[3] Musial won his second World Series championship in 1944, then missed the entire 1945 season while serving in the Navy.
After completing his military service during the war, Musial returned to baseball in 1946 and resumed his consistent hitting. That year he earned his second MVP award and third World Series title. His third MVP award came in 1948, when he finished one home run short of winning baseball's Triple Crown. After struggling offensively in 1959, Musial used a personal trainer to help maintain his productivity until he decided to retire in 1963. At the time of his retirement, he held or shared 17 major league records, 29 National League records, and nine All-Star Game records. Ironically, in 1964, the season following his retirement, the Cardinals went on to defeat the New York Yankees in an epic 7-game clash, for St. Louis' first World Series championship in nearly two decades (a team which included future Hall of Famer Lou Brock performing what would have likely been Musial's left field duties).[4] In addition to overseeing businesses, such as a restaurant both before and after his playing career, Musial served as the Cardinals' general manager in 1967, winning the pennant and World Series, then quitting that position. He also became noted for his harmonica playing, a skill he acquired during his playing career. Known for his modesty and sportsmanship, Musial was selected for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team in 1999. In February 2011, President Barack Obama presented Musial with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, one of the highest civilian awards that can be bestowed on a person by the United States government.

Early life[edit]
Musial was born in Donora, Pennsylvania, the fifth of the six children (four girls and two boys) of Lukasz and Mary (Lancos) Musiał (/ˈmuːʃaʊ/, MOO-show).[5] His mother was of Carpatho-Rusyn descent and his father was a Polish immigrant who chose the name Stanisław Franciszek for his first son, though his father always referred to Musial using the Polish nickname Stasiu, pronounced "Stashu".[5][6] Musial frequently played baseball with his brother Ed and other friends during his childhood, and considered Lefty Grove his favorite ballplayer.[7][8] Musial also had the benefit of learning about baseball from his neighbor Joe Barbao, a former minor league pitcher.[9] When he enrolled in school, his name was formally changed to Stanley Frank Musial.[5]
At age 15 Musial joined the Donora Zincs, a semi-professional team managed by Barbao.[10] In his Zincs debut he pitched 6 innings and struck out 13 batters, all of them adults.[10] Musial also played one season on the newly revived Donora High School baseball team, where one of his teammates was Buddy Griffey, father of MLB player Ken Griffey, Sr. and grandfather to Ken Griffey, Jr.[11][12] Baseball statistician Bill James described the younger Griffey, in comparison to Musial, as "the second-best left-handed hitting, left-handed throwing outfielder ever born in Donora, Pennsylvania, on November 21."[13] His exploits as a rising player in Pennsylvania earned him the nickname "The Donora Greyhound".[14]
Musial also played basketball and was offered an athletic scholarship in that sport by the University of Pittsburgh.[10][15] Meanwhile, the St. Louis Cardinals had scouted Musial as a pitcher and, in 1937, offered him a professional contract after a workout with their Class D Penn State League affiliate.[16] Musial's father initially resisted the idea of his son pursuing a baseball career, but reluctantly gave his consent after lobbying by both Musial and his mother.[17] Musial also credited his school librarian Helen Kloz for pointing out that baseball was his dream and advising him to pursue it professionally.[17] In what was then a common practice, the Cardinals did not file the contract with the baseball commissioner's office until June 1938. This preserved Musial's amateur eligibility, and he was still able to participate in high school sports, leading Donora High School's basketball team to a playoff appearance.[18] He then reported to the Cardinals' Class D affiliate in West Virginia, the Williamson Red Birds.[19][20]
Professional baseball career[edit]
Minor leagues (1938–41)[edit]
Musial's rookie year with Williamson in 1938 was a period of adjustment both on and off the field. He began gaining more in-depth knowledge about baseball strategy[21] while posting a 6–6 win–loss record and a 4.66 earned run average (ERA), to go along with a .258 batting average.[22] Off the field, he experienced feelings of homesickness while learning to live comfortably and independently on his $65-per-month salary.[21] Musial finished his high school education before returning to Williamson in spring 1939. That season his numbers improved to a 9–2 record, a 4.30 ERA, and a .352 batting average.[23][24]
Musial spent the 1940 season with the Cardinals' other Class D team, the Daytona Beach Islanders, where he developed a lifelong friendship with manager Dickie Kerr.[25] His pitching skills improved under the guidance of Kerr, who also recognized his hitting talent, playing him in the outfield between pitching starts.[26] On May 25, 1940, Musial married fellow Donora resident, Lillian "Lil" Labash, in Daytona Beach, and the couple's first child followed in August.[27] During late August, Musial suffered a shoulder injury while playing in the outfield, and later made an early exit as the starting pitcher in a 12–5 playoff game loss.[28] For a while Musial considered leaving baseball entirely, complaining that he could not afford to support himself and his wife on the $16 a week pay. Kerr talked him out of it, and even took the Musials into his own home to relieve the financial burden. To repay the debt Musial bought Kerr a $20,000 home in Houston in 1958.[29] In 113 games in 1940 he hit .311, while compiling an 18–5 pitching record that included 176 strikeouts and 145 walks.[30][31]
Musial was assigned to the Class AA Columbus Red Birds to begin 1941, though manager, Burt Shotton, and Musial himself quickly realized that the previous year's injury had considerably weakened his arm.[32] He was reassigned to the Class C Springfield Cardinals as a full-time outfielder, and he later credited manager Ollie Vanek for displaying confidence in his hitting ability.[33] During 87 games with Springfield, Musial hit a league-leading .379 before being promoted to the Rochester Red Wings of the International League.[34] He was noted for his unique batting stance, a crouch in which his back was seemingly square to the pitcher.[35] This stance was later described by pitcher Ted Lyons as "a kid peeking around the corner to see if the cops were coming".[36] According to a 1950 description by author Tom Meany, "The bent knees and the crouch give him the appearance of a coiled spring, although most pitchers think of him as a coiled rattlesnake."[37] Musial continued to play well in Rochester—in one three-game stretch, he had 11 hits. He was called up to the Cardinals for the last two weeks of the 1941 season.[38]
Major leagues (1941–44)[edit]




Musial's statue outside of Busch Stadium captures his signature batting stance.


Musial made his major league debut during the second game of a doubleheader at Sportsman's Park on September 17, 1941.[39] The Cardinals were in the midst of a pennant race with the Brooklyn Dodgers; in 12 games, Musial collected 20 hits for a .426 batting average.[40] Despite Musial's late contributions, the Cardinals finished two and one-half games behind the 100-game-winning Dodgers.[41]
Cardinals manager Billy Southworth used Musial as a left fielder to begin 1942, sometimes lifting him for a pinch-hitter against left-handed pitching.[42] Musial was hitting .315 by late June,[43] as the Cardinals resumed battling the Dodgers for first place in the National League (NL).[44] The Cardinals took sole possession of first place on September 13, and when Musial caught a fly ball to end the first game of a doubleheader on September 27 they clinched the pennant with their 105th win.[45] He finished the season with a .315 batting average and 72 runs batted in (RBI) in 140 games. Musial received national publicity when he was named by St. Louis Post-Dispatch sports editor J. Roy Stockton as his choice for Rookie of the Year in a Saturday Evening Post article.[46][47]
The Cardinals played the American League champion New York Yankees in the 1942 World Series.[48] Representing the winning run at home plate in the bottom of the ninth inning of Game 1 at Sportsman's Park, Musial grounded out with the bases loaded to end the game .[49] Musial's first hit of the Series was an RBI single that provided the margin of victory in Game 2, allowing the Cardinals to tie the Series.[50] Over the next three games at Yankee Stadium, Musial had three more hits as the Cardinals defeated the Yankees in the Series four games to one.[51] Musial batted .222 for the Series, with two runs scored.[52]
Musial's 1943 season started with a brief contract holdout in spring training.[53] He made the National League All-Star team for the first time as a starting left fielder and got a double in the All-Star Game on July 13.[53] He finished the season leading the major leagues in hitting with a .357 batting average and led the NL in hits (220), doubles (48), triples (20), total bases (347), on-base percentage (.425), and slugging percentage (.562).[54] This performance earned him his first NL Most Valuable Player Award, ahead of teammate and catcher Walker Cooper (.318 batting average).[54] After romping to another NL pennant by 18 games, the Cardinals again faced the Yankees in the 1943 World Series.[55] Musial had a single in the Cardinals' Game 1 loss, and scored a run in a Game 2 win.[55] The Cardinals did not win another game in the Series, but the loser's bonus share paid to each Cardinals player ($4,321.99) still amounted to nearly two-thirds of Musial's regular season salary.[56]
United States involvement in World War II began to impinge on Musial's baseball career in 1944, as he underwent a physical examination in prelude to possible service in the armed forces.[57] He ultimately remained with the Cardinals for the entire season, posting a .347 batting average with 197 hits.[58][59] The Cardinals claimed the NL pennant for the third consecutive season, and faced St. Louis's other major league team, the Browns, in the 1944 World Series.[60] The Browns took a 2–1 lead, while Musial hit .250 with zero RBI.[61] He broke out in Game 4 with a two-run home run, single, double, and a walk as part of a 5–1 Cardinals win.[61] The Cardinals went on to defeat the Browns in six games, and Musial posted a .304 batting average for the Series.[62][63]
Sojourn in the U.S. Navy (1945–46)[edit]
Musial enlisted in the United States Navy on January 23, 1945, during World War II. He was initially assigned to noncombat duty at the Naval Training Station in Bainbridge, Maryland.[64] In June 1945, he was assigned to Special Services in Hawaii, and was assigned to a ferry launch unit to bring back damaged ship crews entering Pearl Harbor where he was able to play baseball every afternoon in the naval base's eight-team league.[65] After being granted emergency leave to see his ailing father in January 1946, he was briefly assigned to the Philadelphia Navy Yard before his honorable discharge from the Navy as a Seaman Second Class in March 1946.[65][66]
In 2007, Musial received the Navy Memorial's Lone Sailor Award, which honors Navy veterans who have excelled in civilian life.

"Every time Stan came up they chanted, 'Here comes the man!'"

—Cardinals traveling secretary Leo Ward relates Dodger fans' nickname for Musial to sportswriter Bob Broeg[67]
Rejoining the Cardinals under new manager Eddie Dyer, Musial posted a .388 batting average by the middle of May 1946.[68] He also became close friends with new teammate Red Schoendienst, who had joined the Cardinals during Musial's absence in 1945.[69] During the season, Musial (who was under contract to the Cardinals for $13,500 in 1946) was offered a five-year, $125,000 contract, plus a $50,000 bonus, to join the Mexican League.[70] He declined the offer, and after manager Dyer spoke to club owner Sam Breadon, Musial was given a $5,000 raise later in 1946.[71]
It was also during the 1946 season that Musial acquired his nickname of Stan the Man.[67] During the June 23 game against the Dodgers at Ebbets Field, St. Louis Post-Dispatch sportswriter Bob Broeg heard Dodger fans chanting whenever Musial came to bat, but could not understand the words.[67][72] Later that day over dinner, Broeg asked Cardinals traveling secretary Leo Ward if he had understood what the Dodger fans had been chanting.[67] Ward said, "Every time Stan came up they chanted, 'Here comes the man!'" "'That man,' you mean", Broeg said. "No, the man", replied Ward.[67] Broeg mentioned this story in his Post-Dispatch column, and Musial was thereafter known as Stan "The Man".[67]




Musial on the cover of Baseball Digest, September 1948


In June 1946, Dyer began to use Musial as a first baseman.[73] The Cardinals finished the season tied with the Dodgers,[74] prompting a three-game playoff for the pennant. Musial's Game 1 triple and Game 2 double contributed to the Cardinals' two-games-to-none series victory.[75] Facing the Boston Red Sox, the Cardinals won the 1946 World Series four games to three,[76] as Musial had six hits and four RBI.[77] He batted .365 for the season and won his second NL MVP Award, receiving 22 out of a possible 24 first-place votes, finishing ahead of Brooklyn's Dixie Walker (.319 batting average).[78]
Musial began the 1947 season by hitting .146 in April.[79] On May 9, team doctor Dr. Robert Hyland confirmed a previous diagnosis of appendicitis, while discovering that Musial was concurrently suffering from tonsillitis.[80] He received treatment, but did not have either his appendix or tonsils surgically removed until after the season ended.[81] Despite his health woes, he finished the year with a batting average of .312.[82]
Fully recovered from his ailments, Musial recorded his 1,000th career hit on April 25, 1948.[83] After a May 7 St. Louis Globe-Democrat article criticized baseball players for appearing in cigarette advertisements, he made a personal decision to never again appear in such ads.[84] By June 24, his batting average was .408, prompting Brooklyn pitcher Preacher Roe to comically announce his new method for retiring Musial: "Walk him on four pitches and pick him off first."[85] Given a mid-season pay raise by new Cardinals owner Robert E. Hannegan for his outstanding performance, Musial hit a home run in the All-Star Game.[86] On September 22, he registered five hits in a game for the fourth time in the season, tying a mark set by Ty Cobb in 1922.[87]


"He missed tying for the top in homers by one rained out home run. If it had counted, he would have won the Triple Crown that year...and in addition have been the only player of this century to lead the league in runs, hits, double, triples, and slugging percentage. What a year!"

—Sportswriter Bob Broeg, on Musial's 1948 season[88]
Musial finished the 1948 season leading the major leagues in batting average (.376), hits (230), doubles (46), triples (18), total bases (429), and slugging percentage (.702).[89] Winning the NL batting title by a 43-point margin, with an on-base percentage lead of 27 points and a 138-point slugging percentage margin—the latter being the largest gap since Rogers Hornsby's 1925 season—Musial became the first player to win three NL MVP awards.[89] If a home run he hit during a rained out game had been counted in his season totals, he would have won the Triple Crown by leading the NL in batting average, home runs, and runs batted in.[89][90]
Anticipating life after his baseball career, Musial began the first of several business partnerships with Julius "Biggie" Garagnani in January 1949, opening "Stan Musial & Biggie's" restaurant.[91][92] He approached the 1949 season with the intent to try to hit more home runs, stating he had hit 39 the previous season "without trying".[93] His new focus on hitting for power backfired, as pitchers began using the outside part of the plate to induce him to ground out to the first or second baseman.[93] Musial soon stopped focusing on hitting home runs and resumed his consistent offensive production by the end of May.[93] He received his sixth consecutive All-Star player selection and finished the season leading the NL in hits (207) while playing in every game.[94] However, the Cardinals, with 96 wins, finished one game behind the Dodgers.[95]
In the late 1940s, when baseball was slowly becoming integrated, Musial—along with his roommate Red Schoendienst—would be lauded by newcomers such as Dodgers' pitcher Don Newcombe for their tolerance. "They never...had the need to sit in the dugout and call a black guy a bunch of names", Newcombe said, "because he was trying to change the game and make it what it should have been in the first place, a game for all people."[96]
1950–54[edit]
Musial began the 1950s by posting a .350 batting average before participating in the 1950 All-Star Game, where in fan balloting he was the NL's number two choice.[97] He had the longest hitting streak of his career during the 1950 season—a 30-game stretch that ended on July 27.[97] With the Cardinals falling 14 games out of first place by September, manager Dyer used him at first base and all three outfield positions.[97][98] New Cardinals manager Marty Marion led the team to a third-place finish in 1951, while Musial was named The Sporting News Major League Player of the Year.[99]


"No man has ever been a perfect ballplayer. Stan Musial, however, is the closest to being perfect in the game today.... He plays as hard when his club is away out in front of a game as he does when they're just a run or two behind."

—Ty Cobb, on Musial in a 1952 Life magazine article[100]
National media attention inadvertently turned to Musial a month before the 1952 season began, after Ty Cobb wrote an article regarding modern baseball players that was published in Life magazine.[100] Cobb singled out Musial and Phil Rizzuto as the only players "who can be mentioned in the same breath with the oldtime greats".[100] Cobb went on to refer to Musial as "a better player than Joe DiMaggio was in his prime."[100] In response, Musial displayed his characteristic modesty, saying, "Cobb is baseball's greatest. I don't want to contradict him, but I can't say that I was ever as good as Joe DiMaggio."[100]
The only major league pitching appearance of Musial's career occurred as a publicity stunt during the last Cardinals home game of the 1952 season.[101][102] Manager Eddie Stanky had a reluctant Musial pitch to Frank Baumholtz, the runner-up to Musial for the best batting average in the NL that season.[101] With Baumholtz batting right-handed for the first time in his career, Musial's first pitch was hit so hard it ricocheted off the shin of third baseman Solly Hemus and into the left field corner.[101] The play was ruled an error, and Musial was embarrassed enough by his complicity in the gimmick to avoid pitching again for the remainder of his career.[101]
The Cardinals franchise was up for sale in early 1953, and Musial and Schoendienst advised their friend and fellow duck-hunter Gussie Busch to consider buying the team.[103] Busch used the resources of the Anheuser-Busch company to purchase the Cardinals, keeping Musial in St. Louis by averting the possibility of a move by the team to another city.[103][104] The 1953 season marked Musial's 10th NL All-Star selection, and the 12th consecutive time he finished a major league season with a batting average above .300.[46][105]
Musial accomplished another historical feat on May 2, 1954, in a doubleheader in St. Louis against the New York Giants: he hit three home runs in the first contest, then added two more in the second to become the first major leaguer to hit five home runs in a doubleheader.[106] In addition to his five home runs, he also hit a single in the first game, setting a new record of 21 total bases for a doubleheader.[106] The only player besides Musial to hit five home runs in a doubleheader is Nate Colbert, who achieved the feat in 1972.[107]
1955–59[edit]
Musial made his 12th NL All-Star appearance in 1955 as a reserve player, when Cincinnati's Ted Kluszewski outpolled him by 150,000 votes to get on the starting lineup at first base.[108] Musial entered the game as a pinch hitter in the fourth inning, and played left field as the game entered extra innings.[109] Leading off the bottom of the 12th, he hit a home run to give the NL a 6–5 victory.[109]




Musial in 1957


The 1956 season marked another milestone for Musial, when he broke Mel Ott's NL record for extra-base hits on August 12.[110] Earlier that season, Cardinals general manager "Trader Frank" Lane began negotiations to trade him for Philadelphia pitcher Robin Roberts.[111] When Cardinals owner Gussie Busch learned of the possible move, he made it clear that Musial was not available for any trade.[112] Instead, Lane dealt Musial's close friend Schoendienst to the New York Giants; an upset Musial made no immediate comment to the press.[113]
On June 11, 1957, Musial tied the NL record for consecutive games played with his 822nd, a streak that began on the last day of the 1951 season.[114] Despite ballot stuffing by Cincinnati Reds fans, he was selected and played in the All-Star Game held at Sportsman's Park.[115] When he overextended his swing while batting during a game on August 23, Musial fractured a bone in his left shoulder socket and tore muscles over his collarbone.[116] He was unable to play again until September 8, ending his consecutive games-played streak at 895.[116] He finished 1957 as Sports Illustrated's "Sportsman of the Year".[117]


"Line drive! Into left field! Hit number three thousand! A run has scored! Musial around first, on his way to second with a double. Holy Cow! He came through!"

—Harry Caray's radio play-by-play call of Musial's 3,000th major league hit[118]
Musial signed one of the first $100,000 contracts in NL history on January 29, 1958. (According to Baseball Almanac, Hank Greenberg was the first with Pittsburgh in 1947.)[119] He quickly demonstrated a return on the investment by sharing with Willie Mays the inaugural (and for the only time in Musial's career) NL Player of the Month in May (no such award was given in April until 1969) batting .374, with 4 HR, and 16 RBI. Also that month, as he was approaching the 3,000-hit milestone in his major league career, he expressed a desire to record the hit in St. Louis.[120] He ultimately reached the mark with a pinch-hit, sixth inning RBI double at Chicago's Wrigley Field on May 13.[121][122] The eighth major league player to reach 3,000 hits, and the first to reach the milestone with an extra-base hit, Musial was greeted at St. Louis Union Station that evening by roughly 1,000 fans.[123] Finishing the season in sixth place, the Cardinals embarked on an exhibition tour of Japan, winning 14 of 16 games against top players from the Central and Pacific Japanese Leagues.[124]
Taking a new approach to preparation for the 1959 season, Musial was given permission to report late to spring training so that he might conserve his energy for the duration of the year.[125] Musial, at 6 feet (180 cm) tall, had maintained a weight of around 175 pounds (79 kg) throughout his career. He reported to spring training approximately 10 pounds (4.5 kg) overweight and in substandard physical condition.[126][127] He began the season with one hit in 15 at-bats.[127] Despite his early offensive struggles, he single-handedly spoiled potential no-hitters on April 16 and 19.[127] A game-winning home run on May 7 made him the first major league player ever with 400 home runs and 3,000 hits.[127] As he continued to hit at a relatively low pace, his playing time was limited by Cardinals manager Solly Hemus at various points during the season.[128] Seeking more revenue for the players' pension fund, Major League Baseball held two All-Star games in a season for the first time through 1962.[129] Musial made his 16th All-Star appearance (16th season)[3] and pinch-hit in both contests, flying out in the July 7 game and drawing a walk in the August 3 game.[129] He finished the season with 115 regular game appearances, a .255 batting average, 37 runs, and a slugging percentage of .428.[46]
During the 1959 season, John F. Kennedy approached Musial about supporting Kennedy's campaign for President, citing their close ages. Musial campaigned for Kennedy later that year and became a supporter of the Democrat.[130]
On June 30, 1959, Musial was the batter in one of the oddest plays in baseball history. In a game between the Cardinals and Chicago Cubs, he was at the plate with a count of 3–1. Bob Anderson's next pitch was errant, evading catcher Sammy Taylor and rolling all the way to the backstop. Umpire Vic Delmore called ball four, even as Anderson and Taylor contended that Musial had foul tipped the ball. Because the ball was still in play and Delmore was embroiled in an argument with the catcher and pitcher, Musial kept running in attempt to make second base. Seeing that Musial was trying for second, Alvin Dark ran to the backstop to retrieve the ball. The ball wound up in the hands of field announcer Pat Pieper, but Dark ended up getting it back anyway. Absentmindedly, however, Delmore pulled out a new ball and gave it to Taylor. Anderson finally noticed that Musial was trying for second, took the new ball, and threw it to second baseman Tony Taylor. Anderson's throw flew over Taylor's head into the outfield. Dark, at the same time that Anderson threw the new ball, threw the original ball to shortstop Ernie Banks. Musial did not see Dark's throw and only noticed Anderson's ball fly over the second baseman's head, so he tried to go to third base. On his way there, he was tagged by Banks, and after a delay he was ruled out.[131]
1960–63[edit]
Based on his 1959 performance, Musial accepted a pay cut in 1960 from his previous $100,000 salary to $80,000.[132] He was eager to prove that his mediocre performance was the result of improper physical conditioning, and he enlisted the help of Walter Eberhardt, Saint Louis University's director of physical education.[133] In June 1960, newspaper articles began speculating that Musial would soon retire, yet he finished the season with a .275 batting average.[46][134] He addressed the speculation in September, confirming that he would play again in 1961. His .288 batting average that season reaffirmed his decision.[46][135] In 1962, Musial posted a .330 batting average, good for third in the batting race, with 19 homers and 82 RBI. As a pinch-hitter, he had 14 base hits in 19 at-bats (.737).[136] Along the way, he established new NL career marks for hits, RBI, and runs scored. That same year on July 8, the 41-year-old Musial became the oldest player ever to hit three home runs in one game.





Stan Musial's number 6 was retired by the St. Louis Cardinals in 1963.


The Cardinals began 1963 by winning 10 of their first 15 games, as Musial posted a .237 batting average.[137] He set a new major league record for career extra-base hits on May 8 and improved his batting average to .277 by the end of the month.[138] Making his 20th All-Star appearance[3] and 24th All-Star Game appearance on July 9, 1963, he pinch-hit in the fifth inning.[138] Asked by general manager Bing Devine on July 26 what his plans were, Musial said that he would retire at season's end.[139] He waited until the Cardinals team picnic on August 12 to publicly announce his decision, hopeful he could retire on a winning note.[140]
Musial became a grandfather for the first time in the early hours of September 10; later that day, he hit a home run in his first at-bat.[141] After sweeping a doubleheader on September 15, the Cardinals had won 19 of their last 20 games, and were one game behind the Los Angeles Dodgers.[141] The Dodgers then swept the Cardinals in a three-game series in St. Louis and clinched the NL pennant on September 25.[142] Musial's last game, on September 29, 1963, was preceded by an hour-long retirement ceremony.[143] Speakers at the event included baseball commissioner Ford Frick, Cardinals broadcaster Harry Caray, and Cardinals owner Gussie Busch, who announced that Musial's uniform number "6" would be retired by the team.[143] During the game, Musial recorded a single in the fourth inning, then hit a single to right field that scored teammate Curt Flood in the sixth.[144] Cardinals manager Johnny Keane brought in Gary Kolb as a pinch-runner for Musial, bringing his major league career to an end.[144] Just as he had recorded two base hits in his major league debut, Musial finished his last game with two hits, as well.[144] Musial finished with the all-time National League hits record and second to only Ty Cobb on the all-time Major League list. Musial's last career hit was out of reach of Cincinnati Reds second baseman Pete Rose, who would go on to break Cobb's record to become baseball's all-time hit king.


"All Musial represents is more than two decades of sustained excellence and complete decency as a human being."

—Broadcaster Bob Costas, on Musial[35]
At the time of his retirement, Musial held or shared 17 major league records, 29 NL records, and nine All-Star Game records.[145] Among those records, he ranked as the major league career leader in extra-base hits (1,377) and total bases (6,134).[144] He also held NL career marks in categories such as hits (3,630), games played (3,026), doubles (725), and RBI (1,951).[144] He finished his career with 475 home runs despite never having led the NL in the category.[144] Jerry Lansche speculates Musial would likely have become the second player, after Babe Ruth, with 2,000 RBI, and would have exceeded 500 career home runs had he not served in the military.[146] His lowest full season RBI output before the war was 72 (in 1942) and as he needed only 49 RBI to reach 2,000 for his full career, he certainly would have exceeded 2,000 RBI by playing without injury in 1945. His home run production is a different story and it is highly unlikely he would have reached 500. He did not hit more than 13 home runs in any season before he entered the navy and did not hit as many as 25 (the number he would have needed to become a 500 career homer club member) until 1948, 3 years after returning to baseball from World War II. His career hit total was evenly split between 1,815 hits at home and 1,815 hits on the road.[36] Steven R. Bullock speculates that it is possible that without military service Musial might have continued playing to attempt to exceed Ty Cobb's career hit record of 4,191.[146] Even if Musial had hit safely 207 times (the average of his hits in the 2 years before and the 2 years after his service in the navy) in 1945, he still would have been 354 hits short of tying Ty. His hit total in his last season at age 42 was only 86; even if he could have had 103 hits a season (the average of his last 5 seasons) he would have had to play to age 47 to attain the hits record.
He was the first major league player to appear in more than 1,000 games at two different positions, registering 1,896 games in the outfield and 1,016 at first base.[147] Since Musial's retirement in 1963, Tony Gwynn has been the only player to finish his career with a higher lifetime batting average. Hank Aaron has been the only player to surpass his record of 6,134 total bases.
In Musial's 3,026 major league appearances, he was never ejected from a game.[148] Speaking about his quiet reputation within the sport's history, sportscaster Bob Costas said, "He didn't hit a homer in his last at-bat; he hit a single. He didn't hit in 56 straight games. He married his high school sweetheart and stayed married to her. ... All Musial represents is more than two decades of sustained excellence and complete decency as a human being."[35]
Post-playing career and family life[edit]
Musial was named a vice president of the St. Louis Cardinals in September 1963, and he remained in that position until after the 1966 season.[149] From February 1964 to January 1967, he also served as President Lyndon Johnson's physical fitness adviser, a part-time position created to promote better fitness among American citizens.[150] Before the 1967 season began, the Cardinals named Musial the team's general manager, and he oversaw the club's World Series championship that year.[149] He won the allegiance of Cardinals players by making fair offers from the outset of player-contract negotiations and creating an in-stadium babysitting service so players' wives could attend games.[151] His longtime business partner Biggie Garagnani died in June 1967, prompting Musial to devote more time to managing his restaurant and other business interests.[152] He came to realize that the detail-oriented desk job was not his forte. He consequently decided to step down as general manager, before even completing a full year on the job.[152]
Musial—like Phil Linz—was noted for his harmonica playing, which included his rendition of "Take Me Out to the Ball Game".[153] Through the 1990s, he frequently played the harmonica at public gatherings, such as the annual Baseball Hall of Fame induction ceremony and various charity events.[154] He performed on the television show Hee Haw and in 1994 recorded 18 songs that were sold in tandem with a harmonica-playing instruction booklet.[154]
Even though Musial left Donora after high school, he retained close ties to the town throughout the rest of his life. He maintained membership in local social clubs, and regularly sent a local doctor boxes of autographed baseballs, with the town's mayor using some for United Way fundraising.[155] Musial also gave free meals at the restaurant he owned in St. Louis to any customers who presented valid ID proving they were Donora residents.[156]
Musial met Lillian Susan Labash, the daughter of a local grocer,[155] in Donora when both were 15, and married her in St. Paul's Catholic Church in Daytona Beach, Florida on May 25, 1940. They had four children: son Richard, and daughters Gerry, Janet, and Jeanie.[148][157] Lillian Musial died at 91, on May 3, 2012; their marriage had lasted for almost 72 years.[158] In his final years, Musial suffered from Alzheimer's disease.
Honors and recognition[edit]


"Here stands baseball's perfect warrior. Here stands baseball's perfect knight."

—Quote inscribed on the base of Musial's statue, attributed to former commissioner Ford Frick[159]
On August 4, 1968, a statue of Musial was erected outside of Busch Memorial Stadium on the northeast grounds of the St. Louis stadium.[152] The statue was moved from its original location to the west side of the new Busch Stadium for its first season in 2006, where it became a popular meeting place for generations of Cardinals fans.[160] Musial's statue is inscribed with a quote attributed to former baseball commissioner Ford Frick: "Here stands baseball's perfect warrior. Here stands baseball's perfect knight."[152]
Musial was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility in 1969, when he was named on 93.2 percent of the ballots.[161] On June 14, 1973 he was the first inductee into the National Polish-American Hall of Fame, housed at St. Mary's College in Orchard Lake, Michigan. In 1989, he was inducted into the St. Louis Walk of Fame.[162] Five years later, a baseball field was named after him in his hometown of Donora.[163] He was ranked tenth on The Sporting News' list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players published in 1998.[164] He was also one of the 30 players selected to the Major League Baseball All-Century Team, added by a special committee after he finished 11th in fan voting among outfielders.[165] In 2000, he was inducted into the Hall of Famous Missourians, and a bronze bust depicting him is on permanent display in the rotunda of the Missouri State Capitol.[166] In January, 2014, the Cardinals announced Musial among 22 former players and personnel to be inducted into the St. Louis Cardinals Hall of Fame Museum for the inaugural class of 2014.[167]

Nearly two decades after Musial retired, baseball statistician Bill James and the sabermetrics movement began providing new ways of comparing players across baseball history.[168] In 2001, James ranked Musial the tenth-greatest baseball player in history, and the second-best left fielder of all time.[169] According to Baseball-Reference.com, he ranks fifth all-time among hitters on the Black Ink Test, and third all-time on the Gray Ink Test—measures designed to compare players of different eras.[46][170] He ranks first on Baseball-Reference's Hall of Fame Monitor Test, and is tied for second in the Hall of Fame Career Standards Test.[46] Despite his statistical accomplishments, he is sometimes referred to as the most underrated or overlooked athlete in modern American sports history.[171][172] For instance, in his analysis of baseball's under- and overrated players in 2007, sportswriter Jayson Stark said, "I can't think of any all-time great in any sport who gets left out of more who's-the-greatest conversations than Stan Musial."[171]
Musial threw out the first pitch in the fifth game of the 2006 World Series and delivered the ceremonial first pitch ball to President Barack Obama at the 2009 Major League Baseball All-Star Game.[173] A "Stan the Man" day was held in his honor by the Cardinals on May 18, 2008.[174] In 2010, another one of the Cardinals' greatest sluggers, Albert Pujols, whose nickname was "El Hombre", said he didn't want to be called "The Man", even in Spanish, because "There is one man that gets that respect, and that is Stan Musial." [96] Also in 2010, the Cardinals launched a campaign to build support for awarding Musial the Presidential Medal of Freedom for his lifetime of achievement and service.[175] The campaign realized its goal, and on February 15, 2011, Musial was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Barack Obama[176][177] who called him "an icon untarnished, a beloved pillar of the community, a gentleman you'd want your kids to emulate."[178]
On October 17, 2012, Musial made his final appearance at Busch Stadium, riding in a golf cart around the warning track before Game 4 of the National League Championship Series. Musial stopped at both dugouts and greeted San Francisco Giants manager Bruce Bochy and Cardinals manager Mike Matheny. The Cardinals would go on to win Game 4 by a score of 8-3, but lost the pennant to the eventual World Series champion Giants.

On January 19, 2013, Musial died at age 92 of natural causes at his home in Ladue, Missouri, on the same day that fellow MLB Hall of Fame inductee Earl Weaver passed away.[181][182] Musial was surrounded by his family as he died peacefully. Cardinals owner Bill DeWitt, Jr. released the following statement:

We have lost the most beloved member of the Cardinals family. Stan Musial was the greatest player in Cardinals history and one of the best players in the history of baseball. The entire Cardinals organization extends its sincere condolences to Stan's family, including his children Richard, Gerry, Janet and Jean, as well as his eleven grandchildren and twelve great grandchildren. We join fans everywhere in mourning the loss of our dear friend and reflect on how fortunate we all are to have known 'Stan the Man'.[183]

Upon hearing the news of his death, fans gathered and began an impromptu memorial at his statue outside Busch Stadium; the Cardinals issued a release saying the memorial would be left in place for some time.[184] In a laudatory obituary, The New York Times quoted famed New York manager Leo Durocher: "There is only one way to pitch to Musial—under the plate."[185]
Missouri Governor Jay Nixon commented: "Stan Musial was a great American hero who—with the utmost humility—inspired us all to aim high and dream big. The world is emptier today without him, but far better to have known him. The legacy of 'baseball's perfect warrior' will endure and inspire generations to come."[186]
St. Louis Mayor Francis Slay tweeted: "Sad as we are, we are fortunate to have had Stan in STL for so long, and are also glad that Stan and Lil are together again." He ordered flags at half-mast in the city.[187]
"Major League Baseball has lost one of its true legends in Stan Musial, a Hall of Famer in every sense and a man who led a great American life", Commissioner Bud Selig said. "He was the heart and soul of the historic St. Louis Cardinals franchise for generations, and he served his country during World War II. A recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2011, Stan's life embodies baseball's unparalleled history and why this game is the national pastime."[188]
Thousands of fans braved cold temperatures on January 24 for a public visitation at the Cathedral Basilica of Saint Louis, where Musial lay in state, dressed in his trademark cardinal-red blazer and with a harmonica in his lapel pocket, flanked by a Navy honor guard. A private funeral Mass was held on Saturday, January 26, 2013, at the New Cathedral in St. Louis, televised locally by KTVI and KPLR as well as Fox Sports Midwest on pay-television. New York's Cardinal Timothy Dolan, who in his first episcopal post served as an auxiliary bishop of the Archdiocese of Saint Louis, was the principal celebrant, and Knoxville's Bishop Richard F. Stika, Musial's former parish priest, was the homilist.[189] Bob Costas gave the principal eulogy, calling him "the genuine hero who as the years and decades passed, and disillusionment came from other directions, never once let us down", and quoting fellow Cooperstown honoree Mickey Mantle, who once said that Musial "was a better player than me because he was a better man than me".[190] Following the funeral, Musial's family led a procession from the New Cathedral to Busch Stadium, where they laid a memorial wreath at his statue. Once the wreath was placed and Musial's family began to walk back to their vehicles, the hundreds of Cardinal fans gathered for the wreath ceremony gave both Musial and his family one final salute. That salute was the fans singing "Take Me Out to the Ball Game" before Musial was taken to his final place of rest.
Musial was the last living member of the Cardinals team that won the 1942 World Series. At the time of his death, no living players had played on an earlier World Series-winning team.
The Stan Musial Veterans Memorial Bridge in St. Louis (carries  I‑70) was built in his memorial.
Legacy[edit]
As a reflection of his popularity, Musial has had infrastructure named after him. In May 2011 the Pennsylvania State Senate changed the name of the bridge that carries the C. Vance Deicas Memorial Highway (S.R. 1077) over the Monongahela River from Donora-Monessen Bridge to Stan Musial Bridge after Musial who was a native of the area.[191] In October 2013 the St. Louis Fire Department started operating a fireboat named after Musial.[192] In July 2013, the new Interstate 70 bridge over the Mississippi River between Illinois and Missouri at St. Louis received the official name of "Stan Musial Veterans Memorial Bridge"[193]

Stanley Frank Musial (/ˈmjuːziəl/ or /ˈmjuːʒəl/; born Stanisław Franciszek Musiał; November 21, 1920 – January 19, 2013), nicknamed Stan the Man, was an American Major League Baseball (MLB) outfielder and first baseman. He spent 22 seasons playing for the St. Louis Cardinals, from 1941 to 1944 and 1946 to 1963. Widely considered to be one of the greatest and most consistent hitters in baseball history,[1] Musial was a first-ballot inductee into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1969, and was also selected to the St. Louis Cardinals Hall of Fame in the inaugural class of 2014.
Musial batted .331 over the course of his career and set National League (NL) records for career hits (3,630), runs batted in (1,951), games played (3,026), at bats (10,972), runs scored (1,949) and doubles (725), his 475 career home runs then ranked second in NL history behind Mel Ott's total of 511. His 6,134 total bases remained a major league record until surpassed by Hank Aaron, and his hit total still ranks fourth all-time, and is the highest by any player who spent his career with only one team. A seven-time batting champion with identical totals of 1,815 hits at home and 1,815 hits on the road, he was named the National League's (NL) Most Valuable Player (MVP) three times and led St. Louis to three World Series championships. He also shares the major league record for the most All-Star Games played (24) with Hank Aaron and Willie Mays.[a] [2]
Musial was born in Donora, Pennsylvania, where he frequently played baseball informally or in organized settings, and eventually played on the baseball team at Donora High School. Signed to a professional contract by the St. Louis Cardinals as a pitcher in 1938, Musial was converted into an outfielder prior to his major league debut in 1941. Noted for his unique batting stance, he quickly established himself as a consistent and productive hitter. In his first full season, 1942, the Cardinals won the World Series. The following year, he led the NL in six different offensive categories and earned his first MVP award. He was also named to the NL All-Star squad for the first time; he appeared in every All-Star game in every subsequent season he played.[3] Musial won his second World Series championship in 1944, then missed the entire 1945 season while serving in the Navy.
After completing his military service during the war, Musial returned to baseball in 1946 and resumed his consistent hitting. That year he earned his second MVP award and third World Series title. His third MVP award came in 1948, when he finished one home run short of winning baseball's Triple Crown. After struggling offensively in 1959, Musial used a personal trainer to help maintain his productivity until he decided to retire in 1963. At the time of his retirement, he held or shared 17 major league records, 29 National League records, and nine All-Star Game records. Ironically, in 1964, the season following his retirement, the Cardinals went on to defeat the New York Yankees in an epic 7-game clash, for St. Louis' first World Series championship in nearly two decades (a team which included future Hall of Famer Lou Brock performing what would have likely been Musial's left field duties).[4] In addition to overseeing businesses, such as a restaurant both before and after his playing career, Musial served as the Cardinals' general manager in 1967, winning the pennant and World Series, then quitting that position. He also became noted for his harmonica playing, a skill he acquired during his playing career. Known for his modesty and sportsmanship, Musial was selected for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team in 1999. In February 2011, President Barack Obama presented Musial with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, one of the highest civilian awards that can be bestowed on a person by the United States government.

Early life[edit]
Musial was born in Donora, Pennsylvania, the fifth of the six children (four girls and two boys) of Lukasz and Mary (Lancos) Musiał (/ˈmuːʃaʊ/, MOO-show).[5] His mother was of Carpatho-Rusyn descent and his father was a Polish immigrant who chose the name Stanisław Franciszek for his first son, though his father always referred to Musial using the Polish nickname Stasiu, pronounced "Stashu".[5][6] Musial frequently played baseball with his brother Ed and other friends during his childhood, and considered Lefty Grove his favorite ballplayer.[7][8] Musial also had the benefit of learning about baseball from his neighbor Joe Barbao, a former minor league pitcher.[9] When he enrolled in school, his name was formally changed to Stanley Frank Musial.[5]
At age 15 Musial joined the Donora Zincs, a semi-professional team managed by Barbao.[10] In his Zincs debut he pitched 6 innings and struck out 13 batters, all of them adults.[10] Musial also played one season on the newly revived Donora High School baseball team, where one of his teammates was Buddy Griffey, father of MLB player Ken Griffey, Sr. and grandfather to Ken Griffey, Jr.[11][12] Baseball statistician Bill James described the younger Griffey, in comparison to Musial, as "the second-best left-handed hitting, left-handed throwing outfielder ever born in Donora, Pennsylvania, on November 21."[13] His exploits as a rising player in Pennsylvania earned him the nickname "The Donora Greyhound".[14]
Musial also played basketball and was offered an athletic scholarship in that sport by the University of Pittsburgh.[10][15] Meanwhile, the St. Louis Cardinals had scouted Musial as a pitcher and, in 1937, offered him a professional contract after a workout with their Class D Penn State League affiliate.[16] Musial's father initially resisted the idea of his son pursuing a baseball career, but reluctantly gave his consent after lobbying by both Musial and his mother.[17] Musial also credited his school librarian Helen Kloz for pointing out that baseball was his dream and advising him to pursue it professionally.[17] In what was then a common practice, the Cardinals did not file the contract with the baseball commissioner's office until June 1938. This preserved Musial's amateur eligibility, and he was still able to participate in high school sports, leading Donora High School's basketball team to a playoff appearance.[18] He then reported to the Cardinals' Class D affiliate in West Virginia, the Williamson Red Birds.[19][20]
Professional baseball career[edit]
Minor leagues (1938–41)[edit]
Musial's rookie year with Williamson in 1938 was a period of adjustment both on and off the field. He began gaining more in-depth knowledge about baseball strategy[21] while posting a 6–6 win–loss record and a 4.66 earned run average (ERA), to go along with a .258 batting average.[22] Off the field, he experienced feelings of homesickness while learning to live comfortably and independently on his $65-per-month salary.[21] Musial finished his high school education before returning to Williamson in spring 1939. That season his numbers improved to a 9–2 record, a 4.30 ERA, and a .352 batting average.[23][24]
Musial spent the 1940 season with the Cardinals' other Class D team, the Daytona Beach Islanders, where he developed a lifelong friendship with manager Dickie Kerr.[25] His pitching skills improved under the guidance of Kerr, who also recognized his hitting talent, playing him in the outfield between pitching starts.[26] On May 25, 1940, Musial married fellow Donora resident, Lillian "Lil" Labash, in Daytona Beach, and the couple's first child followed in August.[27] During late August, Musial suffered a shoulder injury while playing in the outfield, and later made an early exit as the starting pitcher in a 12–5 playoff game loss.[28] For a while Musial considered leaving baseball entirely, complaining that he could not afford to support himself and his wife on the $16 a week pay. Kerr talked him out of it, and even took the Musials into his own home to relieve the financial burden. To repay the debt Musial bought Kerr a $20,000 home in Houston in 1958.[29] In 113 games in 1940 he hit .311, while compiling an 18–5 pitching record that included 176 strikeouts and 145 walks.[30][31]
Musial was assigned to the Class AA Columbus Red Birds to begin 1941, though manager, Burt Shotton, and Musial himself quickly realized that the previous year's injury had considerably weakened his arm.[32] He was reassigned to the Class C Springfield Cardinals as a full-time outfielder, and he later credited manager Ollie Vanek for displaying confidence in his hitting ability.[33] During 87 games with Springfield, Musial hit a league-leading .379 before being promoted to the Rochester Red Wings of the International League.[34] He was noted for his unique batting stance, a crouch in which his back was seemingly square to the pitcher.[35] This stance was later described by pitcher Ted Lyons as "a kid peeking around the corner to see if the cops were coming".[36] According to a 1950 description by author Tom Meany, "The bent knees and the crouch give him the appearance of a coiled spring, although most pitchers think of him as a coiled rattlesnake."[37] Musial continued to play well in Rochester—in one three-game stretch, he had 11 hits. He was called up to the Cardinals for the last two weeks of the 1941 season.[38]
Major leagues (1941–44)[edit]

Musial made his major league debut during the second game of a doubleheader at Sportsman's Park on September 17, 1941.[39] The Cardinals were in the midst of a pennant race with the Brooklyn Dodgers; in 12 games, Musial collected 20 hits for a .426 batting average.[40] Despite Musial's late contributions, the Cardinals finished two and one-half games behind the 100-game-winning Dodgers.[41]
Cardinals manager Billy Southworth used Musial as a left fielder to begin 1942, sometimes lifting him for a pinch-hitter against left-handed pitching.[42] Musial was hitting .315 by late June,[43] as the Cardinals resumed battling the Dodgers for first place in the National League (NL).[44] The Cardinals took sole possession of first place on September 13, and when Musial caught a fly ball to end the first game of a doubleheader on September 27 they clinched the pennant with their 105th win.[45] He finished the season with a .315 batting average and 72 runs batted in (RBI) in 140 games. Musial received national publicity when he was named by St. Louis Post-Dispatch sports editor J. Roy Stockton as his choice for Rookie of the Year in a Saturday Evening Post article.[46][47]
The Cardinals played the American League champion New York Yankees in the 1942 World Series.[48] Representing the winning run at home plate in the bottom of the ninth inning of Game 1 at Sportsman's Park, Musial grounded out with the bases loaded to end the game .[49] Musial's first hit of the Series was an RBI single that provided the margin of victory in Game 2, allowing the Cardinals to tie the Series.[50] Over the next three games at Yankee Stadium, Musial had three more hits as the Cardinals defeated the Yankees in the Series four games to one.[51] Musial batted .222 for the Series, with two runs scored.[52]
Musial's 1943 season started with a brief contract holdout in spring training.[53] He made the National League All-Star team for the first time as a starting left fielder and got a double in the All-Star Game on July 13.[53] He finished the season leading the major leagues in hitting with a .357 batting average and led the NL in hits (220), doubles (48), triples (20), total bases (347), on-base percentage (.425), and slugging percentage (.562).[54] This performance earned him his first NL Most Valuable Player Award, ahead of teammate and catcher Walker Cooper (.318 batting average).[54] After romping to another NL pennant by 18 games, the Cardinals again faced the Yankees in the 1943 World Series.[55] Musial had a single in the Cardinals' Game 1 loss, and scored a run in a Game 2 win.[55] The Cardinals did not win another game in the Series, but the loser's bonus share paid to each Cardinals player ($4,321.99) still amounted to nearly two-thirds of Musial's regular season salary.[56]
United States involvement in World War II began to impinge on Musial's baseball career in 1944, as he underwent a physical examination in prelude to possible service in the armed forces.[57] He ultimately remained with the Cardinals for the entire season, posting a .347 batting average with 197 hits.[58][59] The Cardinals claimed the NL pennant for the third consecutive season, and faced St. Louis's other major league team, the Browns, in the 1944 World Series.[60] The Browns took a 2–1 lead, while Musial hit .250 with zero RBI.[61] He broke out in Game 4 with a two-run home run, single, double, and a walk as part of a 5–1 Cardinals win.[61] The Cardinals went on to defeat the Browns in six games, and Musial posted a .304 batting average for the Series.[62][63]
Sojourn in the U.S. Navy (1945–46)[edit]
Musial enlisted in the United States Navy on January 23, 1945, during World War II. He was initially assigned to noncombat duty at the Naval Training Station in Bainbridge, Maryland.[64] In June 1945, he was assigned to Special Services in Hawaii, and was assigned to a ferry launch unit to bring back damaged ship crews entering Pearl Harbor where he was able to play baseball every afternoon in the naval base's eight-team league.[65] After being granted emergency leave to see his ailing father in January 1946, he was briefly assigned to the Philadelphia Navy Yard before his honorable discharge from the Navy as a Seaman Second Class in March 1946.[65][66]
In 2007, Musial received the Navy Memorial's Lone Sailor Award, which honors Navy veterans who have excelled in civilian life.

"Every time Stan came up they chanted, 'Here comes the man!'"

—Cardinals traveling secretary Leo Ward relates Dodger fans' nickname for Musial to sportswriter Bob Broeg[67]
Rejoining the Cardinals under new manager Eddie Dyer, Musial posted a .388 batting average by the middle of May 1946.[68] He also became close friends with new teammate Red Schoendienst, who had joined the Cardinals during Musial's absence in 1945.[69] During the season, Musial (who was under contract to the Cardinals for $13,500 in 1946) was offered a five-year, $125,000 contract, plus a $50,000 bonus, to join the Mexican League.[70] He declined the offer, and after manager Dyer spoke to club owner Sam Breadon, Musial was given a $5,000 raise later in 1946.[71]
It was also during the 1946 season that Musial acquired his nickname of Stan the Man.[67] During the June 23 game against the Dodgers at Ebbets Field, St. Louis Post-Dispatch sportswriter Bob Broeg heard Dodger fans chanting whenever Musial came to bat, but could not understand the words.[67][72] Later that day over dinner, Broeg asked Cardinals traveling secretary Leo Ward if he had understood what the Dodger fans had been chanting.[67] Ward said, "Every time Stan came up they chanted, 'Here comes the man!'" "'That man,' you mean", Broeg said. "No, the man", replied Ward.[67] Broeg mentioned this story in his Post-Dispatch column, and Musial was thereafter known as Stan "The Man".[67]




Musial on the cover of Baseball Digest, September 1948


In June 1946, Dyer began to use Musial as a first baseman.[73] The Cardinals finished the season tied with the Dodgers,[74] prompting a three-game playoff for the pennant. Musial's Game 1 triple and Game 2 double contributed to the Cardinals' two-games-to-none series victory.[75] Facing the Boston Red Sox, the Cardinals won the 1946 World Series four games to three,[76] as Musial had six hits and four RBI.[77] He batted .365 for the season and won his second NL MVP Award, receiving 22 out of a possible 24 first-place votes, finishing ahead of Brooklyn's Dixie Walker (.319 batting average).[78]
Musial began the 1947 season by hitting .146 in April.[79] On May 9, team doctor Dr. Robert Hyland confirmed a previous diagnosis of appendicitis, while discovering that Musial was concurrently suffering from tonsillitis.[80] He received treatment, but did not have either his appendix or tonsils surgically removed until after the season ended.[81] Despite his health woes, he finished the year with a batting average of .312.[82]
Fully recovered from his ailments, Musial recorded his 1,000th career hit on April 25, 1948.[83] After a May 7 St. Louis Globe-Democrat article criticized baseball players for appearing in cigarette advertisements, he made a personal decision to never again appear in such ads.[84] By June 24, his batting average was .408, prompting Brooklyn pitcher Preacher Roe to comically announce his new method for retiring Musial: "Walk him on four pitches and pick him off first."[85] Given a mid-season pay raise by new Cardinals owner Robert E. Hannegan for his outstanding performance, Musial hit a home run in the All-Star Game.[86] On September 22, he registered five hits in a game for the fourth time in the season, tying a mark set by Ty Cobb in 1922.[87]


"He missed tying for the top in homers by one rained out home run. If it had counted, he would have won the Triple Crown that year...and in addition have been the only player of this century to lead the league in runs, hits, double, triples, and slugging percentage. What a year!"

—Sportswriter Bob Broeg, on Musial's 1948 season[88]
Musial finished the 1948 season leading the major leagues in batting average (.376), hits (230), doubles (46), triples (18), total bases (429), and slugging percentage (.702).[89] Winning the NL batting title by a 43-point margin, with an on-base percentage lead of 27 points and a 138-point slugging percentage margin—the latter being the largest gap since Rogers Hornsby's 1925 season—Musial became the first player to win three NL MVP awards.[89] If a home run he hit during a rained out game had been counted in his season totals, he would have won the Triple Crown by leading the NL in batting average, home runs, and runs batted in.[89][90]
Anticipating life after his baseball career, Musial began the first of several business partnerships with Julius "Biggie" Garagnani in January 1949, opening "Stan Musial & Biggie's" restaurant.[91][92] He approached the 1949 season with the intent to try to hit more home runs, stating he had hit 39 the previous season "without trying".[93] His new focus on hitting for power backfired, as pitchers began using the outside part of the plate to induce him to ground out to the first or second baseman.[93] Musial soon stopped focusing on hitting home runs and resumed his consistent offensive production by the end of May.[93] He received his sixth consecutive All-Star player selection and finished the season leading the NL in hits (207) while playing in every game.[94] However, the Cardinals, with 96 wins, finished one game behind the Dodgers.[95]
In the late 1940s, when baseball was slowly becoming integrated, Musial—along with his roommate Red Schoendienst—would be lauded by newcomers such as Dodgers' pitcher Don Newcombe for their tolerance. "They never...had the need to sit in the dugout and call a black guy a bunch of names", Newcombe said, "because he was trying to change the game and make it what it should have been in the first place, a game for all people."[96]
1950–54[edit]
Musial began the 1950s by posting a .350 batting average before participating in the 1950 All-Star Game, where in fan balloting he was the NL's number two choice.[97] He had the longest hitting streak of his career during the 1950 season—a 30-game stretch that ended on July 27.[97] With the Cardinals falling 14 games out of first place by September, manager Dyer used him at first base and all three outfield positions.[97][98] New Cardinals manager Marty Marion led the team to a third-place finish in 1951, while Musial was named The Sporting News Major League Player of the Year.[99]


"No man has ever been a perfect ballplayer. Stan Musial, however, is the closest to being perfect in the game today.... He plays as hard when his club is away out in front of a game as he does when they're just a run or two behind."

—Ty Cobb, on Musial in a 1952 Life magazine article[100]
National media attention inadvertently turned to Musial a month before the 1952 season began, after Ty Cobb wrote an article regarding modern baseball players that was published in Life magazine.[100] Cobb singled out Musial and Phil Rizzuto as the only players "who can be mentioned in the same breath with the oldtime greats".[100] Cobb went on to refer to Musial as "a better player than Joe DiMaggio was in his prime."[100] In response, Musial displayed his characteristic modesty, saying, "Cobb is baseball's greatest. I don't want to contradict him, but I can't say that I was ever as good as Joe DiMaggio."[100]
The only major league pitching appearance of Musial's career occurred as a publicity stunt during the last Cardinals home game of the 1952 season.[101][102] Manager Eddie Stanky had a reluctant Musial pitch to Frank Baumholtz, the runner-up to Musial for the best batting average in the NL that season.[101] With Baumholtz batting right-handed for the first time in his career, Musial's first pitch was hit so hard it ricocheted off the shin of third baseman Solly Hemus and into the left field corner.[101] The play was ruled an error, and Musial was embarrassed enough by his complicity in the gimmick to avoid pitching again for the remainder of his career.[101]
The Cardinals franchise was up for sale in early 1953, and Musial and Schoendienst advised their friend and fellow duck-hunter Gussie Busch to consider buying the team.[103] Busch used the resources of the Anheuser-Busch company to purchase the Cardinals, keeping Musial in St. Louis by averting the possibility of a move by the team to another city.[103][104] The 1953 season marked Musial's 10th NL All-Star selection, and the 12th consecutive time he finished a major league season with a batting average above .300.[46][105]
Musial accomplished another historical feat on May 2, 1954, in a doubleheader in St. Louis against the New York Giants: he hit three home runs in the first contest, then added two more in the second to become the first major leaguer to hit five home runs in a doubleheader.[106] In addition to his five home runs, he also hit a single in the first game, setting a new record of 21 total bases for a doubleheader.[106] The only player besides Musial to hit five home runs in a doubleheader is Nate Colbert, who achieved the feat in 1972.[107]
1955–59[edit]
Musial made his 12th NL All-Star appearance in 1955 as a reserve player, when Cincinnati's Ted Kluszewski outpolled him by 150,000 votes to get on the starting lineup at first base.[108] Musial entered the game as a pinch hitter in the fourth inning, and played left field as the game entered extra innings.[109] Leading off the bottom of the 12th, he hit a home run to give the NL a 6–5 victory.[109]




Musial in 1957


The 1956 season marked another milestone for Musial, when he broke Mel Ott's NL record for extra-base hits on August 12.[110] Earlier that season, Cardinals general manager "Trader Frank" Lane began negotiations to trade him for Philadelphia pitcher Robin Roberts.[111] When Cardinals owner Gussie Busch learned of the possible move, he made it clear that Musial was not available for any trade.[112] Instead, Lane dealt Musial's close friend Schoendienst to the New York Giants; an upset Musial made no immediate comment to the press.[113]
On June 11, 1957, Musial tied the NL record for consecutive games played with his 822nd, a streak that began on the last day of the 1951 season.[114] Despite ballot stuffing by Cincinnati Reds fans, he was selected and played in the All-Star Game held at Sportsman's Park.[115] When he overextended his swing while batting during a game on August 23, Musial fractured a bone in his left shoulder socket and tore muscles over his collarbone.[116] He was unable to play again until September 8, ending his consecutive games-played streak at 895.[116] He finished 1957 as Sports Illustrated's "Sportsman of the Year".[117]


"Line drive! Into left field! Hit number three thousand! A run has scored! Musial around first, on his way to second with a double. Holy Cow! He came through!"

—Harry Caray's radio play-by-play call of Musial's 3,000th major league hit[118]
Musial signed one of the first $100,000 contracts in NL history on January 29, 1958. (According to Baseball Almanac, Hank Greenberg was the first with Pittsburgh in 1947.)[119] He quickly demonstrated a return on the investment by sharing with Willie Mays the inaugural (and for the only time in Musial's career) NL Player of the Month in May (no such award was given in April until 1969) batting .374, with 4 HR, and 16 RBI. Also that month, as he was approaching the 3,000-hit milestone in his major league career, he expressed a desire to record the hit in St. Louis.[120] He ultimately reached the mark with a pinch-hit, sixth inning RBI double at Chicago's Wrigley Field on May 13.[121][122] The eighth major league player to reach 3,000 hits, and the first to reach the milestone with an extra-base hit, Musial was greeted at St. Louis Union Station that evening by roughly 1,000 fans.[123] Finishing the season in sixth place, the Cardinals embarked on an exhibition tour of Japan, winning 14 of 16 games against top players from the Central and Pacific Japanese Leagues.[124]
Taking a new approach to preparation for the 1959 season, Musial was given permission to report late to spring training so that he might conserve his energy for the duration of the year.[125] Musial, at 6 feet (180 cm) tall, had maintained a weight of around 175 pounds (79 kg) throughout his career. He reported to spring training approximately 10 pounds (4.5 kg) overweight and in substandard physical condition.[126][127] He began the season with one hit in 15 at-bats.[127] Despite his early offensive struggles, he single-handedly spoiled potential no-hitters on April 16 and 19.[127] A game-winning home run on May 7 made him the first major league player ever with 400 home runs and 3,000 hits.[127] As he continued to hit at a relatively low pace, his playing time was limited by Cardinals manager Solly Hemus at various points during the season.[128] Seeking more revenue for the players' pension fund, Major League Baseball held two All-Star games in a season for the first time through 1962.[129] Musial made his 16th All-Star appearance (16th season)[3] and pinch-hit in both contests, flying out in the July 7 game and drawing a walk in the August 3 game.[129] He finished the season with 115 regular game appearances, a .255 batting average, 37 runs, and a slugging percentage of .428.[46]
During the 1959 season, John F. Kennedy approached Musial about supporting Kennedy's campaign for President, citing their close ages. Musial campaigned for Kennedy later that year and became a supporter of the Democrat.[130]
On June 30, 1959, Musial was the batter in one of the oddest plays in baseball history. In a game between the Cardinals and Chicago Cubs, he was at the plate with a count of 3–1. Bob Anderson's next pitch was errant, evading catcher Sammy Taylor and rolling all the way to the backstop. Umpire Vic Delmore called ball four, even as Anderson and Taylor contended that Musial had foul tipped the ball. Because the ball was still in play and Delmore was embroiled in an argument with the catcher and pitcher, Musial kept running in attempt to make second base. Seeing that Musial was trying for second, Alvin Dark ran to the backstop to retrieve the ball. The ball wound up in the hands of field announcer Pat Pieper, but Dark ended up getting it back anyway. Absentmindedly, however, Delmore pulled out a new ball and gave it to Taylor. Anderson finally noticed that Musial was trying for second, took the new ball, and threw it to second baseman Tony Taylor. Anderson's throw flew over Taylor's head into the outfield. Dark, at the same time that Anderson threw the new ball, threw the original ball to shortstop Ernie Banks. Musial did not see Dark's throw and only noticed Anderson's ball fly over the second baseman's head, so he tried to go to third base. On his way there, he was tagged by Banks, and after a delay he was ruled out.[131]
1960–63[edit]
Based on his 1959 performance, Musial accepted a pay cut in 1960 from his previous $100,000 salary to $80,000.[132] He was eager to prove that his mediocre performance was the result of improper physical conditioning, and he enlisted the help of Walter Eberhardt, Saint Louis University's director of physical education.[133] In June 1960, newspaper articles began speculating that Musial would soon retire, yet he finished the season with a .275 batting average.[46][134] He addressed the speculation in September, confirming that he would play again in 1961. His .288 batting average that season reaffirmed his decision.[46][135] In 1962, Musial posted a .330 batting average, good for third in the batting race, with 19 homers and 82 RBI. As a pinch-hitter, he had 14 base hits in 19 at-bats (.737).[136] Along the way, he established new NL career marks for hits, RBI, and runs scored. That same year on July 8, the 41-year-old Musial became the oldest player ever to hit three home runs in one game.





Stan Musial's number 6 was retired by the St. Louis Cardinals in 1963.


The Cardinals began 1963 by winning 10 of their first 15 games, as Musial posted a .237 batting average.[137] He set a new major league record for career extra-base hits on May 8 and improved his batting average to .277 by the end of the month.[138] Making his 20th All-Star appearance[3] and 24th All-Star Game appearance on July 9, 1963, he pinch-hit in the fifth inning.[138] Asked by general manager Bing Devine on July 26 what his plans were, Musial said that he would retire at season's end.[139] He waited until the Cardinals team picnic on August 12 to publicly announce his decision, hopeful he could retire on a winning note.[140]
Musial became a grandfather for the first time in the early hours of September 10; later that day, he hit a home run in his first at-bat.[141] After sweeping a doubleheader on September 15, the Cardinals had won 19 of their last 20 games, and were one game behind the Los Angeles Dodgers.[141] The Dodgers then swept the Cardinals in a three-game series in St. Louis and clinched the NL pennant on September 25.[142] Musial's last game, on September 29, 1963, was preceded by an hour-long retirement ceremony.[143] Speakers at the event included baseball commissioner Ford Frick, Cardinals broadcaster Harry Caray, and Cardinals owner Gussie Busch, who announced that Musial's uniform number "6" would be retired by the team.[143] During the game, Musial recorded a single in the fourth inning, then hit a single to right field that scored teammate Curt Flood in the sixth.[144] Cardinals manager Johnny Keane brought in Gary Kolb as a pinch-runner for Musial, bringing his major league career to an end.[144] Just as he had recorded two base hits in his major league debut, Musial finished his last game with two hits, as well.[144] Musial finished with the all-time National League hits record and second to only Ty Cobb on the all-time Major League list. Musial's last career hit was out of reach of Cincinnati Reds second baseman Pete Rose, who would go on to break Cobb's record to become baseball's all-time hit king.


"All Musial represents is more than two decades of sustained excellence and complete decency as a human being."

—Broadcaster Bob Costas, on Musial[35]
At the time of his retirement, Musial held or shared 17 major league records, 29 NL records, and nine All-Star Game records.[145] Among those records, he ranked as the major league career leader in extra-base hits (1,377) and total bases (6,134).[144] He also held NL career marks in categories such as hits (3,630), games played (3,026), doubles (725), and RBI (1,951).[144] He finished his career with 475 home runs despite never having led the NL in the category.[144] Jerry Lansche speculates Musial would likely have become the second player, after Babe Ruth, with 2,000 RBI, and would have exceeded 500 career home runs had he not served in the military.[146] His lowest full season RBI output before the war was 72 (in 1942) and as he needed only 49 RBI to reach 2,000 for his full career, he certainly would have exceeded 2,000 RBI by playing without injury in 1945. His home run production is a different story and it is highly unlikely he would have reached 500. He did not hit more than 13 home runs in any season before he entered the navy and did not hit as many as 25 (the number he would have needed to become a 500 career homer club member) until 1948, 3 years after returning to baseball from World War II. His career hit total was evenly split between 1,815 hits at home and 1,815 hits on the road.[36] Steven R. Bullock speculates that it is possible that without military service Musial might have continued playing to attempt to exceed Ty Cobb's career hit record of 4,191.[146] Even if Musial had hit safely 207 times (the average of his hits in the 2 years before and the 2 years after his service in the navy) in 1945, he still would have been 354 hits short of tying Ty. His hit total in his last season at age 42 was only 86; even if he could have had 103 hits a season (the average of his last 5 seasons) he would have had to play to age 47 to attain the hits record.
He was the first major league player to appear in more than 1,000 games at two different positions, registering 1,896 games in the outfield and 1,016 at first base.[147] Since Musial's retirement in 1963, Tony Gwynn has been the only player to finish his career with a higher lifetime batting average. Hank Aaron has been the only player to surpass his record of 6,134 total bases.
In Musial's 3,026 major league appearances, he was never ejected from a game.[148] Speaking about his quiet reputation within the sport's history, sportscaster Bob Costas said, "He didn't hit a homer in his last at-bat; he hit a single. He didn't hit in 56 straight games. He married his high school sweetheart and stayed married to her. ... All Musial represents is more than two decades of sustained excellence and complete decency as a human being."[35]
Post-playing career and family life[edit]
Musial was named a vice president of the St. Louis Cardinals in September 1963, and he remained in that position until after the 1966 season.[149] From February 1964 to January 1967, he also served as President Lyndon Johnson's physical fitness adviser, a part-time position created to promote better fitness among American citizens.[150] Before the 1967 season began, the Cardinals named Musial the team's general manager, and he oversaw the club's World Series championship that year.[149] He won the allegiance of Cardinals players by making fair offers from the outset of player-contract negotiations and creating an in-stadium babysitting service so players' wives could attend games.[151] His longtime business partner Biggie Garagnani died in June 1967, prompting Musial to devote more time to managing his restaurant and other business interests.[152] He came to realize that the detail-oriented desk job was not his forte. He consequently decided to step down as general manager, before even completing a full year on the job.[152]
Musial—like Phil Linz—was noted for his harmonica playing, which included his rendition of "Take Me Out to the Ball Game".[153] Through the 1990s, he frequently played the harmonica at public gatherings, such as the annual Baseball Hall of Fame induction ceremony and various charity events.[154] He performed on the television show Hee Haw and in 1994 recorded 18 songs that were sold in tandem with a harmonica-playing instruction booklet.[154]
Even though Musial left Donora after high school, he retained close ties to the town throughout the rest of his life. He maintained membership in local social clubs, and regularly sent a local doctor boxes of autographed baseballs, with the town's mayor using some for United Way fundraising.[155] Musial also gave free meals at the restaurant he owned in St. Louis to any customers who presented valid ID proving they were Donora residents.[156]
Musial met Lillian Susan Labash, the daughter of a local grocer,[155] in Donora when both were 15, and married her in St. Paul's Catholic Church in Daytona Beach, Florida on May 25, 1940. They had four children: son Richard, and daughters Gerry, Janet, and Jeanie.[148][157] Lillian Musial died at 91, on May 3, 2012; their marriage had lasted for almost 72 years.[158] In his final years, Musial suffered from Alzheimer's disease.
Honors and recognition[edit]


"Here stands baseball's perfect warrior. Here stands baseball's perfect knight."

—Quote inscribed on the base of Musial's statue, attributed to former commissioner Ford Frick[159]
On August 4, 1968, a statue of Musial was erected outside of Busch Memorial Stadium on the northeast grounds of the St. Louis stadium.[152] The statue was moved from its original location to the west side of the new Busch Stadium for its first season in 2006, where it became a popular meeting place for generations of Cardinals fans.[160] Musial's statue is inscribed with a quote attributed to former baseball commissioner Ford Frick: "Here stands baseball's perfect warrior. Here stands baseball's perfect knight."[152]
Musial was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility in 1969, when he was named on 93.2 percent of the ballots.[161] On June 14, 1973 he was the first inductee into the National Polish-American Hall of Fame, housed at St. Mary's College in Orchard Lake, Michigan. In 1989, he was inducted into the St. Louis Walk of Fame.[162] Five years later, a baseball field was named after him in his hometown of Donora.[163] He was ranked tenth on The Sporting News' list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players published in 1998.[164] He was also one of the 30 players selected to the Major League Baseball All-Century Team, added by a special committee after he finished 11th in fan voting among outfielders.[165] In 2000, he was inducted into the Hall of Famous Missourians, and a bronze bust depicting him is on permanent display in the rotunda of the Missouri State Capitol.[166] In January, 2014, the Cardinals announced Musial among 22 former players and personnel to be inducted into the St. Louis Cardinals Hall of Fame Museum for the inaugural class of 2014.[167]




President Barack Obama awards the 2010 Presidential Medal of Freedom to Stan Musial in a ceremony in the East Room of the White House February 15, 2011.


Nearly two decades after Musial retired, baseball statistician Bill James and the sabermetrics movement began providing new ways of comparing players across baseball history.[168] In 2001, James ranked Musial the tenth-greatest baseball player in history, and the second-best left fielder of all time.[169] According to Baseball-Reference.com, he ranks fifth all-time among hitters on the Black Ink Test, and third all-time on the Gray Ink Test—measures designed to compare players of different eras.[46][170] He ranks first on Baseball-Reference's Hall of Fame Monitor Test, and is tied for second in the Hall of Fame Career Standards Test.[46] Despite his statistical accomplishments, he is sometimes referred to as the most underrated or overlooked athlete in modern American sports history.[171][172] For instance, in his analysis of baseball's under- and overrated players in 2007, sportswriter Jayson Stark said, "I can't think of any all-time great in any sport who gets left out of more who's-the-greatest conversations than Stan Musial."[171]
Musial threw out the first pitch in the fifth game of the 2006 World Series and delivered the ceremonial first pitch ball to President Barack Obama at the 2009 Major League Baseball All-Star Game.[173] A "Stan the Man" day was held in his honor by the Cardinals on May 18, 2008.[174] In 2010, another one of the Cardinals' greatest sluggers, Albert Pujols, whose nickname was "El Hombre", said he didn't want to be called "The Man", even in Spanish, because "There is one man that gets that respect, and that is Stan Musial." [96] Also in 2010, the Cardinals launched a campaign to build support for awarding Musial the Presidential Medal of Freedom for his lifetime of achievement and service.[175] The campaign realized its goal, and on February 15, 2011, Musial was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Barack Obama[176][177] who called him "an icon untarnished, a beloved pillar of the community, a gentleman you'd want your kids to emulate."[178]
On October 17, 2012, Musial made his final appearance at Busch Stadium, riding in a golf cart around the warning track before Game 4 of the National League Championship Series. Musial stopped at both dugouts and greeted San Francisco Giants manager Bruce Bochy and Cardinals manager Mike Matheny. The Cardinals would go on to win Game 4 by a score of 8-3, but lost the pennant to the eventual World Series champion Giants.

Death[edit]
On January 19, 2013, Musial died at age 92 of natural causes at his home in Ladue, Missouri, on the same day that fellow MLB Hall of Fame inductee Earl Weaver passed away.[181][182] Musial was surrounded by his family as he died peacefully. Cardinals owner Bill DeWitt, Jr. released the following statement:

We have lost the most beloved member of the Cardinals family. Stan Musial was the greatest player in Cardinals history and one of the best players in the history of baseball. The entire Cardinals organization extends its sincere condolences to Stan's family, including his children Richard, Gerry, Janet and Jean, as well as his eleven grandchildren and twelve great grandchildren. We join fans everywhere in mourning the loss of our dear friend and reflect on how fortunate we all are to have known 'Stan the Man'.[183]

Upon hearing the news of his death, fans gathered and began an impromptu memorial at his statue outside Busch Stadium; the Cardinals issued a release saying the memorial would be left in place for some time.[184] In a laudatory obituary, The New York Times quoted famed New York manager Leo Durocher: "There is only one way to pitch to Musial—under the plate."[185]
Missouri Governor Jay Nixon commented: "Stan Musial was a great American hero who—with the utmost humility—inspired us all to aim high and dream big. The world is emptier today without him, but far better to have known him. The legacy of 'baseball's perfect warrior' will endure and inspire generations to come."[186]
St. Louis Mayor Francis Slay tweeted: "Sad as we are, we are fortunate to have had Stan in STL for so long, and are also glad that Stan and Lil are together again." He ordered flags at half-mast in the city.[187]
"Major League Baseball has lost one of its true legends in Stan Musial, a Hall of Famer in every sense and a man who led a great American life", Commissioner Bud Selig said. "He was the heart and soul of the historic St. Louis Cardinals franchise for generations, and he served his country during World War II. A recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2011, Stan's life embodies baseball's unparalleled history and why this game is the national pastime."[188]
Thousands of fans braved cold temperatures on January 24 for a public visitation at the Cathedral Basilica of Saint Louis, where Musial lay in state, dressed in his trademark cardinal-red blazer and with a harmonica in his lapel pocket, flanked by a Navy honor guard. A private funeral Mass was held on Saturday, January 26, 2013, at the New Cathedral in St. Louis, televised locally by KTVI and KPLR as well as Fox Sports Midwest on pay-television. New York's Cardinal Timothy Dolan, who in his first episcopal post served as an auxiliary bishop of the Archdiocese of Saint Louis, was the principal celebrant, and Knoxville's Bishop Richard F. Stika, Musial's former parish priest, was the homilist.[189] Bob Costas gave the principal eulogy, calling him "the genuine hero who as the years and decades passed, and disillusionment came from other directions, never once let us down", and quoting fellow Cooperstown honoree Mickey Mantle, who once said that Musial "was a better player than me because he was a better man than me".[190] Following the funeral, Musial's family led a procession from the New Cathedral to Busch Stadium, where they laid a memorial wreath at his statue. Once the wreath was placed and Musial's family began to walk back to their vehicles, the hundreds of Cardinal fans gathered for the wreath ceremony gave both Musial and his family one final salute. That salute was the fans singing "Take Me Out to the Ball Game" before Musial was taken to his final place of rest.
Musial was the last living member of the Cardinals team that won the 1942 World Series. At the time of his death, no living players had played on an earlier World Series-winning team.
The Stan Musial Veterans Memorial Bridge in St. Louis (carries  I‑70) was built in his memorial.
Legacy[edit]
As a reflection of his popularity, Musial has had infrastructure named after him. In May 2011 the Pennsylvania State Senate changed the name of the bridge that carries the C. Vance Deicas Memorial Highway (S.R. 1077) over the Monongahela River from Donora-Monessen Bridge to Stan Musial Bridge after Musial who was a native of the area.[191] In October 2013 the St. Louis Fire Department started operating a fireboat named after Musial.[192] In July 2013, the new Interstate 70 bridge over the Mississippi River between Illinois and Missouri at St. Louis received the official name of "Stan Musial Veterans Memorial Bridge"[193]

Stanley Frank Musial (/ˈmjuːziəl/ or /ˈmjuːʒəl/; born Stanisław Franciszek Musiał; November 21, 1920 – January 19, 2013), nicknamed Stan the Man, was an American Major League Baseball (MLB) outfielder and first baseman. He spent 22 seasons playing for the St. Louis Cardinals, from 1941 to 1944 and 1946 to 1963. Widely considered to be one of the greatest and most consistent hitters in baseball history,[1] Musial was a first-ballot inductee into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1969, and was also selected to the St. Louis Cardinals Hall of Fame in the inaugural class of 2014.
Musial batted .331 over the course of his career and set National League (NL) records for career hits (3,630), runs batted in (1,951), games played (3,026), at bats (10,972), runs scored (1,949) and doubles (725), his 475 career home runs then ranked second in NL history behind Mel Ott's total of 511. His 6,134 total bases remained a major league record until surpassed by Hank Aaron, and his hit total still ranks fourth all-time, and is the highest by any player who spent his career with only one team. A seven-time batting champion with identical totals of 1,815 hits at home and 1,815 hits on the road, he was named the National League's (NL) Most Valuable Player (MVP) three times and led St. Louis to three World Series championships. He also shares the major league record for the most All-Star Games played (24) with Hank Aaron and Willie Mays.[a] [2]
Musial was born in Donora, Pennsylvania, where he frequently played baseball informally or in organized settings, and eventually played on the baseball team at Donora High School. Signed to a professional contract by the St. Louis Cardinals as a pitcher in 1938, Musial was converted into an outfielder prior to his major league debut in 1941. Noted for his unique batting stance, he quickly established himself as a consistent and productive hitter. In his first full season, 1942, the Cardinals won the World Series. The following year, he led the NL in six different offensive categories and earned his first MVP award. He was also named to the NL All-Star squad for the first time; he appeared in every All-Star game in every subsequent season he played.[3] Musial won his second World Series championship in 1944, then missed the entire 1945 season while serving in the Navy.
After completing his military service during the war, Musial returned to baseball in 1946 and resumed his consistent hitting. That year he earned his second MVP award and third World Series title. His third MVP award came in 1948, when he finished one home run short of winning baseball's Triple Crown. After struggling offensively in 1959, Musial used a personal trainer to help maintain his productivity until he decided to retire in 1963. At the time of his retirement, he held or shared 17 major league records, 29 National League records, and nine All-Star Game records. Ironically, in 1964, the season following his retirement, the Cardinals went on to defeat the New York Yankees in an epic 7-game clash, for St. Louis' first World Series championship in nearly two decades (a team which included future Hall of Famer Lou Brock performing what would have likely been Musial's left field duties).[4] In addition to overseeing businesses, such as a restaurant both before and after his playing career, Musial served as the Cardinals' general manager in 1967, winning the pennant and World Series, then quitting that position. He also became noted for his harmonica playing, a skill he acquired during his playing career. Known for his modesty and sportsmanship, Musial was selected for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team in 1999. In February 2011, President Barack Obama presented Musial with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, one of the highest civilian awards that can be bestowed on a person by the United States government.

Early life[edit]
Musial was born in Donora, Pennsylvania, the fifth of the six children (four girls and two boys) of Lukasz and Mary (Lancos) Musiał (/ˈmuːʃaʊ/, MOO-show).[5] His mother was of Carpatho-Rusyn descent and his father was a Polish immigrant who chose the name Stanisław Franciszek for his first son, though his father always referred to Musial using the Polish nickname Stasiu, pronounced "Stashu".[5][6] Musial frequently played baseball with his brother Ed and other friends during his childhood, and considered Lefty Grove his favorite ballplayer.[7][8] Musial also had the benefit of learning about baseball from his neighbor Joe Barbao, a former minor league pitcher.[9] When he enrolled in school, his name was formally changed to Stanley Frank Musial.[5]
At age 15 Musial joined the Donora Zincs, a semi-professional team managed by Barbao.[10] In his Zincs debut he pitched 6 innings and struck out 13 batters, all of them adults.[10] Musial also played one season on the newly revived Donora High School baseball team, where one of his teammates was Buddy Griffey, father of MLB player Ken Griffey, Sr. and grandfather to Ken Griffey, Jr.[11][12] Baseball statistician Bill James described the younger Griffey, in comparison to Musial, as "the second-best left-handed hitting, left-handed throwing outfielder ever born in Donora, Pennsylvania, on November 21."[13] His exploits as a rising player in Pennsylvania earned him the nickname "The Donora Greyhound".[14]
Musial also played basketball and was offered an athletic scholarship in that sport by the University of Pittsburgh.[10][15] Meanwhile, the St. Louis Cardinals had scouted Musial as a pitcher and, in 1937, offered him a professional contract after a workout with their Class D Penn State League affiliate.[16] Musial's father initially resisted the idea of his son pursuing a baseball career, but reluctantly gave his consent after lobbying by both Musial and his mother.[17] Musial also credited his school librarian Helen Kloz for pointing out that baseball was his dream and advising him to pursue it professionally.[17] In what was then a common practice, the Cardinals did not file the contract with the baseball commissioner's office until June 1938. This preserved Musial's amateur eligibility, and he was still able to participate in high school sports, leading Donora High School's basketball team to a playoff appearance.[18] He then reported to the Cardinals' Class D affiliate in West Virginia, the Williamson Red Birds.[19][20]
Professional baseball career[edit]
Minor leagues (1938–41)[edit]
Musial's rookie year with Williamson in 1938 was a period of adjustment both on and off the field. He began gaining more in-depth knowledge about baseball strategy[21] while posting a 6–6 win–loss record and a 4.66 earned run average (ERA), to go along with a .258 batting average.[22] Off the field, he experienced feelings of homesickness while learning to live comfortably and independently on his $65-per-month salary.[21] Musial finished his high school education before returning to Williamson in spring 1939. That season his numbers improved to a 9–2 record, a 4.30 ERA, and a .352 batting average.[23][24]
Musial spent the 1940 season with the Cardinals' other Class D team, the Daytona Beach Islanders, where he developed a lifelong friendship with manager Dickie Kerr.[25] His pitching skills improved under the guidance of Kerr, who also recognized his hitting talent, playing him in the outfield between pitching starts.[26] On May 25, 1940, Musial married fellow Donora resident, Lillian "Lil" Labash, in Daytona Beach, and the couple's first child followed in August.[27] During late August, Musial suffered a shoulder injury while playing in the outfield, and later made an early exit as the starting pitcher in a 12–5 playoff game loss.[28] For a while Musial considered leaving baseball entirely, complaining that he could not afford to support himself and his wife on the $16 a week pay. Kerr talked him out of it, and even took the Musials into his own home to relieve the financial burden. To repay the debt Musial bought Kerr a $20,000 home in Houston in 1958.[29] In 113 games in 1940 he hit .311, while compiling an 18–5 pitching record that included 176 strikeouts and 145 walks.[30][31]
Musial was assigned to the Class AA Columbus Red Birds to begin 1941, though manager, Burt Shotton, and Musial himself quickly realized that the previous year's injury had considerably weakened his arm.[32] He was reassigned to the Class C Springfield Cardinals as a full-time outfielder, and he later credited manager Ollie Vanek for displaying confidence in his hitting ability.[33] During 87 games with Springfield, Musial hit a league-leading .379 before being promoted to the Rochester Red Wings of the International League.[34] He was noted for his unique batting stance, a crouch in which his back was seemingly square to the pitcher.[35] This stance was later described by pitcher Ted Lyons as "a kid peeking around the corner to see if the cops were coming".[36] According to a 1950 description by author Tom Meany, "The bent knees and the crouch give him the appearance of a coiled spring, although most pitchers think of him as a coiled rattlesnake."[37] Musial continued to play well in Rochester—in one three-game stretch, he had 11 hits. He was called up to the Cardinals for the last two weeks of the 1941 season.[38]
Major leagues (1941–44)[edit]

Musial made his major league debut during the second game of a doubleheader at Sportsman's Park on September 17, 1941.[39] The Cardinals were in the midst of a pennant race with the Brooklyn Dodgers; in 12 games, Musial collected 20 hits for a .426 batting average.[40] Despite Musial's late contributions, the Cardinals finished two and one-half games behind the 100-game-winning Dodgers.[41]
Cardinals manager Billy Southworth used Musial as a left fielder to begin 1942, sometimes lifting him for a pinch-hitter against left-handed pitching.[42] Musial was hitting .315 by late June,[43] as the Cardinals resumed battling the Dodgers for first place in the National League (NL).[44] The Cardinals took sole possession of first place on September 13, and when Musial caught a fly ball to end the first game of a doubleheader on September 27 they clinched the pennant with their 105th win.[45] He finished the season with a .315 batting average and 72 runs batted in (RBI) in 140 games. Musial received national publicity when he was named by St. Louis Post-Dispatch sports editor J. Roy Stockton as his choice for Rookie of the Year in a Saturday Evening Post article.[46][47]
The Cardinals played the American League champion New York Yankees in the 1942 World Series.[48] Representing the winning run at home plate in the bottom of the ninth inning of Game 1 at Sportsman's Park, Musial grounded out with the bases loaded to end the game .[49] Musial's first hit of the Series was an RBI single that provided the margin of victory in Game 2, allowing the Cardinals to tie the Series.[50] Over the next three games at Yankee Stadium, Musial had three more hits as the Cardinals defeated the Yankees in the Series four games to one.[51] Musial batted .222 for the Series, with two runs scored.[52]
Musial's 1943 season started with a brief contract holdout in spring training.[53] He made the National League All-Star team for the first time as a starting left fielder and got a double in the All-Star Game on July 13.[53] He finished the season leading the major leagues in hitting with a .357 batting average and led the NL in hits (220), doubles (48), triples (20), total bases (347), on-base percentage (.425), and slugging percentage (.562).[54] This performance earned him his first NL Most Valuable Player Award, ahead of teammate and catcher Walker Cooper (.318 batting average).[54] After romping to another NL pennant by 18 games, the Cardinals again faced the Yankees in the 1943 World Series.[55] Musial had a single in the Cardinals' Game 1 loss, and scored a run in a Game 2 win.[55] The Cardinals did not win another game in the Series, but the loser's bonus share paid to each Cardinals player ($4,321.99) still amounted to nearly two-thirds of Musial's regular season salary.[56]
United States involvement in World War II began to impinge on Musial's baseball career in 1944, as he underwent a physical examination in prelude to possible service in the armed forces.[57] He ultimately remained with the Cardinals for the entire season, posting a .347 batting average with 197 hits.[58][59] The Cardinals claimed the NL pennant for the third consecutive season, and faced St. Louis's other major league team, the Browns, in the 1944 World Series.[60] The Browns took a 2–1 lead, while Musial hit .250 with zero RBI.[61] He broke out in Game 4 with a two-run home run, single, double, and a walk as part of a 5–1 Cardinals win.[61] The Cardinals went on to defeat the Browns in six games, and Musial posted a .304 batting average for the Series.[62][63]
Sojourn in the U.S. Navy (1945–46)[edit]
Musial enlisted in the United States Navy on January 23, 1945, during World War II. He was initially assigned to noncombat duty at the Naval Training Station in Bainbridge, Maryland.[64] In June 1945, he was assigned to Special Services in Hawaii, and was assigned to a ferry launch unit to bring back damaged ship crews entering Pearl Harbor where he was able to play baseball every afternoon in the naval base's eight-team league.[65] After being granted emergency leave to see his ailing father in January 1946, he was briefly assigned to the Philadelphia Navy Yard before his honorable discharge from the Navy as a Seaman Second Class in March 1946.[65][66]
In 2007, Musial received the Navy Memorial's Lone Sailor Award, which honors Navy veterans who have excelled in civilian life.

1946–49[edit]


"Every time Stan came up they chanted, 'Here comes the man!'"

—Cardinals traveling secretary Leo Ward relates Dodger fans' nickname for Musial to sportswriter Bob Broeg[67]
Rejoining the Cardinals under new manager Eddie Dyer, Musial posted a .388 batting average by the middle of May 1946.[68] He also became close friends with new teammate Red Schoendienst, who had joined the Cardinals during Musial's absence in 1945.[69] During the season, Musial (who was under contract to the Cardinals for $13,500 in 1946) was offered a five-year, $125,000 contract, plus a $50,000 bonus, to join the Mexican League.[70] He declined the offer, and after manager Dyer spoke to club owner Sam Breadon, Musial was given a $5,000 raise later in 1946.[71]
It was also during the 1946 season that Musial acquired his nickname of Stan the Man.[67] During the June 23 game against the Dodgers at Ebbets Field, St. Louis Post-Dispatch sportswriter Bob Broeg heard Dodger fans chanting whenever Musial came to bat, but could not understand the words.[67][72] Later that day over dinner, Broeg asked Cardinals traveling secretary Leo Ward if he had understood what the Dodger fans had been chanting.[67] Ward said, "Every time Stan came up they chanted, 'Here comes the man!'" "'That man,' you mean", Broeg said. "No, the man", replied Ward.[67] Broeg mentioned this story in his Post-Dispatch column, and Musial was thereafter known as Stan "The Man".[67]




Musial on the cover of Baseball Digest, September 1948


In June 1946, Dyer began to use Musial as a first baseman.[73] The Cardinals finished the season tied with the Dodgers,[74] prompting a three-game playoff for the pennant. Musial's Game 1 triple and Game 2 double contributed to the Cardinals' two-games-to-none series victory.[75] Facing the Boston Red Sox, the Cardinals won the 1946 World Series four games to three,[76] as Musial had six hits and four RBI.[77] He batted .365 for the season and won his second NL MVP Award, receiving 22 out of a possible 24 first-place votes, finishing ahead of Brooklyn's Dixie Walker (.319 batting average).[78]
Musial began the 1947 season by hitting .146 in April.[79] On May 9, team doctor Dr. Robert Hyland confirmed a previous diagnosis of appendicitis, while discovering that Musial was concurrently suffering from tonsillitis.[80] He received treatment, but did not have either his appendix or tonsils surgically removed until after the season ended.[81] Despite his health woes, he finished the year with a batting average of .312.[82]
Fully recovered from his ailments, Musial recorded his 1,000th career hit on April 25, 1948.[83] After a May 7 St. Louis Globe-Democrat article criticized baseball players for appearing in cigarette advertisements, he made a personal decision to never again appear in such ads.[84] By June 24, his batting average was .408, prompting Brooklyn pitcher Preacher Roe to comically announce his new method for retiring Musial: "Walk him on four pitches and pick him off first."[85] Given a mid-season pay raise by new Cardinals owner Robert E. Hannegan for his outstanding performance, Musial hit a home run in the All-Star Game.[86] On September 22, he registered five hits in a game for the fourth time in the season, tying a mark set by Ty Cobb in 1922.[87]


"He missed tying for the top in homers by one rained out home run. If it had counted, he would have won the Triple Crown that year...and in addition have been the only player of this century to lead the league in runs, hits, double, triples, and slugging percentage. What a year!"

—Sportswriter Bob Broeg, on Musial's 1948 season[88]
Musial finished the 1948 season leading the major leagues in batting average (.376), hits (230), doubles (46), triples (18), total bases (429), and slugging percentage (.702).[89] Winning the NL batting title by a 43-point margin, with an on-base percentage lead of 27 points and a 138-point slugging percentage margin—the latter being the largest gap since Rogers Hornsby's 1925 season—Musial became the first player to win three NL MVP awards.[89] If a home run he hit during a rained out game had been counted in his season totals, he would have won the Triple Crown by leading the NL in batting average, home runs, and runs batted in.[89][90]
Anticipating life after his baseball career, Musial began the first of several business partnerships with Julius "Biggie" Garagnani in January 1949, opening "Stan Musial & Biggie's" restaurant.[91][92] He approached the 1949 season with the intent to try to hit more home runs, stating he had hit 39 the previous season "without trying".[93] His new focus on hitting for power backfired, as pitchers began using the outside part of the plate to induce him to ground out to the first or second baseman.[93] Musial soon stopped focusing on hitting home runs and resumed his consistent offensive production by the end of May.[93] He received his sixth consecutive All-Star player selection and finished the season leading the NL in hits (207) while playing in every game.[94] However, the Cardinals, with 96 wins, finished one game behind the Dodgers.[95]
In the late 1940s, when baseball was slowly becoming integrated, Musial—along with his roommate Red Schoendienst—would be lauded by newcomers such as Dodgers' pitcher Don Newcombe for their tolerance. "They never...had the need to sit in the dugout and call a black guy a bunch of names", Newcombe said, "because he was trying to change the game and make it what it should have been in the first place, a game for all people."[96]
1950–54[edit]
Musial began the 1950s by posting a .350 batting average before participating in the 1950 All-Star Game, where in fan balloting he was the NL's number two choice.[97] He had the longest hitting streak of his career during the 1950 season—a 30-game stretch that ended on July 27.[97] With the Cardinals falling 14 games out of first place by September, manager Dyer used him at first base and all three outfield positions.[97][98] New Cardinals manager Marty Marion led the team to a third-place finish in 1951, while Musial was named The Sporting News Major League Player of the Year.[99]


"No man has ever been a perfect ballplayer. Stan Musial, however, is the closest to being perfect in the game today.... He plays as hard when his club is away out in front of a game as he does when they're just a run or two behind."

—Ty Cobb, on Musial in a 1952 Life magazine article[100]
National media attention inadvertently turned to Musial a month before the 1952 season began, after Ty Cobb wrote an article regarding modern baseball players that was published in Life magazine.[100] Cobb singled out Musial and Phil Rizzuto as the only players "who can be mentioned in the same breath with the oldtime greats".[100] Cobb went on to refer to Musial as "a better player than Joe DiMaggio was in his prime."[100] In response, Musial displayed his characteristic modesty, saying, "Cobb is baseball's greatest. I don't want to contradict him, but I can't say that I was ever as good as Joe DiMaggio."[100]
The only major league pitching appearance of Musial's career occurred as a publicity stunt during the last Cardinals home game of the 1952 season.[101][102] Manager Eddie Stanky had a reluctant Musial pitch to Frank Baumholtz, the runner-up to Musial for the best batting average in the NL that season.[101] With Baumholtz batting right-handed for the first time in his career, Musial's first pitch was hit so hard it ricocheted off the shin of third baseman Solly Hemus and into the left field corner.[101] The play was ruled an error, and Musial was embarrassed enough by his complicity in the gimmick to avoid pitching again for the remainder of his career.[101]
The Cardinals franchise was up for sale in early 1953, and Musial and Schoendienst advised their friend and fellow duck-hunter Gussie Busch to consider buying the team.[103] Busch used the resources of the Anheuser-Busch company to purchase the Cardinals, keeping Musial in St. Louis by averting the possibility of a move by the team to another city.[103][104] The 1953 season marked Musial's 10th NL All-Star selection, and the 12th consecutive time he finished a major league season with a batting average above .300.[46][105]
Musial accomplished another historical feat on May 2, 1954, in a doubleheader in St. Louis against the New York Giants: he hit three home runs in the first contest, then added two more in the second to become the first major leaguer to hit five home runs in a doubleheader.[106] In addition to his five home runs, he also hit a single in the first game, setting a new record of 21 total bases for a doubleheader.[106] The only player besides Musial to hit five home runs in a doubleheader is Nate Colbert, who achieved the feat in 1972.[107]
1955–59[edit]
Musial made his 12th NL All-Star appearance in 1955 as a reserve player, when Cincinnati's Ted Kluszewski outpolled him by 150,000 votes to get on the starting lineup at first base.[108] Musial entered the game as a pinch hitter in the fourth inning, and played left field as the game entered extra innings.[109] Leading off the bottom of the 12th, he hit a home run to give the NL a 6–5 victory.[109]




Musial in 1957


The 1956 season marked another milestone for Musial, when he broke Mel Ott's NL record for extra-base hits on August 12.[110] Earlier that season, Cardinals general manager "Trader Frank" Lane began negotiations to trade him for Philadelphia pitcher Robin Roberts.[111] When Cardinals owner Gussie Busch learned of the possible move, he made it clear that Musial was not available for any trade.[112] Instead, Lane dealt Musial's close friend Schoendienst to the New York Giants; an upset Musial made no immediate comment to the press.[113]
On June 11, 1957, Musial tied the NL record for consecutive games played with his 822nd, a streak that began on the last day of the 1951 season.[114] Despite ballot stuffing by Cincinnati Reds fans, he was selected and played in the All-Star Game held at Sportsman's Park.[115] When he overextended his swing while batting during a game on August 23, Musial fractured a bone in his left shoulder socket and tore muscles over his collarbone.[116] He was unable to play again until September 8, ending his consecutive games-played streak at 895.[116] He finished 1957 as Sports Illustrated's "Sportsman of the Year".[117]


"Line drive! Into left field! Hit number three thousand! A run has scored! Musial around first, on his way to second with a double. Holy Cow! He came through!"

—Harry Caray's radio play-by-play call of Musial's 3,000th major league hit[118]
Musial signed one of the first $100,000 contracts in NL history on January 29, 1958. (According to Baseball Almanac, Hank Greenberg was the first with Pittsburgh in 1947.)[119] He quickly demonstrated a return on the investment by sharing with Willie Mays the inaugural (and for the only time in Musial's career) NL Player of the Month in May (no such award was given in April until 1969) batting .374, with 4 HR, and 16 RBI. Also that month, as he was approaching the 3,000-hit milestone in his major league career, he expressed a desire to record the hit in St. Louis.[120] He ultimately reached the mark with a pinch-hit, sixth inning RBI double at Chicago's Wrigley Field on May 13.[121][122] The eighth major league player to reach 3,000 hits, and the first to reach the milestone with an extra-base hit, Musial was greeted at St. Louis Union Station that evening by roughly 1,000 fans.[123] Finishing the season in sixth place, the Cardinals embarked on an exhibition tour of Japan, winning 14 of 16 games against top players from the Central and Pacific Japanese Leagues.[124]
Taking a new approach to preparation for the 1959 season, Musial was given permission to report late to spring training so that he might conserve his energy for the duration of the year.[125] Musial, at 6 feet (180 cm) tall, had maintained a weight of around 175 pounds (79 kg) throughout his career. He reported to spring training approximately 10 pounds (4.5 kg) overweight and in substandard physical condition.[126][127] He began the season with one hit in 15 at-bats.[127] Despite his early offensive struggles, he single-handedly spoiled potential no-hitters on April 16 and 19.[127] A game-winning home run on May 7 made him the first major league player ever with 400 home runs and 3,000 hits.[127] As he continued to hit at a relatively low pace, his playing time was limited by Cardinals manager Solly Hemus at various points during the season.[128] Seeking more revenue for the players' pension fund, Major League Baseball held two All-Star games in a season for the first time through 1962.[129] Musial made his 16th All-Star appearance (16th season)[3] and pinch-hit in both contests, flying out in the July 7 game and drawing a walk in the August 3 game.[129] He finished the season with 115 regular game appearances, a .255 batting average, 37 runs, and a slugging percentage of .428.[46]
During the 1959 season, John F. Kennedy approached Musial about supporting Kennedy's campaign for President, citing their close ages. Musial campaigned for Kennedy later that year and became a supporter of the Democrat.[130]
On June 30, 1959, Musial was the batter in one of the oddest plays in baseball history. In a game between the Cardinals and Chicago Cubs, he was at the plate with a count of 3–1. Bob Anderson's next pitch was errant, evading catcher Sammy Taylor and rolling all the way to the backstop. Umpire Vic Delmore called ball four, even as Anderson and Taylor contended that Musial had foul tipped the ball. Because the ball was still in play and Delmore was embroiled in an argument with the catcher and pitcher, Musial kept running in attempt to make second base. Seeing that Musial was trying for second, Alvin Dark ran to the backstop to retrieve the ball. The ball wound up in the hands of field announcer Pat Pieper, but Dark ended up getting it back anyway. Absentmindedly, however, Delmore pulled out a new ball and gave it to Taylor. Anderson finally noticed that Musial was trying for second, took the new ball, and threw it to second baseman Tony Taylor. Anderson's throw flew over Taylor's head into the outfield. Dark, at the same time that Anderson threw the new ball, threw the original ball to shortstop Ernie Banks. Musial did not see Dark's throw and only noticed Anderson's ball fly over the second baseman's head, so he tried to go to third base. On his way there, he was tagged by Banks, and after a delay he was ruled out.[131]
1960–63[edit]
Based on his 1959 performance, Musial accepted a pay cut in 1960 from his previous $100,000 salary to $80,000.[132] He was eager to prove that his mediocre performance was the result of improper physical conditioning, and he enlisted the help of Walter Eberhardt, Saint Louis University's director of physical education.[133] In June 1960, newspaper articles began speculating that Musial would soon retire, yet he finished the season with a .275 batting average.[46][134] He addressed the speculation in September, confirming that he would play again in 1961. His .288 batting average that season reaffirmed his decision.[46][135] In 1962, Musial posted a .330 batting average, good for third in the batting race, with 19 homers and 82 RBI. As a pinch-hitter, he had 14 base hits in 19 at-bats (.737).[136] Along the way, he established new NL career marks for hits, RBI, and runs scored. That same year on July 8, the 41-year-old Musial became the oldest player ever to hit three home runs in one game.





Stan Musial's number 6 was retired by the St. Louis Cardinals in 1963.


The Cardinals began 1963 by winning 10 of their first 15 games, as Musial posted a .237 batting average.[137] He set a new major league record for career extra-base hits on May 8 and improved his batting average to .277 by the end of the month.[138] Making his 20th All-Star appearance[3] and 24th All-Star Game appearance on July 9, 1963, he pinch-hit in the fifth inning.[138] Asked by general manager Bing Devine on July 26 what his plans were, Musial said that he would retire at season's end.[139] He waited until the Cardinals team picnic on August 12 to publicly announce his decision, hopeful he could retire on a winning note.[140]
Musial became a grandfather for the first time in the early hours of September 10; later that day, he hit a home run in his first at-bat.[141] After sweeping a doubleheader on September 15, the Cardinals had won 19 of their last 20 games, and were one game behind the Los Angeles Dodgers.[141] The Dodgers then swept the Cardinals in a three-game series in St. Louis and clinched the NL pennant on September 25.[142] Musial's last game, on September 29, 1963, was preceded by an hour-long retirement ceremony.[143] Speakers at the event included baseball commissioner Ford Frick, Cardinals broadcaster Harry Caray, and Cardinals owner Gussie Busch, who announced that Musial's uniform number "6" would be retired by the team.[143] During the game, Musial recorded a single in the fourth inning, then hit a single to right field that scored teammate Curt Flood in the sixth.[144] Cardinals manager Johnny Keane brought in Gary Kolb as a pinch-runner for Musial, bringing his major league career to an end.[144] Just as he had recorded two base hits in his major league debut, Musial finished his last game with two hits, as well.[144] Musial finished with the all-time National League hits record and second to only Ty Cobb on the all-time Major League list. Musial's last career hit was out of reach of Cincinnati Reds second baseman Pete Rose, who would go on to break Cobb's record to become baseball's all-time hit king.


"All Musial represents is more than two decades of sustained excellence and complete decency as a human being."

—Broadcaster Bob Costas, on Musial[35]
At the time of his retirement, Musial held or shared 17 major league records, 29 NL records, and nine All-Star Game records.[145] Among those records, he ranked as the major league career leader in extra-base hits (1,377) and total bases (6,134).[144] He also held NL career marks in categories such as hits (3,630), games played (3,026), doubles (725), and RBI (1,951).[144] He finished his career with 475 home runs despite never having led the NL in the category.[144] Jerry Lansche speculates Musial would likely have become the second player, after Babe Ruth, with 2,000 RBI, and would have exceeded 500 career home runs had he not served in the military.[146] His lowest full season RBI output before the war was 72 (in 1942) and as he needed only 49 RBI to reach 2,000 for his full career, he certainly would have exceeded 2,000 RBI by playing without injury in 1945. His home run production is a different story and it is highly unlikely he would have reached 500. He did not hit more than 13 home runs in any season before he entered the navy and did not hit as many as 25 (the number he would have needed to become a 500 career homer club member) until 1948, 3 years after returning to baseball from World War II. His career hit total was evenly split between 1,815 hits at home and 1,815 hits on the road.[36] Steven R. Bullock speculates that it is possible that without military service Musial might have continued playing to attempt to exceed Ty Cobb's career hit record of 4,191.[146] Even if Musial had hit safely 207 times (the average of his hits in the 2 years before and the 2 years after his service in the navy) in 1945, he still would have been 354 hits short of tying Ty. His hit total in his last season at age 42 was only 86; even if he could have had 103 hits a season (the average of his last 5 seasons) he would have had to play to age 47 to attain the hits record.
He was the first major league player to appear in more than 1,000 games at two different positions, registering 1,896 games in the outfield and 1,016 at first base.[147] Since Musial's retirement in 1963, Tony Gwynn has been the only player to finish his career with a higher lifetime batting average. Hank Aaron has been the only player to surpass his record of 6,134 total bases.
In Musial's 3,026 major league appearances, he was never ejected from a game.[148] Speaking about his quiet reputation within the sport's history, sportscaster Bob Costas said, "He didn't hit a homer in his last at-bat; he hit a single. He didn't hit in 56 straight games. He married his high school sweetheart and stayed married to her. ... All Musial represents is more than two decades of sustained excellence and complete decency as a human being."[35]
Post-playing career and family life[edit]
Musial was named a vice president of the St. Louis Cardinals in September 1963, and he remained in that position until after the 1966 season.[149] From February 1964 to January 1967, he also served as President Lyndon Johnson's physical fitness adviser, a part-time position created to promote better fitness among American citizens.[150] Before the 1967 season began, the Cardinals named Musial the team's general manager, and he oversaw the club's World Series championship that year.[149] He won the allegiance of Cardinals players by making fair offers from the outset of player-contract negotiations and creating an in-stadium babysitting service so players' wives could attend games.[151] His longtime business partner Biggie Garagnani died in June 1967, prompting Musial to devote more time to managing his restaurant and other business interests.[152] He came to realize that the detail-oriented desk job was not his forte. He consequently decided to step down as general manager, before even completing a full year on the job.[152]
Musial—like Phil Linz—was noted for his harmonica playing, which included his rendition of "Take Me Out to the Ball Game".[153] Through the 1990s, he frequently played the harmonica at public gatherings, such as the annual Baseball Hall of Fame induction ceremony and various charity events.[154] He performed on the television show Hee Haw and in 1994 recorded 18 songs that were sold in tandem with a harmonica-playing instruction booklet.[154]
Even though Musial left Donora after high school, he retained close ties to the town throughout the rest of his life. He maintained membership in local social clubs, and regularly sent a local doctor boxes of autographed baseballs, with the town's mayor using some for United Way fundraising.[155] Musial also gave free meals at the restaurant he owned in St. Louis to any customers who presented valid ID proving they were Donora residents.[156]
Musial met Lillian Susan Labash, the daughter of a local grocer,[155] in Donora when both were 15, and married her in St. Paul's Catholic Church in Daytona Beach, Florida on May 25, 1940. They had four children: son Richard, and daughters Gerry, Janet, and Jeanie.[148][157] Lillian Musial died at 91, on May 3, 2012; their marriage had lasted for almost 72 years.[158] In his final years, Musial suffered from Alzheimer's disease.
Honors and recognition[edit]


"Here stands baseball's perfect warrior. Here stands baseball's perfect knight."

—Quote inscribed on the base of Musial's statue, attributed to former commissioner Ford Frick[159]
On August 4, 1968, a statue of Musial was erected outside of Busch Memorial Stadium on the northeast grounds of the St. Louis stadium.[152] The statue was moved from its original location to the west side of the new Busch Stadium for its first season in 2006, where it became a popular meeting place for generations of Cardinals fans.[160] Musial's statue is inscribed with a quote attributed to former baseball commissioner Ford Frick: "Here stands baseball's perfect warrior. Here stands baseball's perfect knight."[152]
Musial was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility in 1969, when he was named on 93.2 percent of the ballots.[161] On June 14, 1973 he was the first inductee into the National Polish-American Hall of Fame, housed at St. Mary's College in Orchard Lake, Michigan. In 1989, he was inducted into the St. Louis Walk of Fame.[162] Five years later, a baseball field was named after him in his hometown of Donora.[163] He was ranked tenth on The Sporting News' list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players published in 1998.[164] He was also one of the 30 players selected to the Major League Baseball All-Century Team, added by a special committee after he finished 11th in fan voting among outfielders.[165] In 2000, he was inducted into the Hall of Famous Missourians, and a bronze bust depicting him is on permanent display in the rotunda of the Missouri State Capitol.[166] In January, 2014, the Cardinals announced Musial among 22 former players and personnel to be inducted into the St. Louis Cardinals Hall of Fame Museum for the inaugural class of 2014.[167]




President Barack Obama awards the 2010 Presidential Medal of Freedom to Stan Musial in a ceremony in the East Room of the White House February 15, 2011.


Nearly two decades after Musial retired, baseball statistician Bill James and the sabermetrics movement began providing new ways of comparing players across baseball history.[168] In 2001, James ranked Musial the tenth-greatest baseball player in history, and the second-best left fielder of all time.[169] According to Baseball-Reference.com, he ranks fifth all-time among hitters on the Black Ink Test, and third all-time on the Gray Ink Test—measures designed to compare players of different eras.[46][170] He ranks first on Baseball-Reference's Hall of Fame Monitor Test, and is tied for second in the Hall of Fame Career Standards Test.[46] Despite his statistical accomplishments, he is sometimes referred to as the most underrated or overlooked athlete in modern American sports history.[171][172] For instance, in his analysis of baseball's under- and overrated players in 2007, sportswriter Jayson Stark said, "I can't think of any all-time great in any sport who gets left out of more who's-the-greatest conversations than Stan Musial."[171]
Musial threw out the first pitch in the fifth game of the 2006 World Series and delivered the ceremonial first pitch ball to President Barack Obama at the 2009 Major League Baseball All-Star Game.[173] A "Stan the Man" day was held in his honor by the Cardinals on May 18, 2008.[174] In 2010, another one of the Cardinals' greatest sluggers, Albert Pujols, whose nickname was "El Hombre", said he didn't want to be called "The Man", even in Spanish, because "There is one man that gets that respect, and that is Stan Musial." [96] Also in 2010, the Cardinals launched a campaign to build support for awarding Musial the Presidential Medal of Freedom for his lifetime of achievement and service.[175] The campaign realized its goal, and on February 15, 2011, Musial was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Barack Obama[176][177] who called him "an icon untarnished, a beloved pillar of the community, a gentleman you'd want your kids to emulate."[178]
On October 17, 2012, Musial made his final appearance at Busch Stadium, riding in a golf cart around the warning track before Game 4 of the National League Championship Series. Musial stopped at both dugouts and greeted San Francisco Giants manager Bruce Bochy and Cardinals manager Mike Matheny. The Cardinals would go on to win Game 4 by a score of 8-3, but lost the pennant to the eventual World Series champion Giants.

Death[edit]
On January 19, 2013, Musial died at age 92 of natural causes at his home in Ladue, Missouri, on the same day that fellow MLB Hall of Fame inductee Earl Weaver passed away.[181][182] Musial was surrounded by his family as he died peacefully. Cardinals owner Bill DeWitt, Jr. released the following statement:

We have lost the most beloved member of the Cardinals family. Stan Musial was the greatest player in Cardinals history and one of the best players in the history of baseball. The entire Cardinals organization extends its sincere condolences to Stan's family, including his children Richard, Gerry, Janet and Jean, as well as his eleven grandchildren and twelve great grandchildren. We join fans everywhere in mourning the loss of our dear friend and reflect on how fortunate we all are to have known 'Stan the Man'.[183]

Upon hearing the news of his death, fans gathered and began an impromptu memorial at his statue outside Busch Stadium; the Cardinals issued a release saying the memorial would be left in place for some time.[184] In a laudatory obituary, The New York Times quoted famed New York manager Leo Durocher: "There is only one way to pitch to Musial—under the plate."[185]
Missouri Governor Jay Nixon commented: "Stan Musial was a great American hero who—with the utmost humility—inspired us all to aim high and dream big. The world is emptier today without him, but far better to have known him. The legacy of 'baseball's perfect warrior' will endure and inspire generations to come."[186]
St. Louis Mayor Francis Slay tweeted: "Sad as we are, we are fortunate to have had Stan in STL for so long, and are also glad that Stan and Lil are together again." He ordered flags at half-mast in the city.[187]
"Major League Baseball has lost one of its true legends in Stan Musial, a Hall of Famer in every sense and a man who led a great American life", Commissioner Bud Selig said. "He was the heart and soul of the historic St. Louis Cardinals franchise for generations, and he served his country during World War II. A recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2011, Stan's life embodies baseball's unparalleled history and why this game is the national pastime."[188]
Thousands of fans braved cold temperatures on January 24 for a public visitation at the Cathedral Basilica of Saint Louis, where Musial lay in state, dressed in his trademark cardinal-red blazer and with a harmonica in his lapel pocket, flanked by a Navy honor guard. A private funeral Mass was held on Saturday, January 26, 2013, at the New Cathedral in St. Louis, televised locally by KTVI and KPLR as well as Fox Sports Midwest on pay-television. New York's Cardinal Timothy Dolan, who in his first episcopal post served as an auxiliary bishop of the Archdiocese of Saint Louis, was the principal celebrant, and Knoxville's Bishop Richard F. Stika, Musial's former parish priest, was the homilist.[189] Bob Costas gave the principal eulogy, calling him "the genuine hero who as the years and decades passed, and disillusionment came from other directions, never once let us down", and quoting fellow Cooperstown honoree Mickey Mantle, who once said that Musial "was a better player than me because he was a better man than me".[190] Following the funeral, Musial's family led a procession from the New Cathedral to Busch Stadium, where they laid a memorial wreath at his statue. Once the wreath was placed and Musial's family began to walk back to their vehicles, the hundreds of Cardinal fans gathered for the wreath ceremony gave both Musial and his family one final salute. That salute was the fans singing "Take Me Out to the Ball Game" before Musial was taken to his final place of rest.
Musial was the last living member of the Cardinals team that won the 1942 World Series. At the time of his death, no living players had played on an earlier World Series-winning team.
The Stan Musial Veterans Memorial Bridge in St. Louis (carries  I‑70) was built in his memorial.
Legacy[edit]
As a reflection of his popularity, Musial has had infrastructure named after him. In May 2011 the Pennsylvania State Senate changed the name of the bridge that carries the C. Vance Deicas Memorial Highway (S.R. 1077) over the Monongahela River from Donora-Monessen Bridge to Stan Musial Bridge after Musial who was a native of the area.[191] In October 2013 the St. Louis Fire Department started operating a fireboat named after Musial.[192] In July 2013, the new Interstate 70 bridge over the Mississippi River between Illinois and Missouri at St. Louis received the official name of "Stan Musial Veterans Memorial Bridge"[193]

Stanley Frank Musial (/ˈmjuːziəl/ or /ˈmjuːʒəl/; born Stanisław Franciszek Musiał; November 21, 1920 – January 19, 2013), nicknamed Stan the Man, was an American Major League Baseball (MLB) outfielder and first baseman. He spent 22 seasons playing for the St. Louis Cardinals, from 1941 to 1944 and 1946 to 1963. Widely considered to be one of the greatest and most consistent hitters in baseball history,[1] Musial was a first-ballot inductee into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1969, and was also selected to the St. Louis Cardinals Hall of Fame in the inaugural class of 2014.
Musial batted .331 over the course of his career and set National League (NL) records for career hits (3,630), runs batted in (1,951), games played (3,026), at bats (10,972), runs scored (1,949) and doubles (725), his 475 career home runs then ranked second in NL history behind Mel Ott's total of 511. His 6,134 total bases remained a major league record until surpassed by Hank Aaron, and his hit total still ranks fourth all-time, and is the highest by any player who spent his career with only one team. A seven-time batting champion with identical totals of 1,815 hits at home and 1,815 hits on the road, he was named the National League's (NL) Most Valuable Player (MVP) three times and led St. Louis to three World Series championships. He also shares the major league record for the most All-Star Games played (24) with Hank Aaron and Willie Mays.[a] [2]
Musial was born in Donora, Pennsylvania, where he frequently played baseball informally or in organized settings, and eventually played on the baseball team at Donora High School. Signed to a professional contract by the St. Louis Cardinals as a pitcher in 1938, Musial was converted into an outfielder prior to his major league debut in 1941. Noted for his unique batting stance, he quickly established himself as a consistent and productive hitter. In his first full season, 1942, the Cardinals won the World Series. The following year, he led the NL in six different offensive categories and earned his first MVP award. He was also named to the NL All-Star squad for the first time; he appeared in every All-Star game in every subsequent season he played.[3] Musial won his second World Series championship in 1944, then missed the entire 1945 season while serving in the Navy.
After completing his military service during the war, Musial returned to baseball in 1946 and resumed his consistent hitting. That year he earned his second MVP award and third World Series title. His third MVP award came in 1948, when he finished one home run short of winning baseball's Triple Crown. After struggling offensively in 1959, Musial used a personal trainer to help maintain his productivity until he decided to retire in 1963. At the time of his retirement, he held or shared 17 major league records, 29 National League records, and nine All-Star Game records. Ironically, in 1964, the season following his retirement, the Cardinals went on to defeat the New York Yankees in an epic 7-game clash, for St. Louis' first World Series championship in nearly two decades (a team which included future Hall of Famer Lou Brock performing what would have likely been Musial's left field duties).[4] In addition to overseeing businesses, such as a restaurant both before and after his playing career, Musial served as the Cardinals' general manager in 1967, winning the pennant and World Series, then quitting that position. He also became noted for his harmonica playing, a skill he acquired during his playing career. Known for his modesty and sportsmanship, Musial was selected for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team in 1999. In February 2011, President Barack Obama presented Musial with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, one of the highest civilian awards that can be bestowed on a person by the United States government.

Early life[edit]
Musial was born in Donora, Pennsylvania, the fifth of the six children (four girls and two boys) of Lukasz and Mary (Lancos) Musiał (/ˈmuːʃaʊ/, MOO-show).[5] His mother was of Carpatho-Rusyn descent and his father was a Polish immigrant who chose the name Stanisław Franciszek for his first son, though his father always referred to Musial using the Polish nickname Stasiu, pronounced "Stashu".[5][6] Musial frequently played baseball with his brother Ed and other friends during his childhood, and considered Lefty Grove his favorite ballplayer.[7][8] Musial also had the benefit of learning about baseball from his neighbor Joe Barbao, a former minor league pitcher.[9] When he enrolled in school, his name was formally changed to Stanley Frank Musial.[5]
At age 15 Musial joined the Donora Zincs, a semi-professional team managed by Barbao.[10] In his Zincs debut he pitched 6 innings and struck out 13 batters, all of them adults.[10] Musial also played one season on the newly revived Donora High School baseball team, where one of his teammates was Buddy Griffey, father of MLB player Ken Griffey, Sr. and grandfather to Ken Griffey, Jr.[11][12] Baseball statistician Bill James described the younger Griffey, in comparison to Musial, as "the second-best left-handed hitting, left-handed throwing outfielder ever born in Donora, Pennsylvania, on November 21."[13] His exploits as a rising player in Pennsylvania earned him the nickname "The Donora Greyhound".[14]
Musial also played basketball and was offered an athletic scholarship in that sport by the University of Pittsburgh.[10][15] Meanwhile, the St. Louis Cardinals had scouted Musial as a pitcher and, in 1937, offered him a professional contract after a workout with their Class D Penn State League affiliate.[16] Musial's father initially resisted the idea of his son pursuing a baseball career, but reluctantly gave his consent after lobbying by both Musial and his mother.[17] Musial also credited his school librarian Helen Kloz for pointing out that baseball was his dream and advising him to pursue it professionally.[17] In what was then a common practice, the Cardinals did not file the contract with the baseball commissioner's office until June 1938. This preserved Musial's amateur eligibility, and he was still able to participate in high school sports, leading Donora High School's basketball team to a playoff appearance.[18] He then reported to the Cardinals' Class D affiliate in West Virginia, the Williamson Red Birds.[19][20]
Professional baseball career[edit]
Minor leagues (1938–41)[edit]
Musial's rookie year with Williamson in 1938 was a period of adjustment both on and off the field. He began gaining more in-depth knowledge about baseball strategy[21] while posting a 6–6 win–loss record and a 4.66 earned run average (ERA), to go along with a .258 batting average.[22] Off the field, he experienced feelings of homesickness while learning to live comfortably and independently on his $65-per-month salary.[21] Musial finished his high school education before returning to Williamson in spring 1939. That season his numbers improved to a 9–2 record, a 4.30 ERA, and a .352 batting average.[23][24]
Musial spent the 1940 season with the Cardinals' other Class D team, the Daytona Beach Islanders, where he developed a lifelong friendship with manager Dickie Kerr.[25] His pitching skills improved under the guidance of Kerr, who also recognized his hitting talent, playing him in the outfield between pitching starts.[26] On May 25, 1940, Musial married fellow Donora resident, Lillian "Lil" Labash, in Daytona Beach, and the couple's first child followed in August.[27] During late August, Musial suffered a shoulder injury while playing in the outfield, and later made an early exit as the starting pitcher in a 12–5 playoff game loss.[28] For a while Musial considered leaving baseball entirely, complaining that he could not afford to support himself and his wife on the $16 a week pay. Kerr talked him out of it, and even took the Musials into his own home to relieve the financial burden. To repay the debt Musial bought Kerr a $20,000 home in Houston in 1958.[29] In 113 games in 1940 he hit .311, while compiling an 18–5 pitching record that included 176 strikeouts and 145 walks.[30][31]
Musial was assigned to the Class AA Columbus Red Birds to begin 1941, though manager, Burt Shotton, and Musial himself quickly realized that the previous year's injury had considerably weakened his arm.[32] He was reassigned to the Class C Springfield Cardinals as a full-time outfielder, and he later credited manager Ollie Vanek for displaying confidence in his hitting ability.[33] During 87 games with Springfield, Musial hit a league-leading .379 before being promoted to the Rochester Red Wings of the International League.[34] He was noted for his unique batting stance, a crouch in which his back was seemingly square to the pitcher.[35] This stance was later described by pitcher Ted Lyons as "a kid peeking around the corner to see if the cops were coming".[36] According to a 1950 description by author Tom Meany, "The bent knees and the crouch give him the appearance of a coiled spring, although most pitchers think of him as a coiled rattlesnake."[37] Musial continued to play well in Rochester—in one three-game stretch, he had 11 hits. He was called up to the Cardinals for the last two weeks of the 1941 season.[38]
Major leagues (1941–44)[edit]




Musial's statue outside of Busch Stadium captures his signature batting stance.


Musial made his major league debut during the second game of a doubleheader at Sportsman's Park on September 17, 1941.[39] The Cardinals were in the midst of a pennant race with the Brooklyn Dodgers; in 12 games, Musial collected 20 hits for a .426 batting average.[40] Despite Musial's late contributions, the Cardinals finished two and one-half games behind the 100-game-winning Dodgers.[41]
Cardinals manager Billy Southworth used Musial as a left fielder to begin 1942, sometimes lifting him for a pinch-hitter against left-handed pitching.[42] Musial was hitting .315 by late June,[43] as the Cardinals resumed battling the Dodgers for first place in the National League (NL).[44] The Cardinals took sole possession of first place on September 13, and when Musial caught a fly ball to end the first game of a doubleheader on September 27 they clinched the pennant with their 105th win.[45] He finished the season with a .315 batting average and 72 runs batted in (RBI) in 140 games. Musial received national publicity when he was named by St. Louis Post-Dispatch sports editor J. Roy Stockton as his choice for Rookie of the Year in a Saturday Evening Post article.[46][47]
The Cardinals played the American League champion New York Yankees in the 1942 World Series.[48] Representing the winning run at home plate in the bottom of the ninth inning of Game 1 at Sportsman's Park, Musial grounded out with the bases loaded to end the game .[49] Musial's first hit of the Series was an RBI single that provided the margin of victory in Game 2, allowing the Cardinals to tie the Series.[50] Over the next three games at Yankee Stadium, Musial had three more hits as the Cardinals defeated the Yankees in the Series four games to one.[51] Musial batted .222 for the Series, with two runs scored.[52]
Musial's 1943 season started with a brief contract holdout in spring training.[53] He made the National League All-Star team for the first time as a starting left fielder and got a double in the All-Star Game on July 13.[53] He finished the season leading the major leagues in hitting with a .357 batting average and led the NL in hits (220), doubles (48), triples (20), total bases (347), on-base percentage (.425), and slugging percentage (.562).[54] This performance earned him his first NL Most Valuable Player Award, ahead of teammate and catcher Walker Cooper (.318 batting average).[54] After romping to another NL pennant by 18 games, the Cardinals again faced the Yankees in the 1943 World Series.[55] Musial had a single in the Cardinals' Game 1 loss, and scored a run in a Game 2 win.[55] The Cardinals did not win another game in the Series, but the loser's bonus share paid to each Cardinals player ($4,321.99) still amounted to nearly two-thirds of Musial's regular season salary.[56]
United States involvement in World War II began to impinge on Musial's baseball career in 1944, as he underwent a physical examination in prelude to possible service in the armed forces.[57] He ultimately remained with the Cardinals for the entire season, posting a .347 batting average with 197 hits.[58][59] The Cardinals claimed the NL pennant for the third consecutive season, and faced St. Louis's other major league team, the Browns, in the 1944 World Series.[60] The Browns took a 2–1 lead, while Musial hit .250 with zero RBI.[61] He broke out in Game 4 with a two-run home run, single, double, and a walk as part of a 5–1 Cardinals win.[61] The Cardinals went on to defeat the Browns in six games, and Musial posted a .304 batting average for the Series.[62][63]
Sojourn in the U.S. Navy (1945–46)[edit]
Musial enlisted in the United States Navy on January 23, 1945, during World War II. He was initially assigned to noncombat duty at the Naval Training Station in Bainbridge, Maryland.[64] In June 1945, he was assigned to Special Services in Hawaii, and was assigned to a ferry launch unit to bring back damaged ship crews entering Pearl Harbor where he was able to play baseball every afternoon in the naval base's eight-team league.[65] After being granted emergency leave to see his ailing father in January 1946, he was briefly assigned to the Philadelphia Navy Yard before his honorable discharge from the Navy as a Seaman Second Class in March 1946.[65][66]
In 2007, Musial received the Navy Memorial's Lone Sailor Award, which honors Navy veterans who have excelled in civilian life.

1946–49[edit]


"Every time Stan came up they chanted, 'Here comes the man!'"

—Cardinals traveling secretary Leo Ward relates Dodger fans' nickname for Musial to sportswriter Bob Broeg[67]
Rejoining the Cardinals under new manager Eddie Dyer, Musial posted a .388 batting average by the middle of May 1946.[68] He also became close friends with new teammate Red Schoendienst, who had joined the Cardinals during Musial's absence in 1945.[69] During the season, Musial (who was under contract to the Cardinals for $13,500 in 1946) was offered a five-year, $125,000 contract, plus a $50,000 bonus, to join the Mexican League.[70] He declined the offer, and after manager Dyer spoke to club owner Sam Breadon, Musial was given a $5,000 raise later in 1946.[71]
It was also during the 1946 season that Musial acquired his nickname of Stan the Man.[67] During the June 23 game against the Dodgers at Ebbets Field, St. Louis Post-Dispatch sportswriter Bob Broeg heard Dodger fans chanting whenever Musial came to bat, but could not understand the words.[67][72] Later that day over dinner, Broeg asked Cardinals traveling secretary Leo Ward if he had understood what the Dodger fans had been chanting.[67] Ward said, "Every time Stan came up they chanted, 'Here comes the man!'" "'That man,' you mean", Broeg said. "No, the man", replied Ward.[67] Broeg mentioned this story in his Post-Dispatch column, and Musial was thereafter known as Stan "The Man".[67]




Musial on the cover of Baseball Digest, September 1948


In June 1946, Dyer began to use Musial as a first baseman.[73] The Cardinals finished the season tied with the Dodgers,[74] prompting a three-game playoff for the pennant. Musial's Game 1 triple and Game 2 double contributed to the Cardinals' two-games-to-none series victory.[75] Facing the Boston Red Sox, the Cardinals won the 1946 World Series four games to three,[76] as Musial had six hits and four RBI.[77] He batted .365 for the season and won his second NL MVP Award, receiving 22 out of a possible 24 first-place votes, finishing ahead of Brooklyn's Dixie Walker (.319 batting average).[78]
Musial began the 1947 season by hitting .146 in April.[79] On May 9, team doctor Dr. Robert Hyland confirmed a previous diagnosis of appendicitis, while discovering that Musial was concurrently suffering from tonsillitis.[80] He received treatment, but did not have either his appendix or tonsils surgically removed until after the season ended.[81] Despite his health woes, he finished the year with a batting average of .312.[82]
Fully recovered from his ailments, Musial recorded his 1,000th career hit on April 25, 1948.[83] After a May 7 St. Louis Globe-Democrat article criticized baseball players for appearing in cigarette advertisements, he made a personal decision to never again appear in such ads.[84] By June 24, his batting average was .408, prompting Brooklyn pitcher Preacher Roe to comically announce his new method for retiring Musial: "Walk him on four pitches and pick him off first."[85] Given a mid-season pay raise by new Cardinals owner Robert E. Hannegan for his outstanding performance, Musial hit a home run in the All-Star Game.[86] On September 22, he registered five hits in a game for the fourth time in the season, tying a mark set by Ty Cobb in 1922.[87]


"He missed tying for the top in homers by one rained out home run. If it had counted, he would have won the Triple Crown that year...and in addition have been the only player of this century to lead the league in runs, hits, double, triples, and slugging percentage. What a year!"

—Sportswriter Bob Broeg, on Musial's 1948 season[88]
Musial finished the 1948 season leading the major leagues in batting average (.376), hits (230), doubles (46), triples (18), total bases (429), and slugging percentage (.702).[89] Winning the NL batting title by a 43-point margin, with an on-base percentage lead of 27 points and a 138-point slugging percentage margin—the latter being the largest gap since Rogers Hornsby's 1925 season—Musial became the first player to win three NL MVP awards.[89] If a home run he hit during a rained out game had been counted in his season totals, he would have won the Triple Crown by leading the NL in batting average, home runs, and runs batted in.[89][90]
Anticipating life after his baseball career, Musial began the first of several business partnerships with Julius "Biggie" Garagnani in January 1949, opening "Stan Musial & Biggie's" restaurant.[91][92] He approached the 1949 season with the intent to try to hit more home runs, stating he had hit 39 the previous season "without trying".[93] His new focus on hitting for power backfired, as pitchers began using the outside part of the plate to induce him to ground out to the first or second baseman.[93] Musial soon stopped focusing on hitting home runs and resumed his consistent offensive production by the end of May.[93] He received his sixth consecutive All-Star player selection and finished the season leading the NL in hits (207) while playing in every game.[94] However, the Cardinals, with 96 wins, finished one game behind the Dodgers.[95]
In the late 1940s, when baseball was slowly becoming integrated, Musial—along with his roommate Red Schoendienst—would be lauded by newcomers such as Dodgers' pitcher Don Newcombe for their tolerance. "They never...had the need to sit in the dugout and call a black guy a bunch of names", Newcombe said, "because he was trying to change the game and make it what it should have been in the first place, a game for all people."[96]
1950–54[edit]
Musial began the 1950s by posting a .350 batting average before participating in the 1950 All-Star Game, where in fan balloting he was the NL's number two choice.[97] He had the longest hitting streak of his career during the 1950 season—a 30-game stretch that ended on July 27.[97] With the Cardinals falling 14 games out of first place by September, manager Dyer used him at first base and all three outfield positions.[97][98] New Cardinals manager Marty Marion led the team to a third-place finish in 1951, while Musial was named The Sporting News Major League Player of the Year.[99]


"No man has ever been a perfect ballplayer. Stan Musial, however, is the closest to being perfect in the game today.... He plays as hard when his club is away out in front of a game as he does when they're just a run or two behind."

—Ty Cobb, on Musial in a 1952 Life magazine article[100]
National media attention inadvertently turned to Musial a month before the 1952 season began, after Ty Cobb wrote an article regarding modern baseball players that was published in Life magazine.[100] Cobb singled out Musial and Phil Rizzuto as the only players "who can be mentioned in the same breath with the oldtime greats".[100] Cobb went on to refer to Musial as "a better player than Joe DiMaggio was in his prime."[100] In response, Musial displayed his characteristic modesty, saying, "Cobb is baseball's greatest. I don't want to contradict him, but I can't say that I was ever as good as Joe DiMaggio."[100]
The only major league pitching appearance of Musial's career occurred as a publicity stunt during the last Cardinals home game of the 1952 season.[101][102] Manager Eddie Stanky had a reluctant Musial pitch to Frank Baumholtz, the runner-up to Musial for the best batting average in the NL that season.[101] With Baumholtz batting right-handed for the first time in his career, Musial's first pitch was hit so hard it ricocheted off the shin of third baseman Solly Hemus and into the left field corner.[101] The play was ruled an error, and Musial was embarrassed enough by his complicity in the gimmick to avoid pitching again for the remainder of his career.[101]
The Cardinals franchise was up for sale in early 1953, and Musial and Schoendienst advised their friend and fellow duck-hunter Gussie Busch to consider buying the team.[103] Busch used the resources of the Anheuser-Busch company to purchase the Cardinals, keeping Musial in St. Louis by averting the possibility of a move by the team to another city.[103][104] The 1953 season marked Musial's 10th NL All-Star selection, and the 12th consecutive time he finished a major league season with a batting average above .300.[46][105]
Musial accomplished another historical feat on May 2, 1954, in a doubleheader in St. Louis against the New York Giants: he hit three home runs in the first contest, then added two more in the second to become the first major leaguer to hit five home runs in a doubleheader.[106] In addition to his five home runs, he also hit a single in the first game, setting a new record of 21 total bases for a doubleheader.[106] The only player besides Musial to hit five home runs in a doubleheader is Nate Colbert, who achieved the feat in 1972.[107]
1955–59[edit]
Musial made his 12th NL All-Star appearance in 1955 as a reserve player, when Cincinnati's Ted Kluszewski outpolled him by 150,000 votes to get on the starting lineup at first base.[108] Musial entered the game as a pinch hitter in the fourth inning, and played left field as the game entered extra innings.[109] Leading off the bottom of the 12th, he hit a home run to give the NL a 6–5 victory.[109]




Musial in 1957


The 1956 season marked another milestone for Musial, when he broke Mel Ott's NL record for extra-base hits on August 12.[110] Earlier that season, Cardinals general manager "Trader Frank" Lane began negotiations to trade him for Philadelphia pitcher Robin Roberts.[111] When Cardinals owner Gussie Busch learned of the possible move, he made it clear that Musial was not available for any trade.[112] Instead, Lane dealt Musial's close friend Schoendienst to the New York Giants; an upset Musial made no immediate comment to the press.[113]
On June 11, 1957, Musial tied the NL record for consecutive games played with his 822nd, a streak that began on the last day of the 1951 season.[114] Despite ballot stuffing by Cincinnati Reds fans, he was selected and played in the All-Star Game held at Sportsman's Park.[115] When he overextended his swing while batting during a game on August 23, Musial fractured a bone in his left shoulder socket and tore muscles over his collarbone.[116] He was unable to play again until September 8, ending his consecutive games-played streak at 895.[116] He finished 1957 as Sports Illustrated's "Sportsman of the Year".[117]


"Line drive! Into left field! Hit number three thousand! A run has scored! Musial around first, on his way to second with a double. Holy Cow! He came through!"

—Harry Caray's radio play-by-play call of Musial's 3,000th major league hit[118]
Musial signed one of the first $100,000 contracts in NL history on January 29, 1958. (According to Baseball Almanac, Hank Greenberg was the first with Pittsburgh in 1947.)[119] He quickly demonstrated a return on the investment by sharing with Willie Mays the inaugural (and for the only time in Musial's career) NL Player of the Month in May (no such award was given in April until 1969) batting .374, with 4 HR, and 16 RBI. Also that month, as he was approaching the 3,000-hit milestone in his major league career, he expressed a desire to record the hit in St. Louis.[120] He ultimately reached the mark with a pinch-hit, sixth inning RBI double at Chicago's Wrigley Field on May 13.[121][122] The eighth major league player to reach 3,000 hits, and the first to reach the milestone with an extra-base hit, Musial was greeted at St. Louis Union Station that evening by roughly 1,000 fans.[123] Finishing the season in sixth place, the Cardinals embarked on an exhibition tour of Japan, winning 14 of 16 games against top players from the Central and Pacific Japanese Leagues.[124]
Taking a new approach to preparation for the 1959 season, Musial was given permission to report late to spring training so that he might conserve his energy for the duration of the year.[125] Musial, at 6 feet (180 cm) tall, had maintained a weight of around 175 pounds (79 kg) throughout his career. He reported to spring training approximately 10 pounds (4.5 kg) overweight and in substandard physical condition.[126][127] He began the season with one hit in 15 at-bats.[127] Despite his early offensive struggles, he single-handedly spoiled potential no-hitters on April 16 and 19.[127] A game-winning home run on May 7 made him the first major league player ever with 400 home runs and 3,000 hits.[127] As he continued to hit at a relatively low pace, his playing time was limited by Cardinals manager Solly Hemus at various points during the season.[128] Seeking more revenue for the players' pension fund, Major League Baseball held two All-Star games in a season for the first time through 1962.[129] Musial made his 16th All-Star appearance (16th season)[3] and pinch-hit in both contests, flying out in the July 7 game and drawing a walk in the August 3 game.[129] He finished the season with 115 regular game appearances, a .255 batting average, 37 runs, and a slugging percentage of .428.[46]
During the 1959 season, John F. Kennedy approached Musial about supporting Kennedy's campaign for President, citing their close ages. Musial campaigned for Kennedy later that year and became a supporter of the Democrat.[130]
On June 30, 1959, Musial was the batter in one of the oddest plays in baseball history. In a game between the Cardinals and Chicago Cubs, he was at the plate with a count of 3–1. Bob Anderson's next pitch was errant, evading catcher Sammy Taylor and rolling all the way to the backstop. Umpire Vic Delmore called ball four, even as Anderson and Taylor contended that Musial had foul tipped the ball. Because the ball was still in play and Delmore was embroiled in an argument with the catcher and pitcher, Musial kept running in attempt to make second base. Seeing that Musial was trying for second, Alvin Dark ran to the backstop to retrieve the ball. The ball wound up in the hands of field announcer Pat Pieper, but Dark ended up getting it back anyway. Absentmindedly, however, Delmore pulled out a new ball and gave it to Taylor. Anderson finally noticed that Musial was trying for second, took the new ball, and threw it to second baseman Tony Taylor. Anderson's throw flew over Taylor's head into the outfield. Dark, at the same time that Anderson threw the new ball, threw the original ball to shortstop Ernie Banks. Musial did not see Dark's throw and only noticed Anderson's ball fly over the second baseman's head, so he tried to go to third base. On his way there, he was tagged by Banks, and after a delay he was ruled out.[131]
1960–63[edit]
Based on his 1959 performance, Musial accepted a pay cut in 1960 from his previous $100,000 salary to $80,000.[132] He was eager to prove that his mediocre performance was the result of improper physical conditioning, and he enlisted the help of Walter Eberhardt, Saint Louis University's director of physical education.[133] In June 1960, newspaper articles began speculating that Musial would soon retire, yet he finished the season with a .275 batting average.[46][134] He addressed the speculation in September, confirming that he would play again in 1961. His .288 batting average that season reaffirmed his decision.[46][135] In 1962, Musial posted a .330 batting average, good for third in the batting race, with 19 homers and 82 RBI. As a pinch-hitter, he had 14 base hits in 19 at-bats (.737).[136] Along the way, he established new NL career marks for hits, RBI, and runs scored. That same year on July 8, the 41-year-old Musial became the oldest player ever to hit three home runs in one game.





Stan Musial's number 6 was retired by the St. Louis Cardinals in 1963.


The Cardinals began 1963 by winning 10 of their first 15 games, as Musial posted a .237 batting average.[137] He set a new major league record for career extra-base hits on May 8 and improved his batting average to .277 by the end of the month.[138] Making his 20th All-Star appearance[3] and 24th All-Star Game appearance on July 9, 1963, he pinch-hit in the fifth inning.[138] Asked by general manager Bing Devine on July 26 what his plans were, Musial said that he would retire at season's end.[139] He waited until the Cardinals team picnic on August 12 to publicly announce his decision, hopeful he could retire on a winning note.[140]
Musial became a grandfather for the first time in the early hours of September 10; later that day, he hit a home run in his first at-bat.[141] After sweeping a doubleheader on September 15, the Cardinals had won 19 of their last 20 games, and were one game behind the Los Angeles Dodgers.[141] The Dodgers then swept the Cardinals in a three-game series in St. Louis and clinched the NL pennant on September 25.[142] Musial's last game, on September 29, 1963, was preceded by an hour-long retirement ceremony.[143] Speakers at the event included baseball commissioner Ford Frick, Cardinals broadcaster Harry Caray, and Cardinals owner Gussie Busch, who announced that Musial's uniform number "6" would be retired by the team.[143] During the game, Musial recorded a single in the fourth inning, then hit a single to right field that scored teammate Curt Flood in the sixth.[144] Cardinals manager Johnny Keane brought in Gary Kolb as a pinch-runner for Musial, bringing his major league career to an end.[144] Just as he had recorded two base hits in his major league debut, Musial finished his last game with two hits, as well.[144] Musial finished with the all-time National League hits record and second to only Ty Cobb on the all-time Major League list. Musial's last career hit was out of reach of Cincinnati Reds second baseman Pete Rose, who would go on to break Cobb's record to become baseball's all-time hit king.


"All Musial represents is more than two decades of sustained excellence and complete decency as a human being."

—Broadcaster Bob Costas, on Musial[35]
At the time of his retirement, Musial held or shared 17 major league records, 29 NL records, and nine All-Star Game records.[145] Among those records, he ranked as the major league career leader in extra-base hits (1,377) and total bases (6,134).[144] He also held NL career marks in categories such as hits (3,630), games played (3,026), doubles (725), and RBI (1,951).[144] He finished his career with 475 home runs despite never having led the NL in the category.[144] Jerry Lansche speculates Musial would likely have become the second player, after Babe Ruth, with 2,000 RBI, and would have exceeded 500 career home runs had he not served in the military.[146] His lowest full season RBI output before the war was 72 (in 1942) and as he needed only 49 RBI to reach 2,000 for his full career, he certainly would have exceeded 2,000 RBI by playing without injury in 1945. His home run production is a different story and it is highly unlikely he would have reached 500. He did not hit more than 13 home runs in any season before he entered the navy and did not hit as many as 25 (the number he would have needed to become a 500 career homer club member) until 1948, 3 years after returning to baseball from World War II. His career hit total was evenly split between 1,815 hits at home and 1,815 hits on the road.[36] Steven R. Bullock speculates that it is possible that without military service Musial might have continued playing to attempt to exceed Ty Cobb's career hit record of 4,191.[146] Even if Musial had hit safely 207 times (the average of his hits in the 2 years before and the 2 years after his service in the navy) in 1945, he still would have been 354 hits short of tying Ty. His hit total in his last season at age 42 was only 86; even if he could have had 103 hits a season (the average of his last 5 seasons) he would have had to play to age 47 to attain the hits record.
He was the first major league player to appear in more than 1,000 games at two different positions, registering 1,896 games in the outfield and 1,016 at first base.[147] Since Musial's retirement in 1963, Tony Gwynn has been the only player to finish his career with a higher lifetime batting average. Hank Aaron has been the only player to surpass his record of 6,134 total bases.
In Musial's 3,026 major league appearances, he was never ejected from a game.[148] Speaking about his quiet reputation within the sport's history, sportscaster Bob Costas said, "He didn't hit a homer in his last at-bat; he hit a single. He didn't hit in 56 straight games. He married his high school sweetheart and stayed married to her. ... All Musial represents is more than two decades of sustained excellence and complete decency as a human being."[35]
Post-playing career and family life[edit]
Musial was named a vice president of the St. Louis Cardinals in September 1963, and he remained in that position until after the 1966 season.[149] From February 1964 to January 1967, he also served as President Lyndon Johnson's physical fitness adviser, a part-time position created to promote better fitness among American citizens.[150] Before the 1967 season began, the Cardinals named Musial the team's general manager, and he oversaw the club's World Series championship that year.[149] He won the allegiance of Cardinals players by making fair offers from the outset of player-contract negotiations and creating an in-stadium babysitting service so players' wives could attend games.[151] His longtime business partner Biggie Garagnani died in June 1967, prompting Musial to devote more time to managing his restaurant and other business interests.[152] He came to realize that the detail-oriented desk job was not his forte. He consequently decided to step down as general manager, before even completing a full year on the job.[152]
Musial—like Phil Linz—was noted for his harmonica playing, which included his rendition of "Take Me Out to the Ball Game".[153] Through the 1990s, he frequently played the harmonica at public gatherings, such as the annual Baseball Hall of Fame induction ceremony and various charity events.[154] He performed on the television show Hee Haw and in 1994 recorded 18 songs that were sold in tandem with a harmonica-playing instruction booklet.[154]
Even though Musial left Donora after high school, he retained close ties to the town throughout the rest of his life. He maintained membership in local social clubs, and regularly sent a local doctor boxes of autographed baseballs, with the town's mayor using some for United Way fundraising.[155] Musial also gave free meals at the restaurant he owned in St. Louis to any customers who presented valid ID proving they were Donora residents.[156]
Musial met Lillian Susan Labash, the daughter of a local grocer,[155] in Donora when both were 15, and married her in St. Paul's Catholic Church in Daytona Beach, Florida on May 25, 1940. They had four children: son Richard, and daughters Gerry, Janet, and Jeanie.[148][157] Lillian Musial died at 91, on May 3, 2012; their marriage had lasted for almost 72 years.[158] In his final years, Musial suffered from Alzheimer's disease.
Honors and recognition[edit]


"Here stands baseball's perfect warrior. Here stands baseball's perfect knight."

—Quote inscribed on the base of Musial's statue, attributed to former commissioner Ford Frick[159]
On August 4, 1968, a statue of Musial was erected outside of Busch Memorial Stadium on the northeast grounds of the St. Louis stadium.[152] The statue was moved from its original location to the west side of the new Busch Stadium for its first season in 2006, where it became a popular meeting place for generations of Cardinals fans.[160] Musial's statue is inscribed with a quote attributed to former baseball commissioner Ford Frick: "Here stands baseball's perfect warrior. Here stands baseball's perfect knight."[152]
Musial was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility in 1969, when he was named on 93.2 percent of the ballots.[161] On June 14, 1973 he was the first inductee into the National Polish-American Hall of Fame, housed at St. Mary's College in Orchard Lake, Michigan. In 1989, he was inducted into the St. Louis Walk of Fame.[162] Five years later, a baseball field was named after him in his hometown of Donora.[163] He was ranked tenth on The Sporting News' list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players published in 1998.[164] He was also one of the 30 players selected to the Major League Baseball All-Century Team, added by a special committee after he finished 11th in fan voting among outfielders.[165] In 2000, he was inducted into the Hall of Famous Missourians, and a bronze bust depicting him is on permanent display in the rotunda of the Missouri State Capitol.[166] In January, 2014, the Cardinals announced Musial among 22 former players and personnel to be inducted into the St. Louis Cardinals Hall of Fame Museum for the inaugural class of 2014.[167]

Nearly two decades after Musial retired, baseball statistician Bill James and the sabermetrics movement began providing new ways of comparing players across baseball history.[168] In 2001, James ranked Musial the tenth-greatest baseball player in history, and the second-best left fielder of all time.[169] According to Baseball-Reference.com, he ranks fifth all-time among hitters on the Black Ink Test, and third all-time on the Gray Ink Test—measures designed to compare players of different eras.[46][170] He ranks first on Baseball-Reference's Hall of Fame Monitor Test, and is tied for second in the Hall of Fame Career Standards Test.[46] Despite his statistical accomplishments, he is sometimes referred to as the most underrated or overlooked athlete in modern American sports history.[171][172] For instance, in his analysis of baseball's under- and overrated players in 2007, sportswriter Jayson Stark said, "I can't think of any all-time great in any sport who gets left out of more who's-the-greatest conversations than Stan Musial."[171]
Musial threw out the first pitch in the fifth game of the 2006 World Series and delivered the ceremonial first pitch ball to President Barack Obama at the 2009 Major League Baseball All-Star Game.[173] A "Stan the Man" day was held in his honor by the Cardinals on May 18, 2008.[174] In 2010, another one of the Cardinals' greatest sluggers, Albert Pujols, whose nickname was "El Hombre", said he didn't want to be called "The Man", even in Spanish, because "There is one man that gets that respect, and that is Stan Musial." [96] Also in 2010, the Cardinals launched a campaign to build support for awarding Musial the Presidential Medal of Freedom for his lifetime of achievement and service.[175] The campaign realized its goal, and on February 15, 2011, Musial was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Barack Obama[176][177] who called him "an icon untarnished, a beloved pillar of the community, a gentleman you'd want your kids to emulate."[178]
On October 17, 2012, Musial made his final appearance at Busch Stadium, riding in a golf cart around the warning track before Game 4 of the National League Championship Series. Musial stopped at both dugouts and greeted San Francisco Giants manager Bruce Bochy and Cardinals manager Mike Matheny. The Cardinals would go on to win Game 4 by a score of 8-3, but lost the pennant to the eventual World Series champion Giants.

Death[edit]
On January 19, 2013, Musial died at age 92 of natural causes at his home in Ladue, Missouri, on the same day that fellow MLB Hall of Fame inductee Earl Weaver passed away.[181][182] Musial was surrounded by his family as he died peacefully. Cardinals owner Bill DeWitt, Jr. released the following statement:

We have lost the most beloved member of the Cardinals family. Stan Musial was the greatest player in Cardinals history and one of the best players in the history of baseball. The entire Cardinals organization extends its sincere condolences to Stan's family, including his children Richard, Gerry, Janet and Jean, as well as his eleven grandchildren and twelve great grandchildren. We join fans everywhere in mourning the loss of our dear friend and reflect on how fortunate we all are to have known 'Stan the Man'.[183]

Upon hearing the news of his death, fans gathered and began an impromptu memorial at his statue outside Busch Stadium; the Cardinals issued a release saying the memorial would be left in place for some time.[184] In a laudatory obituary, The New York Times quoted famed New York manager Leo Durocher: "There is only one way to pitch to Musial—under the plate."[185]
Missouri Governor Jay Nixon commented: "Stan Musial was a great American hero who—with the utmost humility—inspired us all to aim high and dream big. The world is emptier today without him, but far better to have known him. The legacy of 'baseball's perfect warrior' will endure and inspire generations to come."[186]
St. Louis Mayor Francis Slay tweeted: "Sad as we are, we are fortunate to have had Stan in STL for so long, and are also glad that Stan and Lil are together again." He ordered flags at half-mast in the city.[187]
"Major League Baseball has lost one of its true legends in Stan Musial, a Hall of Famer in every sense and a man who led a great American life", Commissioner Bud Selig said. "He was the heart and soul of the historic St. Louis Cardinals franchise for generations, and he served his country during World War II. A recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2011, Stan's life embodies baseball's unparalleled history and why this game is the national pastime."[188]
Thousands of fans braved cold temperatures on January 24 for a public visitation at the Cathedral Basilica of Saint Louis, where Musial lay in state, dressed in his trademark cardinal-red blazer and with a harmonica in his lapel pocket, flanked by a Navy honor guard. A private funeral Mass was held on Saturday, January 26, 2013, at the New Cathedral in St. Louis, televised locally by KTVI and KPLR as well as Fox Sports Midwest on pay-television. New York's Cardinal Timothy Dolan, who in his first episcopal post served as an auxiliary bishop of the Archdiocese of Saint Louis, was the principal celebrant, and Knoxville's Bishop Richard F. Stika, Musial's former parish priest, was the homilist.[189] Bob Costas gave the principal eulogy, calling him "the genuine hero who as the years and decades passed, and disillusionment came from other directions, never once let us down", and quoting fellow Cooperstown honoree Mickey Mantle, who once said that Musial "was a better player than me because he was a better man than me".[190] Following the funeral, Musial's family led a procession from the New Cathedral to Busch Stadium, where they laid a memorial wreath at his statue. Once the wreath was placed and Musial's family began to walk back to their vehicles, the hundreds of Cardinal fans gathered for the wreath ceremony gave both Musial and his family one final salute. That salute was the fans singing "Take Me Out to the Ball Game" before Musial was taken to his final place of rest.
Musial was the last living member of the Cardinals team that won the 1942 World Series. At the time of his death, no living players had played on an earlier World Series-winning team.
The Stan Musial Veterans Memorial Bridge in St. Louis (carries  I‑70) was built in his memorial.
Legacy[edit]
As a reflection of his popularity, Musial has had infrastructure named after him. In May 2011 the Pennsylvania State Senate changed the name of the bridge that carries the C. Vance Deicas Memorial Highway (S.R. 1077) over the Monongahela River from Donora-Monessen Bridge to Stan Musial Bridge after Musial who was a native of the area.[191] In October 2013 the St. Louis Fire Department started operating a fireboat named after Musial.[192] In July 2013, the new Interstate 70 bridge over the Mississippi River between Illinois and Missouri at St. Louis received the official name of "Stan Musial Veterans Memorial Bridge"[193]

About       Stan Musial Autographed Memorabilia & Collectibles
Retired professional baseball player, Stan Musial, was a member of the St. Louis Cardinals. Musial spent his entire 22 season career playing outfielder and first baseman for the Cardinals. Widely considered to be the greatest hitter to play the game, Stan Musial was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1969. Throughout his entire career, Musial recorded a total of 3,630 hits, which ranks him fourth of All-time, 1,951 runs batted in, and 475 home runs.
Due to his many accolades, Stan Musial is a player that will be remembered forever by baseball fans. All of his achievements are of note and responsible for the high worth of Musial memorabilia. Both fans and collectors seek to add Stan Musial signed baseballs, jerseys, bats, and photos to their collection because of the rarity of these pieces and their likelihood to increase in value over time. Musial is a player that is respected by fans of all sports because of his iconic career, so shop our large selection of Stan Musial collectibles for the perfect gift for any sports fan or addition to your collection.

                  About the Book


 In the most comprehensive assessment of baseball legend Stan Musial's life and career to date, James N. Giglio places the St. Louis Cardinal star within the context of the times-the Great Depression and wartime and postwar America-and the issues then prevalent in professional baseball, particularly race and the changing economics of the game. Giglio illuminates how the times shaped Musial and delves further into his popular image as a warm, unfailingly gracious role model known for good sportsmanship and devotion to family.


Authors/Editors


James N. Giglio is Distinguished Professor of History at Missouri State University in Springfield. He is the author of several books, including The Presidency of John F. Kennedy.  The Missouri Biography Series, edited by William E. Foley




Reviews


   “Musial was and still is the most beloved Cardinal. Here’s the full story of how one of the best sluggers and nicest guys in baseball history won both ballgames and the hearts of St. Louis fans.”—USA TODAY Baseball Weekly.          “Musial should stand as the definitive biography of the  great St. Louis Cardinal first baseman-outfielder. . . . Written by a  leading historian of 20th-century America, this volume offers a fine  examination of its subject and his era. . . . The research for this book  is impeccable.”—Choice.      “Stan Musial has had millions of words written about him, but nothing  compares to this in-depth study of the person and his accomplishments.  Giglio spent several years researching the available printed and  manuscript sources and interviewed and corresponded with countless  ballplayers, family members, and friends representing Musial’s entire  history. He has dealt with both myth and reality and shed light on  aspects of Musial’s life ignored or overlooked by previous  biographers.”—Missouri Historical Review.     “Giglio’s book allows us to see Musial as a more interesting person  than [the one who] comes out of the much simpler and familiar legend,  more complex than a one-dimensional figure. That, in turn, makes  Musial’s accomplishments, both on the field and off, all the more  remarkable.”—Cardinals Magazine.      “This biography is an excellent example of solid and thorough research,  smooth and lively writing, and critical analysis. Giglio has produced  an intelligent baseball biography that offers much to historians of  twentieth-century America.”—Journal of American History.  



Awards


Musial: From Stash to Stan the Man by James N. Giglio, is a finalist for the third annual Dave Moore Award, sponsored by Elysian Fields Quarterly, which seeks to honor the author of the "most important book on baseball" published in 2001.

Stan Musial, Gentlemanly Slugger and Cardinals’ Stan the Man, Dies at 92

Stan Musial, one of baseball’s greatest hitters and a revered figure in the storied history of the St. Louis Cardinals —  the player they called Stan the Man — died Saturday. He was 92.The Cardinals said he died at his home in Ladue, Mo., surrounded by family.A signature Musial image endures: He waits for a pitch in a left-handed crouch, his knees bent and close together, his body leaning to the left as he peers over his right shoulder, the red No. 6 on his back. The stance was likened to a corkscrew or, as the White Sox pitcher and Dodgers coach Ted Lyons once described it, “a kid peeking around the corner to see if the cops are coming.”Swinging from that stance, Musial won seven batting championships, hit 475 home runs and amassed 3,630 hits. His brilliance lay in his consistency. He had 1,815 hits at home and 1,815 on the road. He drove in 1,951 runs and scored 1,949 runs. And his power could be explosive: he set a major league record, equaled only once, when he hit five home runs in a doubleheader.“There is only one way to pitch to Musial — under the plate,” Leo Durocher, the manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers and New York Giants teams that Musial often victimized, once said.

Musial was renowned for his concentration at the plate, and for his patience: he struck out only 696 times in 10,972 at-bats in his 22 major league seasons, all as a Cardinal. A gentlemanly and sunny figure — he loved to play “Take Me Out to the Ball Game” on his harmonica — he was never ejected from a game. When admirers approached him, he chatted them up with his familiar “whattayasay, whattayasay.” Continue reading the main story

But he otherwise had little of the glamour of the other stars of his era — from the World War II years to the early 1960s — when baseball was the undisputed king of sports. He did not have the mystique of Joe DiMaggio, the tempestuousness of Ted Williams, the electrifying presence of Willie Mays, the country-boy aura of Mickey Mantle. His Cardinals were far removed from the coastal media centers, and he shunned controversy.He simply tattooed National League pitching.Musial played on three World Series championship teams, won three Most Valuable Player awards, had a career batting average of .331 while playing in the outfield and at first base, and was the fourth player inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility.He was the most cherished Cardinal of them all in a city that witnessed the exploits of Grover Cleveland Alexander and Rogers Hornsby, Dizzy Dean and the Gashouse Gang, Enos Slaughter, Marty Marion, Red Schoendienst, Ozzie Smith, Lou Brock, Bob Gibson, Mark McGwire and Albert Pujols.Pujols, the slugger from the Dominican Republic, was sometimes saluted as El Hombre as he neared the end of his time in St. Louis.“I don’t want to be called that,” he told The St. Louis Post-Dispatch in 2010. “There is one man that gets that respect, and that’s Stan Musial. I know El Hombre is The Man in Spanish. But he is The Man.”A frail Musial, wearing a Cardinal red sport jacket, went to the White House in February 2011 to receive the Medal of Freedom, the nation’s highest civilian award, from President Obama, who called him “untarnished, a beloved pillar of the community, a gentleman you’d want your kids to emulate.”There is one Gateway Arch in St. Louis but two statues of Stan the Man. Both are outside the Cardinals’ Busch Stadium, the earlier one engraved with the words of Ford Frick, the baseball commissioner at the time, speaking at a ceremony before Musial’s final game, on Sunday, Sept. 29, 1963, at home against the Cincinnati Reds: “Here stands baseball’s perfect warrior. Here stands baseball’s perfect knight.”

Stanley Frank Musial was born on Nov. 21, 1920, in Donora, Pa., a zinc and steel mill town some 30 miles from Pittsburgh where smokestacks sent grime aloft around the clock. He was the fifth of six children of Lukasz Musial, a Polish immigrant who worked at a steel and wire company, and his wife, Mary, a New York City native of Czech descent.

His father had no interest in the frivolity of baseball, but the young Musial competed in gymnastics at a Polish sports club, developing his athleticism, and he played baseball with balls that his mother sewed from rags and string. His family and friends called him Stashu, the diminutive for the Polish Stanislaus.His high school didn’t have a baseball team, but he excelled in American Legion play as a left-handed pitcher, and he could hit as well. The Cardinals signed him to a minor-league contract for the 1938 season.Musial was pitching for the Cardinals’ farm team at Daytona Beach in the Florida State League in 1940 when he injured his left shoulder diving for a ball while playing the outfield part time. He was converted to a full-time outfielder, and his batting prowess brought him to the Cardinals in September 1941.Playing left field in a superb outfield with Terry Moore in center and Slaughter in right, Musial hit .315 in 1942, when the Cardinals staged a furious pennant run to overtake the Dodgers, then defeated the Yankees in the World Series.Musial hit .357 in 1943, winning his first batting title, but the Cardinals lost to the Yankees in a repeat World Series matchup. He batted .347 in 1944, when the Cardinals were again pennant-winners and defeated the St. Louis Browns in what was known as the Streetcar Series.Musial spent 1945 in the Navy, which assigned him to play baseball for its ball clubs to entertain servicemen. When he returned to the Cardinals, he picked up where he had left off, winning his second battling title with a .365 average in 1946 and helping to propel the Cardinals to the pennant, which they won in a playoff with the Dodgers. They also won the World Series title, defeating the Boston Red Sox.That Series was the last in which blacks were kept from playing. By the spring of 1947, Jackie Robinson had broken the color barrier with the Dodgers.

That did not sit well with some Cardinals players, according to reports, which said they had talked about refusing to take the field in protest when the team was scheduled to play at Brooklyn in May. But the truth of those accounts remains murky, and the Cardinals did, in fact, play against Robinson.

Musial did not speak out on racial issues, but he showed no reluctance to face black players. He liked to tell of how he once played baseball with blacks in his hometown, among them Buddy Griffey, the father and grandfather of the outfield stars Ken Griffey and Ken Jr.The Dodgers’ Don Newcombe, major league baseball’s first black pitching star, recalled hearing taunts from some Cardinals players, but never from Musial or Schoendienst, Musial’s longtime roommate.“We’d watch ’em in the dugout,” Newcombe told George Vecsey in “Stan Musial: An American Life.” “Wisecracks, call names. I could see from the mound when I got there in ’49. You never saw guys like Musial or Schoendienst. They never showed you up. The man went about his job and did it damn well and never had the need to sit in the dugout and call a black guy a bunch of names, because he was trying to change the game and make it what it should have been in the first place, a game for all people.”The Cardinals did not have a black player until 1954.Despite Musial’s consistent brilliance, the Cardinals fell in the standings during the late 1940s and ’50s, when the Dodgers of Robinson, Newcombe and Roy Campanella and the Giants of Mays and Monte Irvin dominated the National League.

Stan Musial, a Hall of Famer, was so beloved in St. Louis that two statues of him stand outside the Cardinals’ ballpark.

Musial thrived at the Dodgers’ Ebbets Field, plastering the right-field scoreboard and hitting home runs over it, and winning the grudging admiration of the notoriously tough Brooklyn fans.“I did some phenomenal hitting there,” he told The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. “The ballpark was small, so the seats were close to the field and you could hear just about anything anybody said. Then I’d come to the plate and the fans would say, ‘Here comes that man again.’ And a sportswriter picked it up and it became Stan the Man.”The nickname, attributed to Bob Broeg of The St. Louis Post-Dispatch, stayed with Musial as he piled up hits, combining his talent with intense concentration at the plate.“I’m always set for a fastball,” Musial told The Saturday Evening Post in 1958 when he got his 3,000th career hit. “When I’m concentrating up there, I know that pitcher’s best fastball. When he lets the ball go, if that ball jumps out in front of me there about 30, 40 feet, I know it’s got to be a fastball. If he lets that ball go and it doesn’t come up that quick, then it’s going to be a change or a curve. I never watch the spin of the ball. I watch the ball in its entirety, and what it’s doing, and how fast it’s reacting to me. And then I try to adjust from there.”

Musial was durable as well. He once held the National League record for consecutive games played, a streak that ended at 895 when he hurt a shoulder in August 1957. He won his seventh and last batting title that season, hitting .351. The following year, he became the first National League player with a $100,000 contract.Musial retired after the 1963 season, having played in 24 All-Star Games. He was elected to the Hall of Fame in 1969.After his playing days ended, Musial became an adviser to the Cardinals as a senior vice president. The team ended an 18-year pennant drought in 1964 and beat the Yankees in the World Series, having finally fielded outstanding black players like Gibson, Brock, Curt Flood and Bill White.Musial succeeded Bob Howsam as the Cardinals’ general manager in 1967, but the team was set to contend when he took the job, and he made no major personnel moves. That team, managed by Schoendienst, went on to defeat the Boston Red Sox in the World Series.Musial stepped down from the post after the season to pursue his business interests, notably the St. Louis restaurant popularly known as Stan and Biggie’s. He had been greeting guests there as an owner since 1949, when he bought into a steakhouse run by Julius Garagnani, known as Biggie, a product of the Italian-American Hill section of St. Louis.Musial is survived by his son, Richard; his daughters Gerry Ashley, Janet Schwarze and Jeanne Edmonds; 11 grandchildren; and 12 great-grandchildren. His wife, Lillian, whom he married in 1940, died in May 2012 at 91.St. Louis did not forget Musial. At the 2009 All-Star Game there, he received a huge ovation as he rode onto the field in a golf cart and handed President Obama a baseball for his ceremonial first pitch. And Musial did not forget the Cardinals. He visited with them during the 2011 playoffs and World Series, when they defeated the Texas Rangers in seven games.Musial was appreciated even by rival players. “Stan was such a nice guy that I was probably happy for him when he homered off me,” Johnny Antonelli, a leading left-handed pitcher of the 1950s, told Danny Peary in the oral history “We Played the Game.”Musial had an explanation for his good nature. “Maybe one reason I’m so cheerful is that for more than 20 years I’ve had an unbeatable combination going for me — getting paid, often a lot, to do the thing I love the most,” he told Sports Illustrated in 1963. “The love is important, but let’s not pretend; so is the money. My old Cardinals coach, Mike Gonzales, used to say to me, ‘Musial, if I could hit like you, I’d play for nothing.’ Not me. But I wouldn’t play for the money without the fun.”

 Correction: January 19, 2013  
An earlier version of this obituary misstated the number of hits Stan Musial had at home and on the road. It was 1,815 for each, not 1,860. 

 Correction: January 27, 2013  
An obituary in some editions last Sunday about the baseball great Stan Musial misspelled the surname of a New York Giants player in the late 1940s and ’50s, when the Giants and Dodgers dominated the National League. He is Monte Irvin, not Irvine.

Stanley Frank Musial (/ˈmjuːziəl/ or /ˈmjuːʒəl/; born Stanisław Franciszek Musiał; November 21, 1920 – January 19, 2013), nicknamed Stan the Man, was an American Major League Baseball (MLB) outfielder and first baseman. He spent 22 seasons playing for the St. Louis Cardinals, from 1941 to 1944 and 1946 to 1963. Widely considered to be one of the greatest and most consistent hitters in baseball history,[1] Musial was a first-ballot inductee into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1969, and was also selected to the St. Louis Cardinals Hall of Fame in the inaugural class of 2014.
Musial batted .331 over the course of his career and set National League (NL) records for career hits (3,630), runs batted in (1,951), games played (3,026), at bats (10,972), runs scored (1,949) and doubles (725), his 475 career home runs then ranked second in NL history behind Mel Ott's total of 511. His 6,134 total bases remained a major league record until surpassed by Hank Aaron, and his hit total still ranks fourth all-time, and is the highest by any player who spent his career with only one team. A seven-time batting champion with identical totals of 1,815 hits at home and 1,815 hits on the road, he was named the National League's (NL) Most Valuable Player (MVP) three times and led St. Louis to three World Series championships. He also shares the major league record for the most All-Star Games played (24) with Hank Aaron and Willie Mays.[a] [2]
Musial was born in Donora, Pennsylvania, where he frequently played baseball informally or in organized settings, and eventually played on the baseball team at Donora High School. Signed to a professional contract by the St. Louis Cardinals as a pitcher in 1938, Musial was converted into an outfielder prior to his major league debut in 1941. Noted for his unique batting stance, he quickly established himself as a consistent and productive hitter. In his first full season, 1942, the Cardinals won the World Series. The following year, he led the NL in six different offensive categories and earned his first MVP award. He was also named to the NL All-Star squad for the first time; he appeared in every All-Star game in every subsequent season he played.[3] Musial won his second World Series championship in 1944, then missed the entire 1945 season while serving in the Navy.
After completing his military service during the war, Musial returned to baseball in 1946 and resumed his consistent hitting. That year he earned his second MVP award and third World Series title. His third MVP award came in 1948, when he finished one home run short of winning baseball's Triple Crown. After struggling offensively in 1959, Musial used a personal trainer to help maintain his productivity until he decided to retire in 1963. At the time of his retirement, he held or shared 17 major league records, 29 National League records, and nine All-Star Game records. Ironically, in 1964, the season following his retirement, the Cardinals went on to defeat the New York Yankees in an epic 7-game clash, for St. Louis' first World Series championship in nearly two decades (a team which included future Hall of Famer Lou Brock performing what would have likely been Musial's left field duties).[4] In addition to overseeing businesses, such as a restaurant both before and after his playing career, Musial served as the Cardinals' general manager in 1967, winning the pennant and World Series, then quitting that position. He also became noted for his harmonica playing, a skill he acquired during his playing career. Known for his modesty and sportsmanship, Musial was selected for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team in 1999. In February 2011, President Barack Obama presented Musial with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, one of the highest civilian awards that can be bestowed on a person by the United States government.

Early life[edit]
Musial was born in Donora, Pennsylvania, the fifth of the six children (four girls and two boys) of Lukasz and Mary (Lancos) Musiał (/ˈmuːʃaʊ/, MOO-show).[5] His mother was of Carpatho-Rusyn descent and his father was a Polish immigrant who chose the name Stanisław Franciszek for his first son, though his father always referred to Musial using the Polish nickname Stasiu, pronounced "Stashu".[5][6] Musial frequently played baseball with his brother Ed and other friends during his childhood, and considered Lefty Grove his favorite ballplayer.[7][8] Musial also had the benefit of learning about baseball from his neighbor Joe Barbao, a former minor league pitcher.[9] When he enrolled in school, his name was formally changed to Stanley Frank Musial.[5]
At age 15 Musial joined the Donora Zincs, a semi-professional team managed by Barbao.[10] In his Zincs debut he pitched 6 innings and struck out 13 batters, all of them adults.[10] Musial also played one season on the newly revived Donora High School baseball team, where one of his teammates was Buddy Griffey, father of MLB player Ken Griffey, Sr. and grandfather to Ken Griffey, Jr.[11][12] Baseball statistician Bill James described the younger Griffey, in comparison to Musial, as "the second-best left-handed hitting, left-handed throwing outfielder ever born in Donora, Pennsylvania, on November 21."[13] His exploits as a rising player in Pennsylvania earned him the nickname "The Donora Greyhound".[14]
Musial also played basketball and was offered an athletic scholarship in that sport by the University of Pittsburgh.[10][15] Meanwhile, the St. Louis Cardinals had scouted Musial as a pitcher and, in 1937, offered him a professional contract after a workout with their Class D Penn State League affiliate.[16] Musial's father initially resisted the idea of his son pursuing a baseball career, but reluctantly gave his consent after lobbying by both Musial and his mother.[17] Musial also credited his school librarian Helen Kloz for pointing out that baseball was his dream and advising him to pursue it professionally.[17] In what was then a common practice, the Cardinals did not file the contract with the baseball commissioner's office until June 1938. This preserved Musial's amateur eligibility, and he was still able to participate in high school sports, leading Donora High School's basketball team to a playoff appearance.[18] He then reported to the Cardinals' Class D affiliate in West Virginia, the Williamson Red Birds.[19][20]
Professional baseball career[edit]
Minor leagues (1938–41)[edit]
Musial's rookie year with Williamson in 1938 was a period of adjustment both on and off the field. He began gaining more in-depth knowledge about baseball strategy[21] while posting a 6–6 win–loss record and a 4.66 earned run average (ERA), to go along with a .258 batting average.[22] Off the field, he experienced feelings of homesickness while learning to live comfortably and independently on his $65-per-month salary.[21] Musial finished his high school education before returning to Williamson in spring 1939. That season his numbers improved to a 9–2 record, a 4.30 ERA, and a .352 batting average.[23][24]
Musial spent the 1940 season with the Cardinals' other Class D team, the Daytona Beach Islanders, where he developed a lifelong friendship with manager Dickie Kerr.[25] His pitching skills improved under the guidance of Kerr, who also recognized his hitting talent, playing him in the outfield between pitching starts.[26] On May 25, 1940, Musial married fellow Donora resident, Lillian "Lil" Labash, in Daytona Beach, and the couple's first child followed in August.[27] During late August, Musial suffered a shoulder injury while playing in the outfield, and later made an early exit as the starting pitcher in a 12–5 playoff game loss.[28] For a while Musial considered leaving baseball entirely, complaining that he could not afford to support himself and his wife on the $16 a week pay. Kerr talked him out of it, and even took the Musials into his own home to relieve the financial burden. To repay the debt Musial bought Kerr a $20,000 home in Houston in 1958.[29] In 113 games in 1940 he hit .311, while compiling an 18–5 pitching record that included 176 strikeouts and 145 walks.[30][31]
Musial was assigned to the Class AA Columbus Red Birds to begin 1941, though manager, Burt Shotton, and Musial himself quickly realized that the previous year's injury had considerably weakened his arm.[32] He was reassigned to the Class C Springfield Cardinals as a full-time outfielder, and he later credited manager Ollie Vanek for displaying confidence in his hitting ability.[33] During 87 games with Springfield, Musial hit a league-leading .379 before being promoted to the Rochester Red Wings of the International League.[34] He was noted for his unique batting stance, a crouch in which his back was seemingly square to the pitcher.[35] This stance was later described by pitcher Ted Lyons as "a kid peeking around the corner to see if the cops were coming".[36] According to a 1950 description by author Tom Meany, "The bent knees and the crouch give him the appearance of a coiled spring, although most pitchers think of him as a coiled rattlesnake."[37] Musial continued to play well in Rochester—in one three-game stretch, he had 11 hits. He was called up to the Cardinals for the last two weeks of the 1941 season.[38]
Major leagues (1941–44)[edit]

Musial made his major league debut during the second game of a doubleheader at Sportsman's Park on September 17, 1941.[39] The Cardinals were in the midst of a pennant race with the Brooklyn Dodgers; in 12 games, Musial collected 20 hits for a .426 batting average.[40] Despite Musial's late contributions, the Cardinals finished two and one-half games behind the 100-game-winning Dodgers.[41]
Cardinals manager Billy Southworth used Musial as a left fielder to begin 1942, sometimes lifting him for a pinch-hitter against left-handed pitching.[42] Musial was hitting .315 by late June,[43] as the Cardinals resumed battling the Dodgers for first place in the National League (NL).[44] The Cardinals took sole possession of first place on September 13, and when Musial caught a fly ball to end the first game of a doubleheader on September 27 they clinched the pennant with their 105th win.[45] He finished the season with a .315 batting average and 72 runs batted in (RBI) in 140 games. Musial received national publicity when he was named by St. Louis Post-Dispatch sports editor J. Roy Stockton as his choice for Rookie of the Year in a Saturday Evening Post article.[46][47]
The Cardinals played the American League champion New York Yankees in the 1942 World Series.[48] Representing the winning run at home plate in the bottom of the ninth inning of Game 1 at Sportsman's Park, Musial grounded out with the bases loaded to end the game .[49] Musial's first hit of the Series was an RBI single that provided the margin of victory in Game 2, allowing the Cardinals to tie the Series.[50] Over the next three games at Yankee Stadium, Musial had three more hits as the Cardinals defeated the Yankees in the Series four games to one.[51] Musial batted .222 for the Series, with two runs scored.[52]
Musial's 1943 season started with a brief contract holdout in spring training.[53] He made the National League All-Star team for the first time as a starting left fielder and got a double in the All-Star Game on July 13.[53] He finished the season leading the major leagues in hitting with a .357 batting average and led the NL in hits (220), doubles (48), triples (20), total bases (347), on-base percentage (.425), and slugging percentage (.562).[54] This performance earned him his first NL Most Valuable Player Award, ahead of teammate and catcher Walker Cooper (.318 batting average).[54] After romping to another NL pennant by 18 games, the Cardinals again faced the Yankees in the 1943 World Series.[55] Musial had a single in the Cardinals' Game 1 loss, and scored a run in a Game 2 win.[55] The Cardinals did not win another game in the Series, but the loser's bonus share paid to each Cardinals player ($4,321.99) still amounted to nearly two-thirds of Musial's regular season salary.[56]
United States involvement in World War II began to impinge on Musial's baseball career in 1944, as he underwent a physical examination in prelude to possible service in the armed forces.[57] He ultimately remained with the Cardinals for the entire season, posting a .347 batting average with 197 hits.[58][59] The Cardinals claimed the NL pennant for the third consecutive season, and faced St. Louis's other major league team, the Browns, in the 1944 World Series.[60] The Browns took a 2–1 lead, while Musial hit .250 with zero RBI.[61] He broke out in Game 4 with a two-run home run, single, double, and a walk as part of a 5–1 Cardinals win.[61] The Cardinals went on to defeat the Browns in six games, and Musial posted a .304 batting average for the Series.[62][63]
Sojourn in the U.S. Navy (1945–46)[edit]
Musial enlisted in the United States Navy on January 23, 1945, during World War II. He was initially assigned to noncombat duty at the Naval Training Station in Bainbridge, Maryland.[64] In June 1945, he was assigned to Special Services in Hawaii, and was assigned to a ferry launch unit to bring back damaged ship crews entering Pearl Harbor where he was able to play baseball every afternoon in the naval base's eight-team league.[65] After being granted emergency leave to see his ailing father in January 1946, he was briefly assigned to the Philadelphia Navy Yard before his honorable discharge from the Navy as a Seaman Second Class in March 1946.[65][66]
In 2007, Musial received the Navy Memorial's Lone Sailor Award, which honors Navy veterans who have excelled in civilian life.

"Every time Stan came up they chanted, 'Here comes the man!'"

—Cardinals traveling secretary Leo Ward relates Dodger fans' nickname for Musial to sportswriter Bob Broeg[67]
Rejoining the Cardinals under new manager Eddie Dyer, Musial posted a .388 batting average by the middle of May 1946.[68] He also became close friends with new teammate Red Schoendienst, who had joined the Cardinals during Musial's absence in 1945.[69] During the season, Musial (who was under contract to the Cardinals for $13,500 in 1946) was offered a five-year, $125,000 contract, plus a $50,000 bonus, to join the Mexican League.[70] He declined the offer, and after manager Dyer spoke to club owner Sam Breadon, Musial was given a $5,000 raise later in 1946.[71]
It was also during the 1946 season that Musial acquired his nickname of Stan the Man.[67] During the June 23 game against the Dodgers at Ebbets Field, St. Louis Post-Dispatch sportswriter Bob Broeg heard Dodger fans chanting whenever Musial came to bat, but could not understand the words.[67][72] Later that day over dinner, Broeg asked Cardinals traveling secretary Leo Ward if he had understood what the Dodger fans had been chanting.[67] Ward said, "Every time Stan came up they chanted, 'Here comes the man!'" "'That man,' you mean", Broeg said. "No, the man", replied Ward.[67] Broeg mentioned this story in his Post-Dispatch column, and Musial was thereafter known as Stan "The Man".[67]




Musial on the cover of Baseball Digest, September 1948


In June 1946, Dyer began to use Musial as a first baseman.[73] The Cardinals finished the season tied with the Dodgers,[74] prompting a three-game playoff for the pennant. Musial's Game 1 triple and Game 2 double contributed to the Cardinals' two-games-to-none series victory.[75] Facing the Boston Red Sox, the Cardinals won the 1946 World Series four games to three,[76] as Musial had six hits and four RBI.[77] He batted .365 for the season and won his second NL MVP Award, receiving 22 out of a possible 24 first-place votes, finishing ahead of Brooklyn's Dixie Walker (.319 batting average).[78]
Musial began the 1947 season by hitting .146 in April.[79] On May 9, team doctor Dr. Robert Hyland confirmed a previous diagnosis of appendicitis, while discovering that Musial was concurrently suffering from tonsillitis.[80] He received treatment, but did not have either his appendix or tonsils surgically removed until after the season ended.[81] Despite his health woes, he finished the year with a batting average of .312.[82]
Fully recovered from his ailments, Musial recorded his 1,000th career hit on April 25, 1948.[83] After a May 7 St. Louis Globe-Democrat article criticized baseball players for appearing in cigarette advertisements, he made a personal decision to never again appear in such ads.[84] By June 24, his batting average was .408, prompting Brooklyn pitcher Preacher Roe to comically announce his new method for retiring Musial: "Walk him on four pitches and pick him off first."[85] Given a mid-season pay raise by new Cardinals owner Robert E. Hannegan for his outstanding performance, Musial hit a home run in the All-Star Game.[86] On September 22, he registered five hits in a game for the fourth time in the season, tying a mark set by Ty Cobb in 1922.[87]


"He missed tying for the top in homers by one rained out home run. If it had counted, he would have won the Triple Crown that year...and in addition have been the only player of this century to lead the league in runs, hits, double, triples, and slugging percentage. What a year!"

—Sportswriter Bob Broeg, on Musial's 1948 season[88]
Musial finished the 1948 season leading the major leagues in batting average (.376), hits (230), doubles (46), triples (18), total bases (429), and slugging percentage (.702).[89] Winning the NL batting title by a 43-point margin, with an on-base percentage lead of 27 points and a 138-point slugging percentage margin—the latter being the largest gap since Rogers Hornsby's 1925 season—Musial became the first player to win three NL MVP awards.[89] If a home run he hit during a rained out game had been counted in his season totals, he would have won the Triple Crown by leading the NL in batting average, home runs, and runs batted in.[89][90]
Anticipating life after his baseball career, Musial began the first of several business partnerships with Julius "Biggie" Garagnani in January 1949, opening "Stan Musial & Biggie's" restaurant.[91][92] He approached the 1949 season with the intent to try to hit more home runs, stating he had hit 39 the previous season "without trying".[93] His new focus on hitting for power backfired, as pitchers began using the outside part of the plate to induce him to ground out to the first or second baseman.[93] Musial soon stopped focusing on hitting home runs and resumed his consistent offensive production by the end of May.[93] He received his sixth consecutive All-Star player selection and finished the season leading the NL in hits (207) while playing in every game.[94] However, the Cardinals, with 96 wins, finished one game behind the Dodgers.[95]
In the late 1940s, when baseball was slowly becoming integrated, Musial—along with his roommate Red Schoendienst—would be lauded by newcomers such as Dodgers' pitcher Don Newcombe for their tolerance. "They never...had the need to sit in the dugout and call a black guy a bunch of names", Newcombe said, "because he was trying to change the game and make it what it should have been in the first place, a game for all people."[96]
1950–54[edit]
Musial began the 1950s by posting a .350 batting average before participating in the 1950 All-Star Game, where in fan balloting he was the NL's number two choice.[97] He had the longest hitting streak of his career during the 1950 season—a 30-game stretch that ended on July 27.[97] With the Cardinals falling 14 games out of first place by September, manager Dyer used him at first base and all three outfield positions.[97][98] New Cardinals manager Marty Marion led the team to a third-place finish in 1951, while Musial was named The Sporting News Major League Player of the Year.[99]


"No man has ever been a perfect ballplayer. Stan Musial, however, is the closest to being perfect in the game today.... He plays as hard when his club is away out in front of a game as he does when they're just a run or two behind."

—Ty Cobb, on Musial in a 1952 Life magazine article[100]
National media attention inadvertently turned to Musial a month before the 1952 season began, after Ty Cobb wrote an article regarding modern baseball players that was published in Life magazine.[100] Cobb singled out Musial and Phil Rizzuto as the only players "who can be mentioned in the same breath with the oldtime greats".[100] Cobb went on to refer to Musial as "a better player than Joe DiMaggio was in his prime."[100] In response, Musial displayed his characteristic modesty, saying, "Cobb is baseball's greatest. I don't want to contradict him, but I can't say that I was ever as good as Joe DiMaggio."[100]
The only major league pitching appearance of Musial's career occurred as a publicity stunt during the last Cardinals home game of the 1952 season.[101][102] Manager Eddie Stanky had a reluctant Musial pitch to Frank Baumholtz, the runner-up to Musial for the best batting average in the NL that season.[101] With Baumholtz batting right-handed for the first time in his career, Musial's first pitch was hit so hard it ricocheted off the shin of third baseman Solly Hemus and into the left field corner.[101] The play was ruled an error, and Musial was embarrassed enough by his complicity in the gimmick to avoid pitching again for the remainder of his career.[101]
The Cardinals franchise was up for sale in early 1953, and Musial and Schoendienst advised their friend and fellow duck-hunter Gussie Busch to consider buying the team.[103] Busch used the resources of the Anheuser-Busch company to purchase the Cardinals, keeping Musial in St. Louis by averting the possibility of a move by the team to another city.[103][104] The 1953 season marked Musial's 10th NL All-Star selection, and the 12th consecutive time he finished a major league season with a batting average above .300.[46][105]
Musial accomplished another historical feat on May 2, 1954, in a doubleheader in St. Louis against the New York Giants: he hit three home runs in the first contest, then added two more in the second to become the first major leaguer to hit five home runs in a doubleheader.[106] In addition to his five home runs, he also hit a single in the first game, setting a new record of 21 total bases for a doubleheader.[106] The only player besides Musial to hit five home runs in a doubleheader is Nate Colbert, who achieved the feat in 1972.[107]
1955–59[edit]
Musial made his 12th NL All-Star appearance in 1955 as a reserve player, when Cincinnati's Ted Kluszewski outpolled him by 150,000 votes to get on the starting lineup at first base.[108] Musial entered the game as a pinch hitter in the fourth inning, and played left field as the game entered extra innings.[109] Leading off the bottom of the 12th, he hit a home run to give the NL a 6–5 victory.[109]




Musial in 1957


The 1956 season marked another milestone for Musial, when he broke Mel Ott's NL record for extra-base hits on August 12.[110] Earlier that season, Cardinals general manager "Trader Frank" Lane began negotiations to trade him for Philadelphia pitcher Robin Roberts.[111] When Cardinals owner Gussie Busch learned of the possible move, he made it clear that Musial was not available for any trade.[112] Instead, Lane dealt Musial's close friend Schoendienst to the New York Giants; an upset Musial made no immediate comment to the press.[113]
On June 11, 1957, Musial tied the NL record for consecutive games played with his 822nd, a streak that began on the last day of the 1951 season.[114] Despite ballot stuffing by Cincinnati Reds fans, he was selected and played in the All-Star Game held at Sportsman's Park.[115] When he overextended his swing while batting during a game on August 23, Musial fractured a bone in his left shoulder socket and tore muscles over his collarbone.[116] He was unable to play again until September 8, ending his consecutive games-played streak at 895.[116] He finished 1957 as Sports Illustrated's "Sportsman of the Year".[117]


"Line drive! Into left field! Hit number three thousand! A run has scored! Musial around first, on his way to second with a double. Holy Cow! He came through!"

—Harry Caray's radio play-by-play call of Musial's 3,000th major league hit[118]
Musial signed one of the first $100,000 contracts in NL history on January 29, 1958. (According to Baseball Almanac, Hank Greenberg was the first with Pittsburgh in 1947.)[119] He quickly demonstrated a return on the investment by sharing with Willie Mays the inaugural (and for the only time in Musial's career) NL Player of the Month in May (no such award was given in April until 1969) batting .374, with 4 HR, and 16 RBI. Also that month, as he was approaching the 3,000-hit milestone in his major league career, he expressed a desire to record the hit in St. Louis.[120] He ultimately reached the mark with a pinch-hit, sixth inning RBI double at Chicago's Wrigley Field on May 13.[121][122] The eighth major league player to reach 3,000 hits, and the first to reach the milestone with an extra-base hit, Musial was greeted at St. Louis Union Station that evening by roughly 1,000 fans.[123] Finishing the season in sixth place, the Cardinals embarked on an exhibition tour of Japan, winning 14 of 16 games against top players from the Central and Pacific Japanese Leagues.[124]
Taking a new approach to preparation for the 1959 season, Musial was given permission to report late to spring training so that he might conserve his energy for the duration of the year.[125] Musial, at 6 feet (180 cm) tall, had maintained a weight of around 175 pounds (79 kg) throughout his career. He reported to spring training approximately 10 pounds (4.5 kg) overweight and in substandard physical condition.[126][127] He began the season with one hit in 15 at-bats.[127] Despite his early offensive struggles, he single-handedly spoiled potential no-hitters on April 16 and 19.[127] A game-winning home run on May 7 made him the first major league player ever with 400 home runs and 3,000 hits.[127] As he continued to hit at a relatively low pace, his playing time was limited by Cardinals manager Solly Hemus at various points during the season.[128] Seeking more revenue for the players' pension fund, Major League Baseball held two All-Star games in a season for the first time through 1962.[129] Musial made his 16th All-Star appearance (16th season)[3] and pinch-hit in both contests, flying out in the July 7 game and drawing a walk in the August 3 game.[129] He finished the season with 115 regular game appearances, a .255 batting average, 37 runs, and a slugging percentage of .428.[46]
During the 1959 season, John F. Kennedy approached Musial about supporting Kennedy's campaign for President, citing their close ages. Musial campaigned for Kennedy later that year and became a supporter of the Democrat.[130]
On June 30, 1959, Musial was the batter in one of the oddest plays in baseball history. In a game between the Cardinals and Chicago Cubs, he was at the plate with a count of 3–1. Bob Anderson's next pitch was errant, evading catcher Sammy Taylor and rolling all the way to the backstop. Umpire Vic Delmore called ball four, even as Anderson and Taylor contended that Musial had foul tipped the ball. Because the ball was still in play and Delmore was embroiled in an argument with the catcher and pitcher, Musial kept running in attempt to make second base. Seeing that Musial was trying for second, Alvin Dark ran to the backstop to retrieve the ball. The ball wound up in the hands of field announcer Pat Pieper, but Dark ended up getting it back anyway. Absentmindedly, however, Delmore pulled out a new ball and gave it to Taylor. Anderson finally noticed that Musial was trying for second, took the new ball, and threw it to second baseman Tony Taylor. Anderson's throw flew over Taylor's head into the outfield. Dark, at the same time that Anderson threw the new ball, threw the original ball to shortstop Ernie Banks. Musial did not see Dark's throw and only noticed Anderson's ball fly over the second baseman's head, so he tried to go to third base. On his way there, he was tagged by Banks, and after a delay he was ruled out.[131]
1960–63[edit]
Based on his 1959 performance, Musial accepted a pay cut in 1960 from his previous $100,000 salary to $80,000.[132] He was eager to prove that his mediocre performance was the result of improper physical conditioning, and he enlisted the help of Walter Eberhardt, Saint Louis University's director of physical education.[133] In June 1960, newspaper articles began speculating that Musial would soon retire, yet he finished the season with a .275 batting average.[46][134] He addressed the speculation in September, confirming that he would play again in 1961. His .288 batting average that season reaffirmed his decision.[46][135] In 1962, Musial posted a .330 batting average, good for third in the batting race, with 19 homers and 82 RBI. As a pinch-hitter, he had 14 base hits in 19 at-bats (.737).[136] Along the way, he established new NL career marks for hits, RBI, and runs scored. That same year on July 8, the 41-year-old Musial became the oldest player ever to hit three home runs in one game.





Stan Musial's number 6 was retired by the St. Louis Cardinals in 1963.


The Cardinals began 1963 by winning 10 of their first 15 games, as Musial posted a .237 batting average.[137] He set a new major league record for career extra-base hits on May 8 and improved his batting average to .277 by the end of the month.[138] Making his 20th All-Star appearance[3] and 24th All-Star Game appearance on July 9, 1963, he pinch-hit in the fifth inning.[138] Asked by general manager Bing Devine on July 26 what his plans were, Musial said that he would retire at season's end.[139] He waited until the Cardinals team picnic on August 12 to publicly announce his decision, hopeful he could retire on a winning note.[140]
Musial became a grandfather for the first time in the early hours of September 10; later that day, he hit a home run in his first at-bat.[141] After sweeping a doubleheader on September 15, the Cardinals had won 19 of their last 20 games, and were one game behind the Los Angeles Dodgers.[141] The Dodgers then swept the Cardinals in a three-game series in St. Louis and clinched the NL pennant on September 25.[142] Musial's last game, on September 29, 1963, was preceded by an hour-long retirement ceremony.[143] Speakers at the event included baseball commissioner Ford Frick, Cardinals broadcaster Harry Caray, and Cardinals owner Gussie Busch, who announced that Musial's uniform number "6" would be retired by the team.[143] During the game, Musial recorded a single in the fourth inning, then hit a single to right field that scored teammate Curt Flood in the sixth.[144] Cardinals manager Johnny Keane brought in Gary Kolb as a pinch-runner for Musial, bringing his major league career to an end.[144] Just as he had recorded two base hits in his major league debut, Musial finished his last game with two hits, as well.[144] Musial finished with the all-time National League hits record and second to only Ty Cobb on the all-time Major League list. Musial's last career hit was out of reach of Cincinnati Reds second baseman Pete Rose, who would go on to break Cobb's record to become baseball's all-time hit king.


"All Musial represents is more than two decades of sustained excellence and complete decency as a human being."

—Broadcaster Bob Costas, on Musial[35]
At the time of his retirement, Musial held or shared 17 major league records, 29 NL records, and nine All-Star Game records.[145] Among those records, he ranked as the major league career leader in extra-base hits (1,377) and total bases (6,134).[144] He also held NL career marks in categories such as hits (3,630), games played (3,026), doubles (725), and RBI (1,951).[144] He finished his career with 475 home runs despite never having led the NL in the category.[144] Jerry Lansche speculates Musial would likely have become the second player, after Babe Ruth, with 2,000 RBI, and would have exceeded 500 career home runs had he not served in the military.[146] His lowest full season RBI output before the war was 72 (in 1942) and as he needed only 49 RBI to reach 2,000 for his full career, he certainly would have exceeded 2,000 RBI by playing without injury in 1945. His home run production is a different story and it is highly unlikely he would have reached 500. He did not hit more than 13 home runs in any season before he entered the navy and did not hit as many as 25 (the number he would have needed to become a 500 career homer club member) until 1948, 3 years after returning to baseball from World War II. His career hit total was evenly split between 1,815 hits at home and 1,815 hits on the road.[36] Steven R. Bullock speculates that it is possible that without military service Musial might have continued playing to attempt to exceed Ty Cobb's career hit record of 4,191.[146] Even if Musial had hit safely 207 times (the average of his hits in the 2 years before and the 2 years after his service in the navy) in 1945, he still would have been 354 hits short of tying Ty. His hit total in his last season at age 42 was only 86; even if he could have had 103 hits a season (the average of his last 5 seasons) he would have had to play to age 47 to attain the hits record.
He was the first major league player to appear in more than 1,000 games at two different positions, registering 1,896 games in the outfield and 1,016 at first base.[147] Since Musial's retirement in 1963, Tony Gwynn has been the only player to finish his career with a higher lifetime batting average. Hank Aaron has been the only player to surpass his record of 6,134 total bases.
In Musial's 3,026 major league appearances, he was never ejected from a game.[148] Speaking about his quiet reputation within the sport's history, sportscaster Bob Costas said, "He didn't hit a homer in his last at-bat; he hit a single. He didn't hit in 56 straight games. He married his high school sweetheart and stayed married to her. ... All Musial represents is more than two decades of sustained excellence and complete decency as a human being."[35]
Post-playing career and family life[edit]
Musial was named a vice president of the St. Louis Cardinals in September 1963, and he remained in that position until after the 1966 season.[149] From February 1964 to January 1967, he also served as President Lyndon Johnson's physical fitness adviser, a part-time position created to promote better fitness among American citizens.[150] Before the 1967 season began, the Cardinals named Musial the team's general manager, and he oversaw the club's World Series championship that year.[149] He won the allegiance of Cardinals players by making fair offers from the outset of player-contract negotiations and creating an in-stadium babysitting service so players' wives could attend games.[151] His longtime business partner Biggie Garagnani died in June 1967, prompting Musial to devote more time to managing his restaurant and other business interests.[152] He came to realize that the detail-oriented desk job was not his forte. He consequently decided to step down as general manager, before even completing a full year on the job.[152]
Musial—like Phil Linz—was noted for his harmonica playing, which included his rendition of "Take Me Out to the Ball Game".[153] Through the 1990s, he frequently played the harmonica at public gatherings, such as the annual Baseball Hall of Fame induction ceremony and various charity events.[154] He performed on the television show Hee Haw and in 1994 recorded 18 songs that were sold in tandem with a harmonica-playing instruction booklet.[154]
Even though Musial left Donora after high school, he retained close ties to the town throughout the rest of his life. He maintained membership in local social clubs, and regularly sent a local doctor boxes of autographed baseballs, with the town's mayor using some for United Way fundraising.[155] Musial also gave free meals at the restaurant he owned in St. Louis to any customers who presented valid ID proving they were Donora residents.[156]
Musial met Lillian Susan Labash, the daughter of a local grocer,[155] in Donora when both were 15, and married her in St. Paul's Catholic Church in Daytona Beach, Florida on May 25, 1940. They had four children: son Richard, and daughters Gerry, Janet, and Jeanie.[148][157] Lillian Musial died at 91, on May 3, 2012; their marriage had lasted for almost 72 years.[158] In his final years, Musial suffered from Alzheimer's disease.
Honors and recognition[edit]


"Here stands baseball's perfect warrior. Here stands baseball's perfect knight."

—Quote inscribed on the base of Musial's statue, attributed to former commissioner Ford Frick[159]
On August 4, 1968, a statue of Musial was erected outside of Busch Memorial Stadium on the northeast grounds of the St. Louis stadium.[152] The statue was moved from its original location to the west side of the new Busch Stadium for its first season in 2006, where it became a popular meeting place for generations of Cardinals fans.[160] Musial's statue is inscribed with a quote attributed to former baseball commissioner Ford Frick: "Here stands baseball's perfect warrior. Here stands baseball's perfect knight."[152]
Musial was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility in 1969, when he was named on 93.2 percent of the ballots.[161] On June 14, 1973 he was the first inductee into the National Polish-American Hall of Fame, housed at St. Mary's College in Orchard Lake, Michigan. In 1989, he was inducted into the St. Louis Walk of Fame.[162] Five years later, a baseball field was named after him in his hometown of Donora.[163] He was ranked tenth on The Sporting News' list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players published in 1998.[164] He was also one of the 30 players selected to the Major League Baseball All-Century Team, added by a special committee after he finished 11th in fan voting among outfielders.[165] In 2000, he was inducted into the Hall of Famous Missourians, and a bronze bust depicting him is on permanent display in the rotunda of the Missouri State Capitol.[166] In January, 2014, the Cardinals announced Musial among 22 former players and personnel to be inducted into the St. Louis Cardinals Hall of Fame Museum for the inaugural class of 2014.[167]




President Barack Obama awards the 2010 Presidential Medal of Freedom to Stan Musial in a ceremony in the East Room of the White House February 15, 2011.


Nearly two decades after Musial retired, baseball statistician Bill James and the sabermetrics movement began providing new ways of comparing players across baseball history.[168] In 2001, James ranked Musial the tenth-greatest baseball player in history, and the second-best left fielder of all time.[169] According to Baseball-Reference.com, he ranks fifth all-time among hitters on the Black Ink Test, and third all-time on the Gray Ink Test—measures designed to compare players of different eras.[46][170] He ranks first on Baseball-Reference's Hall of Fame Monitor Test, and is tied for second in the Hall of Fame Career Standards Test.[46] Despite his statistical accomplishments, he is sometimes referred to as the most underrated or overlooked athlete in modern American sports history.[171][172] For instance, in his analysis of baseball's under- and overrated players in 2007, sportswriter Jayson Stark said, "I can't think of any all-time great in any sport who gets left out of more who's-the-greatest conversations than Stan Musial."[171]
Musial threw out the first pitch in the fifth game of the 2006 World Series and delivered the ceremonial first pitch ball to President Barack Obama at the 2009 Major League Baseball All-Star Game.[173] A "Stan the Man" day was held in his honor by the Cardinals on May 18, 2008.[174] In 2010, another one of the Cardinals' greatest sluggers, Albert Pujols, whose nickname was "El Hombre", said he didn't want to be called "The Man", even in Spanish, because "There is one man that gets that respect, and that is Stan Musial." [96] Also in 2010, the Cardinals launched a campaign to build support for awarding Musial the Presidential Medal of Freedom for his lifetime of achievement and service.[175] The campaign realized its goal, and on February 15, 2011, Musial was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Barack Obama[176][177] who called him "an icon untarnished, a beloved pillar of the community, a gentleman you'd want your kids to emulate."[178]
On October 17, 2012, Musial made his final appearance at Busch Stadium, riding in a golf cart around the warning track before Game 4 of the National League Championship Series. Musial stopped at both dugouts and greeted San Francisco Giants manager Bruce Bochy and Cardinals manager Mike Matheny. The Cardinals would go on to win Game 4 by a score of 8-3, but lost the pennant to the eventual World Series champion Giants.

Death[edit]
On January 19, 2013, Musial died at age 92 of natural causes at his home in Ladue, Missouri, on the same day that fellow MLB Hall of Fame inductee Earl Weaver passed away.[181][182] Musial was surrounded by his family as he died peacefully. Cardinals owner Bill DeWitt, Jr. released the following statement:

We have lost the most beloved member of the Cardinals family. Stan Musial was the greatest player in Cardinals history and one of the best players in the history of baseball. The entire Cardinals organization extends its sincere condolences to Stan's family, including his children Richard, Gerry, Janet and Jean, as well as his eleven grandchildren and twelve great grandchildren. We join fans everywhere in mourning the loss of our dear friend and reflect on how fortunate we all are to have known 'Stan the Man'.[183]

Upon hearing the news of his death, fans gathered and began an impromptu memorial at his statue outside Busch Stadium; the Cardinals issued a release saying the memorial would be left in place for some time.[184] In a laudatory obituary, The New York Times quoted famed New York manager Leo Durocher: "There is only one way to pitch to Musial—under the plate."[185]
Missouri Governor Jay Nixon commented: "Stan Musial was a great American hero who—with the utmost humility—inspired us all to aim high and dream big. The world is emptier today without him, but far better to have known him. The legacy of 'baseball's perfect warrior' will endure and inspire generations to come."[186]
St. Louis Mayor Francis Slay tweeted: "Sad as we are, we are fortunate to have had Stan in STL for so long, and are also glad that Stan and Lil are together again." He ordered flags at half-mast in the city.[187]
"Major League Baseball has lost one of its true legends in Stan Musial, a Hall of Famer in every sense and a man who led a great American life", Commissioner Bud Selig said. "He was the heart and soul of the historic St. Louis Cardinals franchise for generations, and he served his country during World War II. A recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2011, Stan's life embodies baseball's unparalleled history and why this game is the national pastime."[188]
Thousands of fans braved cold temperatures on January 24 for a public visitation at the Cathedral Basilica of Saint Louis, where Musial lay in state, dressed in his trademark cardinal-red blazer and with a harmonica in his lapel pocket, flanked by a Navy honor guard. A private funeral Mass was held on Saturday, January 26, 2013, at the New Cathedral in St. Louis, televised locally by KTVI and KPLR as well as Fox Sports Midwest on pay-television. New York's Cardinal Timothy Dolan, who in his first episcopal post served as an auxiliary bishop of the Archdiocese of Saint Louis, was the principal celebrant, and Knoxville's Bishop Richard F. Stika, Musial's former parish priest, was the homilist.[189] Bob Costas gave the principal eulogy, calling him "the genuine hero who as the years and decades passed, and disillusionment came from other directions, never once let us down", and quoting fellow Cooperstown honoree Mickey Mantle, who once said that Musial "was a better player than me because he was a better man than me".[190] Following the funeral, Musial's family led a procession from the New Cathedral to Busch Stadium, where they laid a memorial wreath at his statue. Once the wreath was placed and Musial's family began to walk back to their vehicles, the hundreds of Cardinal fans gathered for the wreath ceremony gave both Musial and his family one final salute. That salute was the fans singing "Take Me Out to the Ball Game" before Musial was taken to his final place of rest.
Musial was the last living member of the Cardinals team that won the 1942 World Series. At the time of his death, no living players had played on an earlier World Series-winning team.
The Stan Musial Veterans Memorial Bridge in St. Louis (carries  I‑70) was built in his memorial.
Legacy[edit]
As a reflection of his popularity, Musial has had infrastructure named after him. In May 2011 the Pennsylvania State Senate changed the name of the bridge that carries the C. Vance Deicas Memorial Highway (S.R. 1077) over the Monongahela River from Donora-Monessen Bridge to Stan Musial Bridge after Musial who was a native of the area.[191] In October 2013 the St. Louis Fire Department started operating a fireboat named after Musial.[192] In July 2013, the new Interstate 70 bridge over the Mississippi River between Illinois and Missouri at St. Louis received the official name of "Stan Musial Veterans Memorial Bridge"[193]

Stanley Frank Musial (/ˈmjuːziəl/ or /ˈmjuːʒəl/; born Stanisław Franciszek Musiał; November 21, 1920 – January 19, 2013), nicknamed Stan the Man, was an American Major League Baseball (MLB) outfielder and first baseman. He spent 22 seasons playing for the St. Louis Cardinals, from 1941 to 1944 and 1946 to 1963. Widely considered to be one of the greatest and most consistent hitters in baseball history,[1] Musial was a first-ballot inductee into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1969, and was also selected to the St. Louis Cardinals Hall of Fame in the inaugural class of 2014.
Musial batted .331 over the course of his career and set National League (NL) records for career hits (3,630), runs batted in (1,951), games played (3,026), at bats (10,972), runs scored (1,949) and doubles (725), his 475 career home runs then ranked second in NL history behind Mel Ott's total of 511. His 6,134 total bases remained a major league record until surpassed by Hank Aaron, and his hit total still ranks fourth all-time, and is the highest by any player who spent his career with only one team. A seven-time batting champion with identical totals of 1,815 hits at home and 1,815 hits on the road, he was named the National League's (NL) Most Valuable Player (MVP) three times and led St. Louis to three World Series championships. He also shares the major league record for the most All-Star Games played (24) with Hank Aaron and Willie Mays.[a] [2]
Musial was born in Donora, Pennsylvania, where he frequently played baseball informally or in organized settings, and eventually played on the baseball team at Donora High School. Signed to a professional contract by the St. Louis Cardinals as a pitcher in 1938, Musial was converted into an outfielder prior to his major league debut in 1941. Noted for his unique batting stance, he quickly established himself as a consistent and productive hitter. In his first full season, 1942, the Cardinals won the World Series. The following year, he led the NL in six different offensive categories and earned his first MVP award. He was also named to the NL All-Star squad for the first time; he appeared in every All-Star game in every subsequent season he played.[3] Musial won his second World Series championship in 1944, then missed the entire 1945 season while serving in the Navy.
After completing his military service during the war, Musial returned to baseball in 1946 and resumed his consistent hitting. That year he earned his second MVP award and third World Series title. His third MVP award came in 1948, when he finished one home run short of winning baseball's Triple Crown. After struggling offensively in 1959, Musial used a personal trainer to help maintain his productivity until he decided to retire in 1963. At the time of his retirement, he held or shared 17 major league records, 29 National League records, and nine All-Star Game records. Ironically, in 1964, the season following his retirement, the Cardinals went on to defeat the New York Yankees in an epic 7-game clash, for St. Louis' first World Series championship in nearly two decades (a team which included future Hall of Famer Lou Brock performing what would have likely been Musial's left field duties).[4] In addition to overseeing businesses, such as a restaurant both before and after his playing career, Musial served as the Cardinals' general manager in 1967, winning the pennant and World Series, then quitting that position. He also became noted for his harmonica playing, a skill he acquired during his playing career. Known for his modesty and sportsmanship, Musial was selected for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team in 1999. In February 2011, President Barack Obama presented Musial with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, one of the highest civilian awards that can be bestowed on a person by the United States government.

Early life[edit]
Musial was born in Donora, Pennsylvania, the fifth of the six children (four girls and two boys) of Lukasz and Mary (Lancos) Musiał (/ˈmuːʃaʊ/, MOO-show).[5] His mother was of Carpatho-Rusyn descent and his father was a Polish immigrant who chose the name Stanisław Franciszek for his first son, though his father always referred to Musial using the Polish nickname Stasiu, pronounced "Stashu".[5][6] Musial frequently played baseball with his brother Ed and other friends during his childhood, and considered Lefty Grove his favorite ballplayer.[7][8] Musial also had the benefit of learning about baseball from his neighbor Joe Barbao, a former minor league pitcher.[9] When he enrolled in school, his name was formally changed to Stanley Frank Musial.[5]
At age 15 Musial joined the Donora Zincs, a semi-professional team managed by Barbao.[10] In his Zincs debut he pitched 6 innings and struck out 13 batters, all of them adults.[10] Musial also played one season on the newly revived Donora High School baseball team, where one of his teammates was Buddy Griffey, father of MLB player Ken Griffey, Sr. and grandfather to Ken Griffey, Jr.[11][12] Baseball statistician Bill James described the younger Griffey, in comparison to Musial, as "the second-best left-handed hitting, left-handed throwing outfielder ever born in Donora, Pennsylvania, on November 21."[13] His exploits as a rising player in Pennsylvania earned him the nickname "The Donora Greyhound".[14]
Musial also played basketball and was offered an athletic scholarship in that sport by the University of Pittsburgh.[10][15] Meanwhile, the St. Louis Cardinals had scouted Musial as a pitcher and, in 1937, offered him a professional contract after a workout with their Class D Penn State League affiliate.[16] Musial's father initially resisted the idea of his son pursuing a baseball career, but reluctantly gave his consent after lobbying by both Musial and his mother.[17] Musial also credited his school librarian Helen Kloz for pointing out that baseball was his dream and advising him to pursue it professionally.[17] In what was then a common practice, the Cardinals did not file the contract with the baseball commissioner's office until June 1938. This preserved Musial's amateur eligibility, and he was still able to participate in high school sports, leading Donora High School's basketball team to a playoff appearance.[18] He then reported to the Cardinals' Class D affiliate in West Virginia, the Williamson Red Birds.[19][20]
Professional baseball career[edit]
Minor leagues (1938–41)[edit]
Musial's rookie year with Williamson in 1938 was a period of adjustment both on and off the field. He began gaining more in-depth knowledge about baseball strategy[21] while posting a 6–6 win–loss record and a 4.66 earned run average (ERA), to go along with a .258 batting average.[22] Off the field, he experienced feelings of homesickness while learning to live comfortably and independently on his $65-per-month salary.[21] Musial finished his high school education before returning to Williamson in spring 1939. That season his numbers improved to a 9–2 record, a 4.30 ERA, and a .352 batting average.[23][24]
Musial spent the 1940 season with the Cardinals' other Class D team, the Daytona Beach Islanders, where he developed a lifelong friendship with manager Dickie Kerr.[25] His pitching skills improved under the guidance of Kerr, who also recognized his hitting talent, playing him in the outfield between pitching starts.[26] On May 25, 1940, Musial married fellow Donora resident, Lillian "Lil" Labash, in Daytona Beach, and the couple's first child followed in August.[27] During late August, Musial suffered a shoulder injury while playing in the outfield, and later made an early exit as the starting pitcher in a 12–5 playoff game loss.[28] For a while Musial considered leaving baseball entirely, complaining that he could not afford to support himself and his wife on the $16 a week pay. Kerr talked him out of it, and even took the Musials into his own home to relieve the financial burden. To repay the debt Musial bought Kerr a $20,000 home in Houston in 1958.[29] In 113 games in 1940 he hit .311, while compiling an 18–5 pitching record that included 176 strikeouts and 145 walks.[30][31]
Musial was assigned to the Class AA Columbus Red Birds to begin 1941, though manager, Burt Shotton, and Musial himself quickly realized that the previous year's injury had considerably weakened his arm.[32] He was reassigned to the Class C Springfield Cardinals as a full-time outfielder, and he later credited manager Ollie Vanek for displaying confidence in his hitting ability.[33] During 87 games with Springfield, Musial hit a league-leading .379 before being promoted to the Rochester Red Wings of the International League.[34] He was noted for his unique batting stance, a crouch in which his back was seemingly square to the pitcher.[35] This stance was later described by pitcher Ted Lyons as "a kid peeking around the corner to see if the cops were coming".[36] According to a 1950 description by author Tom Meany, "The bent knees and the crouch give him the appearance of a coiled spring, although most pitchers think of him as a coiled rattlesnake."[37] Musial continued to play well in Rochester—in one three-game stretch, he had 11 hits. He was called up to the Cardinals for the last two weeks of the 1941 season.[38]
Major leagues (1941–44)[edit]

Musial made his major league debut during the second game of a doubleheader at Sportsman's Park on September 17, 1941.[39] The Cardinals were in the midst of a pennant race with the Brooklyn Dodgers; in 12 games, Musial collected 20 hits for a .426 batting average.[40] Despite Musial's late contributions, the Cardinals finished two and one-half games behind the 100-game-winning Dodgers.[41]
Cardinals manager Billy Southworth used Musial as a left fielder to begin 1942, sometimes lifting him for a pinch-hitter against left-handed pitching.[42] Musial was hitting .315 by late June,[43] as the Cardinals resumed battling the Dodgers for first place in the National League (NL).[44] The Cardinals took sole possession of first place on September 13, and when Musial caught a fly ball to end the first game of a doubleheader on September 27 they clinched the pennant with their 105th win.[45] He finished the season with a .315 batting average and 72 runs batted in (RBI) in 140 games. Musial received national publicity when he was named by St. Louis Post-Dispatch sports editor J. Roy Stockton as his choice for Rookie of the Year in a Saturday Evening Post article.[46][47]
The Cardinals played the American League champion New York Yankees in the 1942 World Series.[48] Representing the winning run at home plate in the bottom of the ninth inning of Game 1 at Sportsman's Park, Musial grounded out with the bases loaded to end the game .[49] Musial's first hit of the Series was an RBI single that provided the margin of victory in Game 2, allowing the Cardinals to tie the Series.[50] Over the next three games at Yankee Stadium, Musial had three more hits as the Cardinals defeated the Yankees in the Series four games to one.[51] Musial batted .222 for the Series, with two runs scored.[52]
Musial's 1943 season started with a brief contract holdout in spring training.[53] He made the National League All-Star team for the first time as a starting left fielder and got a double in the All-Star Game on July 13.[53] He finished the season leading the major leagues in hitting with a .357 batting average and led the NL in hits (220), doubles (48), triples (20), total bases (347), on-base percentage (.425), and slugging percentage (.562).[54] This performance earned him his first NL Most Valuable Player Award, ahead of teammate and catcher Walker Cooper (.318 batting average).[54] After romping to another NL pennant by 18 games, the Cardinals again faced the Yankees in the 1943 World Series.[55] Musial had a single in the Cardinals' Game 1 loss, and scored a run in a Game 2 win.[55] The Cardinals did not win another game in the Series, but the loser's bonus share paid to each Cardinals player ($4,321.99) still amounted to nearly two-thirds of Musial's regular season salary.[56]
United States involvement in World War II began to impinge on Musial's baseball career in 1944, as he underwent a physical examination in prelude to possible service in the armed forces.[57] He ultimately remained with the Cardinals for the entire season, posting a .347 batting average with 197 hits.[58][59] The Cardinals claimed the NL pennant for the third consecutive season, and faced St. Louis's other major league team, the Browns, in the 1944 World Series.[60] The Browns took a 2–1 lead, while Musial hit .250 with zero RBI.[61] He broke out in Game 4 with a two-run home run, single, double, and a walk as part of a 5–1 Cardinals win.[61] The Cardinals went on to defeat the Browns in six games, and Musial posted a .304 batting average for the Series.[62][63]
Sojourn in the U.S. Navy (1945–46)[edit]
Musial enlisted in the United States Navy on January 23, 1945, during World War II. He was initially assigned to noncombat duty at the Naval Training Station in Bainbridge, Maryland.[64] In June 1945, he was assigned to Special Services in Hawaii, and was assigned to a ferry launch unit to bring back damaged ship crews entering Pearl Harbor where he was able to play baseball every afternoon in the naval base's eight-team league.[65] After being granted emergency leave to see his ailing father in January 1946, he was briefly assigned to the Philadelphia Navy Yard before his honorable discharge from the Navy as a Seaman Second Class in March 1946.[65][66]
In 2007, Musial received the Navy Memorial's Lone Sailor Award, which honors Navy veterans who have excelled in civilian life.

1946–49[edit]


"Every time Stan came up they chanted, 'Here comes the man!'"

—Cardinals traveling secretary Leo Ward relates Dodger fans' nickname for Musial to sportswriter Bob Broeg[67]
Rejoining the Cardinals under new manager Eddie Dyer, Musial posted a .388 batting average by the middle of May 1946.[68] He also became close friends with new teammate Red Schoendienst, who had joined the Cardinals during Musial's absence in 1945.[69] During the season, Musial (who was under contract to the Cardinals for $13,500 in 1946) was offered a five-year, $125,000 contract, plus a $50,000 bonus, to join the Mexican League.[70] He declined the offer, and after manager Dyer spoke to club owner Sam Breadon, Musial was given a $5,000 raise later in 1946.[71]
It was also during the 1946 season that Musial acquired his nickname of Stan the Man.[67] During the June 23 game against the Dodgers at Ebbets Field, St. Louis Post-Dispatch sportswriter Bob Broeg heard Dodger fans chanting whenever Musial came to bat, but could not understand the words.[67][72] Later that day over dinner, Broeg asked Cardinals traveling secretary Leo Ward if he had understood what the Dodger fans had been chanting.[67] Ward said, "Every time Stan came up they chanted, 'Here comes the man!'" "'That man,' you mean", Broeg said. "No, the man", replied Ward.[67] Broeg mentioned this story in his Post-Dispatch column, and Musial was thereafter known as Stan "The Man".[67]




Musial on the cover of Baseball Digest, September 1948


In June 1946, Dyer began to use Musial as a first baseman.[73] The Cardinals finished the season tied with the Dodgers,[74] prompting a three-game playoff for the pennant. Musial's Game 1 triple and Game 2 double contributed to the Cardinals' two-games-to-none series victory.[75] Facing the Boston Red Sox, the Cardinals won the 1946 World Series four games to three,[76] as Musial had six hits and four RBI.[77] He batted .365 for the season and won his second NL MVP Award, receiving 22 out of a possible 24 first-place votes, finishing ahead of Brooklyn's Dixie Walker (.319 batting average).[78]
Musial began the 1947 season by hitting .146 in April.[79] On May 9, team doctor Dr. Robert Hyland confirmed a previous diagnosis of appendicitis, while discovering that Musial was concurrently suffering from tonsillitis.[80] He received treatment, but did not have either his appendix or tonsils surgically removed until after the season ended.[81] Despite his health woes, he finished the year with a batting average of .312.[82]
Fully recovered from his ailments, Musial recorded his 1,000th career hit on April 25, 1948.[83] After a May 7 St. Louis Globe-Democrat article criticized baseball players for appearing in cigarette advertisements, he made a personal decision to never again appear in such ads.[84] By June 24, his batting average was .408, prompting Brooklyn pitcher Preacher Roe to comically announce his new method for retiring Musial: "Walk him on four pitches and pick him off first."[85] Given a mid-season pay raise by new Cardinals owner Robert E. Hannegan for his outstanding performance, Musial hit a home run in the All-Star Game.[86] On September 22, he registered five hits in a game for the fourth time in the season, tying a mark set by Ty Cobb in 1922.[87]


"He missed tying for the top in homers by one rained out home run. If it had counted, he would have won the Triple Crown that year...and in addition have been the only player of this century to lead the league in runs, hits, double, triples, and slugging percentage. What a year!"

—Sportswriter Bob Broeg, on Musial's 1948 season[88]
Musial finished the 1948 season leading the major leagues in batting average (.376), hits (230), doubles (46), triples (18), total bases (429), and slugging percentage (.702).[89] Winning the NL batting title by a 43-point margin, with an on-base percentage lead of 27 points and a 138-point slugging percentage margin—the latter being the largest gap since Rogers Hornsby's 1925 season—Musial became the first player to win three NL MVP awards.[89] If a home run he hit during a rained out game had been counted in his season totals, he would have won the Triple Crown by leading the NL in batting average, home runs, and runs batted in.[89][90]
Anticipating life after his baseball career, Musial began the first of several business partnerships with Julius "Biggie" Garagnani in January 1949, opening "Stan Musial & Biggie's" restaurant.[91][92] He approached the 1949 season with the intent to try to hit more home runs, stating he had hit 39 the previous season "without trying".[93] His new focus on hitting for power backfired, as pitchers began using the outside part of the plate to induce him to ground out to the first or second baseman.[93] Musial soon stopped focusing on hitting home runs and resumed his consistent offensive production by the end of May.[93] He received his sixth consecutive All-Star player selection and finished the season leading the NL in hits (207) while playing in every game.[94] However, the Cardinals, with 96 wins, finished one game behind the Dodgers.[95]
In the late 1940s, when baseball was slowly becoming integrated, Musial—along with his roommate Red Schoendienst—would be lauded by newcomers such as Dodgers' pitcher Don Newcombe for their tolerance. "They never...had the need to sit in the dugout and call a black guy a bunch of names", Newcombe said, "because he was trying to change the game and make it what it should have been in the first place, a game for all people."[96]
1950–54[edit]
Musial began the 1950s by posting a .350 batting average before participating in the 1950 All-Star Game, where in fan balloting he was the NL's number two choice.[97] He had the longest hitting streak of his career during the 1950 season—a 30-game stretch that ended on July 27.[97] With the Cardinals falling 14 games out of first place by September, manager Dyer used him at first base and all three outfield positions.[97][98] New Cardinals manager Marty Marion led the team to a third-place finish in 1951, while Musial was named The Sporting News Major League Player of the Year.[99]


"No man has ever been a perfect ballplayer. Stan Musial, however, is the closest to being perfect in the game today.... He plays as hard when his club is away out in front of a game as he does when they're just a run or two behind."

—Ty Cobb, on Musial in a 1952 Life magazine article[100]
National media attention inadvertently turned to Musial a month before the 1952 season began, after Ty Cobb wrote an article regarding modern baseball players that was published in Life magazine.[100] Cobb singled out Musial and Phil Rizzuto as the only players "who can be mentioned in the same breath with the oldtime greats".[100] Cobb went on to refer to Musial as "a better player than Joe DiMaggio was in his prime."[100] In response, Musial displayed his characteristic modesty, saying, "Cobb is baseball's greatest. I don't want to contradict him, but I can't say that I was ever as good as Joe DiMaggio."[100]
The only major league pitching appearance of Musial's career occurred as a publicity stunt during the last Cardinals home game of the 1952 season.[101][102] Manager Eddie Stanky had a reluctant Musial pitch to Frank Baumholtz, the runner-up to Musial for the best batting average in the NL that season.[101] With Baumholtz batting right-handed for the first time in his career, Musial's first pitch was hit so hard it ricocheted off the shin of third baseman Solly Hemus and into the left field corner.[101] The play was ruled an error, and Musial was embarrassed enough by his complicity in the gimmick to avoid pitching again for the remainder of his career.[101]
The Cardinals franchise was up for sale in early 1953, and Musial and Schoendienst advised their friend and fellow duck-hunter Gussie Busch to consider buying the team.[103] Busch used the resources of the Anheuser-Busch company to purchase the Cardinals, keeping Musial in St. Louis by averting the possibility of a move by the team to another city.[103][104] The 1953 season marked Musial's 10th NL All-Star selection, and the 12th consecutive time he finished a major league season with a batting average above .300.[46][105]
Musial accomplished another historical feat on May 2, 1954, in a doubleheader in St. Louis against the New York Giants: he hit three home runs in the first contest, then added two more in the second to become the first major leaguer to hit five home runs in a doubleheader.[106] In addition to his five home runs, he also hit a single in the first game, setting a new record of 21 total bases for a doubleheader.[106] The only player besides Musial to hit five home runs in a doubleheader is Nate Colbert, who achieved the feat in 1972.[107]
1955–59[edit]
Musial made his 12th NL All-Star appearance in 1955 as a reserve player, when Cincinnati's Ted Kluszewski outpolled him by 150,000 votes to get on the starting lineup at first base.[108] Musial entered the game as a pinch hitter in the fourth inning, and played left field as the game entered extra innings.[109] Leading off the bottom of the 12th, he hit a home run to give the NL a 6–5 victory.[109]




Musial in 1957


The 1956 season marked another milestone for Musial, when he broke Mel Ott's NL record for extra-base hits on August 12.[110] Earlier that season, Cardinals general manager "Trader Frank" Lane began negotiations to trade him for Philadelphia pitcher Robin Roberts.[111] When Cardinals owner Gussie Busch learned of the possible move, he made it clear that Musial was not available for any trade.[112] Instead, Lane dealt Musial's close friend Schoendienst to the New York Giants; an upset Musial made no immediate comment to the press.[113]
On June 11, 1957, Musial tied the NL record for consecutive games played with his 822nd, a streak that began on the last day of the 1951 season.[114] Despite ballot stuffing by Cincinnati Reds fans, he was selected and played in the All-Star Game held at Sportsman's Park.[115] When he overextended his swing while batting during a game on August 23, Musial fractured a bone in his left shoulder socket and tore muscles over his collarbone.[116] He was unable to play again until September 8, ending his consecutive games-played streak at 895.[116] He finished 1957 as Sports Illustrated's "Sportsman of the Year".[117]


"Line drive! Into left field! Hit number three thousand! A run has scored! Musial around first, on his way to second with a double. Holy Cow! He came through!"

—Harry Caray's radio play-by-play call of Musial's 3,000th major league hit[118]
Musial signed one of the first $100,000 contracts in NL history on January 29, 1958. (According to Baseball Almanac, Hank Greenberg was the first with Pittsburgh in 1947.)[119] He quickly demonstrated a return on the investment by sharing with Willie Mays the inaugural (and for the only time in Musial's career) NL Player of the Month in May (no such award was given in April until 1969) batting .374, with 4 HR, and 16 RBI. Also that month, as he was approaching the 3,000-hit milestone in his major league career, he expressed a desire to record the hit in St. Louis.[120] He ultimately reached the mark with a pinch-hit, sixth inning RBI double at Chicago's Wrigley Field on May 13.[121][122] The eighth major league player to reach 3,000 hits, and the first to reach the milestone with an extra-base hit, Musial was greeted at St. Louis Union Station that evening by roughly 1,000 fans.[123] Finishing the season in sixth place, the Cardinals embarked on an exhibition tour of Japan, winning 14 of 16 games against top players from the Central and Pacific Japanese Leagues.[124]
Taking a new approach to preparation for the 1959 season, Musial was given permission to report late to spring training so that he might conserve his energy for the duration of the year.[125] Musial, at 6 feet (180 cm) tall, had maintained a weight of around 175 pounds (79 kg) throughout his career. He reported to spring training approximately 10 pounds (4.5 kg) overweight and in substandard physical condition.[126][127] He began the season with one hit in 15 at-bats.[127] Despite his early offensive struggles, he single-handedly spoiled potential no-hitters on April 16 and 19.[127] A game-winning home run on May 7 made him the first major league player ever with 400 home runs and 3,000 hits.[127] As he continued to hit at a relatively low pace, his playing time was limited by Cardinals manager Solly Hemus at various points during the season.[128] Seeking more revenue for the players' pension fund, Major League Baseball held two All-Star games in a season for the first time through 1962.[129] Musial made his 16th All-Star appearance (16th season)[3] and pinch-hit in both contests, flying out in the July 7 game and drawing a walk in the August 3 game.[129] He finished the season with 115 regular game appearances, a .255 batting average, 37 runs, and a slugging percentage of .428.[46]
During the 1959 season, John F. Kennedy approached Musial about supporting Kennedy's campaign for President, citing their close ages. Musial campaigned for Kennedy later that year and became a supporter of the Democrat.[130]
On June 30, 1959, Musial was the batter in one of the oddest plays in baseball history. In a game between the Cardinals and Chicago Cubs, he was at the plate with a count of 3–1. Bob Anderson's next pitch was errant, evading catcher Sammy Taylor and rolling all the way to the backstop. Umpire Vic Delmore called ball four, even as Anderson and Taylor contended that Musial had foul tipped the ball. Because the ball was still in play and Delmore was embroiled in an argument with the catcher and pitcher, Musial kept running in attempt to make second base. Seeing that Musial was trying for second, Alvin Dark ran to the backstop to retrieve the ball. The ball wound up in the hands of field announcer Pat Pieper, but Dark ended up getting it back anyway. Absentmindedly, however, Delmore pulled out a new ball and gave it to Taylor. Anderson finally noticed that Musial was trying for second, took the new ball, and threw it to second baseman Tony Taylor. Anderson's throw flew over Taylor's head into the outfield. Dark, at the same time that Anderson threw the new ball, threw the original ball to shortstop Ernie Banks. Musial did not see Dark's throw and only noticed Anderson's ball fly over the second baseman's head, so he tried to go to third base. On his way there, he was tagged by Banks, and after a delay he was ruled out.[131]
1960–63[edit]
Based on his 1959 performance, Musial accepted a pay cut in 1960 from his previous $100,000 salary to $80,000.[132] He was eager to prove that his mediocre performance was the result of improper physical conditioning, and he enlisted the help of Walter Eberhardt, Saint Louis University's director of physical education.[133] In June 1960, newspaper articles began speculating that Musial would soon retire, yet he finished the season with a .275 batting average.[46][134] He addressed the speculation in September, confirming that he would play again in 1961. His .288 batting average that season reaffirmed his decision.[46][135] In 1962, Musial posted a .330 batting average, good for third in the batting race, with 19 homers and 82 RBI. As a pinch-hitter, he had 14 base hits in 19 at-bats (.737).[136] Along the way, he established new NL career marks for hits, RBI, and runs scored. That same year on July 8, the 41-year-old Musial became the oldest player ever to hit three home runs in one game.





Stan Musial's number 6 was retired by the St. Louis Cardinals in 1963.


The Cardinals began 1963 by winning 10 of their first 15 games, as Musial posted a .237 batting average.[137] He set a new major league record for career extra-base hits on May 8 and improved his batting average to .277 by the end of the month.[138] Making his 20th All-Star appearance[3] and 24th All-Star Game appearance on July 9, 1963, he pinch-hit in the fifth inning.[138] Asked by general manager Bing Devine on July 26 what his plans were, Musial said that he would retire at season's end.[139] He waited until the Cardinals team picnic on August 12 to publicly announce his decision, hopeful he could retire on a winning note.[140]
Musial became a grandfather for the first time in the early hours of September 10; later that day, he hit a home run in his first at-bat.[141] After sweeping a doubleheader on September 15, the Cardinals had won 19 of their last 20 games, and were one game behind the Los Angeles Dodgers.[141] The Dodgers then swept the Cardinals in a three-game series in St. Louis and clinched the NL pennant on September 25.[142] Musial's last game, on September 29, 1963, was preceded by an hour-long retirement ceremony.[143] Speakers at the event included baseball commissioner Ford Frick, Cardinals broadcaster Harry Caray, and Cardinals owner Gussie Busch, who announced that Musial's uniform number "6" would be retired by the team.[143] During the game, Musial recorded a single in the fourth inning, then hit a single to right field that scored teammate Curt Flood in the sixth.[144] Cardinals manager Johnny Keane brought in Gary Kolb as a pinch-runner for Musial, bringing his major league career to an end.[144] Just as he had recorded two base hits in his major league debut, Musial finished his last game with two hits, as well.[144] Musial finished with the all-time National League hits record and second to only Ty Cobb on the all-time Major League list. Musial's last career hit was out of reach of Cincinnati Reds second baseman Pete Rose, who would go on to break Cobb's record to become baseball's all-time hit king.


"All Musial represents is more than two decades of sustained excellence and complete decency as a human being."

—Broadcaster Bob Costas, on Musial[35]
At the time of his retirement, Musial held or shared 17 major league records, 29 NL records, and nine All-Star Game records.[145] Among those records, he ranked as the major league career leader in extra-base hits (1,377) and total bases (6,134).[144] He also held NL career marks in categories such as hits (3,630), games played (3,026), doubles (725), and RBI (1,951).[144] He finished his career with 475 home runs despite never having led the NL in the category.[144] Jerry Lansche speculates Musial would likely have become the second player, after Babe Ruth, with 2,000 RBI, and would have exceeded 500 career home runs had he not served in the military.[146] His lowest full season RBI output before the war was 72 (in 1942) and as he needed only 49 RBI to reach 2,000 for his full career, he certainly would have exceeded 2,000 RBI by playing without injury in 1945. His home run production is a different story and it is highly unlikely he would have reached 500. He did not hit more than 13 home runs in any season before he entered the navy and did not hit as many as 25 (the number he would have needed to become a 500 career homer club member) until 1948, 3 years after returning to baseball from World War II. His career hit total was evenly split between 1,815 hits at home and 1,815 hits on the road.[36] Steven R. Bullock speculates that it is possible that without military service Musial might have continued playing to attempt to exceed Ty Cobb's career hit record of 4,191.[146] Even if Musial had hit safely 207 times (the average of his hits in the 2 years before and the 2 years after his service in the navy) in 1945, he still would have been 354 hits short of tying Ty. His hit total in his last season at age 42 was only 86; even if he could have had 103 hits a season (the average of his last 5 seasons) he would have had to play to age 47 to attain the hits record.
He was the first major league player to appear in more than 1,000 games at two different positions, registering 1,896 games in the outfield and 1,016 at first base.[147] Since Musial's retirement in 1963, Tony Gwynn has been the only player to finish his career with a higher lifetime batting average. Hank Aaron has been the only player to surpass his record of 6,134 total bases.
In Musial's 3,026 major league appearances, he was never ejected from a game.[148] Speaking about his quiet reputation within the sport's history, sportscaster Bob Costas said, "He didn't hit a homer in his last at-bat; he hit a single. He didn't hit in 56 straight games. He married his high school sweetheart and stayed married to her. ... All Musial represents is more than two decades of sustained excellence and complete decency as a human being."[35]
Post-playing career and family life[edit]
Musial was named a vice president of the St. Louis Cardinals in September 1963, and he remained in that position until after the 1966 season.[149] From February 1964 to January 1967, he also served as President Lyndon Johnson's physical fitness adviser, a part-time position created to promote better fitness among American citizens.[150] Before the 1967 season began, the Cardinals named Musial the team's general manager, and he oversaw the club's World Series championship that year.[149] He won the allegiance of Cardinals players by making fair offers from the outset of player-contract negotiations and creating an in-stadium babysitting service so players' wives could attend games.[151] His longtime business partner Biggie Garagnani died in June 1967, prompting Musial to devote more time to managing his restaurant and other business interests.[152] He came to realize that the detail-oriented desk job was not his forte. He consequently decided to step down as general manager, before even completing a full year on the job.[152]
Musial—like Phil Linz—was noted for his harmonica playing, which included his rendition of "Take Me Out to the Ball Game".[153] Through the 1990s, he frequently played the harmonica at public gatherings, such as the annual Baseball Hall of Fame induction ceremony and various charity events.[154] He performed on the television show Hee Haw and in 1994 recorded 18 songs that were sold in tandem with a harmonica-playing instruction booklet.[154]
Even though Musial left Donora after high school, he retained close ties to the town throughout the rest of his life. He maintained membership in local social clubs, and regularly sent a local doctor boxes of autographed baseballs, with the town's mayor using some for United Way fundraising.[155] Musial also gave free meals at the restaurant he owned in St. Louis to any customers who presented valid ID proving they were Donora residents.[156]
Musial met Lillian Susan Labash, the daughter of a local grocer,[155] in Donora when both were 15, and married her in St. Paul's Catholic Church in Daytona Beach, Florida on May 25, 1940. They had four children: son Richard, and daughters Gerry, Janet, and Jeanie.[148][157] Lillian Musial died at 91, on May 3, 2012; their marriage had lasted for almost 72 years.[158] In his final years, Musial suffered from Alzheimer's disease.
Honors and recognition[edit]


"Here stands baseball's perfect warrior. Here stands baseball's perfect knight."

—Quote inscribed on the base of Musial's statue, attributed to former commissioner Ford Frick[159]
On August 4, 1968, a statue of Musial was erected outside of Busch Memorial Stadium on the northeast grounds of the St. Louis stadium.[152] The statue was moved from its original location to the west side of the new Busch Stadium for its first season in 2006, where it became a popular meeting place for generations of Cardinals fans.[160] Musial's statue is inscribed with a quote attributed to former baseball commissioner Ford Frick: "Here stands baseball's perfect warrior. Here stands baseball's perfect knight."[152]
Musial was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility in 1969, when he was named on 93.2 percent of the ballots.[161] On June 14, 1973 he was the first inductee into the National Polish-American Hall of Fame, housed at St. Mary's College in Orchard Lake, Michigan. In 1989, he was inducted into the St. Louis Walk of Fame.[162] Five years later, a baseball field was named after him in his hometown of Donora.[163] He was ranked tenth on The Sporting News' list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players published in 1998.[164] He was also one of the 30 players selected to the Major League Baseball All-Century Team, added by a special committee after he finished 11th in fan voting among outfielders.[165] In 2000, he was inducted into the Hall of Famous Missourians, and a bronze bust depicting him is on permanent display in the rotunda of the Missouri State Capitol.[166] In January, 2014, the Cardinals announced Musial among 22 former players and personnel to be inducted into the St. Louis Cardinals Hall of Fame Museum for the inaugural class of 2014.[167]




President Barack Obama awards the 2010 Presidential Medal of Freedom to Stan Musial in a ceremony in the East Room of the White House February 15, 2011.


Nearly two decades after Musial retired, baseball statistician Bill James and the sabermetrics movement began providing new ways of comparing players across baseball history.[168] In 2001, James ranked Musial the tenth-greatest baseball player in history, and the second-best left fielder of all time.[169] According to Baseball-Reference.com, he ranks fifth all-time among hitters on the Black Ink Test, and third all-time on the Gray Ink Test—measures designed to compare players of different eras.[46][170] He ranks first on Baseball-Reference's Hall of Fame Monitor Test, and is tied for second in the Hall of Fame Career Standards Test.[46] Despite his statistical accomplishments, he is sometimes referred to as the most underrated or overlooked athlete in modern American sports history.[171][172] For instance, in his analysis of baseball's under- and overrated players in 2007, sportswriter Jayson Stark said, "I can't think of any all-time great in any sport who gets left out of more who's-the-greatest conversations than Stan Musial."[171]
Musial threw out the first pitch in the fifth game of the 2006 World Series and delivered the ceremonial first pitch ball to President Barack Obama at the 2009 Major League Baseball All-Star Game.[173] A "Stan the Man" day was held in his honor by the Cardinals on May 18, 2008.[174] In 2010, another one of the Cardinals' greatest sluggers, Albert Pujols, whose nickname was "El Hombre", said he didn't want to be called "The Man", even in Spanish, because "There is one man that gets that respect, and that is Stan Musial." [96] Also in 2010, the Cardinals launched a campaign to build support for awarding Musial the Presidential Medal of Freedom for his lifetime of achievement and service.[175] The campaign realized its goal, and on February 15, 2011, Musial was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Barack Obama[176][177] who called him "an icon untarnished, a beloved pillar of the community, a gentleman you'd want your kids to emulate."[178]
On October 17, 2012, Musial made his final appearance at Busch Stadium, riding in a golf cart around the warning track before Game 4 of the National League Championship Series. Musial stopped at both dugouts and greeted San Francisco Giants manager Bruce Bochy and Cardinals manager Mike Matheny. The Cardinals would go on to win Game 4 by a score of 8-3, but lost the pennant to the eventual World Series champion Giants.

Death[edit]
On January 19, 2013, Musial died at age 92 of natural causes at his home in Ladue, Missouri, on the same day that fellow MLB Hall of Fame inductee Earl Weaver passed away.[181][182] Musial was surrounded by his family as he died peacefully. Cardinals owner Bill DeWitt, Jr. released the following statement:

We have lost the most beloved member of the Cardinals family. Stan Musial was the greatest player in Cardinals history and one of the best players in the history of baseball. The entire Cardinals organization extends its sincere condolences to Stan's family, including his children Richard, Gerry, Janet and Jean, as well as his eleven grandchildren and twelve great grandchildren. We join fans everywhere in mourning the loss of our dear friend and reflect on how fortunate we all are to have known 'Stan the Man'.[183]

Upon hearing the news of his death, fans gathered and began an impromptu memorial at his statue outside Busch Stadium; the Cardinals issued a release saying the memorial would be left in place for some time.[184] In a laudatory obituary, The New York Times quoted famed New York manager Leo Durocher: "There is only one way to pitch to Musial—under the plate."[185]
Missouri Governor Jay Nixon commented: "Stan Musial was a great American hero who—with the utmost humility—inspired us all to aim high and dream big. The world is emptier today without him, but far better to have known him. The legacy of 'baseball's perfect warrior' will endure and inspire generations to come."[186]
St. Louis Mayor Francis Slay tweeted: "Sad as we are, we are fortunate to have had Stan in STL for so long, and are also glad that Stan and Lil are together again." He ordered flags at half-mast in the city.[187]
"Major League Baseball has lost one of its true legends in Stan Musial, a Hall of Famer in every sense and a man who led a great American life", Commissioner Bud Selig said. "He was the heart and soul of the historic St. Louis Cardinals franchise for generations, and he served his country during World War II. A recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2011, Stan's life embodies baseball's unparalleled history and why this game is the national pastime."[188]
Thousands of fans braved cold temperatures on January 24 for a public visitation at the Cathedral Basilica of Saint Louis, where Musial lay in state, dressed in his trademark cardinal-red blazer and with a harmonica in his lapel pocket, flanked by a Navy honor guard. A private funeral Mass was held on Saturday, January 26, 2013, at the New Cathedral in St. Louis, televised locally by KTVI and KPLR as well as Fox Sports Midwest on pay-television. New York's Cardinal Timothy Dolan, who in his first episcopal post served as an auxiliary bishop of the Archdiocese of Saint Louis, was the principal celebrant, and Knoxville's Bishop Richard F. Stika, Musial's former parish priest, was the homilist.[189] Bob Costas gave the principal eulogy, calling him "the genuine hero who as the years and decades passed, and disillusionment came from other directions, never once let us down", and quoting fellow Cooperstown honoree Mickey Mantle, who once said that Musial "was a better player than me because he was a better man than me".[190] Following the funeral, Musial's family led a procession from the New Cathedral to Busch Stadium, where they laid a memorial wreath at his statue. Once the wreath was placed and Musial's family began to walk back to their vehicles, the hundreds of Cardinal fans gathered for the wreath ceremony gave both Musial and his family one final salute. That salute was the fans singing "Take Me Out to the Ball Game" before Musial was taken to his final place of rest.
Musial was the last living member of the Cardinals team that won the 1942 World Series. At the time of his death, no living players had played on an earlier World Series-winning team.
The Stan Musial Veterans Memorial Bridge in St. Louis (carries  I‑70) was built in his memorial.
Legacy[edit]
As a reflection of his popularity, Musial has had infrastructure named after him. In May 2011 the Pennsylvania State Senate changed the name of the bridge that carries the C. Vance Deicas Memorial Highway (S.R. 1077) over the Monongahela River from Donora-Monessen Bridge to Stan Musial Bridge after Musial who was a native of the area.[191] In October 2013 the St. Louis Fire Department started operating a fireboat named after Musial.[192] In July 2013, the new Interstate 70 bridge over the Mississippi River between Illinois and Missouri at St. Louis received the official name of "Stan Musial Veterans Memorial Bridge"[193]

Stanley Frank Musial (/ˈmjuːziəl/ or /ˈmjuːʒəl/; born Stanisław Franciszek Musiał; November 21, 1920 – January 19, 2013), nicknamed Stan the Man, was an American Major League Baseball (MLB) outfielder and first baseman. He spent 22 seasons playing for the St. Louis Cardinals, from 1941 to 1944 and 1946 to 1963. Widely considered to be one of the greatest and most consistent hitters in baseball history,[1] Musial was a first-ballot inductee into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1969, and was also selected to the St. Louis Cardinals Hall of Fame in the inaugural class of 2014.
Musial batted .331 over the course of his career and set National League (NL) records for career hits (3,630), runs batted in (1,951), games played (3,026), at bats (10,972), runs scored (1,949) and doubles (725), his 475 career home runs then ranked second in NL history behind Mel Ott's total of 511. His 6,134 total bases remained a major league record until surpassed by Hank Aaron, and his hit total still ranks fourth all-time, and is the highest by any player who spent his career with only one team. A seven-time batting champion with identical totals of 1,815 hits at home and 1,815 hits on the road, he was named the National League's (NL) Most Valuable Player (MVP) three times and led St. Louis to three World Series championships. He also shares the major league record for the most All-Star Games played (24) with Hank Aaron and Willie Mays.[a] [2]
Musial was born in Donora, Pennsylvania, where he frequently played baseball informally or in organized settings, and eventually played on the baseball team at Donora High School. Signed to a professional contract by the St. Louis Cardinals as a pitcher in 1938, Musial was converted into an outfielder prior to his major league debut in 1941. Noted for his unique batting stance, he quickly established himself as a consistent and productive hitter. In his first full season, 1942, the Cardinals won the World Series. The following year, he led the NL in six different offensive categories and earned his first MVP award. He was also named to the NL All-Star squad for the first time; he appeared in every All-Star game in every subsequent season he played.[3] Musial won his second World Series championship in 1944, then missed the entire 1945 season while serving in the Navy.
After completing his military service during the war, Musial returned to baseball in 1946 and resumed his consistent hitting. That year he earned his second MVP award and third World Series title. His third MVP award came in 1948, when he finished one home run short of winning baseball's Triple Crown. After struggling offensively in 1959, Musial used a personal trainer to help maintain his productivity until he decided to retire in 1963. At the time of his retirement, he held or shared 17 major league records, 29 National League records, and nine All-Star Game records. Ironically, in 1964, the season following his retirement, the Cardinals went on to defeat the New York Yankees in an epic 7-game clash, for St. Louis' first World Series championship in nearly two decades (a team which included future Hall of Famer Lou Brock performing what would have likely been Musial's left field duties).[4] In addition to overseeing businesses, such as a restaurant both before and after his playing career, Musial served as the Cardinals' general manager in 1967, winning the pennant and World Series, then quitting that position. He also became noted for his harmonica playing, a skill he acquired during his playing career. Known for his modesty and sportsmanship, Musial was selected for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team in 1999. In February 2011, President Barack Obama presented Musial with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, one of the highest civilian awards that can be bestowed on a person by the United States government.

Early life[edit]
Musial was born in Donora, Pennsylvania, the fifth of the six children (four girls and two boys) of Lukasz and Mary (Lancos) Musiał (/ˈmuːʃaʊ/, MOO-show).[5] His mother was of Carpatho-Rusyn descent and his father was a Polish immigrant who chose the name Stanisław Franciszek for his first son, though his father always referred to Musial using the Polish nickname Stasiu, pronounced "Stashu".[5][6] Musial frequently played baseball with his brother Ed and other friends during his childhood, and considered Lefty Grove his favorite ballplayer.[7][8] Musial also had the benefit of learning about baseball from his neighbor Joe Barbao, a former minor league pitcher.[9] When he enrolled in school, his name was formally changed to Stanley Frank Musial.[5]
At age 15 Musial joined the Donora Zincs, a semi-professional team managed by Barbao.[10] In his Zincs debut he pitched 6 innings and struck out 13 batters, all of them adults.[10] Musial also played one season on the newly revived Donora High School baseball team, where one of his teammates was Buddy Griffey, father of MLB player Ken Griffey, Sr. and grandfather to Ken Griffey, Jr.[11][12] Baseball statistician Bill James described the younger Griffey, in comparison to Musial, as "the second-best left-handed hitting, left-handed throwing outfielder ever born in Donora, Pennsylvania, on November 21."[13] His exploits as a rising player in Pennsylvania earned him the nickname "The Donora Greyhound".[14]
Musial also played basketball and was offered an athletic scholarship in that sport by the University of Pittsburgh.[10][15] Meanwhile, the St. Louis Cardinals had scouted Musial as a pitcher and, in 1937, offered him a professional contract after a workout with their Class D Penn State League affiliate.[16] Musial's father initially resisted the idea of his son pursuing a baseball career, but reluctantly gave his consent after lobbying by both Musial and his mother.[17] Musial also credited his school librarian Helen Kloz for pointing out that baseball was his dream and advising him to pursue it professionally.[17] In what was then a common practice, the Cardinals did not file the contract with the baseball commissioner's office until June 1938. This preserved Musial's amateur eligibility, and he was still able to participate in high school sports, leading Donora High School's basketball team to a playoff appearance.[18] He then reported to the Cardinals' Class D affiliate in West Virginia, the Williamson Red Birds.[19][20]
Professional baseball career[edit]
Minor leagues (1938–41)[edit]
Musial's rookie year with Williamson in 1938 was a period of adjustment both on and off the field. He began gaining more in-depth knowledge about baseball strategy[21] while posting a 6–6 win–loss record and a 4.66 earned run average (ERA), to go along with a .258 batting average.[22] Off the field, he experienced feelings of homesickness while learning to live comfortably and independently on his $65-per-month salary.[21] Musial finished his high school education before returning to Williamson in spring 1939. That season his numbers improved to a 9–2 record, a 4.30 ERA, and a .352 batting average.[23][24]
Musial spent the 1940 season with the Cardinals' other Class D team, the Daytona Beach Islanders, where he developed a lifelong friendship with manager Dickie Kerr.[25] His pitching skills improved under the guidance of Kerr, who also recognized his hitting talent, playing him in the outfield between pitching starts.[26] On May 25, 1940, Musial married fellow Donora resident, Lillian "Lil" Labash, in Daytona Beach, and the couple's first child followed in August.[27] During late August, Musial suffered a shoulder injury while playing in the outfield, and later made an early exit as the starting pitcher in a 12–5 playoff game loss.[28] For a while Musial considered leaving baseball entirely, complaining that he could not afford to support himself and his wife on the $16 a week pay. Kerr talked him out of it, and even took the Musials into his own home to relieve the financial burden. To repay the debt Musial bought Kerr a $20,000 home in Houston in 1958.[29] In 113 games in 1940 he hit .311, while compiling an 18–5 pitching record that included 176 strikeouts and 145 walks.[30][31]
Musial was assigned to the Class AA Columbus Red Birds to begin 1941, though manager, Burt Shotton, and Musial himself quickly realized that the previous year's injury had considerably weakened his arm.[32] He was reassigned to the Class C Springfield Cardinals as a full-time outfielder, and he later credited manager Ollie Vanek for displaying confidence in his hitting ability.[33] During 87 games with Springfield, Musial hit a league-leading .379 before being promoted to the Rochester Red Wings of the International League.[34] He was noted for his unique batting stance, a crouch in which his back was seemingly square to the pitcher.[35] This stance was later described by pitcher Ted Lyons as "a kid peeking around the corner to see if the cops were coming".[36] According to a 1950 description by author Tom Meany, "The bent knees and the crouch give him the appearance of a coiled spring, although most pitchers think of him as a coiled rattlesnake."[37] Musial continued to play well in Rochester—in one three-game stretch, he had 11 hits. He was called up to the Cardinals for the last two weeks of the 1941 season.[38]
Major leagues (1941–44)[edit]




Musial's statue outside of Busch Stadium captures his signature batting stance.


Musial made his major league debut during the second game of a doubleheader at Sportsman's Park on September 17, 1941.[39] The Cardinals were in the midst of a pennant race with the Brooklyn Dodgers; in 12 games, Musial collected 20 hits for a .426 batting average.[40] Despite Musial's late contributions, the Cardinals finished two and one-half games behind the 100-game-winning Dodgers.[41]
Cardinals manager Billy Southworth used Musial as a left fielder to begin 1942, sometimes lifting him for a pinch-hitter against left-handed pitching.[42] Musial was hitting .315 by late June,[43] as the Cardinals resumed battling the Dodgers for first place in the National League (NL).[44] The Cardinals took sole possession of first place on September 13, and when Musial caught a fly ball to end the first game of a doubleheader on September 27 they clinched the pennant with their 105th win.[45] He finished the season with a .315 batting average and 72 runs batted in (RBI) in 140 games. Musial received national publicity when he was named by St. Louis Post-Dispatch sports editor J. Roy Stockton as his choice for Rookie of the Year in a Saturday Evening Post article.[46][47]
The Cardinals played the American League champion New York Yankees in the 1942 World Series.[48] Representing the winning run at home plate in the bottom of the ninth inning of Game 1 at Sportsman's Park, Musial grounded out with the bases loaded to end the game .[49] Musial's first hit of the Series was an RBI single that provided the margin of victory in Game 2, allowing the Cardinals to tie the Series.[50] Over the next three games at Yankee Stadium, Musial had three more hits as the Cardinals defeated the Yankees in the Series four games to one.[51] Musial batted .222 for the Series, with two runs scored.[52]
Musial's 1943 season started with a brief contract holdout in spring training.[53] He made the National League All-Star team for the first time as a starting left fielder and got a double in the All-Star Game on July 13.[53] He finished the season leading the major leagues in hitting with a .357 batting average and led the NL in hits (220), doubles (48), triples (20), total bases (347), on-base percentage (.425), and slugging percentage (.562).[54] This performance earned him his first NL Most Valuable Player Award, ahead of teammate and catcher Walker Cooper (.318 batting average).[54] After romping to another NL pennant by 18 games, the Cardinals again faced the Yankees in the 1943 World Series.[55] Musial had a single in the Cardinals' Game 1 loss, and scored a run in a Game 2 win.[55] The Cardinals did not win another game in the Series, but the loser's bonus share paid to each Cardinals player ($4,321.99) still amounted to nearly two-thirds of Musial's regular season salary.[56]
United States involvement in World War II began to impinge on Musial's baseball career in 1944, as he underwent a physical examination in prelude to possible service in the armed forces.[57] He ultimately remained with the Cardinals for the entire season, posting a .347 batting average with 197 hits.[58][59] The Cardinals claimed the NL pennant for the third consecutive season, and faced St. Louis's other major league team, the Browns, in the 1944 World Series.[60] The Browns took a 2–1 lead, while Musial hit .250 with zero RBI.[61] He broke out in Game 4 with a two-run home run, single, double, and a walk as part of a 5–1 Cardinals win.[61] The Cardinals went on to defeat the Browns in six games, and Musial posted a .304 batting average for the Series.[62][63]
Sojourn in the U.S. Navy (1945–46)[edit]
Musial enlisted in the United States Navy on January 23, 1945, during World War II. He was initially assigned to noncombat duty at the Naval Training Station in Bainbridge, Maryland.[64] In June 1945, he was assigned to Special Services in Hawaii, and was assigned to a ferry launch unit to bring back damaged ship crews entering Pearl Harbor where he was able to play baseball every afternoon in the naval base's eight-team league.[65] After being granted emergency leave to see his ailing father in January 1946, he was briefly assigned to the Philadelphia Navy Yard before his honorable discharge from the Navy as a Seaman Second Class in March 1946.[65][66]
In 2007, Musial received the Navy Memorial's Lone Sailor Award, which honors Navy veterans who have excelled in civilian life.

1946–49[edit]


"Every time Stan came up they chanted, 'Here comes the man!'"

—Cardinals traveling secretary Leo Ward relates Dodger fans' nickname for Musial to sportswriter Bob Broeg[67]
Rejoining the Cardinals under new manager Eddie Dyer, Musial posted a .388 batting average by the middle of May 1946.[68] He also became close friends with new teammate Red Schoendienst, who had joined the Cardinals during Musial's absence in 1945.[69] During the season, Musial (who was under contract to the Cardinals for $13,500 in 1946) was offered a five-year, $125,000 contract, plus a $50,000 bonus, to join the Mexican League.[70] He declined the offer, and after manager Dyer spoke to club owner Sam Breadon, Musial was given a $5,000 raise later in 1946.[71]
It was also during the 1946 season that Musial acquired his nickname of Stan the Man.[67] During the June 23 game against the Dodgers at Ebbets Field, St. Louis Post-Dispatch sportswriter Bob Broeg heard Dodger fans chanting whenever Musial came to bat, but could not understand the words.[67][72] Later that day over dinner, Broeg asked Cardinals traveling secretary Leo Ward if he had understood what the Dodger fans had been chanting.[67] Ward said, "Every time Stan came up they chanted, 'Here comes the man!'" "'That man,' you mean", Broeg said. "No, the man", replied Ward.[67] Broeg mentioned this story in his Post-Dispatch column, and Musial was thereafter known as Stan "The Man".[67]




Musial on the cover of Baseball Digest, September 1948


In June 1946, Dyer began to use Musial as a first baseman.[73] The Cardinals finished the season tied with the Dodgers,[74] prompting a three-game playoff for the pennant. Musial's Game 1 triple and Game 2 double contributed to the Cardinals' two-games-to-none series victory.[75] Facing the Boston Red Sox, the Cardinals won the 1946 World Series four games to three,[76] as Musial had six hits and four RBI.[77] He batted .365 for the season and won his second NL MVP Award, receiving 22 out of a possible 24 first-place votes, finishing ahead of Brooklyn's Dixie Walker (.319 batting average).[78]
Musial began the 1947 season by hitting .146 in April.[79] On May 9, team doctor Dr. Robert Hyland confirmed a previous diagnosis of appendicitis, while discovering that Musial was concurrently suffering from tonsillitis.[80] He received treatment, but did not have either his appendix or tonsils surgically removed until after the season ended.[81] Despite his health woes, he finished the year with a batting average of .312.[82]
Fully recovered from his ailments, Musial recorded his 1,000th career hit on April 25, 1948.[83] After a May 7 St. Louis Globe-Democrat article criticized baseball players for appearing in cigarette advertisements, he made a personal decision to never again appear in such ads.[84] By June 24, his batting average was .408, prompting Brooklyn pitcher Preacher Roe to comically announce his new method for retiring Musial: "Walk him on four pitches and pick him off first."[85] Given a mid-season pay raise by new Cardinals owner Robert E. Hannegan for his outstanding performance, Musial hit a home run in the All-Star Game.[86] On September 22, he registered five hits in a game for the fourth time in the season, tying a mark set by Ty Cobb in 1922.[87]


"He missed tying for the top in homers by one rained out home run. If it had counted, he would have won the Triple Crown that year...and in addition have been the only player of this century to lead the league in runs, hits, double, triples, and slugging percentage. What a year!"

—Sportswriter Bob Broeg, on Musial's 1948 season[88]
Musial finished the 1948 season leading the major leagues in batting average (.376), hits (230), doubles (46), triples (18), total bases (429), and slugging percentage (.702).[89] Winning the NL batting title by a 43-point margin, with an on-base percentage lead of 27 points and a 138-point slugging percentage margin—the latter being the largest gap since Rogers Hornsby's 1925 season—Musial became the first player to win three NL MVP awards.[89] If a home run he hit during a rained out game had been counted in his season totals, he would have won the Triple Crown by leading the NL in batting average, home runs, and runs batted in.[89][90]
Anticipating life after his baseball career, Musial began the first of several business partnerships with Julius "Biggie" Garagnani in January 1949, opening "Stan Musial & Biggie's" restaurant.[91][92] He approached the 1949 season with the intent to try to hit more home runs, stating he had hit 39 the previous season "without trying".[93] His new focus on hitting for power backfired, as pitchers began using the outside part of the plate to induce him to ground out to the first or second baseman.[93] Musial soon stopped focusing on hitting home runs and resumed his consistent offensive production by the end of May.[93] He received his sixth consecutive All-Star player selection and finished the season leading the NL in hits (207) while playing in every game.[94] However, the Cardinals, with 96 wins, finished one game behind the Dodgers.[95]
In the late 1940s, when baseball was slowly becoming integrated, Musial—along with his roommate Red Schoendienst—would be lauded by newcomers such as Dodgers' pitcher Don Newcombe for their tolerance. "They never...had the need to sit in the dugout and call a black guy a bunch of names", Newcombe said, "because he was trying to change the game and make it what it should have been in the first place, a game for all people."[96]
1950–54[edit]
Musial began the 1950s by posting a .350 batting average before participating in the 1950 All-Star Game, where in fan balloting he was the NL's number two choice.[97] He had the longest hitting streak of his career during the 1950 season—a 30-game stretch that ended on July 27.[97] With the Cardinals falling 14 games out of first place by September, manager Dyer used him at first base and all three outfield positions.[97][98] New Cardinals manager Marty Marion led the team to a third-place finish in 1951, while Musial was named The Sporting News Major League Player of the Year.[99]


"No man has ever been a perfect ballplayer. Stan Musial, however, is the closest to being perfect in the game today.... He plays as hard when his club is away out in front of a game as he does when they're just a run or two behind."

—Ty Cobb, on Musial in a 1952 Life magazine article[100]
National media attention inadvertently turned to Musial a month before the 1952 season began, after Ty Cobb wrote an article regarding modern baseball players that was published in Life magazine.[100] Cobb singled out Musial and Phil Rizzuto as the only players "who can be mentioned in the same breath with the oldtime greats".[100] Cobb went on to refer to Musial as "a better player than Joe DiMaggio was in his prime."[100] In response, Musial displayed his characteristic modesty, saying, "Cobb is baseball's greatest. I don't want to contradict him, but I can't say that I was ever as good as Joe DiMaggio."[100]
The only major league pitching appearance of Musial's career occurred as a publicity stunt during the last Cardinals home game of the 1952 season.[101][102] Manager Eddie Stanky had a reluctant Musial pitch to Frank Baumholtz, the runner-up to Musial for the best batting average in the NL that season.[101] With Baumholtz batting right-handed for the first time in his career, Musial's first pitch was hit so hard it ricocheted off the shin of third baseman Solly Hemus and into the left field corner.[101] The play was ruled an error, and Musial was embarrassed enough by his complicity in the gimmick to avoid pitching again for the remainder of his career.[101]
The Cardinals franchise was up for sale in early 1953, and Musial and Schoendienst advised their friend and fellow duck-hunter Gussie Busch to consider buying the team.[103] Busch used the resources of the Anheuser-Busch company to purchase the Cardinals, keeping Musial in St. Louis by averting the possibility of a move by the team to another city.[103][104] The 1953 season marked Musial's 10th NL All-Star selection, and the 12th consecutive time he finished a major league season with a batting average above .300.[46][105]
Musial accomplished another historical feat on May 2, 1954, in a doubleheader in St. Louis against the New York Giants: he hit three home runs in the first contest, then added two more in the second to become the first major leaguer to hit five home runs in a doubleheader.[106] In addition to his five home runs, he also hit a single in the first game, setting a new record of 21 total bases for a doubleheader.[106] The only player besides Musial to hit five home runs in a doubleheader is Nate Colbert, who achieved the feat in 1972.[107]
1955–59[edit]
Musial made his 12th NL All-Star appearance in 1955 as a reserve player, when Cincinnati's Ted Kluszewski outpolled him by 150,000 votes to get on the starting lineup at first base.[108] Musial entered the game as a pinch hitter in the fourth inning, and played left field as the game entered extra innings.[109] Leading off the bottom of the 12th, he hit a home run to give the NL a 6–5 victory.[109]




Musial in 1957


The 1956 season marked another milestone for Musial, when he broke Mel Ott's NL record for extra-base hits on August 12.[110] Earlier that season, Cardinals general manager "Trader Frank" Lane began negotiations to trade him for Philadelphia pitcher Robin Roberts.[111] When Cardinals owner Gussie Busch learned of the possible move, he made it clear that Musial was not available for any trade.[112] Instead, Lane dealt Musial's close friend Schoendienst to the New York Giants; an upset Musial made no immediate comment to the press.[113]
On June 11, 1957, Musial tied the NL record for consecutive games played with his 822nd, a streak that began on the last day of the 1951 season.[114] Despite ballot stuffing by Cincinnati Reds fans, he was selected and played in the All-Star Game held at Sportsman's Park.[115] When he overextended his swing while batting during a game on August 23, Musial fractured a bone in his left shoulder socket and tore muscles over his collarbone.[116] He was unable to play again until September 8, ending his consecutive games-played streak at 895.[116] He finished 1957 as Sports Illustrated's "Sportsman of the Year".[117]


"Line drive! Into left field! Hit number three thousand! A run has scored! Musial around first, on his way to second with a double. Holy Cow! He came through!"

—Harry Caray's radio play-by-play call of Musial's 3,000th major league hit[118]
Musial signed one of the first $100,000 contracts in NL history on January 29, 1958. (According to Baseball Almanac, Hank Greenberg was the first with Pittsburgh in 1947.)[119] He quickly demonstrated a return on the investment by sharing with Willie Mays the inaugural (and for the only time in Musial's career) NL Player of the Month in May (no such award was given in April until 1969) batting .374, with 4 HR, and 16 RBI. Also that month, as he was approaching the 3,000-hit milestone in his major league career, he expressed a desire to record the hit in St. Louis.[120] He ultimately reached the mark with a pinch-hit, sixth inning RBI double at Chicago's Wrigley Field on May 13.[121][122] The eighth major league player to reach 3,000 hits, and the first to reach the milestone with an extra-base hit, Musial was greeted at St. Louis Union Station that evening by roughly 1,000 fans.[123] Finishing the season in sixth place, the Cardinals embarked on an exhibition tour of Japan, winning 14 of 16 games against top players from the Central and Pacific Japanese Leagues.[124]
Taking a new approach to preparation for the 1959 season, Musial was given permission to report late to spring training so that he might conserve his energy for the duration of the year.[125] Musial, at 6 feet (180 cm) tall, had maintained a weight of around 175 pounds (79 kg) throughout his career. He reported to spring training approximately 10 pounds (4.5 kg) overweight and in substandard physical condition.[126][127] He began the season with one hit in 15 at-bats.[127] Despite his early offensive struggles, he single-handedly spoiled potential no-hitters on April 16 and 19.[127] A game-winning home run on May 7 made him the first major league player ever with 400 home runs and 3,000 hits.[127] As he continued to hit at a relatively low pace, his playing time was limited by Cardinals manager Solly Hemus at various points during the season.[128] Seeking more revenue for the players' pension fund, Major League Baseball held two All-Star games in a season for the first time through 1962.[129] Musial made his 16th All-Star appearance (16th season)[3] and pinch-hit in both contests, flying out in the July 7 game and drawing a walk in the August 3 game.[129] He finished the season with 115 regular game appearances, a .255 batting average, 37 runs, and a slugging percentage of .428.[46]
During the 1959 season, John F. Kennedy approached Musial about supporting Kennedy's campaign for President, citing their close ages. Musial campaigned for Kennedy later that year and became a supporter of the Democrat.[130]
On June 30, 1959, Musial was the batter in one of the oddest plays in baseball history. In a game between the Cardinals and Chicago Cubs, he was at the plate with a count of 3–1. Bob Anderson's next pitch was errant, evading catcher Sammy Taylor and rolling all the way to the backstop. Umpire Vic Delmore called ball four, even as Anderson and Taylor contended that Musial had foul tipped the ball. Because the ball was still in play and Delmore was embroiled in an argument with the catcher and pitcher, Musial kept running in attempt to make second base. Seeing that Musial was trying for second, Alvin Dark ran to the backstop to retrieve the ball. The ball wound up in the hands of field announcer Pat Pieper, but Dark ended up getting it back anyway. Absentmindedly, however, Delmore pulled out a new ball and gave it to Taylor. Anderson finally noticed that Musial was trying for second, took the new ball, and threw it to second baseman Tony Taylor. Anderson's throw flew over Taylor's head into the outfield. Dark, at the same time that Anderson threw the new ball, threw the original ball to shortstop Ernie Banks. Musial did not see Dark's throw and only noticed Anderson's ball fly over the second baseman's head, so he tried to go to third base. On his way there, he was tagged by Banks, and after a delay he was ruled out.[131]
1960–63[edit]
Based on his 1959 performance, Musial accepted a pay cut in 1960 from his previous $100,000 salary to $80,000.[132] He was eager to prove that his mediocre performance was the result of improper physical conditioning, and he enlisted the help of Walter Eberhardt, Saint Louis University's director of physical education.[133] In June 1960, newspaper articles began speculating that Musial would soon retire, yet he finished the season with a .275 batting average.[46][134] He addressed the speculation in September, confirming that he would play again in 1961. His .288 batting average that season reaffirmed his decision.[46][135] In 1962, Musial posted a .330 batting average, good for third in the batting race, with 19 homers and 82 RBI. As a pinch-hitter, he had 14 base hits in 19 at-bats (.737).[136] Along the way, he established new NL career marks for hits, RBI, and runs scored. That same year on July 8, the 41-year-old Musial became the oldest player ever to hit three home runs in one game.





Stan Musial's number 6 was retired by the St. Louis Cardinals in 1963.


The Cardinals began 1963 by winning 10 of their first 15 games, as Musial posted a .237 batting average.[137] He set a new major league record for career extra-base hits on May 8 and improved his batting average to .277 by the end of the month.[138] Making his 20th All-Star appearance[3] and 24th All-Star Game appearance on July 9, 1963, he pinch-hit in the fifth inning.[138] Asked by general manager Bing Devine on July 26 what his plans were, Musial said that he would retire at season's end.[139] He waited until the Cardinals team picnic on August 12 to publicly announce his decision, hopeful he could retire on a winning note.[140]
Musial became a grandfather for the first time in the early hours of September 10; later that day, he hit a home run in his first at-bat.[141] After sweeping a doubleheader on September 15, the Cardinals had won 19 of their last 20 games, and were one game behind the Los Angeles Dodgers.[141] The Dodgers then swept the Cardinals in a three-game series in St. Louis and clinched the NL pennant on September 25.[142] Musial's last game, on September 29, 1963, was preceded by an hour-long retirement ceremony.[143] Speakers at the event included baseball commissioner Ford Frick, Cardinals broadcaster Harry Caray, and Cardinals owner Gussie Busch, who announced that Musial's uniform number "6" would be retired by the team.[143] During the game, Musial recorded a single in the fourth inning, then hit a single to right field that scored teammate Curt Flood in the sixth.[144] Cardinals manager Johnny Keane brought in Gary Kolb as a pinch-runner for Musial, bringing his major league career to an end.[144] Just as he had recorded two base hits in his major league debut, Musial finished his last game with two hits, as well.[144] Musial finished with the all-time National League hits record and second to only Ty Cobb on the all-time Major League list. Musial's last career hit was out of reach of Cincinnati Reds second baseman Pete Rose, who would go on to break Cobb's record to become baseball's all-time hit king.


"All Musial represents is more than two decades of sustained excellence and complete decency as a human being."

—Broadcaster Bob Costas, on Musial[35]
At the time of his retirement, Musial held or shared 17 major league records, 29 NL records, and nine All-Star Game records.[145] Among those records, he ranked as the major league career leader in extra-base hits (1,377) and total bases (6,134).[144] He also held NL career marks in categories such as hits (3,630), games played (3,026), doubles (725), and RBI (1,951).[144] He finished his career with 475 home runs despite never having led the NL in the category.[144] Jerry Lansche speculates Musial would likely have become the second player, after Babe Ruth, with 2,000 RBI, and would have exceeded 500 career home runs had he not served in the military.[146] His lowest full season RBI output before the war was 72 (in 1942) and as he needed only 49 RBI to reach 2,000 for his full career, he certainly would have exceeded 2,000 RBI by playing without injury in 1945. His home run production is a different story and it is highly unlikely he would have reached 500. He did not hit more than 13 home runs in any season before he entered the navy and did not hit as many as 25 (the number he would have needed to become a 500 career homer club member) until 1948, 3 years after returning to baseball from World War II. His career hit total was evenly split between 1,815 hits at home and 1,815 hits on the road.[36] Steven R. Bullock speculates that it is possible that without military service Musial might have continued playing to attempt to exceed Ty Cobb's career hit record of 4,191.[146] Even if Musial had hit safely 207 times (the average of his hits in the 2 years before and the 2 years after his service in the navy) in 1945, he still would have been 354 hits short of tying Ty. His hit total in his last season at age 42 was only 86; even if he could have had 103 hits a season (the average of his last 5 seasons) he would have had to play to age 47 to attain the hits record.
He was the first major league player to appear in more than 1,000 games at two different positions, registering 1,896 games in the outfield and 1,016 at first base.[147] Since Musial's retirement in 1963, Tony Gwynn has been the only player to finish his career with a higher lifetime batting average. Hank Aaron has been the only player to surpass his record of 6,134 total bases.
In Musial's 3,026 major league appearances, he was never ejected from a game.[148] Speaking about his quiet reputation within the sport's history, sportscaster Bob Costas said, "He didn't hit a homer in his last at-bat; he hit a single. He didn't hit in 56 straight games. He married his high school sweetheart and stayed married to her. ... All Musial represents is more than two decades of sustained excellence and complete decency as a human being."[35]
Post-playing career and family life[edit]
Musial was named a vice president of the St. Louis Cardinals in September 1963, and he remained in that position until after the 1966 season.[149] From February 1964 to January 1967, he also served as President Lyndon Johnson's physical fitness adviser, a part-time position created to promote better fitness among American citizens.[150] Before the 1967 season began, the Cardinals named Musial the team's general manager, and he oversaw the club's World Series championship that year.[149] He won the allegiance of Cardinals players by making fair offers from the outset of player-contract negotiations and creating an in-stadium babysitting service so players' wives could attend games.[151] His longtime business partner Biggie Garagnani died in June 1967, prompting Musial to devote more time to managing his restaurant and other business interests.[152] He came to realize that the detail-oriented desk job was not his forte. He consequently decided to step down as general manager, before even completing a full year on the job.[152]
Musial—like Phil Linz—was noted for his harmonica playing, which included his rendition of "Take Me Out to the Ball Game".[153] Through the 1990s, he frequently played the harmonica at public gatherings, such as the annual Baseball Hall of Fame induction ceremony and various charity events.[154] He performed on the television show Hee Haw and in 1994 recorded 18 songs that were sold in tandem with a harmonica-playing instruction booklet.[154]
Even though Musial left Donora after high school, he retained close ties to the town throughout the rest of his life. He maintained membership in local social clubs, and regularly sent a local doctor boxes of autographed baseballs, with the town's mayor using some for United Way fundraising.[155] Musial also gave free meals at the restaurant he owned in St. Louis to any customers who presented valid ID proving they were Donora residents.[156]
Musial met Lillian Susan Labash, the daughter of a local grocer,[155] in Donora when both were 15, and married her in St. Paul's Catholic Church in Daytona Beach, Florida on May 25, 1940. They had four children: son Richard, and daughters Gerry, Janet, and Jeanie.[148][157] Lillian Musial died at 91, on May 3, 2012; their marriage had lasted for almost 72 years.[158] In his final years, Musial suffered from Alzheimer's disease.
Honors and recognition[edit]


"Here stands baseball's perfect warrior. Here stands baseball's perfect knight."

—Quote inscribed on the base of Musial's statue, attributed to former commissioner Ford Frick[159]
On August 4, 1968, a statue of Musial was erected outside of Busch Memorial Stadium on the northeast grounds of the St. Louis stadium.[152] The statue was moved from its original location to the west side of the new Busch Stadium for its first season in 2006, where it became a popular meeting place for generations of Cardinals fans.[160] Musial's statue is inscribed with a quote attributed to former baseball commissioner Ford Frick: "Here stands baseball's perfect warrior. Here stands baseball's perfect knight."[152]
Musial was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility in 1969, when he was named on 93.2 percent of the ballots.[161] On June 14, 1973 he was the first inductee into the National Polish-American Hall of Fame, housed at St. Mary's College in Orchard Lake, Michigan. In 1989, he was inducted into the St. Louis Walk of Fame.[162] Five years later, a baseball field was named after him in his hometown of Donora.[163] He was ranked tenth on The Sporting News' list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players published in 1998.[164] He was also one of the 30 players selected to the Major League Baseball All-Century Team, added by a special committee after he finished 11th in fan voting among outfielders.[165] In 2000, he was inducted into the Hall of Famous Missourians, and a bronze bust depicting him is on permanent display in the rotunda of the Missouri State Capitol.[166] In January, 2014, the Cardinals announced Musial among 22 former players and personnel to be inducted into the St. Louis Cardinals Hall of Fame Museum for the inaugural class of 2014.[167]

Nearly two decades after Musial retired, baseball statistician Bill James and the sabermetrics movement began providing new ways of comparing players across baseball history.[168] In 2001, James ranked Musial the tenth-greatest baseball player in history, and the second-best left fielder of all time.[169] According to Baseball-Reference.com, he ranks fifth all-time among hitters on the Black Ink Test, and third all-time on the Gray Ink Test—measures designed to compare players of different eras.[46][170] He ranks first on Baseball-Reference's Hall of Fame Monitor Test, and is tied for second in the Hall of Fame Career Standards Test.[46] Despite his statistical accomplishments, he is sometimes referred to as the most underrated or overlooked athlete in modern American sports history.[171][172] For instance, in his analysis of baseball's under- and overrated players in 2007, sportswriter Jayson Stark said, "I can't think of any all-time great in any sport who gets left out of more who's-the-greatest conversations than Stan Musial."[171]
Musial threw out the first pitch in the fifth game of the 2006 World Series and delivered the ceremonial first pitch ball to President Barack Obama at the 2009 Major League Baseball All-Star Game.[173] A "Stan the Man" day was held in his honor by the Cardinals on May 18, 2008.[174] In 2010, another one of the Cardinals' greatest sluggers, Albert Pujols, whose nickname was "El Hombre", said he didn't want to be called "The Man", even in Spanish, because "There is one man that gets that respect, and that is Stan Musial." [96] Also in 2010, the Cardinals launched a campaign to build support for awarding Musial the Presidential Medal of Freedom for his lifetime of achievement and service.[175] The campaign realized its goal, and on February 15, 2011, Musial was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Barack Obama[176][177] who called him "an icon untarnished, a beloved pillar of the community, a gentleman you'd want your kids to emulate."[178]
On October 17, 2012, Musial made his final appearance at Busch Stadium, riding in a golf cart around the warning track before Game 4 of the National League Championship Series. Musial stopped at both dugouts and greeted San Francisco Giants manager Bruce Bochy and Cardinals manager Mike Matheny. The Cardinals would go on to win Game 4 by a score of 8-3, but lost the pennant to the eventual World Series champion Giants.

Death[edit]
On January 19, 2013, Musial died at age 92 of natural causes at his home in Ladue, Missouri, on the same day that fellow MLB Hall of Fame inductee Earl Weaver passed away.[181][182] Musial was surrounded by his family as he died peacefully. Cardinals owner Bill DeWitt, Jr. released the following statement:

We have lost the most beloved member of the Cardinals family. Stan Musial was the greatest player in Cardinals history and one of the best players in the history of baseball. The entire Cardinals organization extends its sincere condolences to Stan's family, including his children Richard, Gerry, Janet and Jean, as well as his eleven grandchildren and twelve great grandchildren. We join fans everywhere in mourning the loss of our dear friend and reflect on how fortunate we all are to have known 'Stan the Man'.[183]

Upon hearing the news of his death, fans gathered and began an impromptu memorial at his statue outside Busch Stadium; the Cardinals issued a release saying the memorial would be left in place for some time.[184] In a laudatory obituary, The New York Times quoted famed New York manager Leo Durocher: "There is only one way to pitch to Musial—under the plate."[185]
Missouri Governor Jay Nixon commented: "Stan Musial was a great American hero who—with the utmost humility—inspired us all to aim high and dream big. The world is emptier today without him, but far better to have known him. The legacy of 'baseball's perfect warrior' will endure and inspire generations to come."[186]
St. Louis Mayor Francis Slay tweeted: "Sad as we are, we are fortunate to have had Stan in STL for so long, and are also glad that Stan and Lil are together again." He ordered flags at half-mast in the city.[187]
"Major League Baseball has lost one of its true legends in Stan Musial, a Hall of Famer in every sense and a man who led a great American life", Commissioner Bud Selig said. "He was the heart and soul of the historic St. Louis Cardinals franchise for generations, and he served his country during World War II. A recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2011, Stan's life embodies baseball's unparalleled history and why this game is the national pastime."[188]
Thousands of fans braved cold temperatures on January 24 for a public visitation at the Cathedral Basilica of Saint Louis, where Musial lay in state, dressed in his trademark cardinal-red blazer and with a harmonica in his lapel pocket, flanked by a Navy honor guard. A private funeral Mass was held on Saturday, January 26, 2013, at the New Cathedral in St. Louis, televised locally by KTVI and KPLR as well as Fox Sports Midwest on pay-television. New York's Cardinal Timothy Dolan, who in his first episcopal post served as an auxiliary bishop of the Archdiocese of Saint Louis, was the principal celebrant, and Knoxville's Bishop Richard F. Stika, Musial's former parish priest, was the homilist.[189] Bob Costas gave the principal eulogy, calling him "the genuine hero who as the years and decades passed, and disillusionment came from other directions, never once let us down", and quoting fellow Cooperstown honoree Mickey Mantle, who once said that Musial "was a better player than me because he was a better man than me".[190] Following the funeral, Musial's family led a procession from the New Cathedral to Busch Stadium, where they laid a memorial wreath at his statue. Once the wreath was placed and Musial's family began to walk back to their vehicles, the hundreds of Cardinal fans gathered for the wreath ceremony gave both Musial and his family one final salute. That salute was the fans singing "Take Me Out to the Ball Game" before Musial was taken to his final place of rest.
Musial was the last living member of the Cardinals team that won the 1942 World Series. At the time of his death, no living players had played on an earlier World Series-winning team.
The Stan Musial Veterans Memorial Bridge in St. Louis (carries  I‑70) was built in his memorial.
Legacy[edit]
As a reflection of his popularity, Musial has had infrastructure named after him. In May 2011 the Pennsylvania State Senate changed the name of the bridge that carries the C. Vance Deicas Memorial Highway (S.R. 1077) over the Monongahela River from Donora-Monessen Bridge to Stan Musial Bridge after Musial who was a native of the area.[191] In October 2013 the St. Louis Fire Department started operating a fireboat named after Musial.[192] In July 2013, the new Interstate 70 bridge over the Mississippi River between Illinois and Missouri at St. Louis received the official name of "Stan Musial Veterans Memorial Bridge"[193]

Personal Quotes (7)

      The first principle of contract negotiations is don't remind them of what you did in the past - tell them what you're going to do in the future.


      There was never a day when I was as good as Joe DiMaggio at his best. Joe was the best, the very best I ever saw.


      I consciously memorized the speed at which every pitcher in the league threw his fastball, curve, and slider; then, I'd pick up the speed of the ball in the first thirty feet of its flight and knew how it would move once it had crossed the plate.


      Somehow it doesn't seem to be making me as nervous as when I was getting close to 3,000 hits. - on approaching Honus Wagner's 44-year-old league record for career hits in 1962


      When a pitcher's throwing a spitball, don't worry and don't complain, just hit the dry side like I do.


      The key to hitting for high average is to relax, concentrate, and don't hit the fly ball to center field.


      [explaining his unfailingly cheerful manner] If you had a .331 lifetime batting average, you'd be happy all the time too.

Hitting is like swimming. Once you learn the stroke, you never forget it.
Stan Musial


Swimming,
Learn,
You



















I think I had the smallest handle around. When I got my bats, I even trimmed them down. I used to scrape them. Some years later when I started getting older, I used to start with a 33 and in the summer it got down to 31 and then probably in September got down to 30.
Stan Musial


Summer,
Getting Older,
Start
























I consciously memorized the speed at which every pitcher in the league threw his fastball, curve, and slider. Then, I'd pick up the speed of the ball in the first 30 feet of its flight and knew how it would move once it has crossed the plate.
Stan Musial


Feet,
Speed,
Flight



















I could always hit. I learned to hit with a broomstick and a ball of tape and I could always get that bat on the ball.
Stan Musial


Always,
Bat,
Learned



















When a pitcher's throwing a spitball, don't worry and don't complain, just hit the dry side like I do.
Stan Musial


Worry,
Complain,
Dry



















Back in my day, we didn't think about money as much. We enjoyed playing the game. We loved baseball. I didn't think about anybody else but the Cardinals.
Stan Musial


Money,
Baseball,
Day



















I have no hesitation to say that St. Louis is a great place in which to live and work.
Stan Musial


Work,
Great,
Live



















It seemed like I always did some great hitting in Brooklyn. The field there was close to the stands. Every time I started walking to the plate, I could hear the fans say, 'Here comes that man again. Here comes that man.'
Stan Musial


Time,
Great,
Man



















I'm a musician. I play harmonica for relaxation. A good way to relax and entertain people. An excellent way to have fun.
Stan Musial


Good,
Relax,
Fun
























A lot of hitters stay away from the plate, some are close up, some are forward, some are back. The thing about hitting is this: You have to know the strike zone. That's the most important thing. Hit strikes and put the bat on the ball.
Stan Musial


Know,
Important,
You



















When we played the Dodgers in St. Louis, they had to come through our dugout, and our bat rack was right there where they had to walk. My bats kept disappearing, and I couldn't figure it out. Turns out, Pee Wee Reese was stealing my bats. I found that out later, after we got out of baseball. He and Rube Walker stole my bats.
Stan Musial


Baseball,
Walk,
Stealing



















Used to be bats had thick handles and a big barrel. Then they found it's not the size of the bat that gets home runs - it's the speed with which you can swing it.
Stan Musial


Home,
Speed,
You



















I came up in 1941 and I played against men who played in the 1930s. I stayed until 1963 playing against men who will be playing in the 1970s. So I think I can feel qualified to say that baseball really was a great game, and baseball is really a great game, and baseball will always be a great game.
Stan Musial


Great,
Baseball,
Men



















The first principle of contract negotiations is don't remind them of what you did in the past - tell them what you're going to do in the future.
Stan Musial


Future,
Past,
You



















Get eight hours of sleep regularly. Keep your weight down, run a mile a day.
Stan Musial


Sleep,
Day,
Down
























Always wanted to be a Major League player. Loved baseball. Followed it. Loved to play. Plus, I could always hit.
Stan Musial


Baseball,
Play,
Loved



















What I try to do is never to hurt anybody else and figure if I don't, then I'm not likely to get hurt myself.
Stan Musial


Myself,
Hurt,
Try



















I'm proud to be a Cardinal.
Stan Musial


Proud,
Cardinal



















There was never a day when I was as good as Joe DiMaggio at his best. Joe was the best, the very best I ever saw.
Stan Musial


Best,
Good,
Day

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
