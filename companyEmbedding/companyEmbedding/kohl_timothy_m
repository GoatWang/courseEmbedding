 Career History



President

                                    2007 - Current                


Marten Transport Ltd.


                  Marten Transport Ltd. engages in the provision of providing temperature-sensitive truckload carrier services.  It operates through the following segments: Truckload, Dedicated, Intermodal, and Brokerage. The Truckload segment includes transport of food and consumer packaged goods that require a temperature-controlled or insulated environment. The Dedicated segment provides transportation solutions to individual customers using temperature-controlled trailers, dry vans, and specialized equipment. The Intermodal segment offers transports its customer's freight utilizing temperature-controlled trailers and dry containers on railroad flatcars for portions of trips. The Brokerage segment involves in arranging smaller third-party carriers to transport freight for its customers in temperature-controlled trailers and dry vans. The company was founded by Roger R. Marten in 1946 and is headquartered in Mondovi, WI.                




President

                                    1996 - 2007                


Knight Transportation, Inc.


                  Knight Transportation is a provider of multiple truckload transportation services, which involve the movement of full trailer or container loads of freight from origin to destination for a single customer. We use our nationwide network of service centers, one of the country’s largest company-owned tractor fleets, as well as access to the fleets of thousands of third-party equipment providers, to provide truckload capacity and a broad range of solutions to truckload shippers. Our services include dry van truckload, temperature-controlled truckload, and dedicated truckload services, drayage services between ocean ports or rail ramps and shipping docks, rail intermodal services, and truckload freight brokerage services. As a result of the expanse of our network we are able to transport, or arrange for the transportation of, general commodities for customers throughout the United States and parts of Canada and Mexico.

Our objective is to operate truckload businesses that are industry leading in both margin and growth, while providing cost-effective solutions for our customers.

To achieve these goals, we operate primarily in high-density, predictable freight lanes in select geographic regions, and attempt to develop and expand our customer base around each of our service centers by providing multiple truckload services for each customer. This operating strategy allows us to take advantage of the large amount of freight transported in regional markets. Our decentralized service centers enable us to better serve our customers and work more closely with our driving associates. We operate a modern fleet to appeal to Driving Associates and customers, decrease maintenance expenses and downtime, and enhance our operating efficiencies.

Your access to this site has been limited
Your access to this service has been temporarily limited. Please try again in a few minutes. (HTTP response code 503)
Reason: Exceeded the maximum global requests per minute for crawlers or humans.
Important note for site admins: If you are the administrator of this website note that your access has been limited because you broke one of the Wordfence blocking rules.
The reason your access was limited is: "Exceeded the maximum global requests per minute for crawlers or humans.".

If this is a false positive, meaning that your access to your own site has been limited incorrectly, then you
will need to regain access to your site, go to the Wordfence "options" page, go to the section for Rate Limiting Rules and disable the rule that caused you to be blocked. For example,
if you were blocked because it was detected that you are a fake Google crawler, then disable the rule that blocks fake google crawlers. Or if you were blocked because you 
were accessing your site too quickly, then increase the number of accesses allowed per minute.

If you're still having trouble, then simply disable the Wordfence advanced blocking and you will 
still benefit from the other security features that Wordfence provides.


If you are a site administrator and have been accidentally locked out, please enter your email in the box below and click "Send". If the email address you enter belongs to a known site administrator or someone set to receive Wordfence alerts, we will send you an email to help you regain access. Please read this FAQ entry if this does not work.
