FUND EXECUTIVE ACCEPTS LIFE BAN IN TRADING CASE

Richard S. Strong, who helped fuel the extraordinary growth of mutual funds over the last three decades, agreed yesterday to pay $60 million and be banned from the financial industry for life to settle an investigation over rapid trades he made at the expense of investors in his funds.Mr. Strong, the founder of Strong Capital Management, is the most prominent figure to be ensnared in a sweeping investigation of improper trading in mutual funds begun last September by Eliot Spitzer, the New York attorney general. Mr. Spitzer and other regulators have sued some of the largest money managers, forcing several to pay steep penalties and also reduce the fees charged to investors.Strong Capital, based in Menomonee Falls, Wis., agreed to pay $80 million and cut management fees for its mutual funds by 6 percent over the next five years.Mr. Spitzer has long maintained that Mr. Strong's behavior stood out because he personally profited from the trading and also because, as chief executive, he should have known better.

''The magnitude of his breach of duty is greater than what we have seen in other cases,'' Mr. Spitzer said yesterday. ''When you're the C.E.O., your duty could not be more clear.'' Continue reading the main story

The amount Mr. Strong is paying is the largest penalty by an individual since the mutual fund investigation began. The sum is large measured against other recent corporate misconduct, like the amounts demanded by regulators in cases against the Wall Street analysts Jack B. Grubman and Henry Blodget. Of course, criminal cases involving Wall Street figures have resulted in much larger fines. Still, Mr. Spitzer noted that Mr. Strong's penalty is significant in proportion to his trading profits.The punishments of Mr. Strong, 62, and his company are part of settlements negotiated jointly with Mr. Spitzer, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Wisconsin attorney general and the Wisconsin Department of Financial Institutions. The amounts to be paid by the company and Mr. Strong will go to investors harmed by the improper trading.''Strong Capital Management and its founder, Richard Strong, betrayed the mutual fund investors they were duty-bound to protect,'' Stephen M. Cutler, director of enforcement at the S.E.C., said in a statement yesterday.Mr. Strong wrote a statement of contrition that was released by Mr. Spitzer's office yesterday.''Throughout my career, I have considered it to be my sacred duty to protect my investors; and yet in a particular and persistent way I let them down,'' Mr. Strong wrote. ''I frequently traded the shares of the Strong funds, at the same time that the advice which we gave our investors was to do the opposite and to hold their shares for the long term.''The settlement is a humbling of a pioneer in the mutual fund business. Mr. Strong rose to prominence from modest roots in North Dakota. Described by colleagues as having an abrasive and tenacious personality, he built Strong over three decades into an industry giant through aggressive marketing and recruitment of investment talent.Today, the company manages $33.8 billion in assets in mutual funds and investments for institutions including pension funds.Forbes magazine has estimated Mr. Strong's personal wealth at $800 million. But it was a relatively small gain that resulted in his downfall.

He made $1.8 million in profit on hundreds of short-term trades in Strong Capital mutual funds, even as the company's public filings indicated that it discouraged such activity, Mr. Spitzer's office said yesterday.The company also permitted a hedge fund, Canary Capital Partners, to trade rapidly in and out of Strong's funds, regulators said. The trades by Canary and its manager, Edward Stern, were first disclosed by Mr. Spitzer in a $40 million settlement with the fund and Mr. Stern last September.Mr. Spitzer had weighed bringing criminal charges against Mr. Strong for the trading, and had convened a grand jury to consider the case. Mr. Strong, who avoided criminal charges, agreed to pay $60 million in penalties and disgorgement of profits.Mr. Strong will be banned from associating with any investment or brokerage firm, regulators said. The settlement does not preclude his receiving any profits from the sale of Strong Capital, where he controls an 85 percent stake, Mr. Spitzer said. Mr. Strong resigned in December as company chairman.

Mr. Strong announced in December that he was looking for a buyer for his stake in Strong Capital, and Wells Fargo, the big San Francisco-based bank, is the leading candidate to acquire the company, people briefed on the talks have said. Wells was waiting for the regulators' investigation to be resolved before it would consider an agreement to buy the company, these people said.A spokesman for the bank declined to comment yesterday.A sale would come after Mr. Strong hurt the business he worked so long to develop. Assets at the company declined to $33.8 billion under management at the end of April from $43 billion at the end of September, weeks before Mr. Strong's trading became public.Mr. Strong will probably get much less for his interest in the company than he sought when he put it up for sale. Mr. Strong had hoped for close to $1 billion, people briefed on the sale negotiations said; now he is likely to get half that amount.One fund industry analyst said he was surprised that Mr. Spitzer had not pursued a criminal case against Mr. Strong.''Mr. Spitzer had been holding up Strong as a poster child for going to jail,'' said Roy Weitz, who runs a Web site called FundAlarm.com. ''There's some suggestion that the steam is running out of this investigation,'' with regulators eager to settle and move on, he said.

Mr. Spitzer acknowledged that some critics would say that he should have brought charges against Mr. Strong. But he said that he did not bring a criminal case against Mr. Strong because market timing was not clearly illegal.In the fund investigation to date, Mr. Spitzer said, ''the criminal cases we've made all relate to late trading,'' he said, which refers to trades made after the market has closed but at an earlier price. Such trading is clearly illegal, he said, but the legality of market timing is more ambiguous.Mr. Spitzer said he had insisted on a statement of contrition by Mr. Strong, rather than a refusal to admit or deny charges, a feature of prior settlements. That statement could figure in future securities litigation against Mr. Strong, Mr. Weitz said.Mr. Strong's lawyer, Stanley S. Arkin, made clear that Mr. Strong was aware of the impact of his behavior on the company he founded.''In reaching this civil settlement, Dick had very much in mind that he wished to preserve the jobs and the futures of the many loyal and talented people at Strong Capital, and at the same time enable the funds to continue for the future benefit of all of their shareholders,'' Mr. Arkin said. Mr. Strong was not available for comment, Mr. Arkin said.Kenneth J. Wessels, who was named chairman and chief executive of Strong last December, said yesterday, ''These settlement agreements allow us to move forward and concentrate all of our energies on meeting the needs of our clients.''Two other employees of the company were named in yesterday's settlement. Thomas A. Hooker Jr., who had been director of compliance at Strong Capital, and Anthony J. D'Amato, an executive vice president, have also agreed to a ban from the industry.Mr. D'Amato will pay $750,000 in penalties and disgorgement; Mr. Hooker will pay a $50,000 civil penalty.A spokeswoman for Strong Capital said the two men were no longer at the company.''The case reflects the increased attention compliance officers are receiving in a new era of enforcement of the securities laws,'' said Richard Morvillo, a lawyer for Mr. Hooker.

			Margaret Richard (Instructor Profile)
SKU: 1314
        
        Region: 1


Product Description: Build strong muscles and bones with two 30-minute workouts patterned after the Body Electric TV program. Join Margaret for graceful stretching in a tranquil Gulf of Mexico setting. The “Stretch-Out-Strap” is not included with the 30-minute stretching program. (1997)

Strong & Limber for Life combines strengthening and stretching programs for increased:

Bone density
Muscle tone, definition and strength
Flexibility

Strong for Life
Two 30-minute programs are patterned after the Body Electric television show. Each workout features a warm up, and exercises for the upper and lower body, followed by a relaxing cool down. Rotate both programs to work all major muscle groups.
The Strong for Life program is a sentimental favorite as it was the last Body Electric program to be produced in Tallahassee, FL, prior to Margaret’s move to Western New York.
Limber for Life
Stretching just five minutes each day helps maintain:

Muscle length
Full range of motion in joints
Long-term injury prevention

Increase your flexibility regardless of your age or fitness level. The Stretch-Out-Strap acts as your “partner” for safe and effective head-to-toe stretching. The program’s tranquil setting is the Seaside Resort on Florida’s beautiful Gulf Coast.

(SCM), its founder and majority owner, Richard S. Strong, two affiliated entities and two other SCM executives, for allowing and, in the case of Strong, engaging in undisclosed frequent trading in Strong mutual funds in violation of their fiduciary duties to the Strong funds and their investors. The settled order requires the payment of more that $140 million in monetary remedies, and imposes regulated industry bars and other reliefStephen M. Cutler, Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement, said, "Strong Capital Management and its founder, Richard Strong, betrayed the mutual fund investors they were duty-bound to protect. In Richard Strong's case, his personal trades were a betrayal of the highest order, warranting the stiffest possible civil sanctions."Robert J. Burson, Senior Associate Regional Director of the SEC's Midwest Regional Office, added, "This is the second time that Strong and SCM have been the subject of an SEC enforcement action for placing their interests before the interests of mutual fund investors. That fact, together with the gravity of the breach of trust reflected in the Commission's findings, shows that the severe sanctions imposed in this case are warranted."The Commission's Order finds, among other things:SCM entered into an express agreement with hedge fund manager Edward Stern allowing his hedge funds (the Canary hedge funds) to market time certain Strong funds, in order to obtain non-mutual fund business from Stern and his family. The agreement enabled the Canary hedge funds to make approximately 135 round trip trades in four Strong funds, realizing gross profits of $2.7 million from December 2002 to May 2003. Under SCM's policies and procedures, other shareholders would have been ejected from the Strong funds for engaging in similar trading. Richard Strong engaged in frequent trading in several Strong funds, including one fund he managed. Between 1998 and 2003, he engaged in several hundred such trades, making gross profits of $4.1 million and net profits of $1.6 million. SCM failed to disclose the arrangement with Stern, and Strong and SCM failed to disclose Strong's personal trading, to the Strong funds' Boards of Directors or shareholders. In fact, the Strong funds' prospectuses and SCM's policies and practices created the misleading impression that frequent trading of the kind practiced by Strong and the Canary hedge funds would not be allowed. SCM provided the Canary hedge funds with the month-end portfolio holdings for the funds in which Canary traded before other shareholders could see the same information, to the possible detriment of the funds and their shareholders. SCM's affiliated transfer agent, Strong Investor Services, Inc. (SIS), and its affiliated broker-dealer, Strong Investments, Inc. (SII), facilitated SCM's violations by allowing the Canary hedge funds' frequent trading. Anthony J. D'Amato, SCM's Executive Vice President and a resident of Elm Grove, Wis., aided and abetted SCM's violations by approving the arrangement with the Canary hedge funds. Thomas A. Hooker, SCM's Compliance Officer, aided and abetted SCM's and Strong's violations by failing, after he learned of Strong's frequent trading, to follow up on a directive to monitor the trading and ensure it stopped.Based on these findings, the Commission ordered (1) SCM to pay $40 million in disgorgement and $40 million in civil penalties; (2) Strong to pay $30 million in disgorgement and $30 million in civil penalties; (3) D'Amato to pay $375,000 in disgorgement and $375,000 in civil penalties; and (4) Hooker to pay a $50,000 civil penalty.In addition, the Commission (1) barred Strong from association with any investment adviser, investment company, broker, dealer, municipal securities dealer or transfer agent; (2) barred D'Amato from association with any investment adviser, investment company, broker or dealer; and (3) barred Hooker from association with any investment adviser or investment company. SCM, SII and SIS consented to censures and undertook compliance and mutual fund governance reforms. All parties consented to cease-and-desist orders.The Commission's Order finds that SCM and Strong violated Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act; SCM violated Section 204A of the Advisers Act and Section 34(b) of the Investment Company Act; D'Amato and SCM violated Section 204A of the Advisers Act and Section 34(b) of the Investment Company Act; D'Amato, SII, and SIS aided and abetted violations of Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Advisers Act; and Hooker aided and abetted violations of Sections 206(2) of the Advisers Act. SCM, Strong, SII, SIS, D'Amato and Hooker consented to entry of the Commission's Order without admitting or denying the findings.This enforcement action has been coordinated with The Office of the New York Attorney General and the Wisconsin Department of Financial Institutions.For further information contact:Stephen M.

 While touring in Florida last month, my buddies and I stayed at the Sea Shell motel in Naples. We met a guy who said his father invented some detail products called "The Bomb." He asked where we were from and we told him Plum Boro,Pittsburgh,PA. He said he was from Pittsburgh too and was moving down to Naples. One of my Buddies had some with him, and I gave it a try. Very nice....easy to use and does the job nicely. I ordered some and also ordered Bombs Away. I gotta say I was REALLY impressed with Bombs Away. I have an RC Components "Smoothie" solid polished aluminun rear wheel on my Road Star and it always has looked just "ok." I polished it up with the Bombs Away, and all I can say is WOW! The wheel looks better than when I received it from the factory. Not as good as chrome, but pretty damn close. I'm a self-employed dental lab tech and I know what it's like to  hear from my customers and their patients when they pleased with my work. Justwanted to let ya know..good stuff.


Larry Rudolph


 This is the greatest product I have ever used. I especially enjoy having the travel bottle.  This is not the BOM. . it is a NUCLEAR EXPLOSIONIIIII Keep up The Good Work!!!


Captain Richard's Customer


 Folks: I am a professional bike / auto detailer. I've tried just about every metal polish product out there and have repeatedly found one particular product better than the rest. Today was history in the making, because Bom's Away Metal Polish has just dethroned my  favorite metal polish for the past 10 years. Thank you for a great Product!

 Hello, The products I ordered yesterday arrived today and so I decided to see if all the claims were true. Just finished a trip up to Lake City, FL on my black 2002 GL1800 and it was pretty dirty. Shock took the grease and grime off the lower engine casings and made them look like new. BOM has put a luster and depth in the black paint that I was never able to get with Meguiars Gold Class. I haven't tried the BOMS AWAY on the wheels yet, but I did make a very expensive Case knife look better than new. I am quite a pessimist regarding products that have big claims, but I have to say that that ALL of your products have far exceeded my expectations. I coordinate a couple of riding groups in the Ft Lauderdale area and I would love to tell them about these products except I don't want their bikes looking as good as mine.  I have three other bikes that will be BOM'd later this week. Thank you!

 I've not tried the Bombs Away so I'm looking forward to that. I love the "Captain Richards" and it gets confirmed every time I use it or when I  see the Tuttle boys using it on American Chopper. Thanks a bunch.

 Hi Richard- I just wanted to let you know how much I enjoy your products. I am a confirmed clean-car nut. I have used many products to wash/wax my vehicles, and yours are the best. I have owned both motorcycles and cars, and I will use your cleaners as my first choice. I was introduced to 'waterless car cleaner' by DryWash'n'Guard. While I liked the product, I thought it could be improved, and it also was expensive. I prefer your "BOM" (aka Cap'n Richard's Best) to anything else. By the way, I ordered a couple bottles of BOM last week, and they haven't arrived yet.  Can you confirm that they've been shipped? I wanted to clean up my cars this holiday weekend. Thanks.

 I found out about your product at Bourget Bike Works and I used your bike wash today. It was super easy and  I almost enjoyed washing my bike. Thanks for a great product.

 Captain Richards: I have owned my 1969 Porsche since it was new. It has won trophies in many club shows. The mag wheels have NEVER  looked as good as they do now after using my new bottle of Boms Away. Thanks for a good product!

 Alright....I was skeptical could the Cherry Wash and the Captain Richard's Best be as good as promoted 222 Well, after two evenings of riding in Southern Illinois warm weather and covering over 300 miles with at least three times that many half dollar size moths hitting the bike, I thought "here's the test!!!" The 2005 HD Black Ultra fairing, windshield and entire front end were nothing but remnants of the early summer moth population here in Southern Illinois ... WHAT A MESS!!!! So, I openec the bottle of Cherry Wash and started spraying. Now, an Ultra has a lot of places to clean, and it was good thing the bottle was so large. I decided to completely follow the instructions and not wipe any surfaces...just trust in the directions and the strong water spray/stream on the bike. UNBELIEVABLE RESULTS....still can't believe it!!! WHAT A SHINE!!! And no more moth remnants! The black is really looking great, and the chrome will blind you. I'm sold!!!! Only wish I could buy the Cherry Wash in a bigger bottle. I don't need to truly wash the bike often, but I put at least 12,000 miles a year on the Ultra. And many of those miles are in tr "bug-time" of the day. The Captain Richard's Best is good to use for detailing before a poker run if the bike is slightly "unshowable", but I don't think I want to use it on such a buggy mess after a 300-500 mile day. That's when the Cherry Wash comes in. Thanks for the product. I'm very interested in getting more...will be ordering soon. And it blows any of the other "spray and wash" products off the block... they can't compete with the performance of Cherry Wash.

 Captain Richard, Got my first bottle of Captain Richard's Best and it is fantastic. cleaned and detailed my Custom Hemi truck. It is unbelievable. I love it.... Have used the BOMS AWAY for about seven years on our 2002  Custom HD wheels to keep them looking like chrome. Wonderful products!!! Thank you.

 Just a note to let you know...my daughters found my cache of BOM and have been using it on thier personal vehicles. fine...okay NOW my wife is using it in her new kitchen!!!! Granite countertops....the black range and oven  hood look great...the refridge...microwave. This just isn't right on so many levels.

 Hello, My buddy and I have tried everything we know of to get rid of the blueing on his pipes. A mistake was made during the tuning process and his pipes turned a dark blue. I have attached a picture of the pipe. The entire thing was as blue as the top elbow part of the pipe. We ran out of stuff to try so he decided to try some Boms Away I had in my garage. A little time with a polishing ball and a little Boms Away and you can see the results for yourself.  This product is amazing! I only wish he didn't use it all during the process!!!


Robert Boyero, Captain/USMC


 I have tried many products, but yours is the best I have ever used. It not only cleans and shines better then anything I've used it is less work also. It is especially good on lace wheels which can be a lot of work. My chrome is brilliant and my paint has that deep luster. You guys get a "GOLD STAR."  I'm attaching a photo. My bike looks better then the day it came off the dealers floor.

 The greatest, Without a doubt, the BOM is the best product I have ever seen in my 52 years. I showed it to my Paint and Body man and he was very impressed. I loaned my BOM to my son-in-law, who has a great restored 1967 Camaro, and I haven't been able to get it back except in small quantities(he fills my small bottle up when I ask). He just won a trophy at a local car show last Saturday. The moral of this story is; don't loan your BOM to anyone The only question I have is: What is the long term use, i.e. will it yellow clear coat? I will continue to use your products until I find something negative  ( I don't think there is anything but positive). I'm ordering more today.
