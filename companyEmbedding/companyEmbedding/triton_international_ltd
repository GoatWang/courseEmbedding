Transaction Fact Sheet (Graphic: Business Wire)





November 09, 2015 05:50 PM Eastern Standard Time



HAMILTON, Bermuda & PURCHASE, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Triton Container International Limited (“Triton”) and TAL International 
      Group, Inc. (NYSE:TAL) (“TAL International”) jointly announced today 
      that they have entered into a definitive agreement under which the 
      companies will combine in an all-stock merger of equals transaction. The 
      transaction, which has been unanimously approved by the Boards of 
      Directors of both companies, will create the world’s largest 
      lessor of intermodal freight containers with a combined container fleet 
      of nearly five million twenty-foot equivalent units (TEU) and revenue 
      earning assets of $8.7 billion.
    

      Under the terms of the transaction agreement, Triton and TAL 
      International will combine under a newly-formed holding company, Triton 
      International Limited (“Triton International”), which will be domiciled 
      in Bermuda and is expected to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange. 
      Triton shareholders will own 55% of the equity of the combined company 
      and TAL International shareholders will own 45%. TAL International 
      shareholders will receive one common share of Triton International for 
      each share of TAL International stock owned. TAL International 
      shareholders will also receive a special dividend of $0.54 per share 
      upon closing of the transaction.
    

Company Backgrounds


      Triton was founded in 1980 and is currently owned by Warburg Pincus LLC 
      and Vestar Capital Partners, along with other private investors, 
      including members of Triton management. Triton operates a container 
      fleet of 2.4 million TEU, services its customers through 19 subsidiary 
      offices in 13 countries and is domiciled in Bermuda.
    

      TAL International was founded in 1963 and has been publicly listed since 
      2005. TAL International operates a container fleet of 2.4 million TEU, 
      services its customers through 17 offices in 11 countries and is 
      domiciled in Delaware.
    

Transaction Highlights



        A merger of Triton and TAL International will create the world’s 
        largest and most efficient intermodal container leasing company with a 
        container fleet of 4.8 million TEU, resulting in industry cost 
        leadership and an enhanced container supply capability.
      

        The combined company expects to realize $40 million per year in annual 
        SG&A synergies, by aligning infrastructure and creating a 
        best-in-class systems environment. The cost savings are expected to be 
        fully implemented by the end of 2016.
      

        The transaction is expected to be approximately 30% accretive to net 
        income per share for TAL International’s existing shareholders when 
        cost savings are fully realized.
      

        The regional and product line strengths of Triton and TAL 
        International are highly complementary. The combined company will 
        offer its customer base a broad range of container types and will 
        maintain close customer relationships across all major geographic 
        locations.
      

        Consummation of the transaction will not require any incremental 
        leverage and existing debt facilities at Triton and TAL International 
        will largely remain in place.
      

        The new company expects to implement an annual dividend of $1.80 per 
        share and intends to adopt a share repurchase plan of up to $250 
        million following the close of the transaction. The planned share 
        repurchase program will be completed using the company’s existing 
        liquidity, and will supplant TAL International’s recently announced 
        $150 million buyback program.
      


      Ed Schneider, Co-Founder and Chairman of the Board, Triton, stated, 
      “This transaction will create a company with deep industry knowledge, 
      enhanced operating and systems capabilities and expanded fleet size. 
      Both Triton and TAL International have well-earned reputations for 
      competence and reliability with our customers, suppliers and capital 
      providers. We are proud of what Triton has accomplished over the last 35 
      years and we believe that joining forces with TAL International is a 
      next logical step in our evolution. We look forward to bringing together 
      our similar cultures of dependability, high quality customer service and 
      teamwork.”
    

      Brian Sondey, President and Chief Executive Officer, TAL International, 
      stated, “This is a transformational transaction. The new company’s 
      enhanced capabilities, larger scale and improved cost competitiveness 
      will better position it in the current soft operating environment and 
      provide valuable operating leverage when the market recovers. In 
      addition, our customers will benefit from significantly expanded supply 
      capabilities, the industry’s best container build quality and top-tier 
      customer service. Both Triton and TAL International have delivered 
      industry-leading returns over the last ten years, and we are very 
      excited to work together to continue this tradition of success as a 
      larger, stronger, more profitable company.”
    

      Simon Vernon, President and Chief Executive Officer, Triton, stated, 
      “Bringing together our two highly compatible companies is a powerful 
      combination that will deliver a number of compelling strategic and 
      financial benefits to the stakeholders of both companies. The product 
      line and customer strengths of Triton and TAL International are highly 
      complementary, which will allow us to preserve the core strengths of 
      each company. We also share a strong commitment to container quality, 
      investment discipline and operational excellence. Both organizations are 
      focused on making the integration as seamless as possible for our 
      respective customers and suppliers. TAL International will be an 
      excellent partner for us and we are looking forward to bringing these 
      two outstanding companies together.”

_______________________1 Subject to 
      completion of quarterly reviews by Triton’s external auditors.2 
      Combined financial data as of September 30, 2015, before consideration 
      of transaction costs, synergies, and purchase accounting adjustments.
    

      The combined company expects to achieve $40 million in annual SG&A 
      synergies upon full integration by the end of 2016, to be realized 
      through aligning infrastructure and creating a best-in-class systems 
      environment. No additional leverage is required to consummate the 
      transaction and existing Triton and TAL International debt facilities 
      will largely remain in place. Both companies have significant undrawn 
      financing availability for liquidity and capital expenditures under 
      their existing credit facilities.
    

      GAAP purchase accounting adjustments at Triton International will result 
      in a reduction to the carrying value of certain revenue earning assets. 
      In addition, a lease intangible asset will be created to reflect the 
      value of above market lease rates on certain existing leases. These 
      accounting changes will not impact the borrowing base availability under 
      the debt facilities of either Triton or TAL International. These 
      purchase accounting adjustments, which are non-cash, will likely 
      decrease net income in 2016, be approximately net income neutral in 2017 
      and positively impact net income thereafter.
    

Management and Board of Directors


      Following the completion of the transaction, TAL International’s 
      President and Chief Executive Officer Brian Sondey will serve as Chief 
      Executive Officer, Triton’s President and Chief Executive Officer Simon 
      Vernon will serve as President, and TAL International’s Chief Financial 
      Officer John Burns will serve as Chief Financial Officer of the combined 
      company. Triton’s Chairman Ed Schneider will see the transaction through 
      to close and has announced that he will then retire.
    

      The newly-formed company will be domiciled in Bermuda and will continue 
      to have significant operating subsidiaries worldwide.
    

      The Board of Directors of the newly-formed company will initially be 
      comprised of nine directors. It is expected that three directors will 
      come from Triton’s existing Board of Directors with one additional 
      director to be identified by Triton, four will come from TAL 
      International’s existing Board of Directors, and one new independent 
      director will be identified by TAL International's Nominating and 
      Governance Committee after conducting an external search process. From 
      and after the closing, Warburg Pincus LLC and Vestar Capital Partners 
      will have the right to designate three of the nine directors, subject to 
      step down as their ownership decreases after the closing.
    

      Following the close of the transaction, Warburg Pincus and Vestar will 
      own approximately 27% and 15%, respectively, of Triton International. A 
      majority of the Board of Directors will be independent under New York 
      Stock Exchange standards.
    

Approvals and Time to Close


      The transaction is subject to Triton and TAL International shareholder 
      approval, regulatory clearances and other customary closing conditions. 
      Triton shareholders holding Triton common shares sufficient to approve 
      the transaction on behalf of the Triton shareholders have agreed to vote 
      in favor of the transaction. The companies expect to complete the 
      transaction during the first half of 2016.
    

Advisors


      Wells Fargo Securities is serving as financial advisor to Triton, and 
      Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP is serving as its legal advisor. 
      BofA Merrill Lynch is serving as financial advisor to TAL International 
      and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP and Shearman & Sterling LLP 
      are serving as its legal advisors.

      facts but are forward-looking statements for purposes of the safe harbor 
      provisions under The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. 
      Forward-looking statements generally are accompanied by words such as 
      “may”, “should”, “would”, “plan”, “intend”, “anticipate”, “believe”, 
      “estimate”, “predict”, “potential”, “seem”, “seek”, “continue”, 
      “future”, “will”, “expect”, “outlook” or other similar words, phrases or 
      expressions. These forward-looking statements include statements 
      regarding our industry, future events, the proposed transaction between 
      Triton and TAL International, the estimated or anticipated future 
      results and benefits of Triton and TAL International following the 
      transaction, including estimated synergies, the likelihood and ability 
      of the parties to successfully close the proposed transaction, future 
      opportunities for the combined company, and other statements that are 
      not historical facts. These statements are based on the current 
      expectations of Triton and TAL International management and are not 
      predictions of actual performance. These statements are subject to a 
      number of risks and uncertainties regarding Triton’s and TAL 
      International’s respective businesses and the transaction, and actual 
      results may differ materially. These risks and uncertainties include, 
      but are not limited to, changes in the business environment in which 
      Triton and TAL International operate, including inflation and interest 
      rates, and general financial, economic, regulatory and political 
      conditions affecting the industry in which Triton and TAL International 
      operate; changes in taxes, governmental laws, and regulations; 
      competitive product and pricing activity; difficulties of managing 
      growth profitably; the loss of one or more members of Triton’s or TAL 
      International’s management team; the ability of the parties to 
      successfully close the proposed transaction, including the risk that the 
      required regulatory approvals are not obtained, are delayed or are 
      subject to unanticipated conditions that could adversely affect the 
      combined company or the expected benefits of the transaction; failure to 
      realize the anticipated benefits of the transaction, including as a 
      result of a delay in completing the transaction or a delay or difficulty 
      in integrating the businesses of Triton and TAL International; 
      uncertainty as to the long-term value of Triton International common 
      shares; the expected amount and timing of cost savings and operating 
      synergies; failure to receive the approval of the stockholders of Triton 
      and TAL International for the transaction, and those discussed in TAL 
      International’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 
      31, 2014 under the heading “Risk Factors,” as updated from time to time 
      by TAL International’s Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and other 
      documents of TAL International on file with the Securities and Exchange 
      Commission ("SEC") or in the registration statement on Form S-4 that 
      will be filed with the SEC by Triton International. There may be 
      additional risks that neither Triton nor TAL International presently 
      know or that Triton and TAL International currently believe are 
      immaterial which could also cause actual results to differ from those 
      contained in the forward-looking statements. In addition, 
      forward-looking statements provide Triton’s and TAL International’s 
      expectations, plans or forecasts of future events and views as of the 
      date of this press release. Triton and TAL International anticipate that 
      subsequent events and developments will cause Triton’s and TAL 
      International’s assessments to change. However, while Triton and TAL 
      International may elect to update these forward-looking statements at 
      some point in the future, Triton and TAL International specifically 
      disclaim any obligation to do so. These forward-looking statements 
      should not be relied upon as representing Triton’s and TAL 
      International’s assessments as of any date subsequent to the date of 
      this press release.

Looking at the universe of stocks we cover at Dividend Channel, on 11/30/16, Triton International Ltd will trade ex-dividend, for its quarterly dividend of $0.45, payable on 12/22/16. As a percentage of TRTN's recent stock price of $20.29, this dividend works out to approximately 2.22%, so look for shares of Triton International Ltd to trade 2.22% lower — all else being equal — when TRTN shares open for trading on 11/30/16.

There are a number of ways to look at short data, but one metric that we find particularly useful is the "days to cover" because it considers both the total shares short and the average daily volume of shares typically traded.

            A Success Built On Quality
        
    




×




Triton began operations in the intermodal container leasing business in 1980 with some very specific ideas about the kind of company we wanted to be. The most compelling of those ideas was quality. It still is. Perhaps that's because we've got some pretty convincing evidence that it works:


                In an industry known for its challenging economic environment, Triton has operated for over 30 years, serving our customers and growing our fleet.
            

                The Triton fleet has grown to become the largest lessor-owned fleet of marine intermodal cargo containers in the world, with an original equipment cost of approximately $4.0 billion and an average age profile that is one of the youngest in the industry.
            

                Triton's successful performance has enabled us to grow and upgrade our container fleet and worldwide service network and has provided the resources enabling us to develop new product offerings and to expand our capabilities in areas such as Wholesale.
            

The idea of quality is woven through the five key components of our corporate strategy. Quality defines the kind of customers we serve and drives the ways we continue to build our fleet, recruit and motivate our people, manage information, and make financial decisions.
The terms "Triton," "we," "us" and "our" refer to Triton International Limited, Hamilton, Bermuda, and our consolidated subsidiaries. To contact Triton, click on Contact Us.
