Surgical Product Information
General Instrumentation
                        Miltex understands that common instrumentation for   routine surgical needs must meet the same quality standard as all instruments.   Our scissors, needle holders, forceps, and retractors are forged from the   highest grades of surgical stainless steel and expertly crafted to perform as   required by the most demanding clinicians.
Specialty Instrumentation
                        Our general   instruments are fully complemented by an extensive selection of instrumentation   for all surgical specialties. Whether for in-office dermatological procedures or   cardiovascular surgery in the OR, Miltex is able to meet the full range of   instrument needs for all surgical settings; including office-based surgery,   outpatient surgery or that performed in the hospital operating room. 
Premium   Instrumentation
                        A number of important surgical instrument patterns   have been enhanced by Miltex to afford additional clinical as well as economic   benefit to the clinician. Our Tungsten Carbide jaws and scissor blades, SuperCut   scissors, Ceram-A-Grip needle holders and a wide selection of delicate   instrument patterns provides Premium instrumentation for demanding surgical   requirements. 
CryoSolutions®
					  Integra Miltex CryoSolutions is an innovative yet 
					  simple device for delivery of liquefied nitrous oxide 
					  which allows the clinician to pinpoint the treatment site 
					  for rapid freezing and efficacious destruction of unwanted 
					  tissue.
Padgett Instruments
We   are pleased to announce the introduction of Padgett Instruments by Miltex, a new   partnership of two   well respected names in surgical instrumentation.  These classic brands provide   a combination of choice and quality unmatched by any other instrument company.    Two Great Brands……One Great Company! 
The Padgett and Miltex names are   synonymous with premium surgical instrumentation manufactured from the highest   quality stainless steel by skilled German craftsmen to exacting specifications.    The surgical “feel” of our instruments, the superb cutting ability, the smoothly   beveled box locks and jaw edges which protect suture material from snags or   cutting are just a few features that differentiate and make our products   outperform and stand-out from competition.
Our new PADGETT Instrument Catalog   features our expanded offering of over 1,500 new premium SuperCut and Tungsten   Carbide instruments as well as forceps, rasps, retractors, dissectors, fiber   optic, bipolar and other specialty instrument patterns.  
Our instrument selection recognizes   and meets a variety of clinical needs for Plastic & Reconstructive Surgery   involving Breast, Face, Eye, Abdominal, Nasal, Maxillofacial, Cleft Palate, Hand   and many other procedures.  In addition, these products are extensively used in   Dermatology, Oral & Maxillofacial, ENT, Ophthalmology and General Surgery   applications.
Instrument Care and Cleaning
                        A valuable   inventory of surgical instrumentation deserves and requires careful maintenance.   The Miltex line of instrument care and cleaning products are each carefully   formulated to ensure the very best results from instrument reprocessing. Our   goal is to provide the necessary products to restore your instruments to a   like-new condition.
Surgical   Disposables
                        A number of important surgical instruments and many   diagnostic or therapeutic procedures are best accomplished using a disposable   product. Miltex has carefully replicated the very best features of a reusable   instrument to create a more convenient and economical disposable as well as   introducing a new selection of single-use, in-office procedural tools.
Sterilization Containers/Stainless Steelware
                        The processing of surgical instruments has been   significantly improved by the adoption of Sterilization Containers over wrapped   trays or baskets. Miltex offers a full range of newly designed and high quality   Containers for our customers.
As a complement to Containers, we have also expanded our   offering of stainless steelware products to include greater choices of bowls,   trays, jars, cups, as well as instrument stringers.
