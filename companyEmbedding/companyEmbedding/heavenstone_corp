We will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of the common stock
offered by the selling shareholders. We are registering 909,423 of our
71,159,423 currently outstanding shares for resale to provide the holders
thereof with freely tradable securities, but the registration of such shares
does not necessarily mean that any of such shares will be offered or sold by the
holders thereof.


Ranch Segment

The home construction industry is fragmented and highly competitive. We will
compete with numerous other national, regional and local home constructors for
buyers, desirable properties, raw materials, skilled labor, employees and
management talent. We also compete with resales of existing and foreclosed homes
and with the rental housing market. We expect that our homes will compete on the
basis of quality, price, design and location. There is no assurance that we will
compete successfully in our market. 
---

Resort Segment

The segments of the hospitality industry in which we operate are subject to 
intense competition. Our principal competitors are other operators of luxury,
full-service and focused-service hotels and timeshare properties, including
other major hospitality chains with well-established and recognized brands. We
also compete against smaller hotel chains, independent and local hotel owners
and operators and independent timeshare operators. If we are unable to compete
successfully, our revenues or profits would be impaired.


Company Description
Our company is a development-stage company that was incorporated under the laws
of the State of Nevada on June 13, 2014, with the intention of becoming a real
estate development and construction company centered in the Temecula,
California, area, specializing in the construction and sale of luxury


 vineyard
estate homes, each of which will contain a small vineyard capable of producing
small commercial quantities of wine. We refer to this segment of our business as
the “Ranch Segment”. In addition, we intend to construct and operate a five-star
hotel, spa and winery to be known as “Sorrento Resort, Vineyard and Winery”,
also located in the Temecula area. We refer to this segment of our business as
the “Resort Segment”.

While our Ranch Segment has purchased approximately 70 acres of undeveloped real
estate located in Temecula, this segment has not yet begun full-scale
operations. To date, our Ranch Segment has obtained some of the permits and
approvals required for it to begin construction of vineyard estate homes. Our
Resort Segment has identified a 25-acre property located also in Temecula on
which it hopes to construct its planned Sorrento Resort, Vineyard and Winery.
---

We maintain our principal offices at 17800 Castleton Street, Suite 300, City of
Industry, California 91748; our telephone number is (626) 581-3335; our web site
is www.hstone.us.

We will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of the common stock
offered by the selling shareholders. We are registering 909,423 of our
71,159,423 currently outstanding shares for resale to provide the holders
thereof with freely tradable securities, but the registration of such shares
does not necessarily mean that any of such shares will be offered or sold by the
holders thereof.


Ranch Segment

The home construction industry is fragmented and highly competitive. We will
compete with numerous other national, regional and local home constructors for
buyers, desirable properties, raw materials, skilled labor, employees and
management talent. We also compete with resales of existing and foreclosed homes
and with the rental housing market. We expect that our homes will compete on the
basis of quality, price, design and location. There is no assurance that we will
compete successfully in our market. 
---

Resort Segment

The segments of the hospitality industry in which we operate are subject to 
intense competition. Our principal competitors are other operators of luxury,
full-service and focused-service hotels and timeshare properties, including
other major hospitality chains with well-established and recognized brands. We
also compete against smaller hotel chains, independent and local hotel owners
and operators and independent timeshare operators. If we are unable to compete
successfully, our revenues or profits would be impaired.


Company Description
Our company is a development-stage company that was incorporated under the laws
of the State of Nevada on June 13, 2014, with the intention of becoming a real
estate development and construction company centered in the Temecula,
California, area, specializing in the construction and sale of luxury


 vineyard
estate homes, each of which will contain a small vineyard capable of producing
small commercial quantities of wine. We refer to this segment of our business as
the “Ranch Segment”. In addition, we intend to construct and operate a five-star
hotel, spa and winery to be known as “Sorrento Resort, Vineyard and Winery”,
also located in the Temecula area. We refer to this segment of our business as
the “Resort Segment”.

While our Ranch Segment has purchased approximately 70 acres of undeveloped real
estate located in Temecula, this segment has not yet begun full-scale
operations. To date, our Ranch Segment has obtained some of the permits and
approvals required for it to begin construction of vineyard estate homes. Our
Resort Segment has identified a 25-acre property located also in Temecula on
which it hopes to construct its planned Sorrento Resort, Vineyard and Winery.
---

We maintain our principal offices at 17800 Castleton Street, Suite 300, City of
Industry, California 91748; our telephone number is (626) 581-3335; our web site
is www.hstone.us.

HEAVENSTONE
CORP. 

NOTES TO
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS



 





 



September
30, 2016

(unaudited)



 











 

NOTE 1.
BASIS OF PRESENTATION

 

The
accompanying unaudited interim financial statements of Heavenstone
Corp. ("Heavenstone" or the "Company"), have been prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America and the rules of the Securities and
Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), and should be read in conjunction
with the audited financial statements and notes thereto contained
in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June
30, 2016, filed with the SEC. In the opinion of management, all
adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary
for a fair presentation of financial position and the results of
operations for the interim periods presented have been reflected
herein. The results of operations for interim periods are not
necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full
year. Notes to the Financial Statements which substantially
duplicate the disclosure contained in the audited financial
statements for fiscal 2016 as reported in the Company's Annual
Report on Form 10-K have been omitted.

 

NOTE 2.
GOING CONCERN

 

These
financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis,
which implies the Company will continue to realize its assets and
discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. For the
three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company had an
accumulated deficit of $456,009 and revenue of $0. The continuation
of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon the company's
continued financial support from its shareholders, the ability of
the Company to obtain necessary equity financing to continue
operations, and the attainment of profitable operations. These
factors raise substantial doubt regarding the Company's ability to
continue as a going concern. These financial statements do not
include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of
recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might
be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going
concern.

 

The
Company intends to fund operations through equity and debt
financing arrangements, which may be insufficient to fund its
capital expenditures, working capital and other cash requirements
for the year ending June 30, 2017.

 

NOTE
3.  LAND AND LAND DEVELOPMENT COSTS

 

Land and
land development costs are carried at cost. Land development costs
capitalized include costs associated with the development of the
purchased land, including inspection fees and engineering fees. For
the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company had incurred
$301,255 in land development costs. Also, the Company capitalized
the interest costs of $42,420 incurred for the real estate projects
under ASC 835-20, during the three months ended September 30,
2016.

Item 2.
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations.

 

Jumpstart
Our Business Startups Act of 2012

 

As a
company with less than $1 billion in revenue during our last fiscal
year, we qualify as an "emerging growth company", as defined in the
Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the JOBS Act). As an
emerging growth company, we may take advantage of specified reduced
disclosure and other requirements that are otherwise applicable
generally to public companies. These provisions include:

 





 



   •



Only two
years of audited financial statements in addition to any required
unaudited interim financial statements with correspondingly reduced
"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations" disclosure.






 



   •



Reduced
disclosure about our executive compensation
arrangements.






 



   •



Not having
to obtain non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation or
golden parachute arrangements.






 



   •



Exemption
from the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of our
internal control over financial reporting.




 

We may
take advantage of these exemptions for up to five years or such
earlier time that we are no longer an emerging growth company. We
would cease to be an emerging growth company if we have more than
$1 billion in annual revenue, we have more than $700 million in
market value of our stock held by non-affiliates, or we issue more
than $1 billion of non-convertible debt over a three-year period.
We may choose to take advantage of some but not all of these
reduced burdens. We have taken advantage of these reduced reporting
burdens herein, and the information that we provide may be
different than what you might get from other public companies in
which you hold stock.

 

Cautionary
Statement

 

The
following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction
with our financial statements for the three months ended September
30, 2016 (unaudited) and 2015 (unaudited), included elsewhere in
this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The results shown herein are
not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any
future periods.

 

This
discussion contains forward-looking statements. These
forward-looking statements are based on our management's current
expectations with respect to future events, financial performance
and operating results, which statements are subject to risks and
uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those discussed below
and elsewhere in this prospectus. The risks and uncertainties
discussed herein could cause our actual results to differ from the
results contemplated by these forward-looking
statements.

 

Basis of
Presentation – "True" Inception Date

 

While our
company was incorporated in the State of Nevada in June 2104, we
undertook no activities until July 14, 2014. Due to our having less
than one year of actual operations, we determined, for financial
statement purposes, our "true" inception date to be July 14, 2014,
the date of first activities. The following discussion, as well as
the accompanying financial statements, is presented in accordance
with such determination.

 

Background
and Recent Developments

 

We are a
development-stage company that was incorporated under the laws of
the State of Nevada on June 13, 2014. We intend to become a large
real estate development and construction company with operations in
the luxury vineyard estate home construction industry, our Ranch
Segment, and the hospitality industry, our Resort
Segment.

 

 

9

  

 

Until
such time as the results of our operations require us to do so,
this discussion will not present separate segment
information.

 

Ranch
Segment . Since
our inception, we have acquired approximately 70 acres of
unimproved real estate located in Temecula, California. We intend
to construct our first vineyard estate home development on this
land. However, we do not currently possess sufficient capital to
complete these objectives. Recently, we started the permitting
process necessary to begin construction on our first estate home
development.

 

Resort
Segment . We have
identified one or more parcels totaling approximately 25 acres
located in Temecula on which we intend to build and operate our
planned Sorrento Resort, Vineyard & Winery. However, we do not
have a contract to purchase this property and we do not currently
possess sufficient capital to complete these objectives.

 

Principal
Factors Affecting Our Financial Performance

 

We expect
that our operating results will be primarily affected by the
following factors:

 

   •

 

our
ability to obtain capital;

   •

 

our
ability to attract buyers for our estate homes;

   •

 

our
ability to attract guest to our planned resort property;
and

   •

 

our
ability to contain our costs and maintain our low
overhead.

 

Expected
Financial Performance

 

Based on
our current business plan, we expect to incur operating losses
through at least the first quarter of 2017. However, because we do
not yet possess capital to commence operations in the Ranch
Segment, we cannot predict whether we will have any estate home
sales prior to the end of such period.

 

We are
still required to obtain approximately $4.5 million in order to
begin full-scale operations in our Ranch Segment and approximately
$50 million in order to begin full-scale operations in our Resort
Segment, which includes the construction of our planned resort
property. There is no assurance that we will be successful in
obtaining this needed funding.

 

Results of
Operations

 

For the
Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015
. During
the three months ended September 30, 2016 (the "Current Period"),
and the three months ended September 30, 2015 (the "Prior Period"),
we generated no revenues. We do not expect to generate any revenues
until the second quarter of 2017, at the earliest.

 

For the
Current Period, we incurred a net loss of $(2,016) (unaudited). For
the Prior Period, we incurred a net loss of $(67,866) (unaudited).
Had we not experienced a reimbursement of approximately $48,000 in
consulting and related fees, our net loss for the Current Period
would have been approximately $50,000. Until we begin full scale
business operations, we expect the level of our quarterly expenses
to be approximately $50,000.

 

10

  

 

Plan of
Operations

 

General
. We
require significant funding to achieve our objectives. Sources of
funding are expected to be from sources of equity or debt
financing, as well as from sales of our estate homes. As with any
start-up company that offers unproven products, there is no
assurance that our company will be successful with any level of
additional funding.

 

Ranch
Segment . Since
our inception, our Ranch Segment has acquired approximately 70
acres of unimproved real estate located in Temecula, California.
Our Ranch Segment intends to construct our first vineyard estate
home development on these properties.

 

Since
acquiring these properties, we have taken, and will take, the
following actions towards obtaining needed permits and approvals
for the subdivision planning, construction and delivery of vineyard
estate homes:

 

Completed

   •

 

completed
the preliminary application for subdivision of property;

   •

 

successfully
addressed comments and concerns from county agencies with
jurisdiction;

   •

 

completed
required environmental and physical studies with respect to
property;

   •

 

completed
design of tract map and submitted for approval; and

   •

 

completed
initial land development hearing (county).

 

Still to
Complete





 



•



submit
complete improvement plans to county for review and approval
– expected time for approval is between four and six
months;






 



•



three
months after approval of improvements plan, commence street and
other property improvements – approximately three months to
complete.






 



•



record
final tract map, upon completion of improvements;






 



•



submit
grading and building plans for approval, upon recording final tract
map – expected time for approval is approximately three
months; and





 

We expect
to have obtained all of the necessary permits and approvals by
early 2017, at which time we will commence construction of our
first vineyard estate home. However, due to the nature of this
process, we cannot assure you that we will be able to accomplish
these objectives by such date.

 

In
addition, our Ranch Segment plans to offer a wide array of personal
services to the owners of the estate homes during and after their
being built. Because we believe that a prompt and courteous
response to an estate home purchaser's needs during construction
will reduce post-closing repair costs, enhance our reputation for
high quality service and, ultimately, lead to referral business
from our estate home purchasers, our personnel will be trained to
provide exceptional service throughout the construction process,
which service will be provided as part of the estate home purchase
price.

 

Following
the completion of construction and in conjunction with the sale of
homes, our company is planning to provide to purchasers of our
estate homes, a wide array of personal services designed to enhance
the luxury estate home lifestyle. For additional fees, the
following services, among others, will be made av
