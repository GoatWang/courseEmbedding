              Political and economic turmoil in Venezuela could fuel a rise in oil prices—something the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, despite it’s efforts to cut back production, hasn’t been able to do.

Beyond Tesla: 7 stocks driving the autonomous car revolution
              
              Look at these component manufacturers rather than the car companies, says Jeff Reeves.

These 7 highly taxed companies need Congress to finally act on tax reform
              
              It wasn’t Trump’s “movement” that lifted stocks late last year, says Jeff Reeves. It was the promise of lower corporate tax rates.

Extremely low volatility could lead to a sharp, but short-lived, decline in stocks 
              
              Still, a chart of the S&P 500 reveals an undercurrent of bullishness, says Lawrence G. McMillan.

Who trades options the most? Millennial investors
              
              Millennials are frequently criticized by market experts for the way they invest—or, more accurately, the way they’re not investing—but recent research indicates that at least some young market participants are going about things in a more sophisticated way than they’re typically given credit for.

About
Hunt Mining, long an aggressive precious metal exploration and development company listed on the TSX Venture Exchange (HMX.V) with core projects located in the Santa Cruz Province of Argentina, acquired Martha Mine from Coeur in May 2016, and commenced generating a silver concentrate in January 2017. Since 2007, the corporation has drilled more than 62,000 meters of diamond core, conducted 416 line km of IP/Resistivity geophysical surveys and collected more than 20,000 surface chip, channel and trench samples. Drilling led to the identification of six mineralized zones on two projects, including the company’s flagship La Josefina/La Valenciana Project and the 100% controlled El Gateado Project. The company continues to drill on established mineralized zones, all of which remain open to expansion.

Martha Mine | Hunt Mining








































    TSXV:HMX































Martha Mine










The Martha Mine Overview
The Corporation’s acquisition of the Martha Mine will further the transition from an exploration entity to a mining entity. Hunt has one of the largest land packages in Santa Cruz, counting 30 strategic properties prior to the acquisition of Martha, which brought another 7 concessions, and plans to use its acquired flotation mill and infrastructure for mineral exploitation.

Hunt has been an active exploration and development entity in the Santa Cruz Province, Argentina since 2006. From that time on, the Corporation has invested over US$50,000,000 dollars in its Santa Cruz properties which includes the flagship La Josefina Gold / Silver Project (“La Josefina”) and La Valenciana Gold / Silver Project (“La Valenciana”). Both La Josefina and La Valenciana are located within 120 kilometres of the Martha Mine.Most recently, an additional US$2,000,000 in the re-commissioning of the Martha mill and infrastructure to support the Company's production efforts at Martha.  

This website has been updated to include the results of the National Instrument 43-101-Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (the “Report”).
A news release was issued by the Corporation August 10, 2016 when the Report was filed on SEDAR.com, providing additional details about the Martha Mine.

La Josefina | Hunt Mining








































    TSXV:HMX































La Josefina









​
Introduction
The La Josefina Gold-Silver Project, Hunt Mining's advanced-stage property, is a 528 square-kilometer mineral concession and consists of 15 manifestations of discovery (MD's), which are partially covered by 399 mining claims, or pertenencias.
More than 62,500 meters and over 540 holes have been drilled. A preliminary mineral resource was calculated and filed as part of a NI-43-101 technical report in 2010. In 2011 and 2014, additional drilling and trenching was completed to enhance existing resources, test new exploration areas and develop targets for future drill campaigns.
Location
Located within Patagonia's highly prospective Deseado Massif mining district, La Josefina lies approximately 100km northwest of the Cerro Vanguardia (AngloGold Ashanti) gold-silver mine. The nearest town, Gobernador Gregores, is 120km to the south.
Ownership
Cerro Cazador S.A., Hunt Mining's 100% owned Argentine subsidiary, won the public bid to explore, develop and mine La Josefina from Fomicruz S.E. in 2007. CCSA subsequently entered into a partnership agreement with Fomicruz, which was later amended in 2012 from a 9% initial ownership interest to a 19% Fomicruz ownership in a joint venture. The agreement also allows for the provincial mining company to exercise a one-time buy-in option of up to a maximum 49% interest in the project, upon the completion of a positive feasibility study. (More complete details are found on the Corporation's MD&A for 2015)
Geology
Geology of La Josefina Project, within the Deseado Massif, is characterized by abundant middle-to late-Jurassic Age volcanic and volcaniclastic rock units.
The units are dominated by rhyolitic to rhyodacitic ignimbrite flows and lava domes together with subordinate agglomerates, volcanic breccias and tuffs with minor basalts, andesites and volcanic agglomerates intercalated upward with mafic tuffs, conglomerates and sediments. Faults active during the period of intense Jurassic extension and volcanism generally trend NNW-SSE and form a series of grabens, and horst blocks.
Since Jurassic time, the rocks have been cut by normal faults of several different orientations, but have undergone only a moderate amount of compression. In general, the Jurassic rocks remain relatively undeformed and remain flat to gently dipping, except locally where close to faults, volcanic domes or similar features. Thin Quaternary Age basalt flows conceal about half of the Jurassic Age rocks on the La Josefina project.
Mineralization
The type of mineralization and alteration styles present across the project area are classified as low to medium sulfidation type epithermal deposits.
Gold and silver occur in fissure vein systems localized in structures, often a meter or more wide and hundreds of meters long. They are comprised of quartz veins, stockworks and breccias, that carry gold, silver, electrum and some sulfides, primarily pyrite with lessor amounts of base metal sulfides.
Mineralization is commonly zoned vertically over a few to several hundred meters from a gold and silver rich top to a relatively silver-rich zone with increasing base metals at depth. Vein textures include open spaces with evidence of multiple generations of quartz, reflected as finely banded "colloform" and "textures".
One area is noteworthy for the "sinter" type epithermal mineralization found there. Here precious metals are located both within bonanza-grade "pipeline" feeder-breccia zones and lower grade strata-bound mineralization disbursed throughout, and directly below, the flatling sinter unit.
The gold-silver and base metal mineralization at La Josefina is hosted by rhyolitic volcanics of the Chon Aike Formation, which is the host for most mineral occurrences found throughout the Deseado Massif. With one possible exception the mineralization is a variation of classic, structurally-controlled low-sulfidation epithermal fissure-vein systems with minor amounts of sulfide minerals and alteration primarily silicification, (argillization and sericitization).
The one exception, the Sinter target, is a siliceous exhalite or water lain ash tuff related to fossilized hot spring activity.
Nearly all of the vein systems at La Josefina are steeply-dipping (>60°) to sub-vertical. The textures and other characteristics reported for these veins are indicative of high-level to medium epithermal systems.
This suggests gold-silver mineralization in many veins should extend below the depths tested by the drilling done to date.
Drilling Specifications; Sampling and Analytical Procedures
​
All meters drilled consisted of HQ size diamond core (63.5 mm in diameter)
Core recovery averaged greater than 95%
Core boxes were closed and shipped from the rig by attending geologists
All core was unloaded and placed on indoor logging tables by techs
Geologic staff then completed core recovery and geotechnical logs
Core was then logged for lithology, structure, alteration and apparent mineralization (mineralized intervals were reviewed again after splitting)
Geologic staff then typically measured out sample intervals between 0.4 to 1.5 meters in length based on lithology, alteration, structure and apparent mineralization
Geologists determines symmetry of apparent mineralization then draws a cut line onto the core
Core was then photographed (both wet and dry) by techs
Core was then halved by techs with a standard table rock saw (12 inch diamond blade)
 
Halved core is placed back in the box and placed on sampling tables
Geologists then place one half of each sample interval into a marked bag and seals it with a zip tie
Half of sampled core is retained for check assay and geologic verification
In each sequence of twenty samples geologist inserts one blank sample (established barren crystal tuff) one core quarter duplicate, and one standard (3 different standards were purchased from an accredited lab and rotated periodically)
Sealed samples are sorted and stored in a locked container until shipped by truck to bus station for transport to ALS Chemex preparation facility located in Mendoza, Argentina
An independent report on Hunt Mining's QA/QC procedures is included here
Surface Channel Sampling​
Geologist using paint marks samples intervals in the field.
Under Geologic Staff supervision (while filling out sample description and location information): parallel cuts are made into the outcrop or trench floors by technicians
Saw cuts are made to a uniform depth using hand held electric saws
Sample cuts are made to replicate a halved size piece of HQ core (approximately 64 mm wide by 32 mm deep) (This was true, historically, and is still our target process, but we are presently creating some channels that are narrower)
Technicians then chisel out the rock between the cuts, bag, seal and transport samples back to camp
Bagged samples are sorted and QC/QA samples are inserted into each batch of 20 (as described above) (Historically, but not presently our procedure with samples)
Historic Work
Previous exploration valued at $2.8 million was conducted over a thirteen year period by FOMICRUZ and Minamerica including 8,000 surface samples, 3,900 meters of trenching, and 4,100 meters of shallow core drilling. The historical exploration work completed by Fomicruz and Minamérica defined four general target areas in the La Josefina Project as Noreste, Veta Norte, Central, and Piedra Labrada.
Noreste, a 28-square kilometer area in the northeast part of the project, consists of three separate target areas; the most advanced being a sinter layer exposed discontinuously over an area of 2.5 kilometers x 300 meters or more.
Its maximum thickness in outcrop is about 2 meters, dips moderately to the WSW. The best exposure is Mogote Hormigas, a 600-meter long sinter-capped hill bounded on the east by a NW-SE fracture zone that displaces the sinter layer. Examples of high-grade gold over significant lengths of breccia include: 3.0 m @ 176.9 g/t Au and 7.0 m @ 114.1 g/t Au in separate trenches.
Veta Norte is a 3 square kilometers area in the northeast central part of the project between the Noreste and Central target areas. It consists of a prominent north-south fissure vein system, up to 3 meters wide and more than 1,500 meters long. The vein system is divided into 6 separate segments, all which are gold bearing. Outcrop and trench samples contain 2 to 5 g/t gold over lengths of 1 to 4 meters; and 10 of 15 drill holes intersected gold at widths and grades comparable to, or better than, the surface samples.
The Central Area is southwest of Veta Norte and is crossed by at least 8 known vein-veinlet systems exposed in a 2-square-kilometer window through the overlying veneer of Quaternary basalts. The veins are discontinuous sinusoidal bodies up to 3.5 meters wide, 220 to 600 meters long trending NW-SE, concealed in both directions beneath basalt cover. Thirty-two holes drilled to less than 40 meters tested 3 of the 8 known vein systems in the Central Area. Strong mineralization - e.g., from 0.5 to 7 meters with more than 1 g/t gold up to 164 g/t - was intersected in at least 25% of the holes.
Piedra Labrada, in the south-central part of the La Josefina Project, is a 2.5 x 5.0 kilometer area with structural "fairways" containing numerous zones of quartz veinlets and veinlet-stock-works. These zones are a few hundred meters long, up to 15 meters wide, and aligned in NW-SE to NNE-SSW directions over strike lengths of 1 to 2 kilometers. Samples are commonly anomalous in gold, with values up to 9 g/t Au reported.
The historic exploration at La Josefina has produced results, which have been very favorable and in line with results expected from the initial testing of similar high-level epithermal vein systems. In several cases, the results demonstrated good continuity of gold mineralization in three dimensions. The geology and mineralization defined by this initial work suggests the La Josefina vein systems are similar in character and size to other epithermal systems currently being exploited or developed in the region.
Historic Exploration
Hunt Mining through CCSA acquired the La Josefina project in 2007 and immediately initiated aggressive exploration programs that have to date focused largely on drilling targets previously defined by the exploration and drilling efforts of Minamérica and Fomicruz. A brief summary of the exploration activities undertaken by Hunt Mining from 2007 to 2013:
Review of existing project data
Re-logging and re-sampling of core from mineralized intervals of historical drill holes
Re-mapping and re-sampling of select outcrops and trenches
Detailed reconnaissance and geologic mapping of the entire La Josefina property position
Compilation of regional geologic data to better understand structure, stratigraphy, and mineralization
Completion of 416 line kilometers of IP/Resistivity Survey. The IP/Resistivity Survey was done by AkuBra S.A. (Mendoza, Argentina) and consisted of gradient arrays at 25 meter X 50 meter spacing's over a 5.5-kilometer grid. The technology employed was the same as that proven effective elsewhere in the Deseado Massif (e.g., San José and Cerro Negro). The survey undertaken at La Josefina delineated multiple zones of IP chargeability and resistivity anomalies, even under cover south of exposures in the Veta Sur area
Drilling, logging and sampling of 242 HQ diamond drill holes totaling 37,556 meters
Regional analysis and compilation of structural and alteration regimes covering more than 200,000 hectares in western Santa Cruz
Reconnaissance exploration mapping and sampling of 25 HMX controlled prospects
Collection and analysis of more than 2,500 stream sediment soil and rock chip samples covering more than 170,00 hectares of HMX controlled exploration ground
