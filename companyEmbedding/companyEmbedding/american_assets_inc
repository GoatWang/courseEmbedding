American Asset Mgmt





































 

American Asset Management strives to develop low volatility portfolios that are intended to allow our clients to sleep at night regardless of what is occurring in the stock market. We believe your portfolio should give you the opportunity to make money regardless of whether we are in a bull market or a bear market. A properly allocated portfolio has the potential to control the volatility and provide both the income and growth every client is looking for. Low volatility is the key to remaining fully invested and we believe it can prevent the biggest mistake; buying high and selling low. 
American Asset Management focuses on the investor that understands the following: 


Capital preservation is the most important aspect of any portfolio. 
Your career will provide your wealth. 
You cannot replace your wealth. 
There is a tremendous difference between investing and gambling.
Every retirement portfolio must be designed with the goal of providing you with the income you need
to live on for the rest of your life. 


We endeavor to develop a balanced and diversified portfolio that protects the money you need to live on for the rest of your life. Our portfolio is designed to help your wealth survive any event, including an event that would be devastating to any individual element within the portfolio. In other words, we want your portfolio to protect you no matter what the future brings.  
Every client at American Asset Management has the same goal – capital preservation. They also want their portfolios to grow so they have enough income to live on for the rest of their lives. In an effort to achieve those goals, every client has the same asset allocation and is invested in the same securities.   This enables us to manage every client's account every day. 
All of our client's accounts are held at TD Ameritrade in the client's own name and American Asset Management does not have access to any of the cash in your account. Our job is only to decide what to buy and sell. TD Ameritrade will provide monthly statements, internet access and insure your account for $100 million. Please note, however, that this coverage does not protect clients against a decline in the market value of securities in their portfolios.
As a fee-based financial advisor, American Asset Management, Inc. is committed to providing the comprehensive investment management services required to develop and implement a successful financial plan with the proper asset allocation to achieve your goals. 
You may listen to Mr. Julian Rubinstein, President of American Asset Management, Inc. on the radio at 11:30 AM everyday on 740 WSBR-AM. You can also listen on the web at www.wsbrradio.com.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in California:













Does American Assets Inc carry a valid contracting license?



In California, any remodeling or construction project that exceeds $500 (labor and materials), requires a contractor to have an active license with the California Contractor State License Board (CSLB).
American Assets Inc currently holds license 961121, 736845 (General Building Contractor), which was Active when we last checked.











How important is contractor licensing in California?



The CSLB is one of the highest rated licensing boards in the US. Applicants are required to pass a written board exam and prove at least four years of prior, relevant work experience. In addition, the CSLB requires all license holders to maintain at least $2,500 in operating capital and provides you with a range of other consumer protections.











Your liability risk when hiring American Assets Inc



Contractors in California are required to carry workers' compensation insurance if they have employees and proof of liability insurance with the cumulative limit of $1 million for licensees with five or fewer persons, and an additional 100,000 for each additional member over five, not to exceed $5 million total.











Financial recourse when hiring American Assets Inc



All licensed contractors in California are required to maintain a bond, which provides you with financial recourse in case they perform defective work or violate license regulations. If you feel as though you have been taken advantage of, you should leave feedback on the contractor's BuildZoom profile and file a complaint with the CSLB.
American Assets Inc has a $15,000 bond with International Fidelity Insurance Company. 











What else should I know before hiring American Assets Inc



California contractors are required to submit their fingerprints to the board, which are then checked against criminal records held by the California Department of Justice (DOJ) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) prior to obtaining a valid contracting license.











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



The California State License Board recommends getting at least three written bids before hiring a contractor. Do not automatically accept the lowest bid - an abnormally low bid may indicate the contractor made a mistake and is not including the same work quoted by their competitors. We've made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.
