Vantage Drilling - A Likely Candidate To Go Under In 2017 - Vantage Drilling Company (NYSEMKT:VTG) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Vantage Drilling - A Likely Candidate To Go Under In 2017Mar.20.15 | About: Vantage Drilling (VTG) Streetwise Research Contrarian, small-cap, gold & precious metals, Deep ValueSummaryVantage Drilling is a debt-laden offshore drilling company with the right products at the wrong time.Despite achieving profitability in 2014 after years of losses, the company's $2 billion backlog is depleting fast with no new contracts in sight for 2016.With no new contracts in the following quarters, the company's projected EBITDA in 2016 would not be sufficient to cover the $200 million interest expenses.The company's stock and bond prices have been falling drastically over the past six months, signaling an ominous and uncertain future.Like oil tanker or dry bulk operators, offshore drillers know that their business is notoriously cyclical. Ultra deepwater drilling with high-specification floaters capable of reaching over 10,000 feet has been a new and lucrative business in the past decade. The most well known company capitalizing on the booming business at the outset of the cycle is undoubtedly Seadrill (NYSE:SDRL). The company, incorporated in Oslo in 2005 by Norwegian shipping tycoon John Fredriksen, has been one of the most sought after stocks because investors consistently get about 8% dividend yield during the good times, not to mention the phenomenal gain in capital appreciation. Seadrill's ability to pay generous dividend is primarily due to the exorbitantly high day rates they get from oil majors for their services. Oil companies used to pay Seadrill over half-a-million a day per rig, albeit unwillingly, because there was an acute shortage of modern floaters they needed badly to do deepwater exploration in a cost-effective way. The critical success factor is the company's perfect sense in timing the market.
In any free capitalist economy, when someone starts a lucrative business, there is nothing to prevent copycats from following suit. Among the latecomers to the party are Vantage Drilling (NYSEMKT: VTG), Pacific Drilling (NYSE: PACD), Ocean Rigs (NYSE: ORIG) and North Atlantic Drilling (NYSE:NADL) -- a subsidiary of Seadrill. All four commenced the capital-intensive business within the past eight years. Unfortunately, before they could open champagne bottles to celebrate their genius in duplicating Seadrill's success formula, the party was over. They are now bracing for an unprecedented downturn in their business. This author believes Vantage Drilling would likely become the first victim of the bust cycle.

Leveraged finance works only in good times
Seadrill created an enviable business model when the company started building its modern fleet in the early 2000s. How did it work? It was simple. During that period, the cost of building a top-notch high efficiency drillship with a wide range of new capabilities was around $550 to $600 million. Because of the acute shortage of high spec deepwater floaters, big oil companies were willing to pay half-a-million dollar or more per day to hire any driller with such rigs to do exploration and production for them. Based on these day rates, the gross return on investment per annum was over 30%. Owing to the acute demand and supply imbalance, deepwater drillers were able to secure multi-billion backlogs of long-term contracts long before their rigs left the shipyards. With guaranteed stable income from fat-pocketed oil companies, bankers would have little hesitation in providing these drillers huge loans or revolving credit lines.
Even for start-ups without known financial performance, they could simply issue high-yield notes or convertible bonds to raise funds for their first rig. In an era where investors are craving for yields recklessly, their originations sold like hot cakes. Once the drillers raised enough funds to pay the shipyard and secured a long-term contract with an oil company, banks would start lending to them for the second or third rig order. When times were good, their revenue was so colossal that drillers not only could cover the interest charge with effortless ease but also paid a handsome dividend to their shareholders as in the case of Seadrill or North Atlantic Drilling.
Vantage Drilling was apparently late for the party
Vintage Drilling, a company based in Houston, Texas, incidentally or deliberately, used the same leveraged finance model in building up their brand new fleet. The company has a workforce of about 1,300 people with two regional offices in Dubai and Singapore.
Their fleet size is relatively small compared to peers, comprising four BMC 375 Jackups and four DSME Ultra Deepwater Drillships.

Details of the fleet are as follows:

The timing of their entry into the ultra deepwater arena was supposed to be perfect. After the financial crisis in 2008, Brent crude prices have remained at an elevated level between $90 and $120 per barrel until mid-2014. Most important, their high spec rigs were in great demand among big oil companies or independent explorers.
Vantage Drilling began their operation in 2007 with four jackups. As of today, three are working in shallow waters off the coast of South East Asia whereas the fourth off West Africa. Their current day rates are between $135,000 and $185,000. Their aggregate income is about one quarter of the company's total revenue in 2014.
In 2010, Vantage Drilling contracted out their first fifth-generation drillship Platinum Explorer to India's state-owned Oil and Gas Natural Gas Corporation Limited for a period of 5-year. The day rate was $590,000. In 2012, the company secured an 8-year contract with Brazil's state-owned Petrobras (NYSE: PBR) for its second drillship Titanium Explorer. The average contracted day rate was $556,000. In 2014, their third modern drillship Tungsten Explorer secured a 2-year contract with France's oil major Total (NYSE: TOT). The rig commenced work off the coast of West Africa since mid-2014. The day rate achieved was the highest among the three - at a stunning $667,000.

In 2014, the fleet utilization rate was the best of all time and the historic revenue was ample to cover all the operating, financing and capital investment costs with a profit. However, when the management reported in early March their first annual profit of $42 million in five years, they were not doing it in a joyful mood because the favorable operating environment they have long used to had a surprise turnaround in the past six months. The abrupt change in market sentiments was clearly beyond their expectations. Today they are worrying about their highly leveraged balance sheet, the decreasing backlog and the timing to seal new contracts for the current rigs and the 7th generation drillship being built in South Korea.
The bust cycle is coming fast and severe
No business has a never-ending boom cycle. In the deepwater drilling business, when everybody joins the cause, the supply of new rigs would increase rapidly and substantially. In the event the new supply comes at a time when demand shrinks badly, the bust cycle would begin without mercy. The recent 60% plunge in global crude prices provided a timely trigger for the reverse of the cycle to the downside. The low crude prices forced oil majors to reduce their capital expenditure drastically in the region of 20-30%. In turn, they delayed new offshore drilling projects or squeezed service companies to cut their day rates in current and future contracts. Some even went to the extreme by cancelling signed contracts. The current hardship faced by offshore drillers epitomized the plight of the industry piled under mountains of debts yet without any contract opportunity in sight for their newbuildings or rigs just rolling off expired contracts. It is highly probable that a few would not be able to survive the onslaught of the tough times. This author believes Vantage Drilling would be one of the first to go under.
Debt is root of the problem
Vantage Drilling's high-leverage financing is a typical practice to capitalize on rare opportunities arising from the boom cycle of a capital-intensive business. The practice is highly risky but extremely rewarding if the upswing cycle is long enough to enable companies to use the leveraged cash flow to reduce their debt drastically before the bust cycle arrives. In the case of Vantage Drilling, the worst scenario happens because winter arrives on the first day of their autumn harvest. The predicament was worse due to the aggressive leverage of their modest equity. The following table is self-explanatory.

Valuations are deceptively attractive
The abrupt plunge of global crude prices since last July was definitely the villain that caused so much pain to the oil majors and oil service companies. The market was fully aware of the risks associated with debt-laden companies. Investors who read with care the preceding table would understand why the valuation metrics of these offshore drillers look extremely inexpensive.

The ratios are overwhelmingly low by any standard. At the same time, they are telling investors these companies are inexpensive for a good reason -- severe uncertainties ahead.
Vantage Drilling's prospects are bleak
Look at the stock price chart of Vantage Drilling between 2009 and 2014 and compare it with S & P 500 and the oil equipment and service sector. The divergence from the broad market index and the sub-group index speaks volumes.

Source: Vantage Drilling Annual Report 2014
Vantage Drilling's stock price saw an $8.6 historic high in May 2008. Since then it fell sharply to around $1-2 between 2009 and mid-2014. As global oil prices started sliding since mid-2014, so did the share price. Currently, the stock is trading around $0.3 -- the lowest level since listed in 2007 or an 85% fall from the 52-week high. The stock's price actions suggested that investors had strong fear about the future of the company.

While most Wall Street analysts have a hold recommendation on the stock, the recent free fall of the company's high-yield notes indicated that the bond market was very pessimistic about its financial health. The double-digit yield suggested that Vantage Drilling's bonds were trading at a distressed level. According to a Bloomberg report on 6 March 2015, their bond prices fell about 40% in six months.
Vantage's largest bond, $1.13 billion of 7.5 percent first-lien notes due November 2019, dropped 0.75 cent to 60.75 cents on the dollar to yield 21 percent at 3:46 p.m. in New York, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. The company's $730 million of 7.125 percent secured bonds due April 2023 fell to 60.1 cents to yield 16 percent from 66.3 cents on Feb. 18, according to Trace. Both notes traded around par in September.
Five reasons for extreme pessimism
Despite Vantage Drilling's turnaround from loss to profitability in 2014, the market is currently concerned about its mountain of debts, decreasing backlog and financial sustainability. The total amount of long-term debt on the company's balance sheet at the end of 2014 was $2.63 billion whereas EBITDA was $420 million. The ratio of debt to EBITDA was 6.3, a level considered highly unsustainable if there is no immediate reduction in debt or increase in earnings in the near future. Knowing that it would be extremely unlikely to increase earnings because of the poor market environment, Vantage Drilling worked very hard to reduce debts. In 2014 alone, the management retired about $200 million of debt by either repaying part of the loans or repurchasing high-yield corporate notes in the open market.


Source: Vantage Drilling Annual Report 2014
By the end of the first quarter of 2015, the company forecast an extra reduction of another $50 million debt. In the February presentation at "JP Morgan 2015 Global High Yield and Leveraged Finance Conference", the company said the "cash flow from operations projected would cover all debt service through 2018". The first debt maturities would occur in 2017 and the peak would come in 2019. Here is what they presented at the conference.

This author maintained the management appeared to be over optimistic about their future earning capability without giving full consideration of the near-term poor job visibility and additional debt and interest burden brought about by the new drillship Cobalt Explorer in 2016.
Current backlog is unlikely to service the 2017 debt
At the end of 2014, the total backlog stood at $2.1 billion. By the end of March 2015, it would have reduced to about $2 billion. The backlog for 2015 was fine even though weakness has showed up in the jackups. By the end of the year, all the four jackups would have rolled off their existing contracts.

The backlog in 2016 did not look promising. In fact, it is bad among the peers.

Based on the current backlog, Vantage Drilling would be able to generate in 2015 total revenue of about $770 million. The EBITDA would be around $380 million, which is ample to cover the $210 million interest expenses, the second shipyard payment of $60 million for Cobalt Explorer, income tax, lease obligations and some debt repayments. Nonetheless, 2016 does not look promising at all.

Source: Vantage Drilling Annual Report 2014
Year 2016 is the critical moment
In 2016, three happenings would determine the fate of Vantage Drilling. The first is whether the company could fetch new contracts for the four jackups and drillship Platinum Explorer all of which would be "out of job" by end of 2015. The second is whether the management could seal a commercially viable long-term contract for the new drillship Cobalt Explorer before it leaves the shipyard in early 2016. The third and final one is whether financially troubled Petrobras might force the company to reduce Titanium Explorer's prevailing day rates in the midst of the 8-year contract.
New backlog is imperative for survival
Given the highly leveraged balance sheet, the interest burden on the company was immense. Based on the company's 2012, 2013 and 2014 financial statements, annual interest expenses made up 31.6%, 29.3% and 24.4% of its total revenue respectively. Despite the company's efforts to pay off part of the debts since 2013, core debts would remain around $2.5 billion by 2016.

The income, expenditure and debt patterns in the past three years had been reasonably stable for the company and represented the maximum earning capability of the current fleet at almost full utilization rate. The EDITDA was roughly about 48% of the annual income.
As of today, the projected income from existing backlog for 2016 was $396.3 million (see the previous table on Revenues Contracted in 2015 and 2016). The amount primarily came from the two drillships contracted to Petrobras and Total. The estimated EBITDA would be about $190 million. The sad fact is the free cash would be insufficient to cover the $210 million interest, not to mention tax provision or debt repayment. This is how dire the financial situation would be for the company if no new contracts add to the current backlog in 2016. I do not see how the company could pay the outstanding $400 million debts in 2017 unless the fleet could achieve 100% utilization in 2016 and beyond. Otherwise, default would be a likely scenario.
Almost zero job visibility in the market
At the past quarterly earnings conference calls of key deepwater drillers, three common themes emerged. First, jobs were rare and oil companies were unwilling to offer any tender opportunity until the very last minute. Second, bids for any tender were extremely competitive. Day rates were about 30-40% below the peak times while contract period became relatively short. Third, some oil companies, particularly National Oil Companies, started asking for pricing concessions in existing contracts or outright cancelled signed contracts.
Paul Bragg, Chairman and CEO of Vantage Drilling, painted a very gloomy picture of the rig supply situation as well as job opportunities for offshore drillers. In the 2014 annual report, the company predicted that the total number of jackups to be delivered in 2015 and 2016 would be 123 whereas drillships 54. The current meager demand could by no means absorb the new supply. Bragg said there was almost zero visibility in the market.


It seems apparent to me that customer spending or more precisely, lack of spending is being driven more by desire to obtain pricing concessions from the supplier base. Basically, the thought pattern would be well, if we wait longer, the competition is going to be more intense and the price is going to be lower.
As a result, there are almost no visible fixtures or tendering opportunities in the marketplace. The drop in activity is extreme and it is not consistent with just reduced spending whether our customers are going to reduce their spending about 15%, 25% or 35%, we are actually seeing tendering activities that approaches zero.

Given the relatively small size of the company and the fleet, Vantage Drilling would be at a very disadvantageous position in such a depressed market environment. To make things worse, oil majors would surely prefer drilling contractors with a sound balance sheet and the most advanced newbuildings fresh from the shipyard. The recent award of a $545 million contract by the Italian oil company ENI (NYS: EE) to Maersk Drilling for their newest drillship at an average day rate of $426,00o is a case in point. Vantage Drilling's current attempt to secure a contract for Cobalt Explorer at a good price would be a big challenge, not to mention the 5-year old Platinum Explorer. Without any new job in 2016, the company would be in deep trouble.
Cobalt Explorer is a big headache
The company announced early this year that they would put off the second shipyard payment for Cobalt Explorer until July. The new delivery date would postpone to the first quarter of 2016. Bragg was adamant at the previous conference call that unless they could seal a contract for the state-of-the-art drillship at a commercially sound day rate and for a reasonably long period, they would prefer the rig to stay at the shipyard.
We do not anticipate that we would undertake delivery of the unit without a contract of sufficient economic value to justify the addition, giving consideration to financing alternatives. As such, the delivery of the unit may not occur unless there has been some recovery in conditions and we are successful in contracting the unit.

Bragg's hold-on strategy had good reasons. It was all about mathematics. The delivery of Cobalt Explorer "without a contract of sufficient economic value" would undoubtedly exert extra debt and interest burden on the company. It was clear that the company would use debt financing to settle the $476 million final shipyard payment. Given the company's current debt profile, the interest rate charged by any lender would be on the high side probably 9-10%. The annual interest would be around $45 million or about $120,000 a day. Given the daily operating cost for a drillship is about $280,000, the total cost would add up to at least $400,000 per day. Therefore, it is apparent that any deal with a day rate below $400,000 does not make business sense to Bragg. Nonetheless, the harsh reality was that most recent contract awarded to Maersk Drilling is mere $426,000. Hence, Cobalt Explorer was indeed a big headache to Bragg. The following paragraph in the company's 2014 annual report summed up the dilemma in the most succinct way:
We are currently pursuing drilling contracts for the Cobalt Explorer, and the timing and extent of any such contracts is a significant factor that will affect our financing alternatives, which may have a significant impact on our liquidity position in 2015. We expect to fund the balance of the purchase price of the Cobalt Explorer by debt financing, which we may not be able to accomplish on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.
Concession requests from Petrobras would be detrimental
The 8-year contract with Petrobras has virtually become the cornerstone of Vantage Drilling's current backlog (over 70%). Any request for renegotiation of terms or rates would be a great blow to the company because the annual $200 million income from the contract ending in 2010 was the most visible and reliable revenue in the years ahead. Petrobras recently pulled off contracts from Seadrill and Transocean (NYSE: RIG) though Fitch Ratings believed a large-scale renegotiation exercise with current contractors was unlikely.

In case such a request happens, regardless the extent of concessions, the market would react violently and create a lot of volatility for the company's stock and bond prices. This may become the last straw breaking the camel's back.
Vantage Drilling is an ideal short
Recently there has been a spate of bad news surrounding offshore drillers and the continuing over supply of crude worldwide. At present, there are no signs of price stability. Supply is still at all time high.

Source: EIA, Baker Hughes
Unless global crude prices become stable in the next few quarters, oil companies would withhold their capital expenditure investments and the uncertainty of offshore drillers would continue to intensify.
During the bad times, highly leveraged companies would experience the greatest challenges. Vantage Drilling is no exception. Besides the debt burden, there are two other factors affecting the market's perception of the company. One is the on-going $2 billion lawsuits with the company's former director and largest shareholder, Nobu Su. The litigation would prevent any interested parties from buying into or acquiring the company even when the management may consider a strategic review. The other factor is the frequent insider selling by senior members of the management team when the company is in troubled waters.

Source: MarketWatch.com
These two factors alone would make any white knight think twice or thrice in the event that the company calls for help. In the following three quarters before the end of 2015, if there were no new backlog added, the company would be heading for a bad ending. To conclude, the "Hold" recommendation by analysts has been too lenient. Consider selling or shorting this stock whenever there is a rebound.
