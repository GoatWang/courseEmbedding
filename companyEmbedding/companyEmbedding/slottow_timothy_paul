Timothy P. Slottow is a leader in the higher education industry. He is the seventh president of the University of Phoenix, appointed in June 2014 by the institution's Board of Trustees after 16 years at the University of Michigan.
Slottow was appointed president of the University of Phoenix on June 20, 2014. In 2015, his opening message of the newly published Academic Annual Report, he wrote that “The purpose of this report is to provide a picture of the institution today and to outline areas for progress tomorrow,” said University of Phoenix President Tim Slottow. “It describes our vision and approach to higher education. It outlines our challenges. It defines some of the characteristics of our students, our academic programs, and our faculty. This is an incredibly exciting time for University of Phoenix and I am thrilled to be part of it. I hope that everyone committed to improving higher education in America will take a closer look at who we are, how we educate and what we accomplish.”[1]
In October 2015, Slottow wrote to an open letter to alumni of the University of Phoenix after the U.S. Department of Defense placed its MOU with the school in probationary status.[2]
Slottow has published his views of University of Phoenix in Inside Higher Ed, including his view in response to columnist Matt Reed's column[3] about whether the University was a "good" school.[4] He also wrote about the White House College Scorecard upon data released in September 2015.[5]

Education[edit]
After high school, Slottow went to UC Berkeley. Alongside his studies, he performed as a gymnast. He graduated from UC Berkeley with a bachelor’s degree and later earned an M.B.A. from the University of Washington.[6][7]
After college, he went to work in various positions at Amtrak, the city of Seattle, and Accenture.[7]
Business career[edit]
In 1998, he was hired as the executive vice president and CFO at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.[7][8] At the University of Michigan, Slottow managed thousands of employees and served as the leader and manager of building construction, IT services, investment management, and HR.[6] He steered the University of Michigan during the recession, managing a $6.5 billion budget and a $16 billion asset portfolio.[9]
While at Michigan, Slottow intervened in a major dispute between the university and Coca-Cola about alleged human rights violations. Slottow supported, and ultimately won, an investigation into Coca-Cola’s labor practices. In late 2005 and early 2006, UofM stopped buying Coca-Cola products. Allegations surfaced about alleged human rights violations by Coca-Cola. The University requested that Coca-Cola audit the alleged violations, but the company refused. After four months of suspended contracts between UofM and Coca-Cola, Slottow worked with the university’s administration to resume contracts with Coca-Cola in exchange for independent investigations into the alleged violations. A branch of the United Nations (the International Labour Organization) was one of the organizations that agreed to investigate the labor practices. In his public letter to Coca-Cola, which Slottow co-wrote with another Michigan executive, he said “We respect the reputation and track record of ILO in advancing the rights of workers around the world.”[10]
An article about Slottow in the University of Michigan’s student newspaper, The Michigan Daily, praised Slottow for “wide-ranging responsibility for a $5.2 billion enterprise”[6] and said “Timothy Slottow couldn’t be more of an exception.”[6]
In 2014, he was hired to run the University of Phoenix. After he announced his departure from Ann Arbor, the president of the University of Michigan publicly praised one of his greatest accomplishments during his tenure: growing the University of Michigan endowment fund to $8.4 billion.[8] At the University of Michigan, Slottow oversaw operating revenues, financial and physical assets.[11]
Personal life[edit]
Slottow is married to Marie Slottow/ For his “silver” wedding anniversary (25 years), Slottow danced with his wife—a competitive ballroom dancer—at the Michigan Theater for a benefit for the Make-a-Wish Foundation.[6]

Timothy P. Slottow is a leader in the higher education industry. He is the seventh president of the University of Phoenix, appointed in June 2014 by the institution's Board of Trustees after 16 years at the University of Michigan.
Slottow was appointed president of the University of Phoenix on June 20, 2014. In 2015, his opening message of the newly published Academic Annual Report, he wrote that “The purpose of this report is to provide a picture of the institution today and to outline areas for progress tomorrow,” said University of Phoenix President Tim Slottow. “It describes our vision and approach to higher education. It outlines our challenges. It defines some of the characteristics of our students, our academic programs, and our faculty. This is an incredibly exciting time for University of Phoenix and I am thrilled to be part of it. I hope that everyone committed to improving higher education in America will take a closer look at who we are, how we educate and what we accomplish.”[1]
In October 2015, Slottow wrote to an open letter to alumni of the University of Phoenix after the U.S. Department of Defense placed its MOU with the school in probationary status.[2]
Slottow has published his views of University of Phoenix in Inside Higher Ed, including his view in response to columnist Matt Reed's column[3] about whether the University was a "good" school.[4] He also wrote about the White House College Scorecard upon data released in September 2015.[5]

Education[edit]
After high school, Slottow went to UC Berkeley. Alongside his studies, he performed as a gymnast. He graduated from UC Berkeley with a bachelor’s degree and later earned an M.B.A. from the University of Washington.[6][7]
After college, he went to work in various positions at Amtrak, the city of Seattle, and Accenture.[7]
Business career[edit]
In 1998, he was hired as the executive vice president and CFO at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.[7][8] At the University of Michigan, Slottow managed thousands of employees and served as the leader and manager of building construction, IT services, investment management, and HR.[6] He steered the University of Michigan during the recession, managing a $6.5 billion budget and a $16 billion asset portfolio.[9]
While at Michigan, Slottow intervened in a major dispute between the university and Coca-Cola about alleged human rights violations. Slottow supported, and ultimately won, an investigation into Coca-Cola’s labor practices. In late 2005 and early 2006, UofM stopped buying Coca-Cola products. Allegations surfaced about alleged human rights violations by Coca-Cola. The University requested that Coca-Cola audit the alleged violations, but the company refused. After four months of suspended contracts between UofM and Coca-Cola, Slottow worked with the university’s administration to resume contracts with Coca-Cola in exchange for independent investigations into the alleged violations. A branch of the United Nations (the International Labour Organization) was one of the organizations that agreed to investigate the labor practices. In his public letter to Coca-Cola, which Slottow co-wrote with another Michigan executive, he said “We respect the reputation and track record of ILO in advancing the rights of workers around the world.”[10]
An article about Slottow in the University of Michigan’s student newspaper, The Michigan Daily, praised Slottow for “wide-ranging responsibility for a $5.2 billion enterprise”[6] and said “Timothy Slottow couldn’t be more of an exception.”[6]
In 2014, he was hired to run the University of Phoenix. After he announced his departure from Ann Arbor, the president of the University of Michigan publicly praised one of his greatest accomplishments during his tenure: growing the University of Michigan endowment fund to $8.4 billion.[8] At the University of Michigan, Slottow oversaw operating revenues, financial and physical assets.[11]
Personal life[edit]
Slottow is married to Marie Slottow/ For his “silver” wedding anniversary (25 years), Slottow danced with his wife—a competitive ballroom dancer—at the Michigan Theater for a benefit for the Make-a-Wish Foundation.[6]

University of Phoenix Announces Timothy P. Slottow as New University President
By : UOPX News
| April 1, 2014










PHOENIX, April 1, 2014 (4pmEDT)– University of Phoenix today announced that the institution's board of trustees has named Timothy P. Slottow as the new president of the University. Slottow's distinguished career spans 30 years at public and private organizations throughout the U.S. He currently serves as executive vice president and chief financial officer at the University of Michigan, where he is responsible for operations and finance. Since 1998, Slottow's work at the University of Michigan—one of the nation's largest public universities—has helped the institution fulfill its academic mission and strategy on behalf of 61,000 students and 44,000 faculty and staff. He will assume office at University of Phoenix on June 20, 2014. "Tim Slottow's leadership at the University of Michigan amplifies what he has done throughout his accomplished career: delivering measurable results to public and private organizations as they embrace the principle of continuous advancement and transition to reach ambitious goals," said Merrilee Lewis Engel, Ph.D., Chair of the University of Phoenix board of trustees. "After a comprehensive national search, we are honored to have Tim Slottow join us from one of the world's most respected higher education institutions," said Gregory W. Cappelli, member of the University of Phoenix board of trustees, and CEO of Apollo Education Group, Inc. "Tim shares our commitment to the mission of University of Phoenix, and to delivering a quality education that helps students achieve academic and personal success to meet their individual and professional goals. I am confident that his focus on connecting students' talents, skills, and educational achievement to employers' ever-increasing human capital needs will help differentiate University of Phoenix and deliver genuine value to its students." "For decades, University of Phoenix has pioneered change throughout U.S. higher education, and I am honored to lead this groundbreaking and innovative university through its latest and most significant transformation," said Slottow. "I am committed to furthering the University's important work to deliver high quality, career-relevant educational programs that help all students achieve—and exceed—their professional goals." In his current position at the University of Michigan, Slottow supervises and is responsible for the university's $6.3 billion annual operating revenues and more than $16 billion in financial and physical assets. "Tim Slottow has played an integral role in the University's growth and financial stability throughout the recession, ensuring the University of Michigan's academic excellence as he worked in partnership with our academic and university leaders," said University of Michigan president Mary Sue Coleman. Prior to his work at the University of Michigan, Slottow oversaw strategic business planning and finance at Amtrak in Washington, D.C.; served as director of policy and planning for the City of Seattle; and was a manager at Accenture (formerly Andersen Consulting). He earned a master's degree in business administration from University of Washington and a bachelor's degree from University of California, Berkeley. As the seventh University of Phoenix president, Slottow succeeds Bill Pepicello, Ph.D., who began his tenure at the University in 1995 and announced his intention to retire in September 2013. ABOUT UNIVERSITY OF PHOENIX University of Phoenix is constantly innovating to help working adults move more efficiently and effectively from education to careers in a rapidly changing world. Flexible schedules, relevant and engaging courses, and interactive learning utilizing advanced technology can help students more effectively pursue career and personal aspirations while balancing their busy lives. As a subsidiary of Apollo Education Group, Inc. (Nasdaq: APOL), University of Phoenix serves a truly diverse student population, offering associate, bachelor's, master's and doctoral degree programs from campuses and learning centers across the U.S. as well as online throughout the world.
