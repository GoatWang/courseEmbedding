Every single one has given this firm the maximum rating possible. That fact alone should reason enough for anyone with a traumatic life event occur that was not their fault to have Kalka and Baer work for them.    I was severely injured in a car accident due to absolutely no fault of my own. After reading amazing praise from reviewers on a few legal sites I decided to call them. Upon first meeting with Anthony Kalka at my home, as I was bed-ridden, he instantly made me feel relaxed. Mr Kalka and the other members of the firm throughout my dealings with them were always well informed, courteous, helpful beyond expectations. I also never felt pressured by them to do anything I didn't think was right and felt in control of my case. Nor was there any time that I could not reach Tony personally If had any questions. Due to the unbelievable work that Kalka and Baer did preparing for mediation with the insurance company, the proceedings went better than I could have ever dreamed. Mr. Kalka provided video testimony, detailed medical drawings, expert opinions, and a demand letter that was perfect. Thanks to these things and my legal team's diligence, I reached a settlement that was light years away from what I would have received from the insurance company without Kalka and Baer's help. I can't overstate how awesome these people are. If my review and every other perfectly scored review on this site don't convince you to have Kalka and Baer work for you, then I wish you good luck. Because you will not find a law firm that will do the things the wonderful people here will do for you and your case. Dewoskin Law Firmgenar. ratedWow, Where do I begin? How about... that I am truly “thrilled” with the outcome of my debt collection lawsuit!Thanks to the diligence and professionalism of Dan DeWoskin and his tireless and insightful paralegal, Jill Sheridan, I can finally rest with funds still in the bank. I honestly tried fighting my lawsuit on my own, Pro Se, but soon realized that I had wasted much needed energy and time and would most likely suffer wage garnishment, without the help of a lawyer. Luckily, while attending a free Consumer Education Clinic on Debt Collection in Decatur, GA, I met Dan DeWoskin and Jill Sheridan volunteering at the event. There, they took an interest in my case, and helped me to understand and navigate the web of the litigation process.  By the time I left the Clinic, I realized that they are truly for the consumer, and had scheduled a consultation with Dan that very next day! The consultation was informative, thorough, and reassuring. My case was broken down step by step, with all the possible outcomes clearly explained. Dan and Jill also kept me informed with phone calls and emails throughout the process, all the way down to the Dismissal with Prejudice. There is NO DOUBT that without the help and expertise of Dan DeWoskin and Jill Sheridan the outcome of my case would have been drastically different. Thanks again Dan and Jill, I will be recommending you to my family friends and co-workers throughout the state of Georgia!!Gena - Debt Defense Client - Conyers, GAKalka & Baer LLCRonnie H. ratedMy experience working with Tony Kalka and Alfred Evans at Kalka & Baer LLC, has truly been a blessing.  The process was seamless. When I initially had the accident I didn’t think I would need an attorney. As the pain continued to progress to the point where I needed numerous procedures, I went to AVVO.com to make sure I selected the right firm. Skeptical about dealing with attorneys from past experiences, I met with several attorneys before actually selecting one. Since the day I signed the retainer with Tony and Alfred I had not one concern with the advice or service. They make a remarkable team.  They were always available, very knowledgeable, and professional. They made sure they were very thorough and explained every little detail. They were very personable and empathetic, which was exhibited throughout the case. When it came down to structuring my settlement, they put me in the perfect position and they were very transparent and diligent, in not just getting the best settlement offer, but also reducing my liability such as medical bills, etc. This firm is very well respected in the industry and because of that they were able to settle my case within the first 30 days of the demand letter.  Before you select any attorney, meet with Tony and Alfred at Kalka & Baer LLC and I am sure you will go with this firm, and understand why they are among the most respected and prestigious lawyers and law firm in the Greater Atlanta Area.      ~ Ron H. Atlanta, GAKalka & Baer LLCMike T. ratedFrom the beginning, 7 days after my accident, Tony Kalka was the most professional and concerned attorney I had spoke with. Due to my injuries, Mr. Kalka met with me at my home. He was very candid and open with me, and no question I had went unanswered. Immediately I felt comfortable with him.My case went on for the better part of a year, all the while, he and his associates worked on building my case. Tony was also very instrumental in assisting me with managing my finances and getting the best medical care at the time. The due diligence exemplified by Tony Kalka and his staff is top notch, and, I feel, unsurpassed by not a single law firm in the Atlanta, or surrounding area! I owe total success in the case to his patience and understanding of all the intricacies involved with my accident. His knowledgeable staff is friendly and on top of everything. The efforts put forth by Tony and his colleagues allowed me to concentrate on my physical and mental recovery. I placed it all in his hands, and I was not let down!I have grown to look at Tony as a friend, and will use Kalka and Baer law firm in an instant in the future. Tony will not let you down; if you go in open minded, listen to what he says and follow his direction. I have and will continue to recommend Kalka and Baer as the premier injury trial attorneys in this region!Dewoskin Law Firmcline.mark ratedI am pleased to offer this recommendation for the Dewoskin Law Firm.  I recently had the misfortune of being subject to a claim/dispute brought in Dekalb County, Georgia.   As a non-Georgia resident, this served to further exacerbate an already multi-faceted and complex litigation.  Considerations of jurisdiction and venue further compounded our defense strategies, making an efficient use of time and resource management paramount.  Undaunted by the size or reputation of opposing counsel’s firm, Attorney Dewoskin and his team, worked tirelessly as dedicated advocates.  Throughout the entire litigation process, Dan Dewoskin and Jill Sheridan were most responsive – oftentimes responding to my emails and phone calls from different time-zones, after business hours and/or during weekends.  In the face of a very aggressive and ardent opposition, The Dewoskin Firm, possessed the skill set, dedication and experience to protect my interests in this transaction.  The marriage of skill coupled with the efficient use of all available resources, led to a victorious resolution. The Dewoskin team was very compassionate and supportive, providing me with an unparalleled and assertive representation.   I am very happy to have entrusted them with this matter.   Dewoskin Law Firmnmarie.79 ratedI recently found myself in the need for legal representation due to a meritless debt collection lawsuit. I met with three lawyers prior to contacting DeWoskin Law Firm and all three meetings left me more desperate and confused. I called Dan’s office from the parking lot of another firm and we spoke for twenty minutes. I instantly knew DeWoskin Law Firm was going to be my choice. Dan was confident and it was evident he knew his stuff. We scheduled a meeting later that day to discuss my case in more detail. Upon arriving, I met Jill Sheridan, his paralegal. Jill was such a breath of fresh air. While waiting for Dan to return from court, she explained the process and put my nerves at ease. I provided all the documentation I had and left everything else up to them. Dan and Jill are definitely there for the consumer.  They always kept me up-to-date and I was thrilled to receive a call from Dan letting me know we won. If I ever need legal representation again they will definitely have my business.Natalie B. – Hiram, GAMedical Malpractice Attorneys Kaufman & Associates PCR G. ratedAfter being seriously injured in a rear end collision, I knew that I needed a great attorney to stop my insurance company from harassing me. After speaking with my colleagues, I made the best decision ever and chose Jeff Kaufman at Kaufman Law.Jeff and his staff were always caring and professional throughout my ordeal of surgeries, physical therapy, missed work, financial hardships, etc. Jeff even knew before my doctor realized, that the damage to my arm had resulted in CRPS.There was never a time that I called Jeff or sent him an email that he didn't immediately respond and he never made me feel that I was an interruption when I discussed my fears with him. Finally, Jeff and his team negotiated a $600,000 verdict  for my medical bills and pain & suffering. I highly recommend this exception attorney to anyone who needs a compassionate professional to assist them with any personal injury case.Moran & AssociatesTiffany N. ratedMy fiancé and I would like to extend a huge THANK YOU to Mr. Mike Moran for your sincere hospitality. Our experience with him was excellent. My fiancé was facing years in prison on four very serious felony charges. He was also a convicted felon currently on felony probation. Mr. Moran was very honest about the situation. He explained everything to us and made us feel very comfortable and welcomed. He is very down to earth but really professional all at the same time. Mr. Moran was able to get three of the charges dismissed and the four charge the judge basically gave my fiancé a slap on the wrist. That alone let us know that Mr. Moran is very well qualified and respected within his legal community. After the case we closed he also handle other legal issue for my fiancé free of charge. .Since then we have recommend him to family and friends. Again Thank you so much Mr. Moran Kalka & Baer LLCBarbara R. ratedBeing involved in an auto accident is mentally and emotionally draining not to mention any physical injuries one suffers and the financial impact that occurs as a result of injuries. My car was totaled.  I was injured and the other party was at fault with no valid driver's license and was an illegal alien.  The stress of my accident was completely relieved when I contacted and worked with Kalka & Baer, specifically, Alfred Evans.  He handled EVERYTHING  for me. He is the consummate professional keeping me informed all along the way until my case was settled...and to my complete satisfaction. At settlement Alfred made sure there would be no future repercussions for me too. I could now put this terrible experience behind me. Kalka & Baer far exceeded my expectations...and they are just the nicest people you'd want to meet.  I highly recommend them.Kalka & Baer LLCPatricia T. ratedBryan Baer handled my case personally and was awesome!! I read a lot of reviews n have personal acquaintances that say it takes years to get ur money. But not with these guys!! He got the insurance co to write a check ASAP for car damages and then just a few short months received another for personal injury! The guy that hit me had the minimal pay out so getting money from something that isnt there is like pulling teeth BUT this guy knows what he's doing and would have gone after the guy personally had he not been a 24yr old living with parents n no assets!! So he found other alternatives to get me even more AND got my Grady bill lowered from $36,000 to $18,000 for a maximum pay out that I didn't expect at all!!! AND ALL of this was done in a matter of MONTHS NOT YEARS!!! THIS GUY IS AWESOME!!Did You Know?Types of AttorneysThe legal profession is vast, with each attorney having his or her specialties. Here are some of the most common attorneys individuals seek out when they require legal aid:Criminal Lawyer
A criminal defense lawyer is probably the attorney the average person imagines. Criminal attorneys are the men and women who defend individuals accused of a crime. The lawyer may work pro bono - for the public good - so the accused is certain to have representation, even if he or she cannot afford an attorney.Criminal lawyers are experts in the criminal justice system. They help their clients decide how to plead when first charged by the police and guide them through trial procedures. Defense lawyers must use every bit of their knowledge and resources to get their clients the fairest results from criminal proceedings.Business Lawyer
If you are a small business owner or the head of a larger corporation, you may come into contact with a business lawyer. Many big companies keep a legal staff on payroll to deal with the daily operations of running and maintaining a large enterprise. Business lawyers may have more specific specialties like copyright law, product liability and mergers and acquisitions.Business attorneys may focus their practices on certain industries. There are entertainment lawyers to guide artists through royalties and media contracts, while hospitals employ malpractice attorneys to protect doctors from aggressive litigation.Employment Lawyer
When you work for a company, you may find yourself in need of an employment lawyer - especially if the relationship between you and your employer sours. An employment attorney prevents people from losing their jobs due to unfair reasons. Workers' compensation lawyers help maintain safe employment conditions and ensure workers receive fair compensation after workplace injury or discrimination.Finance Lawyer
A personal finance attorney can protect and manage your investments and securities. You may use a finance lawyer to help you prepare your taxes, but you might be better off working with an accountant. A tax attorney is more commonly contacted after a business or individual runs into trouble with the IRS or state regulators.Real Estate Lawyer
Your family may keep a lawyer on retainer to guide you through the major expenses that come up in life. When buying a home, you could work with a real estate lawyer to make sure you get the best deal and won't get taken advantage of by tricky mortgage agreements or unfair landlords. An estate attorney can help you plan for the worst by creating a will and preparing your finances for after your death.Bankruptcy Lawyer
A bankruptcy lawyer is essential to help you resolve your financial difficulties when they start to spin out of control. Certain attorneys help create strategies to bring you out of debt and speak to your creditors. A lawyer can advise you on which type of bankruptcy you should file for.Civil Lawyer
If you are suing someone or being sued, you need a civil lawyer. Civil attorneys - and criminal lawyers - are the legal representatives who argue on your behalf in a courtroom setting. Civil lawyers may represent you on matters of business, finance or a wide variety of other specialized needs.One of the most common types of civil attorneys is a personal injury lawyer. When you're hurt by an outside party and you would like to hold them legally responsible, a personal injury attorney conducts litigation and negotiates settlements to compensate for your pain and suffering. Sometimes many wronged people will join together with a single civil lawyer or law office to form a class action lawsuit.Family/Divorce Lawyer
Most people will turn to a lawyer during a divorce to navigate the emotionally charged legal proceedings. A divorce attorney can assist in determining grounds for separation, division of property and custody of children.Family attorneys deal with much more personal matters. If you're getting married, a family lawyer can help you prepare a prenuptial agreement or other family planning paperwork such as adoption or inheritance documents.Questions One Should Ask a Lawyer Before Hiring ThemTo ensure you find a competent attorney who won't abuse your trust or drain your finances, you have to make the proper inquiries. There are several questions you should ask, but the majority will fall under three general topics:Training and Experience Questions
One of the best ways to determine quality is to examine an attorney's history. When you first step into a lawyer's office, you should check for the appropriate certifications and diplomas. You have to ask how long he or she has practiced law and request information that demonstrates the practice's success. Look for precise details such as percentage of cases settled out of court.Once you inquire about the broad details of their legal career, you should ask questions about their experience that pertains to your specific issue. You should ask how many similar cases they have handled and if they have special skills or training that applies specifically to your needs. Lawyers can't mention clients by name, but you should ask for basic details about identical past cases.Financial Questions
You need to ask about every possible fee that will come up when working with an attorney. You should request a list of all costs in advance so you won't be surprised by additional expenses like overhead. Also determine exactly when you will start being billed. You want to inspect paperwork carefully. If the attorney charges you for his or her experience, you need to make sure he or she will perform tasks personally and not hand it off to an assistant.Find out if the attorney has a flat fee or charges by the hour. Many civil lawyers work on contingency. Whatever the payment plan, make inquiries about how the lawyer plans to provide service for your money and what you can do if you start to feel unsatisfied with his or her performance.Lawyer/Client Relationship Questions
When you hire a lawyer, you're agreeing to work with someone over a certain period of time. You need to ask questions about how the attorney will communicate with you and what responsibilities you hold in the relationship. The attorney should let you know the best channel for quick communication and you need to inform him or her when you want updates.You should also ask questions to get to know the attorney as an individual in order to ensure this is a person you can trust. Ask about their legal philosophy and how he or she views the lawyer/client relationship. Great questions to start off with are ones that will make your life easier, such as how to keep fees down or what daily disruptions you should expect from a long legal battle. The more forthcoming the lawyer appears to be with individual needs, the better.Top Reasons to Hire a LawyerYou may keep a lawyer on retainer or you could turn to an attorney during specific situations. Here are some common reasons people begin seeking legal representation or advice:You Know Your Limitations
If you sign documents and you come across a word you don't recognize, you need assistance. You may need a third party to help you navigate important employment or real estate paperwork. It's essential you fully understand the terms of any legally binding documentation or activity you become a part of. If you are not an expert in a given field, you'll want to hire an attorney who is.A lawyer may find legal implications or opportunities you might miss. If you find yourself in a civil or criminal matter, a proper attorney ensures you don't receive a harsh punishment for a small mistake.You're Facing an Important Event/Decision
When making decisions critical to your financial stability or personal life, you may want a lawyer with expertise in your situation to make sure you do everything you can to arrive at the proper resolution. This is especially true when you become involved in a criminal case and your freedom is on the line.It's not just a matter of legal knowledge; lawyer's have access to numerous resources you do not. They have staff ready to work around the clock and experts in a variety of fields to give your important issues the attention they deserve.You Can't Be Impartial
During times when personal matters intersect with legal proceedings, you may need to have an advocate to prevent your emotions from getting in the way of level-headed thinking. For example, divorce lawyers can mediate a heated argument and help both partners get on with their lives.Emotional investment could be subtle. You may want to have a lawyer look over an investment opportunity that looks too good to be true or investigate the merits of a possible civil suit when you feel wronged.You're Out of Options
Many people turn to lawyers when they are in trouble. If you've been accused of a crime or are in a terrible financial situation, you can find an attorney who will work with what you have available to assist you as you deal with your problems.Personal injury lawyers find solutions for people who can no longer work under their own power and bankruptcy attorneys prevent people from giving in to debt. If you find yourself in a situation where you can't find a solution, a lawyer may be able to offer the counsel you need.How to Choose a LawyerWhen it comes time to choose a lawyer, you should start by searching close to home. While you probably don't want the conflict of interest that comes from being represented by a family member, friends and loved ones can recommend lawyers who served them well in the past. If you do have attorneys you are familiar with, ask who they believe would be best for you.After going through personal references - especially from individuals who had similar needs - you should broaden your search through public information resources. You can call your area's attorney referral service or check legal organizations like Martindale-Hubbell. There are other resources available online. You should check websites for client reviews and other third-party forms of approval.When you build a list of possible candidates, perform a background check on each one. See if you can find information on their history and success record. Once you find a possible lawyer, you should call to arrange a consultation so you can ask your important questions in person.By performing the necessary research and taking every available precaution, you can narrow your search to the attorney most suited to your needs.

											EPUB
										

A leading Reformation scholar historically reassesses the original breadth of Luther's theology of the two kingdoms and the cultural contexts from which it emerged.




Description


										The concept of God's two kingdoms was foundational to Luther and subsequent Lutheran theology. Since the middle of the nineteenth century, that concept has been understood primarily as a political concept. But is a political reading of the two kingdoms a perversion of Luther's teaching?Leading Reformation scholar William Wright contends that those who read Luther politically and see in Luther a compartmentalized approach to Christian life are misreading the Reformer. Wright reassesses the original breadth of Luther's theology of the two kingdoms and the cultural contexts from which it emerged. He argues that Luther's two-kingdom worldview was not a justification for living irresponsibly on planet earth.
