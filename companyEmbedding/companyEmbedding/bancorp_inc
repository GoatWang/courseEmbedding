You may not have heard a lot about us. And that’s by design.

From the start, we’ve spent most of our time and efforts behind the scenes, putting the companies who work with us - and their goals - first. We’ve remained in the background, offering them the guidance, innovative thinking, and operational support they need to succeed. Whether expanding business, increasing profitability, bringing existing financial products to new audiences or creating entirely new financial products and services –take a close look behind some of the world’s most successful companies: that’s where you’ll find The Bancorp.
Today we’ve grown far from our roots as a branchless commercial bank to become a true financial services leader, offering private-label banking and technology solutions to non-bank companies ranging from entrepreneurial start-ups to those on the Fortune 500. Over the years, our strategic focus on a handful of high-growth financial service sectors such as Payments, Health Benefit Banking, Institutional Banking, and Specialized Lending has resulted in tremendous organizational growth and widespread recognition. We now comprise a diverse team that includes bankers, business strategists, fintech experts, software developers, program managers, regulatory advisors, information security specialists and category thought leaders, all eager to provide their wide-ranging expertise in new and innovative ways. No other organization does what we do. And no other organization delivers what we can deliver.

Comprised of some of the most respected leaders in the payments industry, our leadership team brings decades of experience and a history of innovation to each and every project.

 Merchant Services
            









A leading payments processor licensed by Visa®, MasterCard®, Discover®, Star®, NYCE®, PULSE®, Maestro®, Accell®, AFFM® and UnionPay®, we make it possible for growing mid-market companies to take advantage of today’s most advanced, seamless payment processes without incurring the expense or demands of chartering their own bank. As a voting member of NACHA and the Electronics Transactions Association, we are an important part of the decision-making process that affects industry policy. Our working relationships are long-term and almost exclusively with third party agents, who value us for our expertise in providing large and small businesses with extraordinarily stable and efficient payment alternatives. The standards we set are high – we are extremely selective in determining for which merchants we will provide processing services. Because of this strict selection process, we can more readily deliver the greater efficiencies which lead to greater profitability for our partners.

 ACH Processing
            









Innovative, flexible payment solutions that offer an ease of use, security and accuracy – that’s what we provide every day. Our outstanding technical infrastructure, coupled with our proven sophistication in financial services, enables us to achieve an uncommonly high level of service delivery. Our superiority has been achieved through the mastering of ACH processing technologies and administration for two markets in particular: payroll transaction processing and electronic bill payment processing between businesses and their clients and customers. The reliability and speed of our platforms (99.999+% uptime), coupled with highly malleable processing submission options, always-available expert support and best-of-class loss prevention have earned us the recognition as the ideal payments acceptance resource.
