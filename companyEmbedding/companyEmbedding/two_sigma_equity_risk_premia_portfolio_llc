About | Two Sigma














































About
More than 1,100 people who believe the scientific method is the best way to approach investing. Ideas backed up with information. And improved by iteration. That’s Two Sigma.
We’re not your typical investment manager. We follow principles of technology and innovation as much as principles of investment management. Fields like machine learning and distributed computing guide us. Since 2001, we’ve searched for ways that these kinds of technologies can make us better at what we do. We never stop researching and developing.
In the process, we work to help real people. Through our investors, we support the retirements of millions around the world. And we help fund breakthrough research, education and a wide range of charities and foundations.












35,000,000+

Gigabytes of data, and growing:  To test and develop investment models, it helps to have a lot of data. We have a lot of data.*














10,000+

Data sources, both public and proprietary:  We look beyond the obvious. So we can find connections that lead to the next great investment idea.*














95,000

CPUs With 1,695 terabytes of memory:  This is what a tech-driven investment manager looks like.*














1x10^14

Calculations per second:  With 100 teraflops of computing power, we have the tools to model the most complex investment ideas.*














3,300+

Person-years of R&D, growing by 700+ person-years annually:  Our R&D base far exceeds any new startup and is growing faster than any other investment management firm we know.*














2/3

Research and development:  Most finance companies keep technology in the back office. Not us. Research and development make us who we are.*














72%

Non-financial backgrounds:  Most of us don’t have traditional finance backgrounds. This helps us see what others in the industry don’t.*














97%

Voluntary employee retention since inception:  We like it here. We’re a career destination for people with big ideas who want room to grow.*














8

Gold and Silver medalists at the International Math Olympiad:  We like solving hard problems.*














75+

Home countries:  Diversity of thought. Ideas. Languages. Our team brings all of that from all over the world.*














40+

Countries where we trade equities, futures, FX and derivatives:  As a firm, we use diversified systematic strategies in the global financial markets.*














$45b

Assets under management: We have a range of investors from all over the world.*












Co-Chairmen


        
          David Siegel and John Overdeck are recognized pioneers in the fields of technology and investment management. They have more than 40 years of experience in the development of computer-driven, model-based trading systems. Together, David and John run the company.  They work together to drive the mission and strategy for Two Sigma, nurture talent and shape the company’s unique culture.
        




David Siegel, Co-Chairman
Prior to co-founding Two Sigma, David was Chief Technology Officer and Managing Director at Tudor Investment Corporation. After earning his doctorate, David joined D. E. Shaw & Co. and rose to become the company's first chief information officer. While at D. E. Shaw & Co., he founded and served as president of FarSight Financial Services, the world's first integrated personal financial services website, which was acquired by Merrill Lynch. A graduate of Princeton University, David received a PhD in computer science from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he studied at its Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. David has had a lifelong interest in building intelligent computational systems and continues to actively pursue this mission at Two Sigma today.
He currently sits on the Board of Directors of the Hamilton Insurance Group, the Scratch Foundation, NYC FIRST and NAF. In addition, David is a trustee of Carnegie Hall, an Executive Advisory Committee Member of the NSF/MIT Center for Brains, Minds & Machines and an advisory board member of Stanford’s Center on Philanthropy and Civil Society.
David is also a member of the Cornell Tech Board of Overseers and a member of the Corporation Visiting Committee for the MIT Media Laboratory.



John Overdeck, Co-Chairman
John began his career at D.E. Shaw & Co, where he rose to Managing Director. While at D. E. Shaw, he directed the firm’s Japanese equity and equity-linked investments and supervised the firm’s London investment management affiliate.  Following D.E. Shaw and before starting Two Sigma, John spent two years at Amazon.com, first serving as Vice President and technical assistant to Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos. He went on to lead customer relationship management at Amazon.com, directing Amazon’s renowned personalization, community, and targeted marketing features and technology.  He also led critical efforts to make Amazon’s customer technology more scalable.
A lifelong math enthusiast, John won a silver medal for the United States in the 27th International Mathematics Olympiad. He earned a B.S. in Mathematics (with distinction) and a M.S. in Statistics from Stanford University. John currently serves on the Board of Directors of the Hamilton Insurance Group. In addition to his family’s charitable activities, John also serves on the boards of the Robin Hood Foundation, the Institute for Advanced Study and is the acting Chair of the National Museum of Mathematics. 



Founders
Two Sigma Investments was founded in 2001 by David Siegel, John Overdeck and Mark Pickard. They shared the belief that innovative technology and data science could help discover value in the world's data to consistently deliver value for clients.
It is this belief that drives Two Sigma's ongoing development of new technologies that synthesize and integrate vast amounts of data, yielding results that seek to drive smarter investing and more consistent returns.
