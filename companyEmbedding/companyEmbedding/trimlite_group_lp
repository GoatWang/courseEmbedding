Working At LP




Safety Is a Core Value





LP Teamwork and Respect






Employee Spotlight
Lorraine Daley
Plant Safety ManagerEast River, Nova Scotia

I like that we have a strong team and they’re dedicated to safety. I was recruited from another job and when they interviewed me I was hesitant to take the job until I met the team. Once I knew I had this huge support system I knew they were supportive of the safety culture.
“Lorraine is a dedicated member of the LP East River team. She is passionate about her work as the safety manager. Her interactions with employees helps them solve problems on the floor and have a better understanding of how to protect themselves and look out for their co-workers,” said Kyle Kennedy, Plant Manager at LP’s East River Mill.
       
   



Employee Spotlight
Harry Gordon
Production ReliefNewberry, Michigan

I am the person that actually fills in for the production supervisor. We also take care of the day crew and spend time filling in for all the other positions if someone is out. I work with a very supportive team. They inspire the best out of everyone.
"Harry works hard and is well liked by his peers,” said John Duflo, Plant Operations Superintendent at LP’s Newberry mill. “He’s very respectful and a great teammate."
       
   



Employee Spotlight
Leonard Pittman
SupervisorJasper, TX Mill

I supervise our shipping department. I enjoy working with the people I work with and I like working in the area I work in. I’ve been in this department for 15 years. The people are good, safety-oriented people. We have a lot of goal-driven people, people with good ideas that motivate you in your job.
“Leonard does a great job ensuring that we keep our shipments on time and that they have very little error.  He is very dependable and does a great job managing his department,” said Joe Gernand, Production Superintendent at LP’s Jasper Mill.  “I really enjoy working with Leonard because I can trust him to take care of his fellow employees and to keep up with the shipping standards we have at LP.” 
 
       
   



Employee Spotlight
Maria Kaeding
Order Fulfillment AssociateRed Bluff, California

I love what I do. I love helping our customers and I’m very proud of the products we make. I have our LP SmartSide on my house that I bought from one of our distributors. If I had built my house I would’ve bought the I-joists we make. Red Bluff is small so when you find a good job you don’t change. And I found a good one.
"It’s so great to have a resource like Maria on our team. She has a lot of knowledge about our industry, our products, and our customers. And you can tell she cares about people, both inside and outside of LP,” said Alyssa Moore, EWP Customer Service Lead.
       
   



Employee Spotlight
Travis Desrosier
Finishing End LeadHoulton, Maine

I keep track of the quality process in my area and make sure our customers get the product they ordered. We look for any defects before we package it, make sure it’s cut to the right lengths, etc. I like working here because LP cares about each individual person and looks out for their safety.
“Travis works very hard and is very dedicated. When he joined LP he was working in the packaging end and then quickly wanted more responsibility so he moved up and took a lead position. He’s a problem solver for the crew. He works well with his team, and is a very valuable employee,” said Danny Williams, Supervisor at LP’s Houlton Mill.
