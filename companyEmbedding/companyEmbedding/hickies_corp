NEW YORK, Nov. 21, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- HICKIES Corp, the company that created the next generation of shoelaces, has raised $10 million in new funding in a round led by Sforza Holding, owners of footwear and sporting good brands Topper Brazil and Rainha; a top three global footwear brand; and Endeavor Catalyst.
The Brooklyn, NY-based company has seen explosive growth since its modular lacing system hit the market in 2012. The company, with direct operations in Europe's key markets and distribution in over 40 countries, is poised to begin distribution in Brazil in 2017.








HICKIES operates hickies.com in the United States, Germany, the United Kingdom, Mexico, Australia, and multiple marketplaces, all with local fulfillment capabilities. Since its inception, HICKIES has shipped over two million packs of its lacing system and holds nearly 50 patents worldwide.
"This investment marks the beginning of a new chapter for HICKIES. We look forward to building on this momentum with our partners both globally and in Brazil, as we continue to redefine the way people wear their sneakers," said Gaston Frydlewski, Co-Founder & CEO of HICKIES.
The Company has launched a new version of its Lacing System with two new models: HICKIES 2.0 and HICKIES Kids. The new products represent four years of research and customer feedback, with HICKIES 2.0 featuring an adaptive fit tailored for high performance and HICKIES Kids introducing a new material and shape engineered for children. 
About HICKIES®
HICKIES, Corp. is a New York-based global company that is bending the rules of footwear by re-inventing shoelaces and replacing them with an adaptive modular lacing system designed for an active lifestyle.
HICKIES was founded by Gaston Frydlewski and Mariquel Waingarten, an Argentinian couple that moved to New York to launch the Company. 
The senior management team includes Peter Mahrer and Ralf Puschmann, veterans of the sporting goods industry and former senior executives at Under Armour, adidas, and Puma. Joanna Rees remains a member of the HICKIES Board of Directors, having served on the board of a wide range of venture-backed companies. Rees is Managing Director of Soda Rock Partners and has served on the Board of the National Venture Capital Association. 
WHAT ARE HICKIES®?
The HICKIES Lacing System is a better way to lace your shoes. It is founded on a beautifully-simple design that makes any shoes look, feel and fit better. It is also modular, meaning each HICKIES strap expands and contracts independently, responding to your foot's every movement and providing an adaptive fit. Individual straps (one per pair of eyelets) work in tandem in a unique and significant evolution from regular shoelaces. 
The HICKIES Lacing System is made from a proprietary high-performance elastomer blend that is both flexible and strong, giving your feet's muscles freedom to move while retaining a secure fit.

How It Works








        First, Will It Work In My Shoes?
      

        Most likely, yes! The HICKIES® Lacing System is universal by design and is crafted to work with any shoe, as long as it has eyelets. Wear them in your sneakers, work shoes, boots, and even dress shoes.

Step 1

How To Fasten
Installing the HICKIES® Lacing System in your shoes is a one-time affair. Fasten only once and your shoes are always ready to go.










Step 2

How To Adjust Your Fit
A modular design gives you the ability to use different lacing styles within the same shoe based on desired tightness, shoe eyelets, and style preferences.

					  Never Tie Laces.
					
        

					
					  Make any shoe look, fit, and feel better with HICKIES® no-tie laces.

          Simple. Never Tie Again.
        

          Footwear design moves fast, so why do we keep tying our shoes with strings? Fasten HICKIES® laces once, turn any shoe into a slip-on. It's convenient, easy and saves time. Plus it looks better.
        


            How It Works
          










          The Perfect Fit, Always.
        

          The HICKIES® Lacing System connects each pair of eyelets separately. This allows you to customize your fit with different tension levels for different parts of your shoe.

Our experience with traditional laces has been far from perfect. They are either too tight or too loose, always come untied, and look messy. The HICKIES® Lacing System is a no-tie shoelace alternative designed to adapt to your life and how you move. Our modular design and smart material allow you to target how your shoe fits along different parts of your foot, providing personalized comfort and flexibility with each step. Whether running, traveling, training, or on your feet all day, your shoes will fit like a glove and look better, too. Once you install HICKIES® laces, you’ll never have to tie or untie your shoes again. Slip shoes on to run errands, walk the dog, or switch between pairs with ease. Bright, easy, and customizable, the HICKIES® Lacing System is a universal product fit for everyone.

HICKIES, The Company That Reinvented Shoelaces, Raises $10 Million In New Funding From Top Global Footwear Brands And Endeavor Catalyst






Nov 21, 2016, 10:00am EST














NEW YORK, Nov. 21, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- HICKIES Corp, the company that created the next generation of shoelaces, has raised $10 million in new funding in a round led by Sforza Holding, owners of footwear and sporting good brands Topper Brazil and Rainha; a top three global footwear brand; and Endeavor Catalyst.
The Brooklyn, NY-based company has seen explosive growth since its modular lacing system hit the market in 2012. The company, with direct operations in Europe's key markets and distribution in over 40 countries, is poised to begin distribution in Brazil in 2017.
HICKIES operates hickies.com in the United States, Germany, the United Kingdom, Mexico, Australia, and multiple marketplaces, all with local fulfillment capabilities. Since its inception, HICKIES has shipped over two million packs of its lacing system and holds nearly 50 patents worldwide.
"This investment marks the beginning of a new chapter for HICKIES. We look forward to building on this momentum with our partners both globally and in Brazil, as we continue to redefine the way people wear their sneakers," said Gaston Frydlewski, Co-Founder & CEO of HICKIES.
The Company has launched a new version of its Lacing System with two new models: HICKIES 2.0 and HICKIES Kids. The new products represent four years of research and customer feedback, with HICKIES 2.0 featuring an adaptive fit tailored for high performance and HICKIES Kids introducing a new material and shape engineered for children. 
About HICKIES®
HICKIES, Corp. is a New York-based global company that is bending the rules of footwear by re-inventing shoelaces and replacing them with an adaptive modular lacing system designed for an active lifestyle.
HICKIES was founded by Gaston Frydlewski and Mariquel Waingarten, an Argentinian couple that moved to New York to launch the Company. 
The senior management team includes Peter Mahrer and Ralf Puschmann, veterans of the sporting goods industry and former senior executives at Under Armour, adidas, and Puma. Joanna Rees remains a member of the HICKIES Board of Directors, having served on the board of a wide range of venture-backed companies. Rees is Managing Director of Soda Rock Partners and has served on the Board of the National Venture Capital Association. 
WHAT ARE HICKIES®?
The HICKIES Lacing System is a better way to lace your shoes. It is founded on a beautifully-simple design that makes any shoes look, feel and fit better. It is also modular, meaning each HICKIES strap expands and contracts independently, responding to your foot's every movement and providing an adaptive fit. Individual straps (one per pair of eyelets) work in tandem in a unique and significant evolution from regular shoelaces. 
The HICKIES Lacing System is made from a proprietary high-performance elastomer blend that is both flexible and strong, giving your feet's muscles freedom to move while retaining a secure fit.

        Easy and comfortable—simply slip on and off.
        
      




Our experience with traditional laces has been far from perfect. They are either too tight or too loose, always come untied, and look messy. The HICKIES® Lacing System is a no-tie shoelace alternative designed to adapt to your life and how you move. Our modular design and smart material allow you to target how your shoe fits along different parts of your foot, providing personalized comfort and flexibility with each step. Whether running, traveling, training, or on your feet all day, your shoes will fit like a glove and look better, too. Once you install HICKIES® laces, you’ll never have to tie or untie your shoes again. Slip shoes on to run errands, walk the dog, or switch between pairs with ease. Bright, easy, and customizable, the HICKIES® Lacing System is a universal product fit for everyone.

HICKIES Announces Key Management Additions & Raises $4.2MM Investment Round To Fuel Global Expansion And Product Development

Feb 25, 2014, 18:35 ET
		  		  						
						 from   HICKIES 











 
















































 

 




















 


NEW YORK, Feb, 25, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- HICKIES, the start-up responsible for revolutionizing the footwear space with its elastic lacing system, has raised $4.2 million in funding led by the venture arm of one of the largest global footwear brands and the Collaborative Fund. The new financing will be put towards the development, and launch, of new products and the expansion into new international markets.
HICKIES was founded in 2011. Since its launch the company has grown its operations to include a European subsidiary and has shipped 1 million packs of the HICKIES elastic lacing system to 14 different countries.
"This investment marks the beginning of a new chapter in the HICKIES story and it is amazing to reflect on how far we've come in such a short period of time. What started as an idea, grew into a Kickstarter project, is now a global trend. We look forward to building on this momentum by delivering new, simple yet bold, products that will delight our consumers." Mariquel Waingarten, Founder & CMO of HICKIES 
Peter Mahrer and Ralf Puschmann, two veterans of the sporting goods industry, have joined the company and are to head the European office. Mr. Mahrer  serves as the Chief Business Development officer and Mr. Puschmann serves as General Manager for HICKIES Europe.  Most recently Mahrer served as the European president of Under Armour and Puschmann as the Director of Sales Operation and Supply Chain International at Puma. Peter Mahrer has been appointed to the HICKIES Board of Directors. 
Joanna Rees will also join the HICKIES Board of Directors. Miss Rees has served on the board of more than 25 venture-backed start up companies across a broad range of industries. She was a candidate for Mayor of San Francisco in November 2011. Miss Rees was the founder of VSP Capital, a San Francisco-based venture capital firm focused on early-stage companies combining technical innovation with market development. She also served on the Board of the National Venture Capital Association ("NVCA). In 2000 Miss Rees was selected as a Global Leader for Tomorrow (GLT) by The World Economic Forum and in 2002 as a Henry Crown Fellows by The Aspen Institute. 
"Thanks to this strategic investment, and the addition of key team members, we are now well positioned to completely redefine the way people wear their shoes." Gaston Frydlewski, Founder & CEO of HICKIES 
HICKIES will leverage the expertise of its newest team members and partners to continue redefining the footwear and accessories space. New collections and products are forthcoming.
About HICKIESHICKIES is a Brooklyn-based lifestyle company. The company's first product, the HICKIES elastic lacing system, is made of a proprietary blend of elastic polymers which adapt to the shoe's size and contract with the movement of the foot. The product is one size fits all and turns any sneaker into a slip-on. Currently sold in 17 color combinations, the HICKIES elastic lacing system also allows users to customize their footwear.
