ATLANTA, July 26, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- RPC, Inc. (NYSE:    RES) today announced its unaudited results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2017.  RPC provides a broad range of specialized oilfield services and equipment primarily to independent and major oilfield companies engaged in the exploration, production and development of oil and gas properties throughout the United States and in selected international markets.    








For the quarter ended June 30, 2017, revenues increased to $398.8 million compared to $143.0 million in the second quarter of last year.  Revenues increased compared to the prior year due to higher activity levels and pricing for our services, higher service intensity, and a slightly larger fleet of in-service revenue-producing equipment.  Operating profit for the quarter was $67.0 million compared to an operating loss of $75.2 million in the prior year.  Net income for the quarter was $43.8 million or $0.20 diluted earnings per share, compared to net loss of $48.7 million or $0.23 loss per share last year.  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) was $110.3 million compared to a loss of $19.1 million in the prior year.1  For the six months ended June 30, 2017, revenues increased to $696.9 million compared to $332.1 million last year.  Net income for the six-month period was $47.5 million, or $0.22 diluted earnings per share, compared to net loss of $81.2 million, or $0.38 loss per share last year.
Cost of revenues during the second quarter of 2017 was $254.0 million, or 63.7 percent of revenues, compared to $127.0 million, or 88.8 percent of revenues, during the second quarter of last year.  Cost of revenues increased primarily due to higher activity levels and service intensity.  As a percentage of revenues, cost of revenues decreased due to improved pricing for our services as well as leverage of higher revenues over direct costs.  
Selling, general and administrative expenses were $40.3 million in the second quarter of 2017 compared to $36.5 million in the second quarter of 2016.  These expenses increased due to higher compensation costs, as well as other expenses consistent with higher activity levels.   As a percentage of revenues, these costs decreased to 10.1 percent in the second quarter of 2017 compared to 25.5 percent in the second quarter of 2016, due to the leverage of higher revenues over primarily fixed expenses.  Depreciation and amortization decreased to $41.3 million compared to $56.3 million in the second quarter of the prior year.  
RPC recorded a $3.8 million gain on disposition of assets during the quarter, primarily due to the sale of operating equipment related to its oilfield pipe inspection business.  Interest expense during the second quarter of 2017 was $114 thousand compared to $126 thousand during the second quarter of the prior year.  Interest expense during the second quarters of 2016 and 2017 consisted solely of loan facility fees and costs.  Interest income during the second quarter of 2017 was $411 thousand, an increase compared to $104 thousand during the second quarter of 2016.
Discussion of Sequential Quarterly Financial Results
RPC's revenues for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 increased by $100.7 million, or 33.8 percent, compared to the first quarter of 2017.  Revenues increased due to higher activity levels and improved pricing for our services, as well as a slightly larger fleet of in-service revenue-producing equipment.  Cost of revenues during the second quarter of 2017 increased by $37.8 million, or 17.5 percent, due to higher materials and supplies expenses and employment costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses during the second quarter of 2017 increased by $3.1 million, or 8.4 percent, compared to the first quarter of 2017 due to increased costs consistent with higher activity levels and improved profitability.  RPC's operating profit during the second quarter of 2017 was $67.0 million, an increase of $65.4 million, compared to the first quarter operating profit of $1.6 million.  Net income increased from $3.6 million in the first quarter of 2017 to $43.8 million in the second quarter of 2017.  Diluted earnings per share for the second quarter increased to $0.20 compared to $0.02 in the first quarter of 2017. 
Management Commentary
"The U.S. domestic rig count increased for the fourth consecutive quarter, and at a record rate from the historic low set during the second quarter of last year," stated Richard A. Hubbell, RPC's President and Chief Executive Officer.  "Our customers increased their drilling and completion activities, and this increase coupled with RPC's well-maintained pressure pumping service capacity allowed us to generate strong sequential revenue growth and incremental profitability.  The average U.S. domestic rig count during the second quarter of 2017 was 895, an increase of 113.1 percent compared to the same period in 2016, and an increase of 20.3 percent compared to the first quarter of 2017.  The average price of natural gas during the second quarter was $3.08 per Mcf, a 40.6 percent increase compared to the prior year, and a 2.3 percent increase compared to the first quarter of 2017. The average price of oil during the second quarter was $48.19 per barrel, a 4.7 percent increase compared to the prior year but a 6.8 percent decrease compared to the first quarter of 2017.  RPC's revenues increased at a greater rate than the change in these industry metrics because of our preparation over the last several years to participate in improving market conditions, our strong market presence in the Permian Basin, and the re-activation of some of the Company's idle equipment.  
"We currently have indications of strong customer demand through the end of 2017.  However, we are closely monitoring the recent fluctuations in the price of oil and its potential impact on our customer drilling and completion plans.  We are very pleased with the current operating environment and prospects for the immediate future, but the current price of oil forces us to be cautious about large capital commitments until we see an environment conducive to sustained higher activity levels.  We finished the second quarter with $125.8 million in cash.  Capital expenditures during the quarter were $18.9 million directed toward maintenance of our equipment and we returned capital to our shareholders by repurchasing 348,000 shares of our stock.  In addition, as announced this morning, our Board of Directors approved a $0.06 per share dividend to be paid during the third quarter," concluded Hubbell.  
Summary of Segment Operating Performance
RPC manages two operating segments - Technical Services and Support Services.
Technical Services includes RPC's oilfield service lines that utilize people and equipment to perform value-added completion, production and maintenance services directly to a customer's well.  These services are generally directed toward improving the flow of oil and natural gas from producing formations or to address well control issues.  The Technical Services segment includes pressure pumping, coiled tubing, hydraulic workover services, nitrogen, downhole tools, surface pressure control equipment, well control and fishing tool operations.
Support Services includes RPC's oilfield service lines that provide equipment for customer use or services to assist customer operations.  The equipment and services offered include rental of drill pipe and related tools, pipe handling, inspection and storage services, and oilfield training services.
Technical Services revenues increased by almost 200 percent for the quarter compared to the prior year due to improved pricing and higher activity levels as compared to the prior year, particularly within our pressure pumping service line, which is the largest service line within Technical Services.  Support Services revenues increased by 13.3 percent during the quarter compared to the prior year due principally to improved activity levels and pricing in the rental tool service line, which is the largest service line within this segment.  Technical Services reported an operating profit during the quarter compared to an operating loss in the prior year, while Support Services reported operating losses for the second quarters of 2017 and 2016.

Certain statements and information included in this press release constitute "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including all statements that look forward in time or express management's beliefs, expectations or hopes. In particular, such statements include, without limitation, our belief that customer demand will be strong through the end of 2017 and that fluctuations in the price of oil force us to be cautious regarding large capital commitments. These statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of RPC to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied in such forward-looking statements.  Such risks include changes in general global business and economic conditions, including volatility of oil and natural gas prices; credit risks associated with collections of our accounts receivable from customers experiencing challenging business conditions; drilling activity and rig count; risks of reduced availability or increased costs of both labor and raw materials used in providing our services; the impact on our operations if we are unable to comply with the regulatory and environmental laws; turmoil in the financial markets and the potential difficulty to fund our capital needs; the potentially high cost of capital required to fund our capital needs; the impact of the level of unconventional exploration and production activities may cease or change in nature so as to reduce demand for our services; the actions of the OPEC cartel; the ultimate impact of current and potential political unrest and armed conflict in the oil production regions of the world, which could impact drilling activity; adverse weather conditions in oil and gas producing regions, including the Gulf of Mexico; competition in the oil and gas industry; an inability to implement price increases; risks of international operations; and our reliance upon large customers.   Additional discussion of factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from management's projections, forecasts, estimates and expectations is contained in RPC's Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the year ended December 31, 2016.

Appendix A 
RPC has used the non-GAAP financial measure of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) in today's earnings release, and anticipates using EBITDA in today's earnings conference call.  EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for operating income, net income or other performance measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.  RPC uses EBITDA as a measure of operating performance because it allows us to compare performance consistently over various periods without regard to changes in our capital structure. We are also required to use EBITDA to report compliance with financial covenants under our revolving credit facility. A non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of financial performance, financial position, or cash flows that either 1) excludes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding amounts, that are included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the statement of operations, balance sheet or statement of cash flows, or 2) includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of including amounts, that are excluded from the most directly comparable measure so calculated and presented. Set forth below is a reconciliation of EBITDA with Net Income, the most comparable GAAP measure.  This reconciliation also appears on RPC's investor website, which can be found on the Internet at www.rpc.net.

Forward-Looking Statement:


Certain statements and information included in this website constitute "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The Annual Report and press releases contain statements that constitute “forward-looking statements” under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including all statements that look forward in time or express management’s beliefs, expectations or hopes. In particular, such statements include, without limitation, the Company’s belief that its financial strength will continue to support future product development efforts; the Company’s receptiveness to considering acquisition candidates which manufacture complementary products; the Company’s belief that the boating consumer continues to demand more choices and that the Company is meeting that demand; the Company’s belief that it has a strong portfolio of product offerings in a steadily improving recreational boating market; and the Company’s belief that its competitive advantages provide it benefits and the Company’s outlook for another strong year.  The actual results of the Company could differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements because of various risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation, those identified under the title “Risk Factors” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K included as part of the Annual Report. All of the foregoing risks and uncertainties are beyond the ability of the Company to control, and in many cases the Company cannot predict the risks and uncertainties that could cause its actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Additional discussion of factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from management's projections, forecasts, estimates and expectations is contained in Marine Products' Form 10-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the year ending December 31, 2014.

Forward-Looking Statement:
Certain statements and information included in this press release constitute "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements include statements that look forward in time or express management’s beliefs, expectations or hopes. In particular, such statements include, without limitation, statements related to our belief that prolonged winter weather during the first quarter has caused dealer inventories to be higher than normal and our concerns about continued cold weather in many of our domestic markets. These statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of Marine Products Corporation to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied in such forward-looking statements. These risks include possible decreases in the level of consumer confidence and available funds impacting discretionary spending, increased interest rates and fuel prices, weather conditions, changes in consumer preferences, deterioration in the quality of Marine Products’ network of independent boat dealers or availability of financing of their inventory, and competition from other boat manufacturers and dealers. Additional discussion of factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from management's projections, forecasts, estimates and expectations is contained in Marine Products' Form 10-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the year ending December 31, 2013.

08 64 00 – Solar-Tracking Daylighting DeviceMore than a traditional skylight, Sundolier enables the delivery of indirect natural daylight all day, every day as long as the sun shines. With our computer controlled, two axis tracking system, Sundolier is able to harvest and deliver 100,000 lumens of natural daylight through just one small roof penetration. With our state of the art indirect delivery system we can illuminate any space 1,000 – 5,000 square feet, can bring daylight down multiple floors to delivery and can split daylight into two floors with just one device. Sundolier is ideal for commercial, municipal and industrial applications and is retrofit and specification ready. With a system like this we truly can deliver on the promise of daylighting.

This website contains statements that constitute "forward-looking statements" under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including all statements that look forward in time or express management's beliefs, expectations or hopes. In particular, such statements include, without limitation, statements regarding our belief that we have the ability to endure the remainder of the downturn in our industry; our belief that the suspension of our dividends and resulting superior financial strength will provide us with future higher earnings capacity when the domestic oilfield improves which will be a greater long-term benefit to our stockholders; our intention to resume quarterly dividend payments; the advantages provided by our financial strength, including allowing us to survive the harsh operating environment while maintaining our equipment and operational infrastructure, support future strong revenue and earnings growth when the oilfield services industry begins to grow, and allow us to consider strategic opportunities for growth and diversification which would not be available to many of our peers; our belief that the domestic energy industry has a very viable future; and our belief that our industry is only beginning to see a path towards equilibrium. The actual results of the Company could differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements because of various risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation, those identified under the title "Risk Factors" in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K included as a part of this Annual Report.
