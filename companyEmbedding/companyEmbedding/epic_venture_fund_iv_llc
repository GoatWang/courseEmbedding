Our StoryEarly stage venture capital isn't new to us. With roots in Silicon Valley, our mission for two decades has been to partner with entrepreneurs at the earliest stages and bring capital outside the Bay Area. Since then we've built a reputation as partners and advisors helping entrepreneurs build teams, find customers, raise additional capital, and ultimately build lasting businesses.In twenty years our mission hasn't changed. We're as driven as ever to find and support the next generation of entrepreneurs. 

EPIC Ventures has been our trusted partner in growing our business from startup to category leader.

— Mike Sands, Signal
 Our FocusStageWe focus primarily on Series A financings, though we've partnered with strong founders as early as pre-idea seed rounds and as late as $100MM growth equity rounds. We reserve significant capital for follow on and work with our companies from inception to exit.VerticalWe look for companies with a competitive advantage based in technology, but first and foremost we believe in strong founders.We've made investments across the IT stack, as well as in ecommerce, consumer applications, and security.GeographyIn twenty years our investment thesis has taken us across the nation to find category leaders. We've made investments in almost every major US city and actively look outside of Silicon Valley for exceptional entrepreneurs.

Samsung to acquire Joyent



merry osborne


June 16, 2016





Container pioneer and Sun alumni lair Joyent has been bought by Samsung.Since the buyer is a world-spanning industrial powerhouse, the acquisition is too small for Samsung to have to talk about the price.Joyent's probably most famous as the first corporate steward of node.js and one of the language's largest users. It's also got containers-as-a-service under the Triton brand, and the Manta object-storage-as-a-service.From Joyent's point of view the rationale behind the deal is simple. As CEO Scott Hammond – formerly of Cisco, not Sun – says, it's about scale: Joyent lacks it and Samsung has it in spades.Samsung is also going to become an “anchor tenant” for Triton and Manta, Hammond writes, before drifting off into the inevitable corporate-speak about a “culture of innovation and technical excellence”.As reassurance for customers who regularly see products consigned to the bin after acquisition, Hammond promises a strong future for Joyent's technology.
