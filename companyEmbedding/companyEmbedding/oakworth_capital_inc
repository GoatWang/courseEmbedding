Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Time (NYSE:TIME) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 4 Hold Ratings, 1 Buy RatingConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.20)Consensus Price Target: $15.20 (3.05% upside)

What are analysts saying about Amgen stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Amgen stock: 
1. Cann analysts commented, "Amgen reported GAAP earnings per share of $2.91, which is 3.2% higher than our estimate of $2.83. Earnings exceeded our expectations due to higher than estimated product sales and a lower than estimated tax rate. Higher than estimated product sales were primarily driven by higher sales of Aranesp, Kyprolis, Blincyto, and Sensipar. Nearly all of Amgen’s products exceeded our estimates for International sales. Total product sales of $5.57 billion exceeded our estimated $5.47 billion by 1.8% and exceeded consensus product sales by 2.7%." (7/26/2017)
2. Cowen and Company analysts commented, "Amgen reported Q1 Revenue of $5.46B (-1% Y/Y, vs. consensus of $5.61BE) and." (4/27/2017)
3. BMO Capital Markets analysts commented, "We expect the overall survival (OS) benefit in relapsed myeloma patients to enable Kyprolis to grow in the face of generic competition for Velcade. Upside, however, is in our opinion dependent on data in combination with Revlimid+dex (ECOG Ph3) in newly-diagnosed patients given failure of CLARION. Anecdotal data suggests that Darzalex is best suited in IMiD and proteasome inhibitor failures given lack of response of these agents in patients failing Darzalex." (3/6/2017)
4. According to Zacks Investment Research, "Amgen growth products – Prolia, Xgeva, Vectibix, Nplate and Sensipar – are performing well. Amgen’s restructuring plan should make it leaner and more cost efficient. Amgen is also progressing with its pipeline given quite a few regulatory and data updates scheduled for the coming quarters. Amgen has a positive record of earnings surprises in recent quarters. Amgen’s shares surpassed that of Biomed-Genetics industry in 2016. However, the company has some challenges in store given the presence of biosimilar competition and slowdown in sales of mature products. Biosimilars are starting to have a negative impact on key products like Neupogen and Neulasta in the EU. Moreover, minimal sales price increases and stiff competition can hurt blockbuster Enbrel sales in 2017. Estimates have also declined lately ahead of the company’s Q4 earnings release."
