Sollpura








Sollpura represents the potentially first soluble, stable and non-pig derived pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) to offer a novel solution to patients, especially young children and adults who are either unable to swallow multiple pills or are forced to use gastric tubes in order to maintain appropriate nutritional health. Unlike other enzyme products for the treatment of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI), Sollpura’s chemical characteristics, its solubility and stability, make it an ideal product in either a capsule or sachet formulation which can be conveniently co-administered with a variety of food products.
Sollpura provides numerous advantages over current approved PERTs:








Studies
Anthera is conducting two studies with Sollpura.
RESULT Study: The purpose of the RESULT study is to evaluate the non-inferiority of Sollpura compared to approved, porcine-derived, enterically-coated pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy when administered to patients with cystic fibrosis and endocrine pancreatic insufficiency. Learn more.
Simplicity Study: The SIMPLICITY study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of Sollpura powder for oral solution, supplied in sachets. Learn more.

Anthera Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing products to treat serious conditions associated with cystic fibrosis, inflammation and autoimmune diseases. Liprotamase (Sollpura), Anthera’s leading drug candidate which is being developed for exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI) is currently in Phase 3 clinical trials, and A-623 (Blisibimod) for the treatment of IgA nephropathy[1][2] is currently in Phase 2 clinical trial.

Products[edit]
Blisibimod[edit]

Blisibimod is a selective peptibody antagonist of B-cell activating factor (BAFF). BAFF is critical to the development, maintenance and survival of B-cells, but is known to be up-regulated in autoimmune diseases.[3][4][5] It is primarily expressed by macrophages, monocytes and dendritic cells.[6] Blisibimod binds to BAFF and inhibits the interaction of BAFF with its receptors.[7] Blisibimod is currently being evaluated in IgA nephropathy [1].

Sollpura[edit]
July 2014, Anthera acquired Sollpura (Liprotamase) from Eli Lilly and Company.[8] Sollpura is an investigational pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) that uses three biotechnology-derived digestive enzymes intended to treat patients with endocrine pancreatic insufficiency as a result of cystic fibrosis and other diseases.[9]

Blisibimod








Blisibimod was licensed from Amgen in December 2007 with exclusive worldwide rights.  Blisibimod targets B-cell activating factor, or BAFF, which has been shown to be elevated in a variety of B-cell mediated autoimmune diseases, including Immunoglobulin A nephropathy, or IgA nephropathy, systemic lupus erythematosus, or lupus, lupus nephritis, and others.
Blisibimod is currently in development for the treatment of IgA nephropathy (IgAN).  IgAN (also known as Berger’s disease) is the most common cause of primary glomerulonephritis worldwide, occurring more frequently in Asia than in Europe or North America. IgAN is characterized by deposition of IgA-anti IgA immune complexes in the kidney, resulting in inflammation, the leakage of blood and protein into the urine, and loss of kidney function. The disease typically progresses slowly but as many as 40-50% of adults will eventually develop end-stage-renal disease and require dialysis or kidney transplant.  There are currently no approved therapies for IgA nephropathy.












Anthera is currently conducting one study with blisibimod.
Bright•SC: The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the clinical efficacy of blisibimod as a treatment for IgA Nephropathy. Learn more.
