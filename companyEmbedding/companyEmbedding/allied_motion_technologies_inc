The axis drive modules are available in 5 A and 15 A continuous output current versions. A combination of both 5 A and 15 A axis drive modules can be mixed in a MXC chassis to suit application needs. Bus voltage capability ranges from 12 up to 80 VDC to accommodate a broad array of motors. Special function or I/O expansion cards can be substituted for one or more of the axis drive cards, greatlly expanding the applicability of the MXC. Allied Motion can work with you to define and develop these auxiliary cards to suit your specific application demands.The master control card handles all higher level motion control operations and feeds command information to the axis drive cards. It also handles all communication with a host controller or PC, if present.The MXC's master module is equipped with an Ethernet port, enabling high speed communication with a system controller or host PC.The MXC will also able  run in stand-alone mode with no need for a host. The MXC's multi-tasking, pre-emptive, run-time environment is capable of running several program blocks (called POBs) simultaneously. POBs can be downloaded and executed on -the- fly, or recalled and run from local non volatile storage at power-up. The run time environment also features an extensive, programmable event- driven mechanism for starting and stopping program blocks based upon such factors as a change of I/O state or a reaction to a fieldbus message.Allied Motion provides complimentary IN Control software with the MXC. IN Control is a Windows-based development and control software application for use with the MXC and other Allied Motion drive and controller products. IN Control enables you to easily set-up and configure the MXC. It includes a four- channel software oscilloscope tool that provides data logging of system registers in real time. IN Control also provides  tools for system setup, analysis, diagnostics, I/O and event/response configuration.Compact, modular multi-axis motion controller capable of controlling up to six servo axesEach drive module can deliver up to 1000 W of continuous powerIN Control software makes it easy to set-up, configure and program the MXC motion controller.Key Features & BenefitsControl Modes: Position (torque and velocity modes available during commissioning)Motor Types Accommodated: Brushless, brush, stepperAuto Run: Execute stored programs from flashIN Control Software: Set-up and programming software that includes digital oscilloscope and frequency analysis toolsAxis Drive Current: 5 A or 15 A peakAxis Drive voltage: 12 to 80 VDCDigital I/O Master and Axis Cards:6 isolated inputsUp to 4 high speed differential pairs configurable as inputs or outputs2 isolated outputs1 non-isolated output (open-collector)Analog I/O:2 differential inputs, ±10V, 10 bits (Master), 12 bits (Axis)1 analog output, 0 - 5 V, 12 bits (Axis)Power Inputs: Main DC power input and separate auxiliary "keep alive" inputEncoders Accommodated: Single-ended, differential, incremental analog (interpolation to 16,384 times), EnDat 2.2 (up to 3), BISS-C (up to 3)Size: Very compact 5.3¨ x 3.4¨ x 2.5¨ (134.6 mm x 86.36 mm x 63.5 mm)System Communication: Ethernet (100 Mbs) to host or PC, plus RS232SPI Interface: Enables connection of peripheral devices such as camerasOperating Temperature: Wide temperature operating range of -20 to +40 °CCompliance: RoHSSpecificationsArchitectureDC powered, modular multi-axis motion controller with master module, two axis drive modules, optional expanded I/O moduleAxes2Supply Voltage12 - 80 VDCLogic Power12 to 80 VDC to maintain logic power during main power shut offOutput Voltage (max.) (VDC)80Output Current (cont.)15 A (total rack limit of 40 A continuous must be observed)Output Current (peak)15 AOutput Power (cont.)1000 W per 15 A drive (total output power all axes must be < 2900 W)Efficiency> 92% at 30 ºCMotor CompatibilityBrushless servomotors (linear or rotary), sinusoidal or trapezoidal commutation; step motorsCurrent (Torque) LoopPI, 50 μs loop delayVelocity LoopPID/PDF, 250 μs loop delayPosition LoopProportional with feed forward, 250 µsec updatePosition ModesPoint-to-point, target position with velocity/acceleration/jerk limitsMotor Feedback InputsEncoder: 30 MHz digital incremental, 1 MHz analog sin-cos (sin-cos interpolation up to 16,384-times), EnDat 2.1 (support of EnDat 2.2 command set) (up to 3), BISS-C (up to 3), customMotion TypesPosition, velocity, torque (current) control, 20 kHz torque loop update rate, 4 kHz veloicity and position loop update rates; PID + feed-forward, user-configurable digital filters (e.g., notch, low pass), set-point streamingAcceleration ControlThird order position, velocity/acceleration/jerk limiting, independent acceleration and deceleration, blended motion; ramping: rate, time, or distance, independent acceleration and decelerationProgramming.NET framework, AML (Allied Motion Language for Motion Control)MemoryFlash memory for user programs, parameters, miscellaneous storageAnalog I/O2 differential inputs, ±10V, 10-bits (Master), 12-bits (each Axis)|1 analog output, 0 - 5 V, 12-bits (each Axis)Digital I/OPer Master and each Axis drive module:6 isolated inputsUp to 4 high speed differential pairs configurable as inputs or outputs2 isolated outputs1 non-isolated output (open-collector)SPI Interface (Master): Enables connection of peripheral devices such as camerasCommunication InterfaceRS232 or Ethernet bus from host PC to master card; host PC running Vista/7/8 OS and Allied Motion’s IN Control application softwareBusEthernet (100 Mbs) to host or PC, and RS232Protection FeaturesOver voltage detectionUnder voltage detectionOver currentFull short-circuit protectionOver temperature shutdownWeight (lb)0.4Ambient Operating Temperature (°F)-4 to +104Ambient Storage Temperature (°F)-40 to +212List Price (USD)$1,723 Accessories(Click part number to download accessory specification)Part NumberDescriptionList PriceQuickshipAddAC-CB-10011920-pin motor feedback cable with connector, flying leads, 0.5 m (1.5 ft) length

History[edit]
Allied Motion was founded in January 1939 in Denver, Colorado by Claude Hathaway under the name of Hathaway Instruments Company. The company developed and successfully sold electrical instruments to a number of industries through the 1940s and early 1950s.
In 1955, the Hamilton Watch Company purchased the company from Mr. Hathaway. It was operated as a division of Hamilton until January 1960, when the division was purchased by an investor group composed in part of executives working in the division. The new company was named Hathaway Instruments, Inc. The company became a U.S. public company in 1962 under the laws of Colorado, originally named 5800 Corporation.[6] Within days of incorporation the name of the company was changed to Hathaway Instruments Inc.[7]
In 1982 the name of the corporation was again changed to Hathaway Corporation.[8] By 1995, the company had developed, and was manufacturing and selling instrumentation used to monitor and control the operations of power generating, transmission and distribution facilities of electric utility and process control companies. The company had also established a nascent motion control business.[9] At this time, Hathaway Corporation consisted of two wholly owned subsidiaries, Hathaway Systems Corporation (HSC) and subsidiaries and Computer Optical Products, Inc.[7] The Company’s name was also changed to Hathaway Corporation. The motion control business was organized into two divisions and one subsidiary: Hathaway Motion Control, Hathaway Motors and Instruments and Computer Optical Products, Inc., respectively.[7] Between 1962 and 2001 Hathaway executed several acquisitions and mergers of subsidiaries into the parent corporation.[10] In addition, joint ventures in China were established and other acquisitions occurred.[11]
At the end of 2001, Hathaway Corporation consisted basically of the Power and Process business, selling into the electric utility market, and a motion control business operated as a wholly owned subsidiary, Hathaway Motion Control Corporation.[7] In 2002, the company took the decision to focus solely on motion control products and markets. As a result, on July 29, 2002 the company sold its electric utility products division along with the Hathaway brand name to the Danaher Corporation.[12] The day following the divestiture of the Power and Process business, the company completed the acquisition of Motor Products - Owosso Corporation and Motor Products - Ohio Corporation, both manufacturers of permanent magnet DC motors, from the Owosso Corporation.[7] These were the first acquisitions by the company in accordance with its plan to grow their motion control business platform.
On November 19, 2002, the company formally changed its name from Hathaway Corporation to Allied Motion Technologies, Inc.[7] The name was chosen to better reflect the future business direction of the company.
Products[edit]
Key products of this company are brush and brushless DC motors, brushless servo and torque motors, coreless DC motors, brushless motors with integrated drives, gearmotors, digital servo drives, motion controllers, incremental and absolute optical encoders, and powered wheels and transaxles.[13][14]
Acquisitions[edit]
At different times after the establishment of Allied Motion Technologies Inc., the company, through acquisition, became the owner of the following brands: Agile Systems, Globe Motors,[15] Heidrive,[16] Motor Products, Östergrens Elmotor, Premotec, and Stature Electric.
Conflict minerals[edit]
Allied Motion Technologies says[17] that it supports ending the violence and human rights violations in the mining of certain minerals from a location described as the "Conflict Region" that is situated in the eastern portion of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and surrounding countries. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") has adopted a final rule[18] to implement reporting and disclosure requirements related to "conflict minerals" (gold, tin, tantalum, and tungsten, the derivatives of cassiterite, columbite-tantalite, and wolframite) as directed by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010. The rule requires manufacturers who file certain reports with the SEC to disclose whether the products they manufacture or contract to manufacture contain "conflict minerals" that are "necessary to the functionality or production" of those products.[18]

History[edit]
Allied Motion was founded in January 1939 in Denver, Colorado by Claude Hathaway under the name of Hathaway Instruments Company. The company developed and successfully sold electrical instruments to a number of industries through the 1940s and early 1950s.
In 1955, the Hamilton Watch Company purchased the company from Mr. Hathaway. It was operated as a division of Hamilton until January 1960, when the division was purchased by an investor group composed in part of executives working in the division. The new company was named Hathaway Instruments, Inc. The company became a U.S. public company in 1962 under the laws of Colorado, originally named 5800 Corporation.[6] Within days of incorporation the name of the company was changed to Hathaway Instruments Inc.[7]
In 1982 the name of the corporation was again changed to Hathaway Corporation.[8] By 1995, the company had developed, and was manufacturing and selling instrumentation used to monitor and control the operations of power generating, transmission and distribution facilities of electric utility and process control companies. The company had also established a nascent motion control business.[9] At this time, Hathaway Corporation consisted of two wholly owned subsidiaries, Hathaway Systems Corporation (HSC) and subsidiaries and Computer Optical Products, Inc.[7] The Company’s name was also changed to Hathaway Corporation. The motion control business was organized into two divisions and one subsidiary: Hathaway Motion Control, Hathaway Motors and Instruments and Computer Optical Products, Inc., respectively.[7] Between 1962 and 2001 Hathaway executed several acquisitions and mergers of subsidiaries into the parent corporation.[10] In addition, joint ventures in China were established and other acquisitions occurred.[11]
At the end of 2001, Hathaway Corporation consisted basically of the Power and Process business, selling into the electric utility market, and a motion control business operated as a wholly owned subsidiary, Hathaway Motion Control Corporation.[7] In 2002, the company took the decision to focus solely on motion control products and markets. As a result, on July 29, 2002 the company sold its electric utility products division along with the Hathaway brand name to the Danaher Corporation.[12] The day following the divestiture of the Power and Process business, the company completed the acquisition of Motor Products - Owosso Corporation and Motor Products - Ohio Corporation, both manufacturers of permanent magnet DC motors, from the Owosso Corporation.[7] These were the first acquisitions by the company in accordance with its plan to grow their motion control business platform.
On November 19, 2002, the company formally changed its name from Hathaway Corporation to Allied Motion Technologies, Inc.[7] The name was chosen to better reflect the future business direction of the company.
Products[edit]
Key products of this company are brush and brushless DC motors, brushless servo and torque motors, coreless DC motors, brushless motors with integrated drives, gearmotors, digital servo drives, motion controllers, incremental and absolute optical encoders, and powered wheels and transaxles.[13][14]
Acquisitions[edit]
At different times after the establishment of Allied Motion Technologies Inc., the company, through acquisition, became the owner of the following brands: Agile Systems, Globe Motors,[15] Heidrive,[16] Motor Products, Östergrens Elmotor, Premotec, and Stature Electric.
Conflict minerals[edit]
Allied Motion Technologies says[17] that it supports ending the violence and human rights violations in the mining of certain minerals from a location described as the "Conflict Region" that is situated in the eastern portion of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and surrounding countries. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") has adopted a final rule[18] to implement reporting and disclosure requirements related to "conflict minerals" (gold, tin, tantalum, and tungsten, the derivatives of cassiterite, columbite-tantalite, and wolframite) as directed by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010. The rule requires manufacturers who file certain reports with the SEC to disclose whether the products they manufacture or contract to manufacture contain "conflict minerals" that are "necessary to the functionality or production" of those products.[18]

History[edit]
Allied Motion was founded in January 1939 in Denver, Colorado by Claude Hathaway under the name of Hathaway Instruments Company. The company developed and successfully sold electrical instruments to a number of industries through the 1940s and early 1950s.
In 1955, the Hamilton Watch Company purchased the company from Mr. Hathaway. It was operated as a division of Hamilton until January 1960, when the division was purchased by an investor group composed in part of executives working in the division. The new company was named Hathaway Instruments, Inc. The company became a U.S. public company in 1962 under the laws of Colorado, originally named 5800 Corporation.[6] Within days of incorporation the name of the company was changed to Hathaway Instruments Inc.[7]
In 1982 the name of the corporation was again changed to Hathaway Corporation.[8] By 1995, the company had developed, and was manufacturing and selling instrumentation used to monitor and control the operations of power generating, transmission and distribution facilities of electric utility and process control companies. The company had also established a nascent motion control business.[9] At this time, Hathaway Corporation consisted of two wholly owned subsidiaries, Hathaway Systems Corporation (HSC) and subsidiaries and Computer Optical Products, Inc.[7] The Company’s name was also changed to Hathaway Corporation. The motion control business was organized into two divisions and one subsidiary: Hathaway Motion Control, Hathaway Motors and Instruments and Computer Optical Products, Inc., respectively.[7] Between 1962 and 2001 Hathaway executed several acquisitions and mergers of subsidiaries into the parent corporation.[10] In addition, joint ventures in China were established and other acquisitions occurred.[11]
At the end of 2001, Hathaway Corporation consisted basically of the Power and Process business, selling into the electric utility market, and a motion control business operated as a wholly owned subsidiary, Hathaway Motion Control Corporation.[7] In 2002, the company took the decision to focus solely on motion control products and markets. As a result, on July 29, 2002 the company sold its electric utility products division along with the Hathaway brand name to the Danaher Corporation.[12] The day following the divestiture of the Power and Process business, the company completed the acquisition of Motor Products - Owosso Corporation and Motor Products - Ohio Corporation, both manufacturers of permanent magnet DC motors, from the Owosso Corporation.[7] These were the first acquisitions by the company in accordance with its plan to grow their motion control business platform.
On November 19, 2002, the company formally changed its name from Hathaway Corporation to Allied Motion Technologies, Inc.[7] The name was chosen to better reflect the future business direction of the company.
Products[edit]
Key products of this company are brush and brushless DC motors, brushless servo and torque motors, coreless DC motors, brushless motors with integrated drives, gearmotors, digital servo drives, motion controllers, incremental and absolute optical encoders, and powered wheels and transaxles.[13][14]
Acquisitions[edit]
At different times after the establishment of Allied Motion Technologies Inc., the company, through acquisition, became the owner of the following brands: Agile Systems, Globe Motors,[15] Heidrive,[16] Motor Products, Östergrens Elmotor, Premotec, and Stature Electric.
Conflict minerals[edit]
Allied Motion Technologies says[17] that it supports ending the violence and human rights violations in the mining of certain minerals from a location described as the "Conflict Region" that is situated in the eastern portion of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and surrounding countries. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") has adopted a final rule[18] to implement reporting and disclosure requirements related to "conflict minerals" (gold, tin, tantalum, and tungsten, the derivatives of cassiterite, columbite-tantalite, and wolframite) as directed by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010. The rule requires manufacturers who file certain reports with the SEC to disclose whether the products they manufacture or contract to manufacture contain "conflict minerals" that are "necessary to the functionality or production" of those products.[18]

History[edit]
Allied Motion was founded in January 1939 in Denver, Colorado by Claude Hathaway under the name of Hathaway Instruments Company. The company developed and successfully sold electrical instruments to a number of industries through the 1940s and early 1950s.
In 1955, the Hamilton Watch Company purchased the company from Mr. Hathaway. It was operated as a division of Hamilton until January 1960, when the division was purchased by an investor group composed in part of executives working in the division. The new company was named Hathaway Instruments, Inc. The company became a U.S. public company in 1962 under the laws of Colorado, originally named 5800 Corporation.[6] Within days of incorporation the name of the company was changed to Hathaway Instruments Inc.[7]
In 1982 the name of the corporation was again changed to Hathaway Corporation.[8] By 1995, the company had developed, and was manufacturing and selling instrumentation used to monitor and control the operations of power generating, transmission and distribution facilities of electric utility and process control companies. The company had also established a nascent motion control business.[9] At this time, Hathaway Corporation consisted of two wholly owned subsidiaries, Hathaway Systems Corporation (HSC) and subsidiaries and Computer Optical Products, Inc.[7] The Company’s name was also changed to Hathaway Corporation. The motion control business was organized into two divisions and one subsidiary: Hathaway Motion Control, Hathaway Motors and Instruments and Computer Optical Products, Inc., respectively.[7] Between 1962 and 2001 Hathaway executed several acquisitions and mergers of subsidiaries into the parent corporation.[10] In addition, joint ventures in China were established and other acquisitions occurred.[11]
At the end of 2001, Hathaway Corporation consisted basically of the Power and Process business, selling into the electric utility market, and a motion control business operated as a wholly owned subsidiary, Hathaway Motion Control Corporation.[7] In 2002, the company took the decision to focus solely on motion control products and markets. As a result, on July 29, 2002 the company sold its electric utility products division along with the Hathaway brand name to the Danaher Corporation.[12] The day following the divestiture of the Power and Process business, the company completed the acquisition of Motor Products - Owosso Corporation and Motor Products - Ohio Corporation, both manufacturers of permanent magnet DC motors, from the Owosso Corporation.[7] These were the first acquisitions by the company in accordance with its plan to grow their motion control business platform.
On November 19, 2002, the company formally changed its name from Hathaway Corporation to Allied Motion Technologies, Inc.[7] The name was chosen to better reflect the future business direction of the company.
Products[edit]
Key products of this company are brush and brushless DC motors, brushless servo and torque motors, coreless DC motors, brushless motors with integrated drives, gearmotors, digital servo drives, motion controllers, incremental and absolute optical encoders, and powered wheels and transaxles.[13][14]
Acquisitions[edit]
At different times after the establishment of Allied Motion Technologies Inc., the company, through acquisition, became the owner of the following brands: Agile Systems, Globe Motors,[15] Heidrive,[16] Motor Products, Östergrens Elmotor, Premotec, and Stature Electric.
Conflict minerals[edit]
Allied Motion Technologies says[17] that it supports ending the violence and human rights violations in the mining of certain minerals from a location described as the "Conflict Region" that is situated in the eastern portion of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and surrounding countries. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") has adopted a final rule[18] to implement reporting and disclosure requirements related to "conflict minerals" (gold, tin, tantalum, and tungsten, the derivatives of cassiterite, columbite-tantalite, and wolframite) as directed by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010. The rule requires manufacturers who file certain reports with the SEC to disclose whether the products they manufacture or contract to manufacture contain "conflict minerals" that are "necessary to the functionality or production" of those products.[18]
