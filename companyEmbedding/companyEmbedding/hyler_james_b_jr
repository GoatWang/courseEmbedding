 A conversation with James B. Hyler, Jr.Rethinking green                         James B. Hyler, Jr.       Current position:               President of the US Golf Association (USGA)       Last EY office:               Winston-Salem, North Carolina       Born in:               Danville, Virginia       Board/community involvement:               Director at Progress Energy; Trustee of Rex  Healthcare; and past Chairman of the Greater Raleigh Chamber of Commerce, the  North Carolina Chamber and the Raleigh-Durham Airport Authority       Career highlights:               Served eight years on the USGA's Executive Committee;  spent 28 years at First Citizens Bank, retiring as Vice Chairman and COO       Most recent read:               Decision Points by George W. Bush                The USGA President is intent on raising environmental  awareness."Take  time to understand the company and the people. Sometimes the best way to go  fast is to go slow. If you can do that, your chances of success are much  greater." While Jim Hyler is nearing the end of his term as  President of the United States Golf Association (USGA), he remains passionate  about the game and about bringing sustainability practices to the course. Many people envision mornings on the golf course as a  key aspect of retirement. USGA President Jim Hyler, who “retired” from  corporate life in 2008, thinks about golf all day long, but in a far different  way.  The USGA, founded more than a century ago, is  dedicated to maintaining its leadership role regarding rules, equipment  standards, its handicapping and course-rating system, and of course, its  championships. But Hyler is using his position to address environmental issues  as well.  In his inaugural address in February 2010,Hyler called  on the golf community to recognize “how brown can become the new green.” He  reminded his audience that water is one of the most significant issues facing  the future of golf.  With the Southwest facing unprecedented drought  conditions and the impact of a lingering economic slowdown, the USGA has been  promoting a focus on “playability” rather than lush conditions. There are  multiple benefits: improved turf health, better drought resistance, reduced  costs, lower environmental impact and a playing surface that is more fun to  play. Understand  yourself After graduating from Virginia Tech in 1970, Hyler  joined Ernst & Young LLP in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. He chose that  office partly because one of his closest childhood friends, Rodger Holley (now  a retired partner), had joined it the year before. Also, despite its relatively  small size, Hyler thought the office had a “dynamite” client roster.  He served clients in a variety of industries but spent  most of his time on the audit of Wachovia Bank. He recalls his audit service to  Wachovia as an outstanding learning experience, particularly when meeting with  the bank’s audit committee. “The committee was composed of a lot of very sharp  people,” Hyler recalls.  “So we had to prepare well and be on our toes in that  meeting room.” He names retired partners Dave Bodenhamer and Jim Smith as major  influences.  As a consequence of his experience serving Wachovia,  Hyler became a “go-to” instructor of workshops on banking audit software.  According to Hyler, EY was at the cutting edge of the then-new  area of audit software. It was an exciting time. So Hyler was well prepared to  assume the role of CFO at First Citizens Bank in 1980. He stayed there for 28  years, moving up the executive track to become Vice Chairman and COO.  In addition to learning the banking business, Hyler  says that his experience at EY taught him how to interact  effectively with people. “As an auditor, you are, in a sense, intrusive,” he  notes. “How can you make the best of the situation and work with clients in a  non-threatening, cooperative way?”  Hyler advises recent college graduates that getting  along with people is the most important quality for success in business. He  adds, “If you can understand yourself, you will find effective ways to connect  with people.” A double  eagle  One of Hyler’s fondest memories goes back to his  initial involvement with the USGA in 1999. He had volunteered to chair the  President’s Council, a group of North Carolina business leaders tasked with  selling the U.S. Open at the Pinehurst Resort. Since the resort was located in  a small community far from any major population centers, many were skeptical.  Ultimately, the campaign and the event at Pinehurst  were “successful beyond our wildest dreams,” he recalls. Subsequently, the USGA  asked Hyler to join its executive committee.  Inside the  ropes  Hyler appreciates the USGA culture, which maintains  consistent priorities even though presidents change every two years. The  association is focused on continuous improvement with a particular emphasis  “both inside and outside the ropes” of the U.S. Open. As mentioned, Hyler and  his colleagues speak frequently about policies that try to bring a better  balance between golf and the environment.  He cautions, “It’s my view that we over-water golf  courses in this country … and that comes with a cost.”  Today, Hyler spends about half his time on USGA  matters and is on the road more than 100 days a year. “It’s a big commitment,  but an incredible experience. I travel through the US and internationally,  meeting many wonderful people. I’m very fortunate to have been able to do  this.”  Hyler notes that his wife, Natalie, is incredibly  supportive of his USGA activities despite the fact that it’s meant postponing  vacations for the last few years. “She’s been great, but frankly, I think  she’ll be glad when things get a bit more back to normal,” he laughs. All in the  family Golf holds a special place in the Hyler family.  Hyler’s son, Brad, started playing at age seven and went on to join the golf  teams at Virginia Tech and the University of North Carolina. “Watching him  develop from just a young kid into a good college player, and then traveling  with him all over the country to events, that was a wonderful time,”  Hyler reminisces. Hyler’s daughter, Lori, played golf  (and soccer) at the junior level. She now has four children, ages three through  eight. For those individuals choosing to leave professional  service for the corporate world, Hyler is a stellar example. He offers this  advice: “Take time to understand the company and the people. Sometimes the best  way to go fast is to go slow. If you can do that, your chances of success are  much greater.” . Teeing up  for the digital age While steeped in legend and tradition, the USGA is  making significant investments in digital media, and, according to Hyler, to  great effect. During the 2008 U.S. Open playoff round between Tiger Woods and  Rocco Mediate at Torrey Pines, usopen.com served more than           2.5 million video streams, including an all-time  record of 600,000 concurrent streams during Monday’s playoff.  The demand has prompted the creation of a new video  internet console, designed to allow more fans to watch future playoffs with  “higher quality and more stability.” . An “incredible experience”: United States Golf  Association President and EY alumnus Jim Hyler spends about 100  days a year on the road for the USGA. He is working to persuade clubs and  golfers that when it comes to turf, “brown is the new green.” About the  USGA  Together with the  R&A, the USGA governs the game worldwide   Conducts three  Open championships each year — Men’s, Senior Men’s and Women’s — and 10 Amateur  championships   Writes and  interprets the Rules of Golf   Regulates and  tests all golf equipment for conformance to the Rules of Golf   Maintains the  USGA handicap and course-rating systems          Dcember 2011              Your feedback     Rate this article  Leave a comment       Share
