Altogether, we are continuously reassessing and improving our way of working to meet the highest possible quality standards.

We estimate that we will receive net proceeds from the global offering of
approximately $90.2 (€79.3) million, based on the public offering price of
$68.56 (€60.25) per ADS in the U.S. offering and €60.25 per ordinary share in
the European private placement, after deducting underwriting commissions and
estimated offering expenses payable by us, and assuming no exercise of the
underwriters’ option to purchase additional ordinary shares and ADSs. If the
underwriters exercise in full their options to purchase additional ordinary
shares and ADSs in the global offering, we estimate that we will receive net
proceeds from the global offering of approximately $104.2 (€91.5) million, based
on the public offering price of $68.56 (€60.25) per ADS in the U.S. offering and
€60.25 per ordinary share in the European private placement, after deducting
underwriting commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

The principal purposes of the global offering are to increase our financial
flexibility, create a public market for our securities in the United States and
facilitate our access to the public equity markets. We currently expect to use
the net proceeds from the global offering as follows:

. approximately $15.0 million to advance the development of C-Cure through Phase
  3 clinical development as a treatment for ischemic HF;

. approximately $5.0 million to advance the development of CAR-NKG2D through
  Phase 1 clinical development as a treatment for AML and MM;

. approximately $40.0 million to advance additional CAR T-cell therapy drug
  product candidates for the treatment of additional blood cancers and solid
  tumors; and

. approximately $5.0 million to support our growth globally by expanding
  general, administrative and operational functions in our headquarters in
  Belgium and in the United States.

We expect to use the remainder of any net proceeds from the global offering for
working capital and other general corporate purposes.

We may also use a portion of the net proceeds to in-license, acquire or invest
in complementary technologies, products or assets. However we have no current
plan, commitments or obligations to do so.

Based on our current operation plans and assumptions, we believe that such
proceeds, together with our existing cash, will be sufficient to fund our
operations until at least the end of 2017. However, changing circumstances may
cause us to increase our spending significantly faster than we currently
anticipate, and we may need to spend more money than currently expected because
of circumstances beyond our control. We may require additional capital for the
further development and commercialization of our drug product candidates and may
need to raise additional funds sooner if we choose to expand more rapidly than
we presently anticipate. We cannot be certain that additional funding will be
available on acceptable terms, or at all. We have no committed source of
additional capital and if we are unable to raise additional capital in
sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, we may have to significantly
delay, scale back or discontinue the development or commercialization of our
drug product candidates or other research and development initiatives. Our
licenses may also be terminated if we are unable to meet the payment obligations
under the agreements. We could be required to seek collaborators for our drug
product candidates at an earlier stage than otherwise would be desirable or on
terms that are less favorable than might otherwise be available or relinquish or
license on unfavorable terms our rights to our drug product candidates in
markets where we otherwise would seek to pursue development or commercialization
ourselves. Any these events could significantly harm our business, prospects,
financial condition and results of operations and cause the price of our ADSs
and our ordinary shares to decline.

We currently have no specific plans as to how the net proceeds from the global
offering will be allocated beyond the uses specified above and therefore
management will retain discretion to allocate the remainder of the net proceeds
of the global offering among these uses.

This expected use of the net proceeds from the global offering represents our
intentions based upon our current plans and business conditions. As of the date
of this prospectus, we cannot predict with certainty all of the particular uses
for the net proceeds to be received upon the completion of the global offering
or the amounts that we will actually spend on the uses set forth above. The
amounts and timing of our actual expenditures and the extent of clinical
development may vary significantly depending on numerous factors, including the
progress of our development efforts, the status of and results from pre-clinical
studies and any ongoing clinical trials or clinical trials we may commence in
the future, as well as any collaborations that we may enter into with third
parties for our drug product candidates and any unforeseen cash needs. As a
result, our management will retain broad discretion over the allocation of the
net proceeds from the global offering.

Pending our use of the net proceeds from the global offering, we intend to
invest the net proceeds in a variety of capital preservation investments,
including short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing instruments.


The industry in which we operate is subject to rapid technological change. We
face competition from pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and medical devices
companies, as well as from academic and research institutions. Some of these
competitors are pursuing the development of medicinal products and other
therapies that target the same diseases and conditions that we are targeting.

Some of our current or potential competitors, either alone or with their
collaboration partners, have significantly greater financial resources and
expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing,
conducting clinical trials and marketing approved products than we do. Mergers
and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and gene therapy
industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller
number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be
significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with
large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in
recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and
establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials,
as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our
programs.

Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors
develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or
less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any
products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other
regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval
for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market
position before we are able to enter the market. The key competitive factors
affecting the success of all of our programs are likely to be their efficacy,
safety and convenience.

C-Cure

We have identified several companies that are active in cardiac cell therapy as
of the date of this prospectus, including Aldagen, Inc., Athersys, Inc., Cytori
Therapeutics, Inc., Mesoblast Ltd and Vericel Corporation.

CAR T-Cell Therapy

Early results from clinical trials have fueled continued interest in CAR T-cell
therapies and our competitors include Bellicum Pharmaceuticals, Inc., bluebird
bio, Inc., Cellectis S.A., Juno Therapeutics, Inc., Kite Pharma Inc., Novartis
AG and Ziopharm Oncology, Inc.


Company Description
We are a leader in engineered cell therapy treatments with clinical programs
initially targeting indications in cardiovascular disease and oncology. Our lead
drug product candidate in cardiovascular disease is C-Cure, an autologous cell
therapy for the treatment of patients with ischemic heart


 failure, or HF. We
completed enrollment in our first Phase 3 clinical trial of C-Cure in Europe and
Israel, or CHART-1, in March 2015. On March 30, 2015, we announced that the Data
Safety Monitoring Board, or DSMB, reviewed unblinded safety and efficacy data
from CHART-1 and determined that such unblinded safety and efficacy data did not
support the discontinuation of the trial on the basis of safety or futility.
These observations suggested that the trial should be continued in its current
form. The full data readout from this trial is expected in the middle of 2016.
We anticipate initiating our second Phase 3 clinical trial of C-Cure in the
United States and Europe, or CHART-2, pending U.S. Food and Drug Administration,
or FDA, lifting of the existing clinical hold, which we expect in the second
half of 2015. Our lead drug product candidate in oncology is CAR-NKG2D, an
autologous chimeric antigen receptor, or CAR, an artificial, lab engineered
receptor, which is used to graft a given protein onto an immune cell, T
lymphocyte, or CAR T-cell, therapy. We are currently enrolling patients with
refractory or relapsed acute myeloid leukemia, or AML, or multiple myeloma, or
MM, in a Phase 1 clinical trial of CAR-NKG2D in the United States. The first
patient was treated in this trial in April 2015 and no treatment-related safety
concerns were reported during the 30-day follow-up period. Interim data from
this trial is expected to be reported at various times during the trial, with
the full data readout expected in the middle of 2016.

All of our current drug product candidates are autologous cell therapy
treatments. In autologous procedures, a patient’s cells are harvested, selected,
reprogrammed and expanded, and then infused back into the same patient. A
benefit of autologous therapies is that autologous cells are not recognized as
foreign by patients’ immune systems. We believe that we are well situated to
effectively advance autologous cell therapy treatments for cancer and other
indications as a result of the expertise and know-how that we have acquired
through our development of C-Cure.

C-CURE FOR ISCHEMIC HEART FAILURE

Cardiovascular diseases, which are diseases of the heart and blood vessels, are
the largest cause of mortality in the world and, in 2012, approximately 31% of
all global deaths were attributable to cardiovascular diseases according to the
World Health Organization. If left untreated, cardiac diseases can lead to HF, a
condition in which the heart is unable to pump enough blood to meet the body’s
metabolic needs. HF affects 1% to 2% of the adult population in developed
countries and approximately 5.7 million patients were diagnosed with HF in the
United States in 2012, according to the American Heart Association. HF can
either be of ischemic origin, linked to impairment of blood flow to the heart
muscle, or non-ischemic origin, linked to other causes such as hypertension and
metabolic disorders. In the Bromley heart failure study, 52% of the patients had
HF of ischemic origin. Other studies have reported lower rates of ischemic HF,
but such differences can be explained by differences in study population,
definitions and timing of when the study was completed. The long-term prognosis
associated with HF is dire, with approximately 50% mortality at five years
following initial diagnosis according to a 2014 report from the American Heart
Association. HF is classified according to the severity of the symptoms
experienced by the patient. The classification most commonly used in the New
York Heart Association, or NYHA, classification, where patients are classified
from Class I, where there is no limitation on a patient’s physical activity to
Class IV, where the patient is unable to carry on any physical activity without
discomfort. Although existing therapies have been somewhat effective in the
treatment of HF, there is still great unmet medical need. In particular, in the
case of ischemic HF, which is caused by insufficient oxygen to the heart,
current treatments fail to address the decrease in the number of functional
myocytes, or heart cells, in the heart that result from this lack of oxygen.

Our lead drug product candidate, C-Cure, is an autologous cell therapy that we
believe has the potential to treat patients with NYHA, Classes II, III and IV
ischemic HF. To guide cardiac tissue formation, our C-Cure therapy reprograms
multipotent stem cells harvested from a patient into cardiopoietic cells, cells
that can become myocytes, using naturally occurring cytokines, small proteins
that play an important role in cell signaling, and growth factors that mimic the
signaling that occurs in embryonic heart tissue development. Based on
pre-clinical studies, we have identified both direct and indirect modes of
action for C-Cure. The direct mode may replace non-functioning myocytes. In the
indirect modes, factors secreted by the cardiopoietic cells may cause patients’
resident stem cells to begin pooling, regenerating and differentiating into
cardiac cells, with the resulting favorable environment inducing the
non-functioning myocytes to regain function. We have developed C-Cure
predominantly based on technology that we licensed from the Mayo Foundation for
Medical Education and Research, or the Mayo Clinic. To assist in the reinjection
of cardiopoietic cells, we have also developed C-Cathez, which we believe will
achieve a higher retention rate of cells in the heart relative to the commercial
catheter we used in our prior clinical trial.

In the C-Cure process, stem cells are collected from an ischemic HF patient
through bone marrow aspiration during an outpatient procedure. The stem cells
are then harvested, selected, expanded and differentiated into cardiopoietic
cells at our manufacturing facility, yielding a homogeneous and pure
cardiopoietic cell population. The cardiopoietic cells are then re-injected into
the heart of the ischemic HF patient with our C-Cathez cell injection catheter.

Phase 2 Clinical Trial

The first human clinical Phase 2 trial for C-Cure was completed in 2012. A total
of 45 ischemic HF patients were enrolled in this trial, with the primary
endpoint being the safety and feasibility of C-Cure. Positive outcomes were
observed in this trial. Patients treated with C-Cure showed a 25% relative
improvement of median left ventricular ejection fraction, or LVEF, which is the
percentage of blood that is pumped out of the heart at each beat, at six months
versus baseline, whereas untreated patients showed a relative improvement of
0.7% versus baseline. Patients treated with C-Cure also demonstrated an improved
exercise capacity as measured by the six minutes walking distance test, or six
minutes WDT, which measures the distance a patient can walk in a six minute
period. The C-Cure treatment group’s walking distance improved by 77 meters
compared to the control group.

Phase 3 Clinical Program

We are pursuing clinical development of C-Cure through a comprehensive Phase 3
program comprised of two Phase 3 clinical trials, CHART-1 and CHART-2.

CHART-1

CHART-1 is being conducted in the Europe and Israel and was first authorized in
November 2012. CHART-1 is a 240 patient prospective controlled randomized
double-blinded trial, including NYHA Class III and IV ischemic HF patients, with
each patient having a 50% chance of being assigned to the C-Cure treatment group
or the control group. The primary endpoint of this trial is an improvement in
the composite hierarchical endpoint comprised of mortality, morbidity, quality
of life, six minutes WDT, left ventricular end systolic volume and LVEF. Each
patient in the C-Cure treatment group will be compared to each patient in the
control group and a comprehensive score will be derived to compare one group
against the other.

As of the date of this prospectus, we have completed enrollment of all patients
in this trial at over 30 trial sites in Europe and Israel. On March 30, 2015, we
announced that DSMB reviewed unblinded safety and efficacy data from CHART-1 and
determined that such unblinded safety and efficacy data did not support the
discontinuation of the trial on the basis of safety or futility. These
observations suggested that the trial should be continued in its current form.
The full data readout from this trial is expected in the middle of 2016.

CHART-2

CHART-2 is expected to be conducted in the United States and Europe. CHART-2 is
a 240 patient prospective controlled randomized double-blinded trial, including
NYHA Class III and IV ischemic HF patients, with each patient having a 50%
chance of being assigned to the C-Cure treatment group or the control group. Our
Investigational New Drug Application, or IND, for the use of C-Cure in CHART-2
was initially submitted to the FDA in January 2012. This IND became effective in
December 2013 for administration of the cells with Myostar, a catheter used for
the injection of therapeutic agents into the heart, and manufactured by
Biologics Delivery Systems Group, Cordis Corporation, a Johnson & Johnson
company. Prior to initiating the trial, in September 2014, we filed an amendment
to the IND requesting among other changes to the initial submission, the use of
our proprietary cell injection catheter called C-Cathez. In January 2015, the
FDA issued a clinical hold on CHART-2. Most of the clinical hold questions
request clarifications on the design dossier of C-Cathez, while the remaining
questions relate to providing updated safety information on CHART-1, defining
CHART-2 stopping rules, and a request to measure troponin, a cardiac marker of
injury, at day 30 post baseline procedure. We anticipate responding to the
clinical hold questions in the third quarter of 2015 once all safety data from
CHART-1 is available, and pending the FDA’s lifting of the clinical hold,
initiating CHART-2 during the second half of 2015.

CAR T-CELL THERAPY FOR ONCOLOGY

Our approach to CAR T-cell therapy has the potential to treat a wider range of
cancers than other CAR T-cell therapies that target the CD19 antigen, or CD19
CAR Therapy. Our lead CAR T-cell drug product candidate is CAR-NKG2D, which has
shown promising data in pre-clinical solid and blood cancer models, including
for the treatment of lymphoma, ovarian cancer and myeloma. CAR-NKG2D is
constructed using the native sequence of non-engineered natural killer, or NK,
cell receptors that target ligands present in numerous cancer cells. Ligands are
substances bound together to form a larger complex, such as an antigen bound to
other molecules. Accordingly, our technology has the potential to attack and
kill a broad range of solid and blood cancers, while CD19 CAR Therapy is
typically only effective in treating B lymphocyte, or B-cell, malignancies.

In pre-clinical studies, treatment with CAR-NKG2D significantly increased
survival. In some studies, 100% of treated mice survived through the follow-up
period of the applicable study, which in one study was 325 days. All untreated
mice died during the follow-up period of the applicable study. We are currently
enrolling patients with certain types of AML or MM in a Phase1 clinical trial to
test the safety and feasibility of single-dose intravenous administration of
CAR-NKG2D without prior lymphodepletion conditioning, which is the destruction
of lymphocytes and T-cells, normally by radiation. This trial is being conducted
at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute in the United States and interim data is
expected to be reported throughout the trial, with the full data readout
expected in the middle of 2016. The first patient was treated in this trial in
April 2015 and no treatment-related safety concerns were reported during the
30-day follow-up period. A pre-defined, staggered enrollment of two additional
patients at the same dose level as the first patient is expected to occur now
that the 30-day follow-up period for the first patient has ended. We obtained
access to our CAR T-cell drug product candidates and related technology,
including technology licensed from the Trustees of Dartmouth College, or
Dartmouth College, in January 2015, through our purchase of OnCyte, LLC, or
OnCyte, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Celdara Medical, LLC, a privately-held U.S.
biotechnology company.

About Celyad's NKR Platform
Celyad is developing a unique Natural Killer Receptor (NKR) based T-Cell platform to target a wide range of solid and hematological tumors. Unlike traditional CAR-T cell therapy, which target only one tumor antigen, Natural Killer (NK) cell receptors enable a single receptor to recognize multiple tumor antigens.
Celyad's lead candidate, NKR-2, is a T-Cell engineered to express the human NK receptor, NKG2D, which is an activating receptor that triggers cell killing through the binding of NKG2D to any of eight naturally occurring ligands that are known to be overexpressed on more than 80% of tumors.
Preclinical results indicate that NKR-2 has multiple mechanism of actions and goes beyond direct killing by signifying that its encoded T-Cells attack the tumor cells, inhibit the mechanisms that enable tumors to evade the immune system, activate and recruit anti-tumor immune cells and disrupt the blood supply to the tumor. These mechanisms promote the induction of adaptive immunity, meaning the body develops a long-term cell immune memory against specific tumor antigens of the targeted tumor.
In contrast to traditional CAR-T therapeutic approaches, and based on strong preclinical evidence, Celyad's current NKR-2 program does not employ patient lymphodepleting pre-conditioning, thereby avoiding the toxicities associated with chemotherapy and allowing the immune system to remain intact.
Celyad is developing both autologous and allogeneic NKR-2 administrations. For autologous NKR-2, Celyad collects the patient's own T-Cells and engineers them to express NKG2D in order to target cancer cells effectively. Celyad's allogeneic platform engineers the T-Cells of healthy donors, that also express TCR Inhibitory Molecules (TIMs), to avoid having the engineered donor cells be rejected by the patient's normal tissues.
The preclinical research underlying this technology was originally conducted at Dartmouth College by Dr. Charles Sentman and has been published extensively in peer-reviewed publications.
NKR-2 is currently being tested in a Phase I trial in acute myeloid leukemia and multiple myeloma patients. The trial is designed to assess the safety and feasibility of NKR-2, with secondary endpoints including clinical activity. Key research investigations include understanding the persistence of NKR-2 cells within the patient.

Celyad SA Key Developments

Celyad Announces Initiation of the SHRINK Trial
Jul 20 17
Celyad SA/NV announced the initiation of the SHRINK trial, a third clinical trial with its lead product candidate CYAD-01 (CAR-T NKG2D), targeting metastatic colorectal patients. SHRINK(Standard CHemotherapy Regimen and Immunotherapy with NKR-2) is an open-label Phase I study evaluating the safety and clinical activity of multiple doses of CYAD-01, administered concurrently with the neoadjuvant FOLFOX treatment in patients with potentially resectable liver metastases from colorectal cancer. SHRINK will be conducted in Belgium in key oncology centers. It contains a dose escalation and an extension stage. The dose escalation design will include three dose levels adjusted to body weight: up to 3x108, 1x109 and 3x109 of CYAD-01. At each dose, the patients will receive three successive administrations, two weeks apart at the specified dose. The dose escalation part of the study will enroll up to 18 patients while the extension phase would enroll 21 additional patients. The colorectal cancer indication evaluated in the SHRINK trial was selected based on evidence generated in the pre-clinical settings and in the ongoing THINK study. SHRINK is Celyad’s third clinical trial of its CYAD-01 product candidate, a CAR-T cell therapy using NKG2D ligands as a target. The two other trials are CM-CS1 (completed) and THINK (ongoing).


Celyad Publishes Additional Pre-Clinical Data in Support of Think Trial
Jun 22 17
Celyad SA announced that it has published a special report in the peer-reviewed journal Future Oncology summarizing pre-clinical work undertaken on NKR-2, the CAR-T cell therapy currently tested in the company's THINK trial. Celyad's special report entitled Exploiting Natural Killer Group 2D Receptors for CAR-T cell therapy discloses new results confirming the potency of CAR-T NKR-2 cells against various human cancer cell lines in vitro including leukemia, colorectal and pancreatic cancer. Furthermore, new data show the ability of CAR-T NKR-2 cells to effectively challenge established pancreatic cancer xenografts in humanized mouse models. These pre-clinical studies were performed with Celyad's long-term collaborator Professor Charles Sentman and further confirm the choice of indications being investigated in the ongoing THINK trial.


Celyad Reports Promising Early Results at First Dose Level of the Solid Arm of the Think Trial
Jun 19 17
Celyad announced promising early clinical results at the 3-month follow-up of the first dose-level in the solid tumor arm of the THINK trial (THerapeutic Immunotherapy with CAR-T NKR-2). At the first 3 x 108 cell dose-level administered to a total of three patients with metastatic cancer, the two colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients, who were progressing after at least two prior chemotherapy regimens, achieved a confirmed Stable Disease (SD) according to RECIST criteria at three months. According to recent studies conducted on similar patient populations, median progression free survival in these patients under standard of care is between 1.9 and 3.2 months. The third patient, a refractory pancreatic patient, was in progression at the same time point. No toxicity signals were observed in any of the patients. Patients in the second dose of the solid tumor arm (1 x 109)are currently being enrolled and treated. CAR-T NKR-2 cells have so far showed a safety profile that could allow an outpatient clinical approach. The hematological cancer dose escalation arm, including relapsing/refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) and Multiple Myeloma (MM) patients, is progressing. The first dose patients have been registered and are being treated with no toxicity signals to date. The THINK trial, conducted in the US and in Europe, includes two stages: a dose escalation and an extension stage. The dose escalation is being conducted in parallel in solid cancers (colorectal, pancreatic, ovarian, triple negative breast and bladder) and in hematologic (AML and MM) cancer groups, while the extension phase will evaluate in parallel each tumor type independently. The dose escalation design includes three dose levels adjusted to body weight: up to 3x108, 1x109 and 3x109 NKR-2 CAR T-cells. At each dose, the patients receive three successive administrations, two weeks apart, of NKR-2 CAR T-cells at the specified dose. NKR-2 CAR T-cell therapy was designed to act as a targeted therapy with short term persistence and multiple injections in order to provide a better controlled and more predictable safety profile. The primary objective is to avoid uncontrolled in vivo cell expansion and long-term persistence thereby replacing this paradigm with well controlled pharmacokinetics.

NKR-2 is a CAR-T product candidate using NKG2D, an NK Cell activating receptor transduced on T lymphocytes. “We are pleased with the early evidence of activity in AML and MM patients in our low single dose regime testing. This efficacy and clean safety profile support our belief that NKR-2 is differentiated from other CAR-T therapies in development,” said Dr. Christian Homsy, CEO of Celyad. “We look forward to initiating our THINK (Therapeutic Immunotherapy with NKR-2) study designed to evaluate NKR-2 at higher doses and with multiple administrations in both solid and liquid tumors in the near term.” Data presented demonstrate the drug to be safe and well tolerated in the highest dose level tested to date (3×107) as well as showing early efficacy signals, including prolonged survival in both AML and MM patients. Highlights of the data include: Strong safety signals, including no cases of cytokine release syndrome, cell-related neurotoxicity, auto-immunity, or CAR-T related death.Although no blast reduction was observed, an AML patient reported no progression (3+months) and improvement in all hematological parameters under no additional therapy at the highest dose (3×107).Other previously reported patients also showed prolonged survival with unanticipated responses to subsequent treatments, and improvements in hematological parameters despite aggressiveness of baseline disease.In vitro testing of the two patients for which tumor samples were available showed that CAR-T NKR-2 destroyed tumor cells, confirming the relevance of the previously published pre-clinical work.Dr. Frédéric Lehmann, VP Clinical Development & Medical Affairs at Celyad: “We are very encouraged by these interim clinical and correlative data of this Phase I safety trial evaluating CAR-T NKR-2 in refractory AML and multiple myeloma patients who have limited or no treatment options. Celyad is eagerly awaiting the initiation of the THINK study designated to evaluate CAR-T NKR-2 at higher doses and with a multiple administrations schedule in these hematological indications and in five solid tumor types.” CAR-T NKR-2 Phase I trial data results were presented at the poster session of the ASH Annual Meeting, on Monday, December 5th 2016.Title: Safety Data from a First-in-Human Phase 1 Trial of NKG2D Chimeric Antigen Receptor-T Cells in AML/MDS and Multiple Myeloma (Poster Presentation)Abstract: 4052Session: 616. Acute Myeloid Leukemia: Novel Therapy, excluding Transplantation: Poster IIILocation: San Diego Convention Center, Hall GH About the CAR-T NKR-2 Phase 1 Trial The CAR-T NKR-2 Phase I trial is a single infusion, dose escalation study evaluating the safety and feasibility of NKR-2 CAR-T cells in AML and MM patients. 12 patients were treated at low escalating doses NKR-2 cells (max 3×107). This study was completed in September 2016 with a successful safety follow-up for all dose level cohorts. Conference Call Details (Conference ID: 30079023) A conference call will be held on Wednesday, December 7, 2016 at 2:00pm (CET) / 8:00am (EDT) to review the topline results of the CAR-T NKR-2 Phase I safety trial and to present NKR-T clinical development plan with the initiation of the THINK trial.

For autologous NKR-2, Celyad collects the patient’s own T-Cells and engineers them to express NKG2D in order to target cancer cells effectively. Celyad’s allogeneic platform engineers the T-Cells of healthy donors, that also express TCR Inhibitory Molecules (TIMs), to avoid having the engineered donor cells be rejected by the patient’s normal tissues (also called Graft vs. Host Disease). The preclinical research underlying this technology was originally conducted at Dartmouth College byDr. Charles Sentman and has been published extensively in peer-reviewed publications. For more information, please contact: For Europe: Consilium Strategic CommunicationsChris Gardner and Chris Welsh – T: +44 (0)20 3709 5700 – celyad@consilium-comms.comFor France: NewCapPierre Laurent and Nicolas Mérigeau – T: + 33(0)1 44 71 94 94 – celyad@newcap.euFor Belgium: ComfiGunther De Backer and Sabine Leclercq – T.: +32 (0)2 290 90 90 – celyad@comfi.beFor the U.S.: Stern Investor RelationsWill O’Connor and Michael Schaffzin – T.: +1 212.362.1200 – celyad@sternir.comTo subscribe to Celyad’s newsletter, visit www.celyad.comFollow us on LinkedIn & Twitter @CelyadSA Forward looking statements In addition to historical facts or statements of current condition, this press release contains forward-looking statements, including statements about the potential safety and feasibility of CAR-T NKR-2 cell therapy and C-Cure, which reflect our current expectations and projections about future events, and involve certain known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are further qualified by important factors, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements, including risks associated with on-going ex parte re-examination of the Company’s U.S. patent number 9,181,527, including the risk that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office may decide to cancel all or a portion of the claims contained therein, risks associated with conducting clinical trials; the risk that safety, bioactivity, feasibility and/or efficacy demonstrated in earlier clinical or pre-clinical studies may not be replicated in subsequent studies; risk associated with the timely submission and approval of anticipated regulatory filings; the successful initiation and completion of clinical trials, including Phase III clinical trials for C-Cure® and Phase I clinical trial for CAR-T NKR-2; risks associated with the satisfaction of regulatory and other requirements; risks associated with the actions of regulatory bodies and other governmental authorities; risks associated with obtaining, maintaining and protecting intellectual property, our ability to enforce our patents against infringers and defend our patent portfolio against challenges from third parties; risks associated with competition from others developing products for similar uses; risks associated with our ability to manage operating expenses; and risks associated with our ability to obtain additional funding to support our business activities and establish and maintain strategic business alliances and business initiatives. A further list and description of these risks, uncertainties and other risks can be found in the Company’s Securities and Exchange Commission filings and reports, including in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 20-F filed with the SEC on April 8, 2016 and future filings and reports by the Company.
