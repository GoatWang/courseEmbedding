“The mamaRoo is calming because it provides
an environment that is similar to still being in
utero – babies feel contained, they’re moving,
there’s a bit of sound – and we find that very
soothing for our babies.”


– Alan Lantzy, MD; Neonatologist and Pediatrician

Love the updates!



First, I had the third generation of this product and loved it, after using this version, I fell in love all over again. My son enjoys the car ride feature the most and loves to just lounge in it. The updated keypad area and mobile were the top changes made that I liked! I would highly recommend any parent to purchase this product!


KMD11







My baby loves her mamaRoo!



My baby girl (2months) loves this mamaRoo. She will sit it in, entertained, for anywhere from 30-40 mins at a time. It gives me enough time to do the dishes, laundry, and clean up her brother's toys. The features are really easy to use. It even comes with an app to control it from your smartphone. It was very simple to set up and put together. My girl also loves all of the different motions and sounds (esp. the heart beat). If you want a modern, stylish, user friendly, and functional baby seat I would recommend this mamaRoo.


KateBT







Excellent product



My baby loves his mamaroo! The balls are his favorite. Smooth motions and great controls, easy to use and assemble. Love the app that accompanies the product. Wish I would have had this with my first baby.


RNCLE







Functional & Chic!



Loved how easy the MamaRoo4 was to assemble! My son loved the different motions and the mobile (although I wished it would have had the option to move). Better than any swing I have used and it doesn't take up a lot of room. You can easily remove the fabric for washings which was another bonus since my baby has reflux and spits up several times a day.


LauraLou20







Fun and functional!



My little guy loves the mamaroo! He loves the movement-it really helped calm him. I love the sleek design and plush fabric which is easy to remove for washing.

Believe in better™


Parents don't vibrate like bouncy seats or swing like swings. We believe that infant seats would be better if they replicated the natural motions parents use to comfort their babies. That's why we created the
4moms®
mamaRoo®4
infant seat. We put sensor vests on parents to understand those motions and then replicated the bouncing and swaying in the mamaRoo to soothe and entertain better than traditional infant seats.

Join our team
4moms is a special place. We accomplish great things and have a great time doing it.
Our mission is to develop DRAMATICALLY BETTER juvenile products and build a GREAT COMPANY. But what's that mean?
Well, dramatically better products redefine the most important attribute in their category. Take a look at the origami's power, the mamaRoo's motions or the breeze's fold and we think you'll understand what we're after.
 And great companies care about more than just financial success. Just look through our photo albums on Facebook and you see that 4moms is more than a company, we're a family. We treat people like they are our most important asset, because they are.
Do you want to be part of 4moms?  Take a look at our openings below and see if there's a fit.  We're looking forward to hearing from YOU!

Believe in better™


Traditional high chair trays are tricky - you have to line up the rails and coordinate the latches to attach them. We believed that high chairs would be better if the tray was simple to use. That's why we created the 4moms® high chair. Magnetic latches make it easy to attach the tray and the magnetic tray top holds 4moms plates and bowls in place - making mealtime less stressful.

Marketing to Moms: Youâ€™re Doing It All Wrong


Women control $13 trillion in consumer spending. But most of the assumptions you make about them in your marketing are way off.

Want to grow your business? Try marketing differently to women.
“Women make the majority of purchase decisions for almost every product category in the marketplace, and that includes automotive, electronics, and insurance,” says Kat Gordon, founder and Creative Director of Maternal Instinct, a marketing agency focused on helping brands connect with the mom market. “In fact, only three online purchase categories are driven more by men than women: music, auctions, and computer hardware.
“Even so,  research tells us 71 percent of women feel brands only consider them for beauty and cleaning products. If your company sells something other than ‘mops and makeup,’ you’ve got a tremendous opportunity to catapult your brand to new places.”
How big is that opportunity? According to Gordon, women currently control $13 trillion of the world’s $18.4 trillion in consumer spending. And with more women working and an ever-narrowing wage gap, women’s influence over shopping decisions should continue to increase.
Here’s Gordon’s advice on how any business can better reach, appeal, and retain female customers:
How to reach women:
Skate where the puck is. Women are already online in droves, especially on Facebook. Find a community where your customer hangs out and sponsor or enable it. Don’t build a new community and expect her to change her habits. She’s too busy to bother.
Make it mobile. If your site isn’t optimized for mobile, make that your first priority. Moms in particular conduct a lot of business from their phones, and no wonder—research shows they spend 17 days a year in the car with their kids.
Video, video, and more video. Women are heavy video users; the average woman watches over 90 minutes of YouTube videos each month. Over 80 percent of moms look for online videos to see a product in action. If your product does something, find a way to show, don’t tell.
How to appeal to women:
Don’t “enter talking.” Earn the right to a conversation with a female consumer by making your opening line one of recognition, not sales. Gordon calls this a “bridge thought.” Think about what you would say to greet a friend, not to woo a prospect.
Do a humor check. Humor can be a remarkably effective way to connect with women, but only if it’s the right humor. What’s funny to men is often mystifying, or worse, insulting, to women. Before you run a new marketing campaign run it past as many women as you can.
Show diversity. Only 4 percent of households fit the June Cleaver blueprint: working father, stay-at-home mom, and kids under 18. Revisit the text and images on your website and expand how you depict women—and especially the assumptions you make about her life.
Run female-created work. When you hire an ad agency, chances are your campaigns will originate from a male sensibility since only 3 percent of creative directors are women. You’re paying the bill, so you call the shots. Demand female representation on your account.
Give back. When price and quality are equal, 82 percent of women report they are more likely to buy from companies that support a charitable cause they care about. Women also report they will try a product or switch brands if they feel doing so will help others. Find a cause you believe in that aligns with your brand, then highlight your donation, especially at touch points where you ask for a sale.
How to retain female customers:
Thank her.  Few companies take the time to express genuine appreciation for a sale or referral. Be the exception. A sincere “thank you” is like catnip to women.
Offer outstanding service. List your phone number on every page of your website and never subject women to phone tree hell. Answer your phones and respond to emails and tweets. She will not just stay a customer—she will tell everyone she knows.
Practice story-selling. The more you put a human face on your organization, the more invested a female consumer will be in your success. Practice “story-selling” in your consumer communications, sharing rich details about your employees, community, and any lore around the creation of your products.
Ask for feedback. The most valuable insight about your product or service is yours for the asking. So ask. She’ll tell you.

Who is Scholarships4Moms?
Scholarships4Moms is owned and operated by FreeCollegeScholarships, LLC. We are a small, private company located in San Francisco, California. FreeCollegeScholarships, LLC was founded in 2005 and operates an education and media online business. We have been awarding $10,000 scholarships since 2005 and in this time we've awarded over $1,000,000 in scholarships. The Scholarship money is provided by us, we’re able to award the scholarship because we show advertisements for colleges and universities as well as other educational services on our website. We uphold the values and requirements for both the Better Business Bureau and privacy companies to maintain our memberships each year.


What is the entry process?
Entry for the scholarship and our school matching service is quick and easy. First, simply complete the Entry Page, once you hit 'Submit' you will be added to the entry pool for the upcoming drawing date. Next, if you choose, you can view offers available from the colleges and universities advertising on our site. You can request information from these schools and they will contact you with more information. This is not a required step to complete your entry. Be sure to check your email for the confirmation message.


This sounds too good to be true, what's the catch?
This is real, and entry, which is used to connect students with education programs, is free. We award a new winner on a quarterly basis. Since 2005, we have awarded over $1,000,000. But, don't take it from us, hear what our winners have to say: Here


How is my information used?
The quality, transparency and security of this site have been certified by the BBB(Better Business Bureau) and privacy companies, and we collect only what information we operationally require. Before submitting personal information, please read our privacy policy for information on how we gather and use what information you submit.


How many people enter to win the scholarship?
There are no limits on the number of entrants we can accept within each entry time frame. The number of eligible applicants varies for each drawing date but it is approximately 1:250,000. One winner will be selected by a random drawing from all eligible pooled from our multiple websites.


How can I use my money if I win?
Winners of our scholarship can use the money for any educational opportunity. Some past winners have used the money to help pay for college tuition, books or paying off student loans. Please note that a scholarship is tax free only if you are a candidate for a degree at an eligible education institution. An eligible education institution is one that provides a program that is acceptable for full credit towards a bachelors or higher degree, or offers a program of training to prepare students for gainful employment in a recognized occupation; and is authorized under federal or state law to provide such a program and is accredited by a nationally recognized accreditation agency. The prize money must be used for qualified education expenses for the original entrant.
Qualified education expenses do not include the cost of room and board, travel, research, clerical help, or equipment and other expenses that are not required for enrollment in or attendance in an eligible education institution.


Do I have to use the $10K money for a specific school or program?
If you're the lucky winner, you are required to use the scholarship to pay for education and/or related expenses. We do not require you to be enrolled in a particular college or university, but you do need to be a student or planning to enroll within 3 months to be eligible. Upon winning the prize money, you must provide proof of enrollment otherwise you will be deemed ineligible to receive the prize money. Previous winners have used the money for college tuition, books or paying off student loans.


Do I have to pay it back?
Nope! The $10,000 scholarship is funded by Free College Scholarships and is not a loan. You may need to pay taxes on the prize, however.


How will I know if I'm the winner?
If you are selected as the winner of our $10,000 giveaway, we will contact you directly either by email, telephone, regular U.S. postal mail, or by overnight carrier. If we cannot contact you after reasonable effort within two days after our first attempt to contact you, we will select an alternate winner.


Do I need to sign up with the schools to be qualified for the scholarship?
No it is not a requirement to sign up with a school. You are not obligated to accept free information from our sponsors, and your chances of being awarded our scholarship will not be affected. You are not obligated to purchase any product or services, regardless of whether you request any free information from our sponsors. However, if you're interested in going back to school, you can request information during the entry process.
