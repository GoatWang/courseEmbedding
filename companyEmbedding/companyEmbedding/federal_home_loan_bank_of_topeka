Diversity & Inclusion
 



Attention Diverse Vendors: We welcome businesses who qualify as diverse and meet guidelines to register as an FHLBank Topeka diverse supplier. We recently changed our registration site and invite businesses to register at the link at the right.
 
FHLBank's mission is to make a difference by helping our members build their communities. These communities include a variety of people, cultures and businesses. In order to deliver on our mission we must employ a diverse group of business partners who bring different experiences, ideas and perspectives to the table. This results in better decision making, relevant products and a strong, inclusive work culture. We believe this strengthens our brand and fosters the kind of innovation our members seek and deserve.

 
At the core of our philosophy is the principle of respect for each individual. This fundamental commitment to respect guides FHLBank in all of our business operations. It means embracing diverse viewpoints, cultures and ideas in all that we do. How do we do that? 

 


We develop strong relationships with diverse organizations, we accept all people, we volunteer our time and we actively participate in charitable giving.



 
We embrace diversity across all levels of our business, from recruiting and growing our business partners to selecting our suppliers. We recognize that by harnessing the power of our collective similarities and differences FHLBank is better able to deliver on our mission. We believe this makes FHLBank a better place to work and a better partner for our cooperative members.We believe this makes FHLBank a better place to work and a better partner for our cooperative members.

            Federal Home Loan Bank is a privately owned, federally chartered company that provides wholesale products and services to financial institutions wanting to expand the availability of mortgage credit. The bank offers several credit and mortgage products to financial institutions, including advances, letters of credit, derivative transactions and a mortgage partnership finance program. It also offers an array of services, such as deposit services, collateral, safekeeping, wire transfer and consolidated obligation direct placement. Serving nearly 900 banks, thrifts, credit unions and insurance companies, the bank has more than $40 billion in assets. It serves communities in Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska and Oklahoma. Federal Home Loan Bank was formed in 1932 when Congress, through the Federal Home Loan Bank Act, established a system of 12 home loan banks to offer financial support to thrift institutions. Federal Home Loan Bank employs nearly 160 people and maintains a location in Topeka, Kan.
