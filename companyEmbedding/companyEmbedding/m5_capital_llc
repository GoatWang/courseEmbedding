We don't just invest�
We bring time, energy, and passion.





Investment Strategy

Expertise, Integrity, and Passion are what define us. M5 Venture takes a strategic and opportunistic approach to investing. We want to help create enduring value.  Unlike most venture capital or private equity funds we take a long-term approach and are not limited by a fixed fund life or narrow investment mandates. We seek stellar people and ideas in attractive markets � we partner in business. Although our investments are not industry or sector focused, we are enticed by opportunities that exhibit the following characteristics:

Experienced teams with strong customer contacts and domain expertise
Business models with validated, recurring revenue, and high customer ROI
            Technology-driven businesses
Compete in niche or defensible market segments
Go-to-market strategies that leverage channel sales
Markets experiencing game changing growth or dislocation
Capital Efficient business models with significant upside
Businesses with visibility to near-term positive cash flow
Meaningful Ownership and Influence















Early Stage
M5 Venture selectively invests in early stage companies where we see significant opportunities for growth and future investment. We have the ability to see opportunity where others see challenge. We believe that startups with strong leadership and ideas with nominal to no revenue can flourish with appropriately deployed capital and the right strategic partners � partners that are company builders, market experts, and excellent board members.
We partner with visionary companies that exhibit intrinsic value and great commercial potential seeking to accelerate growth. Leverage our diverse experience, gain access to our robust advisor network, and partner with a team that values talented people just as much as the idea itself.
Investment Size: $100K to $3M per opportunity and prefer participation alongside syndicate partners







Expansion Capital 

M5 Venture invests expansion capital in emerging companies that are generating revenue but that might not be cash flow positive. We look for firms that have demonstrated unique propositions, commercial viability, and strong potential to scale.  With M5 Venture you get support and access to seasoned investors complemented with institutional-level resources.
We look to invest in companies with management teams that will execute the expansion plan supported by the invested time, capital, and human resources that M5 Venture provides. Our team has had extensive experience in operating companies and divisions from small to large and private to public. Our commitment to our portfolio companies is to leverage our experience and advisor network to ensure a roadmap of long-term success.
Investment Size: $2M  to $15M per opportunity and will lead or participate in syndicates














Growth Capital
M5 Venture targets growth capital investments in established middle-market companies with strong management teams that are seeking equity capital for growth.
Leveraging a new technology, commercializing a niche product, expanding product lines, consolidating a fragmented industry, or increasing the geographic footprint of a business are core growth elements for businesses in which we invest. More importantly, central to our investment principle is investing in talented entrepreneurs and management teams that can execute a well-crafted plan.
Investment Size: $5M to $20M per opportunity and will lead or participate in syndicates

Financial advisors use their knowledge of investments, 
tax laws, and insurance to recommend financial options to individuals.
The SEC typically regulates investment advisers that have assets under management in excess of $25,000,000. Investment advisers that do not meet this threshold generally are regulated by the states. The SEC registers IA firms but does not separately register individual representatives of IA firms. The states register IA firms, and many separately register individual investment adviser representatives.

Currently, you can only search for IA firms on this website. In the future, this website also will provide the ability to search for individual investment adviser representatives.

In 1996 Congress amended the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 to require that the SEC establish a readily accessible electronic process to respond to public inquiries about investment advisers and their disciplinary information. The SEC created this website to satisfy Congress? mandate.
