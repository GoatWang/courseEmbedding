Strategic Investments - Growth Platforms within Industry Verticals





























































 








Strategic Platform





Our investments are concentrated in six strategic industry verticals: software, semiconductors and IT hardware, retail and restaurants, industrials, IT and business services, and financial services.  Currently, Golden Gate holds investments in more than 35 companies across our six industry verticals. Because we maintain an active strategic presence in each of our industries, our companies often serve as growth platforms within their vertical market. As a result, the significant majority of our more than 160+ historical acquisitions have been made in conjunction with the platform companies that we own and operate. This unique capability enables us to be far more flexible and competitive than conventional private equity firms in valuing potential add-on acquisitions.

Verticals

 
Among Golden Gate’s strategic investments is Angel Island Capital, a dedicated specialty finance company managing over $3 billion of assets and capitalized with equity from the same perpetual investment pool that owns and controls our operating companies. This specialty finance company selectively facilitates the financing of our own investments as well as companies owned by others, uniquely extending the breadth of transactions in which we can participate.
On occasion, Golden Gate may also invest in publicly traded companies within our vertical markets, either directly or via a structured equity investment. We focus our investments in public companies on situations where we view these companies to be meaningfully undervalued based on our deep industry experience.

Operating Executives - Golden Gate Capital

























































 







Operating Executives



 

Golden Gate Capital’s success is contingent upon the strength and performance of its portfolio companies. To that end, our portfolio companies regularly engage industry professionals as Operating Executives or other consultants to help identify potential investment opportunities, assist in conducting due diligence on prospective portfolio companies, render operational and strategic advice, and to assist portfolio company management teams after our investment to effect change in certain areas. These professionals have significant experience working hands-on with companies to drive growth and profitability. These consultants are retained directly by one or more portfolio companies either as members of a company’s management team or on a project-oriented basis, and they also frequently serve on a portfolio company’s board of directors.
