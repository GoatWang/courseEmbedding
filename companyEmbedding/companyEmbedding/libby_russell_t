Libbey Restaurant Supplies and Equipment

Libbey Glassware Wholesale is Perfect for Any Business

															Founded in 1892, Libbey has become synonymous with quality glassware and tabletop supplies throughout the world. This is due to Libbey’s DuraTuff technology. DuraTuff is a strengthening, heat-treating process that makes glassware more resistant to both thermal and mechanical shock. When glass does break, it ensures it is in large chunks instead of exploding in small pieces, protecting your customers and saving valuable time cleaning up. Read more 



																Boasting hundreds of products with countless applications, Libbey glass comes in many varieties, so you can find an option for any occasion. From all purpose wine glasses to beer paddles and ash trays, Libbey's extensive catalog of fashionable glasses is guaranteed to complement and accent restaurants, ice cream shops, buffets, and more.
