Rethinking 
the ABC’s of 
early childhood 
parenting 





Social Impact
Every child born deserves an opportunity to thrive. To that end, WeeSchool is about leveling the playing field, starting from birth. We provide access to the best information and resources for all parents to use with all babies, regardless of a family’s socioeconomic, educational or cultural status. Digital distribution defies the confines of geography, giving WeeSchool global reach – at the touch of a button on a device used by billions of parents.
What we know is this: all parents want their children to be happy and successful, and the tools and resources we’re creating help them pursue that dream.







Our Team
Directors


Julie Clark •
CEO, WeeSchool
Best known for creating the wildly successful Baby Einstein Company, Julie is also a teacher, a mom, and the world’s best chocolate chip cookie maker. She’s written more than 30 bestselling children’s books, and attributes her love of literature to parents who read to her every day. Julie has traveled to every continent (including Antarctica!) with her husband and daughters, but especially loves her home state of Colorado, where she hikes, practices yoga, hangs out with her cats, enjoys gardening and makes cool stuff for babies.


Will Clark •
COO, WeeSchool
Though he dreamed of becoming an astronaut, Will instead has been starting businesses since the age of 17. He was named an Entrepreneur of the Year for founding Optical Data, a company that brought visual teaching strategies into classrooms across the country to help kids learn science. When wife Julie gave birth to the idea for Baby Einstein (after giving birth to their daughters), Will became the company’s COO, publisher and everything in-between. As a WeeSchool co-founder, Will loves making stuff and prefers the creative process that happens outside an office setting.


Luis Duarte •
Investment Officer, Gary Community Investment Company
Luis grew up in Chihuahua, Mexico, but now lives permanently with his wife, his two little boys and a miniature schnauzer in Denver, CO. As a mechanical engineer with an MBA, Luis first became interested in WeeSchool through his work with Gary Community Investments and his philanthropic focus on early childhood education. Known for his impeccable taste in men’s clothing, Luis sets a ridiculously high fashion standard for other WeeSchool Board members.


Lisa Stone •
Lisa Stone • Co-Founder, BlogHer
Though occasionally homesick for Montana, Lisa has learned to love Silicon Valley; it’s where she raised three kids and helped to create an entire movement in community and women as a co-founder of BlogHer. Lisa’s passions are storytelling, user aspiration, technology and karaoke – in that order – and she’s used all of them as a mom. An early Baby Einstein adopter, Lisa was happy to join the WeeSchool team as a Board member and advisor.


Don Warriner •
Managing Partner, Vonzos Partners
Don is an investor and business development exec with deep experience building, leading, funding and selling companies nationally and internationally. He’s currently a co-founder and Managing Partner of accelerator fund Vonzos Partners, and is a seed investor in WeeSchool. Don is the dad of two grown kids, can recommend a kick-ass bottle of wine for any meal, and as a fifth-generation Coloradan, can ski like nobody’s business.


Team Members


Joaquin Brown •
Senior Mobile Engineer
Wannabe rock-and-roll star Joaquin kicks butt as a senior mobile engineer when not practicing guitar or yoga. He’s the dad of one amazing little boy and two funny little cats. Joaquin hails from Culver City, CA, home of Sony Pictures, where he frequently can be found hiding sushi, his favorite food, from cats Jack and Oscar.


Mark Burr •
Video Director
Mark has been in film production and editing for over 30 years, but first became involved in children’s programming after meeting the Clarks in 1998. Few know his other special talent is as an ambidextrous puppeteer – a skill he picked up while creating Baby Einstein and WeeSchool puppet shows. Dad to two young kids, Mark frequently travels abroad to serve underprivileged communities in South America and Africa.


Carrie Germeroth, PhD •
Curriculum and Research Adviser
She’s a certified Hikemaster in Colorado, but Carrie also is WeeSchool’s early childhood expert. As the project manager for the development of the Colorado Early Learning and Development Guidelines, there’s no one who better understands the workings of wee minds and developmental milestones. Carrie also is a researcher and professional development provider for early childhood educators with The Marsico Institute for Early Learning and Literacy at the University of Denver. Her expertise is frequently put to good use with her own wee ones, both under 5 years old.


Jeff Mettais •
President
Jeff has been in the baby business since the birth of his first child 19 years ago, the same year he became the licensee of Baby Einstein products in Japan. Along with serving as WeeSchool’s president, Jeff enjoys regaling his coworkers with tales of his travel escapades, which include driving a jeep all over South America as a (much) younger man. Jeff’s areas of expertise are business development and international markets.



Betty Paxton •
Editorial Director
Mama to human boy Beck and canine boy Blade, editorial director Betty Paton has been an innovator in educational publishing for more than 25 years, even inventing a unique interactive method for effectively conveying information (for which she and Will Clark were awarded a patent). When she isn’t chest deep in researching and writing for WeeSchool, Betty dreams of traveling to Madagascar to check out the wildlife with her trusty camera (this lady takes stunning photos like nobody’s business). She’s also WeeSchool’s grammar whiz, happy to whip out the red pen for unnecessary apostrophes—especially those that are erroneously inserted when last names are pluralized. Please… just stop!


Eric Peterson •
Senior Server-Side Engineer
Fifth grade dodgeball champion, vegan chef and snowboard enthusiast, Eric handles systems architecture and development for WeeSchool. The only team member without kids or pets, Eric proudly shares photos of his adorable succulents when the rest of the gang discusses family. A former studio engineer and producer, he worked with the likes of Rihanna, Snoop Dogg, Pharell and other entertainers before building his own tech company, Linksee. Raised in Austin, TX, Eric is a world-renowned critic of Tex-Mex cuisine.


Rick Simms •
Chief Financial Officer
Rick, the company’s CFO and nonprofit networker, started life as an accountant and later served as CFO for various start-up companies. Rick currently serves as Board Chair for Mental Health Center of Denver. This grandfather of three rides his bike over three mountain passes in two days each summer (120 miles) as a top fundraiser for Colorado Children’s Hospital, and is one of WeeSchool’s earliest investors.


Bill Weisbach •
Music and Sound Design Director
Can you say “talented”? Give this guy an instrument and he’ll whip you up a song. Music and sound director Bill Weisbach has been a musician since he was a wee one, and has studied music composition, jazz performance and computer programming at various schools. He also invented the original ‘music box orchestra’ sound when working with Julie and Will Clark at Baby Einstein. Dad of one son, Bill has received four Gold Album awards from the RIAA, makes a mean omelet and enjoys inventing electro-acoustic instruments in his spare time.


Sarah Wohl •
UI/UX and Graphic Design
San Francisco-based design nerd, foodie and weekend adventurer, Sarah is the artist behind WeeSchool’s mobile app and website experiences. When not at her desk pushing pixels, she’s out exploring the Bay Area by motorcycle or teaching night classes for up-and-coming designers. She has a passion for pancakes, a severe case of wanderlust, and takes joy in creating delightful, meaningful and beautiful experiences that make people’s lives better.

Our Research


At WeeSchool, we are committed to giving all newborns the best possible start. That requires great parenting, and great parenting requires tools and resources that support sound, healthy development. Decades of academic research have provided profound insights into the nature of early childhood development and learning. We’ve turned those insights into practical, everyday approaches you can take to guide your wee one’s social, emotional, physical and cognitive development from birth to age 3.








How We Did It
We first scoured publications from trusted, nationally recognized institutions with a simple goal: To catalog what a child needs to know—and know how to do—to be successful in preschool. During our analysis, we reviewed…

National Association for the Education of Young Children Early
Childhood Program Standards (NAEYC)
National Council for the Social Studies curriculum standards (NCSS)
Head Start Child Development and Early Learning Framework (HSCD)
California Infant/Toddler Learning and Development Foundations (CITL)
Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS)
Colorado Early Learning and Development Guidelines (CELDG)
Ireton Infant Development Inventory and Child Development Review (CDR)
MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventories (CDI)






We then enlisted the help of pediatricians, early childhood specialists, early language development experts We then enlisted the help of pediatricians, early childhood experts, educational publishing specialists and, of course, moms and dads as we identified which learning objectives to include in our budding pre-preschool curriculum. Next, we sequenced these objectives by age appropriateness into a master blueprint we call the WeeSchool First Concepts Framework™. Finally comes the fun part, creating useful parenting tools in the form of fun, engaging, easy-to-use learning activities for you and your baby or toddler to share.
WeeSchool is in session!

	Welcome to the Apple Tree Wee School







 
Apple Tree Wee School, Inc.
 
Registration
 

 
We serve children from 0 months to 12 years of age.
 
We encourage both parents and child to visit our center prior to enrollment. We also offer a complimentary day of care to enable your child’s adjustment period to be as smooth as possible. From the first day of enrollment, your child must have:  a signed application, discipline policy, parent policy / registration agreement, along with an immunization record.  The medical form must be returned two weeks from enrollment.

 
Hours of Operation:
 
Monday –Friday (6:30 a.m. – 6:00 p.m.)
 
We feel it is in the best interest of your child that they not stay at the center for more than 10 hours a day.  Example: Drop off 6:30 a.m.  Pick up 4:30 p.m.
 
We have an open door policy and you, as parents are always welcome to visit our center anytime.  However, we would like to ask that children not be dropped off between the hours of 11:00 a.m. – 2:00 p.m.  These hours include lunch and naptime.  It is very difficult for a child to adjust to coming in mid-day.  It often causes a disruption in the room and makes it very difficult for children to sleep.  Please understand, YOU are welcome anytime during the day (including the hours 11-2).  Also, if you need to pick up your child during this time, you may do so.
 

 
Holiday Closing:
 
The center closes for:                       
New Years Day
 
 Good Friday
 
Memorial Day
 
July 4th
 
Labor Day
 
Thanksgiving
 
Christmas
 
At the discretion of the owners, on some holidays the center may close 2 days.  As time and demand for child care changes, the owners may also change holiday closing schedules.
 
Inclement Weather
 
In regards to inclement weather, we will try to operate under any and all extreme weather conditions.  During events of ice and snow, in most instances, our schedule will be normal.  If the accumulation is great, we may delay our opening schedule and operate with a reduced staff.  In the event of a hurricane and the center loses power, we will have to remain closed until power is restored, and travel is safe.  No matter what the situation may be, you may call our normal business number after hours and listen to a 24 hour message line.  This will give you the most up to date information on our schedule. You may also tune into to WRAL TV to view up to date closing and delays.
 
Arrival and Departure 
 
 
 
Children must be escorted into the building by their parent / guardian / adult in the mornings, signed in and be acknowledged by a staff member.  Children may not walk into the building alone.
 
Children must be picked up in the afternoons by a parent or designated adult.  This person must walk into the building, sign the child/ children out and make certain a staff member is informed of your leaving.  Unless there is a specific custody arrangement, both parents will be allowed to pick up the child, as well as other persons listed on the application.
 
Anyone coming to pick a child up for the first time will be asked for identification.  If the party is not listed on the application as an approved person to pick the child up, they will not be allowed to do so.  If someone different from the names on your list will be picking your child up, you must give us prior notification.  In situations where there is an unusual custody arrangement, we must have a court order on file to enforce it.
 
Meals and Snacks
 
Nutritious snacks and lunches are served daily.  Our snacks and lunches meet the Division of Child Development Child Nutrition requirements.  Morning snack is served between 8:00 and 8:30.  Although it is technically not breakfast, some children do eat it as their breakfast.  It depends on how much your child normally eats in the morning. Children that arrive at the center between 6:30 and 7:30 may bring breakfast with them to the center to eat.  However, it must be food that is nutritional in value.  You may not send your child in with carbonated drinks, tea, sugary artificial fruit drinks, chocolate drinks, doughnuts, cookies, candy, chips of any kind, chocolate pop-tarts (fruit flavors are ok), chocolate granola bars, etc.  Examples of items that are acceptable are toast, fruit, muffins, cereal, biscuits, pancakes, fruit cereal bars, milk, juice, etc.
 
Lunch is served daily and will include meat or protein product, vegetable, fruit, bread or grain product, and milk.  The time lunch is served varies depending on your child’s class schedule.  Afternoon snack is served after nap time. A copy of the menu is posted each week on the bulletin board outside of the office.
 
Referral Award System
 
Most parents work with or cross paths with others parents needing child care.  If you recommend us to another parent who registers their child, you will gain a free week, once they have been at the center for one month.  However, be sure to tell us of your referral BEFORE the child is enrolled.
 
Parental Involvement and Feedback
 
We encourage parents to become involved with our various activities here in the center.  We always welcome volunteers, especially on field trips.  There are various events during the year such as the Christmas program, graduation (for our 4 year olds), Halloween night trick-o-treating, parties, etc. that you, as parents, will always be invited.  Twice a year, we have parent/teach nights.  During these times, you will have an opportunity to visit the classrooms and become more informed on your child’s daily activities. Become a part of our family by getting involved!!
 
Remember, we always have an open door policy and encourage you to keep us informed.
