        Hanesbrands affiliate sues company over bra patents
    


By Richard Craver
Winston-Salem Journal








Richard Craver



















May 11, 2017
 (…)


























































































An affiliate of Hanesbrands Inc. is suing a women’s intimate apparel retailer for patent infringement of a bra cup product that “increases the visual appearance of breast size.”The lawsuit was filed Tuesday in federal court for the Middle District of N.C. with a request for a jury trial.MFB International Holdings, doing business as Maidenform, is the Hanesbrands affiliate, while the defendant is AdoreMe Inc. of New York. AdoreMe could not be reached for immediate comment on the lawsuit.Maidenform has owned the patent numbered ‘433 since it was approved in September 2012, the complaint said.The design, invented by Steven Castellano, is designed to give the wearer’s breasts the visual appearance of being “at least two cup sizes” larger through layers that lift the breast upward and inward.Maidenform accuses AdoreMe of selling bra products in the U.S. covered by the ‘433 patent, including a style known as “Add 2 Cups.”Maidenform claims AdoreMe’s products “have caused and continue to cause Maidenform to suffer irreparable harm to its business.” The lawsuit requests a permanent injunction against AdoreMe for products covered by the ‘433 patent, as well damages and attorney fees.The Maidenform affiliate filed a similar ‘433 patent-infringement lawsuit in September against the online entity of Frederick’s of Hollywood.The parties said in a Feb. 10 filing that they had reached an undisclosed settlement. The lawsuit was dismissed March 27 with prejudice, which means the parties have agreed not to file any future lawsuits about the allegations.On April 18, Hanesbrands filed a lawsuit against a women’s intimate apparel company for patent infringement on its seamless, stretchy sports bra products.The defendant is Jacques Moret Inc., which sells bras under a Jockey International license. Hanesbrands is demanding a jury trial.The patent in dispute, invented by George Browder Jr., entails “a bra formed from an integral circular blank, including a torso part with an inner layer and an outer layer, seamlessly joined to a turned welt.”
Browder received a U.S. patent — known as the ‘664 patent — in October 2000, which Hanesbrands later acquired.Hanesbrands claims Jacques Moret is making and selling bras based on the ‘664 patent, the product styles identified as JK-8791/333 and JK-8973, without its permission.Hanesbrands accuses Jacques Moret of “taking active steps to induce infringement by others,” including distributors, retailers and customers through traditional and social media marketing and providing instructions on how to wear the bra.Hanesbrands requests damages, and a preliminary and permanent injunction be established against Jacques Moret. Jacques Moret officials have not responded to the lawsuit.In March 2015, Hanesbrands and subsidiary HBI Branded Apparel Enterprises LLC voluntarily withdrew a trademark lawsuit against Gildan Activewear Inc., though leaving open the door to resubmitting.Hanesbrands had accused Gildan and Gildana USA Inc. of trademark infringement and unfair competition related to Gildan’s use of the Tempfx brand for moisture-control apparel products. Gildan denied the allegations.

our company
HanesBrands is a socially responsible manufacturer and marketer of leading everyday basic apparel under some of the world's strongest apparel brands in the Americas, Europe and Asia, as well as in Australia and South Africa. Our iconic innerwear and activewear apparel brands found in the United States and elsewhere include Hanes, Champion, Playtex, Bali, Maidenform, JMS/Just My Size, Wonderbra and Gear for Sports. Outside the United States, we also have dominant national and regional brands, including DIM, Nur Die/Nur Der, Lovable, Abanderado, Shock Absorber, Zorba, Sol y Oro, Rinbros, Track N Field and Ritmo.
We are the world’s largest marketer of basic apparel. We sell bras, panties, shapewear, sheer hosiery, men's underwear, children's underwear, socks, T-shirts, sweatshirts, fleece and other activewear. In the United States, we sell more units of intimate apparel, male underwear, socks, shapewear, hosiery and T-shirts than any other company.
Founded in 1901, Hanes has a long history of innovation, product excellence, and brand recognition. In fact, nearly 90 percent of U.S. households have our company's products in them. We revolutionized Tagless T-shirts and underwear, we invented the sports bra and the stretch-cup T-shirt bra, we were the first to advertise a bra on national television (Playtex), and we are innovating with ComfortBlend and temperature-control X-Temp fabrics and seamless Smart Sizes bras.
Our Sell More, Spend Less and Make Acquisitions strategies are driving growth and creating value for our shareholders, consumers, retailers, employees and communities. Hanes has made more than a half dozen acquisitions, including Maidenform Brands, Gear for Sports and Knights Apparel in the United States and DBApparel in Europe.
Based in Winston-Salem, N.C., Hanes is a member of the S&P 500 and is ranked No. 490 on the Fortune 500 list. The company has approximately 65,300 employees in more than 40 countries.
Unlike most apparel companies, Hanes primarily operates its own manufacturing facilities. More than 90 percent of the apparel units that we sell worldwide and in the United States are manufactured in our own plants or those of dedicated contractors.

                                We take great pride in our strong reputation for ethical business practices and the success of our Hanes for Good corporate responsibility program for workplace practices and community and environmental improvement. The company is the only apparel producer to ever be honored by the Great Place to Work Institute for its workplace practices in Central America and the Caribbean. In the United States, the company has earned the Forbes magazine Best Place to Work honor. Hanes has won U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Energy Star sustained excellence recognition for seven consecutive years. Hanes has significant goals for reducing energy use, carbon emissions and water use and publicly reports its progress each year.

CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
The materials we have filed or will file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the "SEC," contain, or will contain, certain forward-looking statements regarding business strategies, market potential, future financial performance and other matters. Forward-looking statements include all statements that do not relate solely to historical or current facts, and can generally be identified by the use of words such as "may," "believe," "will," "expect," "project," "estimate," "intend," "anticipate," "plan," "continue" or similar expressions. Forward-looking statements inherently involve many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in these statements. Where, in any forward-looking statement, we express an expectation or belief as to future results or events, such expectation or belief is based on the current plans and expectations of our management and expressed in good faith and believed to have a reasonable basis, but there can be no assurance that the expectation or belief will result or be achieved or accomplished. The following include some but not all of the factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those anticipated:

our ability to migrate our production and manufacturing operations to lower-cost centers around the world;
the highly competitive and evolving nature of the industry in which we compete;
our ability to effectively manage our inventory and reduce inventory reserves;
any failure by us to successfully streamline our operations;
retailer consolidation and other changes in the apparel essentials industry;
our ability to keep pace with changing consumer preferences in intimate apparel;
any loss of or reduction in sales to any of our top customers;
financial difficulties experienced by any of our top customers;
risks associated with our foreign operations or foreign supply sources, such as disruption of markets, changes in import and export laws, currency restrictions and currency exchange rate fluctuations;
the impact of economic and business conditions and industry trends in the countries in which we operate on our supply chain;
any failure by us to protect against dramatic changes in the volatile market price of cotton, the primary material used in the manufacture of our products;
costs and adverse publicity arising from violations of labor and environmental laws by us or any of our third-party manufacturers;
our ability to attract and retain key personnel;
our substantial debt and debt service requirements which restrict our operating and financial flexibility, and impose significant interest and financing costs;
rapid technological changes;
future financial performance, including availability, terms and deployment of capital; and

The foregoing factors and others are described in greater length in our materials filed with the SEC. These forward-looking statements and such risks, uncertainties and other factors speak only as of the date they are made. We expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to disseminate any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statement contained in any materials we have filed or will file with the SEC, to reflect any change in our expectations with regard thereto or any other change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based other than required by law.

our company
HanesBrands is a socially responsible manufacturer and marketer of leading everyday basic apparel under some of the world's strongest apparel brands in the Americas, Europe and Asia, as well as in Australia and South Africa. Our iconic innerwear and activewear apparel brands found in the United States and elsewhere include Hanes, Champion, Playtex, Bali, Maidenform, JMS/Just My Size, Wonderbra and Gear for Sports. Outside the United States, we also have dominant national and regional brands, including DIM, Nur Die/Nur Der, Lovable, Abanderado, Shock Absorber, Zorba, Sol y Oro, Rinbros, Track N Field and Ritmo.
We are the world’s largest marketer of basic apparel. We sell bras, panties, shapewear, sheer hosiery, men's underwear, children's underwear, socks, T-shirts, sweatshirts, fleece and other activewear. In the United States, we sell more units of intimate apparel, male underwear, socks, shapewear, hosiery and T-shirts than any other company.
Founded in 1901, Hanes has a long history of innovation, product excellence, and brand recognition. In fact, nearly 90 percent of U.S. households have our company's products in them. We revolutionized Tagless T-shirts and underwear, we invented the sports bra and the stretch-cup T-shirt bra, we were the first to advertise a bra on national television (Playtex), and we are innovating with ComfortBlend and temperature-control X-Temp fabrics and seamless Smart Sizes bras.
Our Sell More, Spend Less and Make Acquisitions strategies are driving growth and creating value for our shareholders, consumers, retailers, employees and communities. Hanes has made more than a half dozen acquisitions, including Maidenform Brands, Gear for Sports and Knights Apparel in the United States and DBApparel in Europe.
Based in Winston-Salem, N.C., Hanes is a member of the S&P 500 and is ranked No. 490 on the Fortune 500 list. The company has approximately 65,300 employees in more than 40 countries.
Unlike most apparel companies, Hanes primarily operates its own manufacturing facilities. More than 90 percent of the apparel units that we sell worldwide and in the United States are manufactured in our own plants or those of dedicated contractors.

                                We take great pride in our strong reputation for ethical business practices and the success of our Hanes for Good corporate responsibility program for workplace practices and community and environmental improvement. The company is the only apparel producer to ever be honored by the Great Place to Work Institute for its workplace practices in Central America and the Caribbean. In the United States, the company has earned the Forbes magazine Best Place to Work honor. Hanes has won U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Energy Star sustained excellence recognition for seven consecutive years. Hanes has significant goals for reducing energy use, carbon emissions and water use and publicly reports its progress each year. More information about our Hanes for Good corporate responsibility initiatives may be found at www.HanesForGood.com

CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
The materials we have filed or will file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the "SEC," contain, or will contain, certain forward-looking statements regarding business strategies, market potential, future financial performance and other matters. Forward-looking statements include all statements that do not relate solely to historical or current facts, and can generally be identified by the use of words such as "may," "believe," "will," "expect," "project," "estimate," "intend," "anticipate," "plan," "continue" or similar expressions. Forward-looking statements inherently involve many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in these statements. Where, in any forward-looking statement, we express an expectation or belief as to future results or events, such expectation or belief is based on the current plans and expectations of our management and expressed in good faith and believed to have a reasonable basis, but there can be no assurance that the expectation or belief will result or be achieved or accomplished. The following include some but not all of the factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those anticipated:

our ability to migrate our production and manufacturing operations to lower-cost centers around the world;
the highly competitive and evolving nature of the industry in which we compete;
our ability to effectively manage our inventory and reduce inventory reserves;
any failure by us to successfully streamline our operations;
retailer consolidation and other changes in the apparel essentials industry;
our ability to keep pace with changing consumer preferences in intimate apparel;
any loss of or reduction in sales to any of our top customers;
financial difficulties experienced by any of our top customers;
risks associated with our foreign operations or foreign supply sources, such as disruption of markets, changes in import and export laws, currency restrictions and currency exchange rate fluctuations;
the impact of economic and business conditions and industry trends in the countries in which we operate on our supply chain;
any failure by us to protect against dramatic changes in the volatile market price of cotton, the primary material used in the manufacture of our products;
costs and adverse publicity arising from violations of labor and environmental laws by us or any of our third-party manufacturers;
our ability to attract and retain key personnel;
our substantial debt and debt service requirements which restrict our operating and financial flexibility, and impose significant interest and financing costs;
rapid technological changes;
future financial performance, including availability, terms and deployment of capital; and

The foregoing factors and others are described in greater length in our materials filed with the SEC. These forward-looking statements and such risks, uncertainties and other factors speak only as of the date they are made. We expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to disseminate any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statement contained in any materials we have filed or will file with the SEC, to reflect any change in our expectations with regard thereto or any other change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based other than required by law.

In addition, we may, at any time and from time to time, revise or update this Agreement. We will post such revisions of, or updates to, this Agreement on the Site, and such revisions and updates will be effective as soon as we post them. If you do not wish to be bound by this Agreement (in its current form or as subsequently revised or amended), or if at any time you no longer agree with all the terms and conditions that apply to you, your sole remedy shall be to discontinue any further use of this Site. Because you are always bound by this Agreement as it is in effect during any use of the Site, you should periodically review these Terms of Use and the Privacy Notice so you know the terms and conditions that apply to you.

About HANESBRANDS INC.


   Hanesbrands can't wait 'til it gets its Hanes on you. The company designs, makes, and sells bras, hosiery, men's boxers, socks, and other intimate apparel under brand names such as Bali, Champion, barely there, Just My Size, Hanes, L'eggs, Playtex, and Wonderbra. Its bras are tops in the US and its underwear, legwear, and activewear units are market leaders as well. Hanesbrands also makes basic outerwear, such as T-shirts, and licensed logo apparel for collegiate bookstores, legwear for Donna Karan, and underwear for Polo Ralph Lauren. The lineup is sold to wholesalers, major retail chains (Wal-Mart, Target, and Kohls), and through Hanesbrands' value outlets and Internet site.
  
Operations

   Hanesbrands divides its operations into four segments including innerwear (intimate apparel, men's and children's underwear, and socks), activewear, direct to consumer, and international. Innerwear is the largest by far, accounting for more than 50% of revenue in 2015, while Activewear generated more than 25%.
  

   The company operates nearly 40 distribution centers, with 16 in the US and 21 located internationally near manufacturing regions.
  
Geographic Reach

   Hanesbrands sells in roughly 35 countries, and rings up roughly 80% of its sales in the US (during 2015). Its largest international markets include Europe (12% of sales), Canada, Japan, Mexico, Brazil, and China.
  
Sales and Marketing
 Wal-Mart, Target, and Kohls are the company's largest customers, accounting for 23%, 15%, and 5% of 2015 sales, respectively. Mass merchandise stores are vital to the company's performance, accounting for about half of Hanesbrands' total sales. Hanesbrands also allies with mid-tier stores, including J. C. Penney, Macy's, and Kohls, which are adding its lower-priced labels. It's L'eggs and Hanes brand underwear are also sold in food, drug, and variety stores. Hanesbrands also sell apparel to the US military for sale to soldiers and through discount chains, including Dollar General and Family Dollar Stores.
  
Financial Performance

   Hanesbrands' annual sales and profits have been growing over the past few years as new brand acquisitions have spurred more sales in more geographic markets.
  

   The company's sales rose nearly 8% to $5.73 billion during fiscal 2016 (ended January 2016), mostly thanks to 40%-plus International segment growth. The International segment's Europe operation was boosted by its late 2014 acquisition of DBApparel. Its Activewear sales also grew as its Knights Apparel acquisition led to higher sports apparel sales.
  

   Sales growth in FY2016 drove Hanesbrands' net income up 6% to $428.2 million, despite higher selling, general, and administration costs associated with acquisition and integration charges. The apparel maker's operating cash levels plunged 55% to $227 million for the year as it used more cash to build its inventory levels, paid $100 million in pension contributions, and decreased its accounts receivables collections due to the timing of sales in the fourth quarter.
  
Strategy

   Hanesbrands has been expanding its business overseas by acquiring top brands in its less-tapped markets. In 2016, for example, the company expanded in Australia after buying top intimates maker Pacific Brands in Australia. Pacific Brands adds to the 2014 acquisition of DBApparel Group of France, licensed to sell the Wonderbra and Playdex trademarks in the EU and South Africa.

   The company also hopes to identify and capitalize on the long-term megatrends related to their top product lines over the next five to 10 years. To this end, in early 2015, the company purchased Knights Apparel to expand its sports licensed collegiate apparel business with a goal of appealing to college students as that market grows over the next years and decades.
  

   Beyond growth, Hanesbrands has been reducing production costs by improving operating efficiencies in using a low-cost global supply chain based upon a combination of owned, contracted, and sourced manufacturing.
  
Mergers and Acquisitions

   In 2016 the company acquired leading Australian undergarment company Pacific Brands Limited in a cash deal valued at $800 million. The acquisition gave Hanesbrands the top market position in Australia for intimate apparel. In addition to its core products, Pacific Brands Limited also operates pillow business Tontine and flooring business Dunlop. Hanesbrands intends to divest both businesses.
  

   Hanesbrands also acquired Champion Europe, which owned the Champion brand in Europe, Middle East, and Africa, in 2016 for $228 million in cash. The company operates Champion Europe as a division of Hanes' global Champion organization.
  

   In 2015, the company bought Knights Apparel, a leading retailer of licensed collegiate logo apparel, to enrich its own Gear for Sports licensed collegiate apparel business.

WHEREAS, the Company desires to promote the sale of HBI products and has requested that HBI provide the Company with creative materials showcasing HBI products for this purpose;

NOW, THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:

From time to time, HBI may provide the Company with copies of HBI's trademarks, brand logos, labels, images and/or other creative materials, which are owned by or under license to HBI or its affiliates (the "Materials"), in graphical image files or other media. The Materials may include model photography.
The Company agrees that it will request the Materials in a timely manner, providing HBI sufficient time (but no less than three (3) business days in any event) for HBI to process the request.
The Materials provided by HBI will be used by the Company solely in connection with the marketing and/or sale of HBI products approved by HBI in advance. The Company recognizes that the Materials may contain images that have restrictive usage rights and/or time-sensitive imagery; therefore, the Company warrants that the Materials will only be used in the manner in which the Company originally requested and HBI approved, and the Company hereby represents and warrants that it will only use the Materials as authorized, and within the time period approved by HBI (as approved by HBI on a case by case basis).
The Company agrees not to alter, deface or otherwise change the appearance of any Materials without HBI's prior written consent, including but not limited to the color, character and integrity of same.
The Company acknowledges and agrees that all title to, and ownership of, the Materials and all derivative works thereof shall at all times remain with HBI. The Company will ensure that all Materials hereunder are adequately and correctly displayed on all applicable products, including any markings requested by HBI in order to show evidence of trademark or copyright protection and HBI's ownership of such Materials. In no event shall the Company use the Materials in a manner which will weaken or disparage HBI’s products, trademarks, or reputation. The Company shall not have the right to change or alter any Materials, except with HBI's prior written consent.
Upon reasonable notice from HBI, the Company will immediately discontinue any use of Materials objected to by HBI as contrary to the terms of this Agreement. Upon request, the Company shall also promptly remove any content related to the Materials or to HBI from its web site(s) and/or Company's retail stores as instructed by HBI.
The Company agrees that it will not obtain, register, accept assignment of, or use any domain name or uniform resource locator ("URL") that incorporates a trademark, service mark, trade name, or product name associated with, belonging to or licensed by HBI or any of its affiliates, or any word confusingly similar to such marks or names.
The Company furthermore acknowledges and agrees that HBI is entering into this Agreement with the expectation that the Company’s web site(s) shall be operated in a manner that is consistent with, protects and supports the prestige, image and reputation of HBI, its affiliates and its products. To that end, the Company agrees: (i) to present HBI’s products in a commercially reasonable manner, and in a manner no less favorable than the other products displayed on the Company’s web site(s), (ii) to comply with the Code of On-Line Business Practices established by the Better Business Bureau, and (iii) to operate its web site(s) in such a manner that it is an appropriate environment for the sale of HBI products.
The term of this Agreement and the usage rights granted herein may be terminated at any time by HBI upon written notice to the Company.
The Company acknowledges that HBI products are not intended for sale outside the United States, and agrees not to sell or advertise or allow the sale or advertisement of HBI Products in violation of this paragraph.
The Company shall be solely responsible for updating its web site(s), catalogues and other promotional materials to reflect current HBI product information and availability.
THE COMPANY SHALL HAVE NO AUTHORITY TO WARRANT HBI'S PRODUCTS OTHER THAN AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN WRITING BY HBI. ANY WARRANTY CONTRARY TO SUCH HBI AUTHORIZATION SHALL BE AT COMPANY'S OWN RISK.
The Company shall indemnify and hold HBI, HBI affiliates, and their representatives, agents, officers and directors harmless from any and all claims, liabilities and expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees) arising from the Company's use of the Materials or breach of any of the terms contained herein. Since HBI could be irreparably damaged if the Company violates any provision contained in this Agreement (including, without limitation, the use of the Materials in a manner not authorized hereunder), in addition to any other rights and remedies available to HBI, HBI shall be entitled to full injunctive relief restraining any such violation without any bond or security being required, to the extent permitted by applicable law. The foregoing indemnity shall survive the expiration, termination or cancellation of this Agreement.
During and after the term of this Agreement, the parties acknowledge and agree that information exchanged between the parties shall be considered confidential, unless disclosure of such information is required by laws, regulations or order of government authorities or court order, or unless and to the extent such information has become generally known to the public through a source other than the receiving party.
This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of North Carolina, and may not be amended except in writing executed by both parties. The parties hereby waive any challenge to, and consent to the jurisdiction of the federal and state courts of Forsyth County in the Middle District of North Carolina.
The Company may not assign, subcontract or otherwise transfer all or any part of this Agreement or its rights or obligations hereunder (including the Materials) to any third party, including its affiliates, without the prior written consent of HBI. HBI may assign and/or transfer its rights under this Agreement at any time to any of its affiliates or to any successor to the business or assets of HBI (whether by merger, consolidation, spin-off or otherwise).
