* The Net Expense Ratio includes management fees, other operating expenses and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses. If Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses were excluded, the Net Expense Ratio would be 1.45% for DXMAX, 2.20% for DXMCX, and 1.20% for DXMIX.  The Fund’s Adviser, Rafferty Asset Management, LLC (“Rafferty”) has entered into an Operating Services Agreement with each Fund. Under this Operating Service Agreement, Rafferty has contractually agreed to pay all expenses of each Fund through September 1, 2018 other than the following: management fees, Rule 12b-1distribution and/or service fees, any front-end or contingent deferred sales loads, acquired fund fees and expenses, taxes, swap financing and related costs, dividends or interest on short positions, other interest expenses, brokerage commissions and extraordinary expenses such as litigation or other expenses outside the typical day-to-day operations of the Fund. If these expenses were included, the net expense ratio would be higher.
The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.

        Addressing The Top Misconceptions About Alternative Investments    


Alternative strategies have the potential to be a viable way for investors, whether institutional or retail, to reduce risk in their investment portfolios.
 

 



        Alternatives? Too Many, or Not Enough?    


The key to risk-adjusted returns and diversification is not the number of securities – it’s their correlation – or, really, non-correlation – to each other, that’s paramount.
 

 



        A Correlation Misconception    


Some clients confuse negative correlation with low (or non-) correlation. They mistakenly believe that returns for investments with low correlation move in opposite directions from each other.

 The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost; current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance for one year and under are cumulative, not annualized. Short term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. For additional information, see the fund(s) prospectus.
Each Direxion Fund share price is calculated as of the close of regular trading, usually as of 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time, each day the New York Stock Exchange is open for business. Each fund seeks to meet its investment objective relative to the value of the target index or benchmark as of 4:00 p.m.
Shares of Direxion Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Market Price returns are based upon the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 PM Eastern time (when NAV is normally determined), and do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times. Fund returns assume that dividends and capital gains distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at NAV. Some performance results reflect expense subsidies and waivers in effect during certain periods shown. Absent these waivers, results would have been less favorable.
After-Tax and After-Tax, Post Sales Returns
Tax-adjusted returns and tax cost ratio are estimates of the impact taxes have had on a fund. We assume the highest tax rate in calculating these figures. These returns follow the SEC guidelines for calculating returns before sale of shares. Tax-adjusted returns show a fund’s annualized after tax total return for the one, three and five year periods, excluding any capital-gains effects that would result from selling the fund at the end of the period. To determine this figure, all income and short-term capital gains distributions are taxed at the maximum federal rate at the time of distribution. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a 15% rate. The after tax portion is then assumed to be reinvested in the fund. State and local taxes are not included in our calculations. For more information, please consult your tax consultant.
Distribution Dates

Payable and Ex-Date – With regard to mutual funds, this is the day on which declared distributions (dividends or capital gains) are deducted from the fund’s assets before it calculates its net asset value (NAV). The NAV per share will drop by the amount of the distribution per share.
Record Date – Date by which a shareholder must officially own shares in order to be entitled to a dividend.

Types of Distributions

Income Dividend – A portion of a company’s profit paid to common and preferred shareholders.
Long Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for more than one year.
Short Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for less than one year

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  Overview  The Partnership, including through its investment in the Master prior to its full redemption effective December 31, 2014, seeks to achieve capital appreciation through speculative trading, directly or indirectly, in commodity interests, including commodity futures and commodity option contracts traded on United States exchanges and certain foreign exchanges and swaps. The Partnership, through its investment in the Master, intended to trade only energy and energy-related products, grains, indices, lumber and softs, as well as the Goldman Sachs Commodity Index (an index future comprised of energy and other products) traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, but was authorized to trade commodity futures, swaps and options contracts of any kind. The Partnership had invested substantially all of its capital in the Master. The Advisor was authorized to trade forward contracts on behalf of the Partnership and the Master but did not do so (certain swaps that the Advisor traded were, however, the substantial economic equivalent of forward contracts).  The General Partner manages all business of the Partnership, and the Managing Member managed all business of the Master prior to the Partnership's full redemption from the Master effective December 31, 2014. The General Partner has delegated its responsibility for the investment of the Partnership's assets to the Advisor. The Partnership had invested these assets in the Master prior to its full redemption from the Master effective December 31, 2014. The General Partner engages a team of approximately 35 professionals whose primary emphasis is on attempting to maintain quality control among the advisors to the funds operated or managed by the General Partner. A full-time staff of due diligence professionals uses proprietary technology and on-site evaluations to monitor new and existing futures money managers. The accounting and operations staff provides processing of subscriptions and redemptions and reporting to limited partners and regulatory authorities. The General Partner also includes staff involved in marketing and sales support. In selecting the Advisor for the Partnership and/or Master, as applicable, the General Partner considered past performance, trading style, volatility of markets traded and fee requirements. The General Partner may modify or terminate the allocation of assets to the Advisor at any time.  Responsibilities of the General Partner/Managing Member include:   due diligence examinations of the Advisor;   selection, appointment and termination of the Advisor;   negotiation of the Management Agreement; and   monitoring the activity of the Advisor.  In addition, the General Partner provides, and the Managing Member provided, the administrative and compliance services that are required by law or regulation from time to time in connection with operation of the Partnership/Master. These services include the preparation of required books and records and reports to limited partners, government agencies and regulators; computation of net asset value; calculation of fees; assistance in connection with subscriptions, redemptions and limited partner communications; and preparation of offering documents and sales literature.  While the Partnership has and the Master had the right to seek lower commission rates and fees from other commodity brokers at any time, the General Partner/Managing Member believes that the customer agreement and other arrangements with the commodity broker are fair, reasonable and competitive.  AAA Capital Management Advisors, Ltd.  From inception to December 31, 2014, the Partnership's and the Master's sole trading advisor was AAA. The Partnership's assets allocated to AAA for trading were not invested in commodity interests directly, prior to its full redemption effective December 31, 2014. AAA's allocation of the Partnership's assets was invested in the Master. AAA traded the Master's, and thereby the Partnership's, assets in accordance with its Energy Program - Futures and Swaps.  The Master traded energy futures contracts and options on energy futures contracts on domestic and international exchanges, as well as the Goldman Sachs Commodity Index (an index future comprised of energy and other products) traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. The Master also engaged in swap transactions involving crude oil and other energy-related products. References herein to energy and energy-related products include all of the foregoing.  AAA generally based its trading decisions on "fundamental" factors, namely supply and demand for a particular group or type of commodity. AAA attempted to buy undervalued commodities and sell overvalued commodities, often but not always simultaneously. AAA used options to attempt either to reduce or define risks.  AAA was aware of price trends but did not trade upon trends. AAA often took profits in positions with specific trends even though that trend may still be intact or perhaps even strong. AAA occasionally established positions that were countertrend.  Effective risk management was a crucial aspect of AAA's trading program. Account size, expectation, volatility of the market traded and the nature of other positions taken were all factors in determining the amount of equity committed to each trade. The Master was AAA's largest account.  Pan Capital Management, LP  Effective February 1, 2015, Pan commenced trading the Partnership's assets directly pursuant to its Energy Trading Program, a proprietary, discretionary trading program. Pan will concentrate the Partnership's trading in energy-related markets.  Risk management is an integrated part of Pan's goal of identifying favorable risk/reward trading opportunities for its Energy Trading Program. Pan will monitor risks of all positions and will attempt to prevent over-concentration of particular investment asset or strategy.  (a) Liquidity.  The Partnership does not engage in sales of goods or services. Prior to its full redemption from the Master effective December 31, 2014, its only assets were its investment in the Master and cash. The Master did not engage in the sale of goods or services. The Master's only assets were its equity in trading accounts, consisting of cash and cash margin, net unrealized appreciation on open futures contracts and net unrealized appreciation on options and swaps, if applicable. Because of the low margin deposits normally required in commodity trading, relatively small price movements may have resulted in substantial losses to the Partnership, through its investment in the Master. While substantial losses could have led to a material decrease in liquidity, no such illiquidity occurred during the year ended December 31, 2014.  To minimize the risk relating to low margin deposits, the Master followed certain trading policies, including:  (i) The Master invested its assets only in commodity interests that the Advisor believed were traded in sufficient volume to permit ease of taking and liquidating positions. Sufficient volume, in this context, referred to a level of liquidity that the Advisor believed permitted it to enter and exit trades without noticeably moving the market.  (ii) The Advisor did not initiate additional positions in any commodity if these positions would have resulted in aggregate positions requiring a margin of more than 66 2/3% of the Master's net assets allocated to the Advisor.  (iii) The Master may have occasionally accepted delivery of a commodity. Unless such delivery was disposed of promptly by retendering the warehouse receipt representing the delivery to the appropriate clearinghouse, the physical commodity position was fully hedged.  (iv) The Master did not employ the trading technique commonly known as "pyramiding," in which the speculator uses unrealized profits on existing positions as margin for the purchases or sale of additional positions in the same or related commodities.  (vi) The Advisor may have, from time to time, employed trading strategies such as spreads or straddles on behalf of the Master. "Spreads" and "straddles" describe commodity futures trading strategies involving the simultaneous buying and selling of futures contracts on the same commodity but involving different delivery dates or markets.  (vii) The Master did not permit the churning of its commodity trading account. The term "churning" refers to the practice of entering and exiting trades with a frequency unwarranted by legitimate efforts to profit from the trades, driven by the desire to generate commission income.  From January 1, 2014 through December 31, 2014, the Partnership's average margin to equity ratio (i.e., the percentage of assets on deposit required for margin) was approximately 7.2%. The foregoing margin to equity ratio takes into account cash held in the Partnership's name, as well as the allocable value of the positions and cash held on behalf of the Partnership in the name of the Master.  In the normal course of business, the Partnership is, and through its investment in the Master was, party to financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk, including derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments. These financial instruments include futures, options and swaps, whose values are based upon an underlying asset, index or reference rate, and generally represent future commitments to exchange currencies or cash balances, or to purchase or sell other financial instruments at specified terms at specified future dates, or, in the case of derivative commodity interests, to have a reasonable possibility to be settled in cash, through physical delivery or with another financial instrument. These instruments may have been traded on an exchange, a swap execution facility or over-the-counter ("OTC"). Exchange-traded instruments included futures and certain standardized forward, option and swap contracts. Certain swap contracts may have also been traded on a swap execution facility or OTC. OTC contracts are negotiated between contracting parties and also include certain forward and option contracts. Specific market movements of the commodities or futures contracts underlying an option cannot accurately be predicted. The purchaser of an option may lose the entire premium paid for the option. The writer, or seller, of an option had unlimited risk. Each of these instruments was subject to various risks similar to those relating to the underlying financial instruments, including market and credit risk. In general, the risks associated with OTC contracts are greater than those associated with exchange-traded instruments because of the greater risk of default by the counterparty to an OTC contract. None of the Partnership's current contracts are traded OTC, although contracts may be traded OTC in the future.  The risk to the limited partners that have purchased Redeemable Units is limited to the amount of their share of the Partnership's net assets and undistributed profits. This limited liability is a result of the organization of the Partnership as a limited partnership under New York law.  Market risk is the potential for changes in the value of the financial instruments traded by the Partnership/Master due to market changes, including interest and foreign exchange rate movements and fluctuations in commodity or security prices. Market risk is directly impacted by the volatility and liquidity in the markets in which the related underlying assets were traded by the Partnership/Master. The Partnership/Master was exposed to a market risk equal to the value of futures contracts purchased and unlimited liability on such contracts sold short.  Credit risk is the possibility that a loss may occur due to the failure of a counterparty to perform according to the terms of a contract. The Partnership's/Master's risk of loss in the event of a counterparty default was typically limited to the amounts recognized in the Statements of Financial Condition and was not represented by the contract or notional amounts of the instruments. The Partnership's/Master's risk of loss was reduced through the use of legally enforceable master netting agreements with counterparties that permit the Partnership/Master to offset unrealized gains and losses and other assets and liabilities with such counterparties upon the occurrence of certain events. The Partnership/Master had credit risk and concentration risk during the reporting period and prior periods, as MS&Co. and/or CGM or their affiliates were the sole counterparties or brokers with respect to the Partnership's/Master's assets. During the reporting period and prior periods, credit risk with respect to exchange-traded instruments was reduced to the extent that through MS&Co. or CGM, the Partnership's/Master's counterparty was an exchange or clearing organization. The Partnership continues to be subject to such risks with respect to MS&Co.  The Advisor concentrated the Partnership's/Master's trading in energy-related markets. Concentration in a limited number of commodity interests may have subjected the Partnership's/Master's account to greater volatility than if a more diversified portfolio of contracts had been traded on behalf of the Partnership/Master. The Partnership continues to be subject to such risk.  As both a buyer and seller of options, the Master paid or receives a premium at the outset and then assumed the risk of unfavorable changes in the price of the contract underlying the option. Written options exposed the Partnership/Master to potentially unlimited liability; for purchased options, the risk of loss was limited to the premiums paid. Certain written put options permit cash settlement and do not require the option holder to own the reference asset. The Partnership/Master did not consider these contracts to be guarantees. The Partnership continues to be subject to such risk.  The General Partner monitors and attempts to control the Partnership's risk exposure on a daily basis through financial, credit and risk management monitoring systems, and accordingly, believes that it has effective procedures for evaluating and limiting the credit and market risks to which the Partnership may be subject. These monitoring systems generally allow the General Partner to statistically analyze actual trading results with risk-adjusted performance indicators and correlation statistics. In addition, online monitoring systems provided account analysis of futures, exchange-cleared swap and option contracts by sector, margin requirements, gain and loss transactions and collateral positions. (See also "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for further information on financial instrument risks included in the notes to financial statements.)  Other than the risks inherent in commodity futures, options and swaps trading, the Master knew of no trends, demands, commitments, events or uncertainties which would have resulted in or which are reasonably likely to have resulted in the Master's liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way. The Limited Partnership Agreement provides that the General Partner may cause the Partnership to cease trading operations and liquidate all open positions under certain circumstances, including a decrease in net asset value per Redeemable Unit to less than $400 as of the close of business on any business day.  (b) Capital Resources.  (i) The Partnership has made no material commitments for capital expenditures.  (ii) The Partnership's capital consists of the capital contributions of the partners as increased or decreased by gains or losses on trading and by expenses, interest income, redemptions of Redeemable Units and distributions of profits, if any. Gains or losses on trading cannot be predicted. Market movements in commodities are dependent upon fundamental and technical factors which the Advisor may or may not be able to identify, such as changing supply and demand relationships, weather, government, agricultural, commercial and trade programs and policies, national and international political and economic events and changes in interest rates. Partnership expenses consist of, among other things, clearing, selling agent, advisory and administrative fees and, during the reporting period, brokerage commissions. The level of these expenses is dependent upon the level of trading and the ability of the Advisor to identify and take advantage of price movements in the commodity markets, in addition to the level of Net Assets maintained. In addition, the amount of interest income payable by the Partnership's commodity broker is dependent upon interest rates over which the Partnership has no control.  For the year ended December 31, 2014, there were additional subscriptions of  No forecast can be made as to the level of redemptions in any given period. A limited partner may require the Partnership to redeem its Redeemable Units at their net asset value as of the end of a month on three business days' notice to the General Partner. There is no fee charged to limited partners in connection with redemptions. Redemptions generally are funded out of the Partnership's cash holdings. For the year ended December 31, 2014, 16,433.1240 Redeemable Units were redeemed totaling $56,783,495, 293.8710 General Partner Unit equivalents were redeemed totaling $992,661 and 464.0795 Special Limited Partner Unit equivalents were redeemed totaling $1,589,117. For the year ended December 31, 2013, 25,908.7300 Redeemable Units were redeemed totaling $95,306,548 and  Redeemable Units were sold to persons and entities who are accredited investors as that term is defined in Rule 501(a) of Regulation D under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act").  For the year ended December 31, 2014, the net asset value per unit decreased 4.2% from $3,572.94 to $3,424.23. For the year ended December 31, 2013, the net asset value per unit decreased 11.9% from $4,055.50 to $3,572.94. For the year ended December 31, 2012, the net asset value per unit decreased 2.9% from $4,176.49 to $4,055.50.  The Partnership, through its investment in the Master, prior to its full redemption effective December 31, 2014, experienced a net trading loss of $1,236,399 before fees and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014. Losses were primarily attributable to the Master's trading of commodity futures in Brent crude oil, gasoline and gasoil futures and were partially offset by gains in heating oil, WTI crude oil and natural gas futures. The net trading gain (or loss) realized from the Partnership's investment in the Master is disclosed on page 27 under "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."  The most significant losses were recorded within the gasoline markets during October and November from long futures positions as prices moved lower after the U.S. Energy Department released a report showing gasoline inventories advanced during the third quarter while consumption in the U.S. was lower than analysts previously predicted. During July, August, and September further losses were recorded from long positions in RBOB gasoline futures as prices declined as U.S. refineries increased production at near record rates. Losses were also experienced during September from long positions in Brent crude oil futures as prices moved lower on weakening global demand and increased oil production in the U.S. and Middle East. Additional losses were incurred during May from short positions in Brent crude oil futures as prices advanced as tensions between Ukraine and Russia increased speculation of potential sanctions against Russia. Losses during June were experienced from short positions in Brent crude oil futures as prices rose after uprisings in Iraq and Libya threatened to curtail exports from the Middle East. The Partnership's losses during the year were offset by trading gains achieved during September from short positions in heating oil futures as prices declined on news that fuel inventory levels were higher than previous estimates predicted during the second quarter. During February, gains were recorded from long positions in heating oil futures as prices advanced on increased demand in the U.S. due to persistent, prolonged cold weather throughout much of the country. Additional gains in the heating oil market were achieved during November and December. During July and September, gains were experienced from short WTI crude oil positions as prices moved lower as government reports showed continued growth in U.S. oil production. During February, gains were recorded from long natural gas positions as prices rallied early in the month after cold weather in the U.S. increased demand for heating homes and businesses. Additional gains were recorded during April from long positions in natural gas futures as prices moved higher after government data indicated fuel inventories fell to an 11-year-low.  The Partnership, through its investment in the Master, experienced a net trading loss of $21,343,271 before fees and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2013. Losses were primarily attributable to the Master's trading of commodity futures in Brent Crude Oil, NYMEX Crude Oil, NYMEX Energy Swaps, IPE Gas Oil, NYMEX Gasoline and NYMEX Heating Oil and were partially offset by gains in NYMEX Natural Gas.  During 2013, the Partnership posted a loss primarily from trading in West Texas Intermediate ("WTI") crude oil, RBOB gasoline and gas oil. The most significant losses were incurred during January and March from short futures positions in WTI crude oil as prices rallied due to speculation that flows from Cushing, Oklahoma would be lower and less consistent over the next few months. Further losses were incurred during January from short futures positions in RBOB gasoline and gas oil, which rallied due to higher crude oil prices. Losses were also incurred from short futures positions in gas oil and heating oil during July as prices rallied amid growing concerns tensions in the Middle East would disrupt flows of crude oil and related refined products. Losses were also incurred during August from short futures positions in natural gas as prices rallied due to hotter than usual temperatures throughout the United States. A portion of the Partnership's losses for the year was offset by gains recorded during May from short futures positions in natural gas as prices generally declined given oversupply of the commodity and weakening demand. Profits were also recorded from trading natural gas futures during July. Further gains were recorded during April and May from short futures positions in gasoil as prices generally declined with weaker Brent crude oil and WTI crude oil prices during these months. Further gains were recorded from long futures positions in heating oil during January and February as colder winter temperatures throughout the U.S. helped push prices higher. During November, gains were achieved from long positions in natural gas futures as prices advanced on cold weather moving through much of the U.S. in the middle of the month. Short positions in Brent crude oil futures also contributed positively during November. Finally, additional gains were recorded during December from long positions in gasoline and heating oil futures as prices advanced after U.S. Department of Energy reports showed strong seasonal demand in the U.S. and lower-than-expected inventories in the Atlantic Basin storage facilities.  During the reporting period and prior periods included in this report, interest income on 80% of the Partnership's average daily equity allocated to it by the Master was earned at a 30-day U.S. Treasury bill rate determined weekly based on the average non-competitive yield on 3-month U.S. Treasury bills maturing in 30 days or at the 4-week U.S. Treasury bill discount rate. Interest income allocated from the Master for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2014 decreased by $10,245 and $36,428, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in 2013. The decrease in interest income is primarily due to lower U.S. Treasury bill rates for the Partnership during the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2014, as compared to the corresponding periods in 2013. Interest earned by the Partnership increases the net asset value of the Partnership. The amount of interest income earned by the Partnership during the reporting period depended on the average daily equity in the Partnership's account and upon interest rates over which neither the Partnership nor MS&Co./CGM had control.  During the reporting period, ongoing selling agent fees were based on the number of trades executed by the Advisor and the Partnership's ownership percentage of the Master. Ongoing selling agent fees for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2014 increased by $151,646 and decreased by $1,531,115, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in 2013. The increase in ongoing selling agent fees is primarily due to an increase in the number of trades during the three months ended December 31, 2014, while the decrease in ongoing selling agent fees is primarily due to a decrease in the number of trades during the twelve months ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the corresponding periods in 2013.  Management fees are calculated as a percentage of the Partnership's net asset value as of the end of each month and are affected by trading performance, subscriptions and redemptions. Management fees for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2014 decreased by $240,590 and $1,216,157, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in 2013. The decrease in management fees is due to a decrease in average net assets during the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the corresponding periods in 2013.  Administrative fees are calculated as a percentage of the Partnership's net asset value as of the end of each month and are affected by trading performance, subscriptions and redemptions. Administrative fees for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2014 increased by $3,302 and decreased by $321,885, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in 2013. The increase in administrative fees is due to an increase in the monthly administrative fee rate effective October 1, 2014, while the decrease in administrative fees is primarily due to a decrease in the average net assets during the twelve months ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the corresponding periods in 2013.  Special Limited Partner profit share allocations (incentive fees) are based on the new trading profits generated by the Advisor at the end of the quarter, as defined in the Management Agreement between the Partnership, the General Partner and the Advisor. There were no profit share allocations earned for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2014 and 2013.  The Partnership pays professional fees, which generally include legal and accounting expenses (including legal and accounting fees related to the offering). Professional fees for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 were $229,500 and $123,519, respectively.  The Partnership pays other expenses, which generally include filing, reporting and data processing fees. Other expenses for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 were $64,697 and $70,149, respectively.  . . .  Mar 30, 2015  (c) 1995-2015 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc. All Rights Reserved

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  Overview  The Partnership seeks to achieve capital appreciation through speculative trading, directly or indirectly, in commodity interests, including commodity futures and commodity option contracts traded on United States exchanges and certain foreign exchanges and swaps. The Partnership intends to trade only energy and energy-related products, but is authorized to trade commodity futures, swaps and option contracts of any kind. The Partnership had invested substantially all of its capital in the Master prior to its full redemption from the Master effective December 31, 2014. AAA was authorized to trade forward contracts on behalf of the Partnership but did not do so (certain swaps that the Advisor traded were, however, the substantial economic equivalent of forward contracts.)  The General Partner manages all business of the Partnership. The General Partner has delegated its responsibility for the investment of the Partnership's assets to the Advisor. The General Partner engages a team of approximately 30 professionals whose primary emphasis is on attempting to maintain quality control among the advisors to the funds operated or managed by the General Partner. A full-time staff of due diligence professionals uses proprietary technology and on-site evaluations to monitor new and existing futures money managers. The accounting and operations staff provides processing of subscriptions and redemptions and reporting to limited partners and regulatory authorities. The General Partner also includes staff involved in marketing and sales support. In selecting the Advisor for the Partnership, as applicable, the General Partner considered past performance, trading style, volatility of markets traded and fee requirements. The General Partner may modify or terminate the allocation of assets to the Advisor at any time.  Responsibilities of the General Partner/Managing Member include or included, as applicable:   due diligence examinations of the Advisor;   selection, appointment and termination of the Advisor;   negotiation of the Management Agreement; and   monitoring the activity of the Advisor.  In addition, the General Partner provides, or will assist SS&C in providing, and the Managing Member provided, the administrative and compliance services that are required by law or regulation from time to time in connection with operation of the Partnership/Master.  While the Partnership has the right to seek lower commission rates and fees from other commodity brokers at any time, the General Partner believes that the customer agreement and other arrangements with the commodity broker are fair, reasonable and competitive.  Pan Capital Management, LP  Effective February 1, 2015, Pan commenced trading the Partnership's assets directly pursuant to its Energy Trading Program, a proprietary, discretionary trading program. Pan will concentrate the Partnership's trading in energy-related markets. Risk management is an integrated part of Pan's goal of identifying favorable risk/reward trading opportunities for its Energy Trading Program. Pan will monitor risks of all positions and will attempt to prevent over-concentration of particular investment asset or strategy.  AAA Capital Management Advisors, Ltd.  From inception to December 31, 2014, the Partnership's and the Master's sole trading advisor was AAA. The Partnership's assets allocated to AAA for trading were not invested in commodity interests directly, prior to its full redemption effective December 31,2014. AAA's allocation of the Partnership's assets was invested in the Master. AAA traded the Master's, and thereby the Partnership's, assets in accordance with its Energy Program - Futures and Swaps.  The Master traded energy futures contracts and options on energy futures contracts on domestic and international exchanges, as well as the Goldman Sachs Commodity Index (an index future comprised of energy and other products) traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. The Master also engaged in swap transactions involving crude oil and other energy-related products. References herein to energy and energy-related products include all of the foregoing.  AAA generally based its trading decisions on "fundamental" factors, namely supply and demand for a particular group or type of commodity. AAA attempted to buy undervalued commodities and sell overvalued commodities, often but not always simultaneously. AAA used options to attempt either to reduce or define risks.  AAA was aware of price trends but did not trade upon trends. AAA often took profits in positions with specific trends even though that trend may still have been intact or perhaps even strong. AAA occasionally established positions that were countertrend.  Effective risk management was a crucial aspect of AAA's trading program. Account size, expectation, volatility of the market traded and the nature of other positions taken were all factors in determining the amount of equity committed to each trade. The Master was AAA's largest account.  (a) Liquidity.  The Partnership does not engage in sales of goods or services. Its assets are its (i) equity in its trading account, consisting of cash at MS&Co. and cash margin, net unrealized appreciation on open futures contracts, options purchased at fair value and investment in U.S. Treasury bills at fair value, if applicable, (ii) cash at bank and (iii) interest receivable. Because of the low margin deposits normally required in commodity futures trading, relatively small price movements may result in substantial losses to the Partnership, through its investments in the Funds and direct investments. While substantial losses could lead to a material decrease in liquidity, no such illiquidity occurred during the year ended December 31, 2016.  To minimize the risk relating to low margin deposits, the Partnership and the Master, prior to the Master's full redemption, followed certain trading policies, including:  (i) The Partnership invested its assets only in commodity interests that the Advisor believed were traded in sufficient volume to permit ease of taking and liquidating positions. Sufficient volume, in this context, referred to a level of liquidity that the Advisor believed permitted it to enter and exit trades without noticeably moving the market.  (ii) The Advisor did not initiate additional positions in any commodity if these positions would have resulted in aggregate positions requiring a margin of more than 66 2/3% of the Partnership's net assets allocated to the Advisor.  (iii) The Partnership may have occasionally accepted delivery of a commodity. Unless such delivery was disposed of promptly by retendering the warehouse receipt representing the delivery to the appropriate clearinghouse, the physical commodity position was fully hedged.  (iv) The Partnership did not employ the trading technique commonly known as "pyramiding," in which the speculator uses unrealized profits on existing positions as margin for the purchases or sale of additional positions in the same or related commodities.  (v) The Partnership did not utilize borrowings other than short-term borrowings if the Partnership took delivery of any cash commodities.  (vi) The Advisor may have, from time to time, employed trading strategies such as spreads or straddles on behalf of the Partnership. "Spreads" and "straddles" describe commodity futures trading strategies involving the simultaneous buying and selling of futures contracts on the same commodity but involving different delivery dates or markets.  (vii) The Partnership did not permit the churning of its commodity trading account. The term "churning" refers to the practice of entering and exiting trades with a frequency unwarranted by legitimate efforts to profit from the trades, driven by the desire to generate commission income.  From January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016, the Partnership's average margin to equity ratio (i.e., the percentage of assets on deposit required for margin) was approximately 5.3%.  In the normal course of business, the Partnership is party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk, including derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments. These financial instruments may include futures, options, and swaps, whose values are based upon an underlying asset, index, or reference rate, and generally represent future commitments to exchange currencies or cash balances, or to purchase or sell other financial instruments at specific terms at specified future dates, or, in the case of derivative commodity instruments, to have a reasonable possibility to be settled in cash, through physical delivery or with another financial instrument. These instruments may trade on an exchange or over-the-counter ("OTC"). Exchange-traded instruments include futures and certain standardized forward, option and swap contracts. Certain swap contracts may also trade on a swap execution facility or OTC. OTC contracts are negotiated between contracting parties and also include certain forward and option contracts. Specific market movements of commodities or futures contracts underlying an option cannot accurately be predicted. The purchaser of an option may lose the entire premium paid for the option. The writer, or seller, of an option has unlimited risk. Each of these instruments is subject to various risks similar to those related to the underlying financial instruments, including market and credit risk. In general, the risks associated with OTC contracts are greater than those associated with exchange-traded instruments because of the greater risk of default by the counterparty to an OTC contract. None of the Partnership's current contracts are traded OTC, although contracts may be traded OTC in the future.  As both a buyer and seller of options, the Partnership and/or the Master, as applicable, paid or received a premium at the outset and then assumed the risk of unfavorable changes in the price of the contract underlying the option. Written options exposed the Partnership/Master to potentially unlimited liability; for purchased options, the risk of loss was limited to the premiums paid. Certain written put options permitted cash settlement and did not require the option holder to own the reference asset. The Partnership/Master did not consider these contracts to be guarantees.  Market risk is the potential for changes in the value of the financial instruments traded by the Partnership due to market changes, including interest and foreign exchange rate movements and fluctuations in commodity or security prices. Market risk is directly impacted by the volatility and liquidity in the markets in which the related underlying assets are traded by the Partnership. The Partnership is exposed to a market risk equal to the value of futures contracts purchased and unlimited liability on such contracts sold short.  Credit risk is the possibility that a loss may occur due to the failure of a counterparty to perform according to the terms of a contract. In the event of a counterparty default, the Partnership's risk of loss is typically limited to the amounts recognized in the Statements of Financial Condition and is not represented by the contract or notional amounts of the instruments. The Partnership's risk of loss is reduced through the use of legally enforceable master netting agreements with counterparties that permit the Partnership to offset unrealized gains and losses and other assets and liabilities with such counterparties upon the occurrence of certain events. The Partnership/Master had credit risk and concentration risk during the reporting period and prior periods, as MS&Co. and/or CGM or their affiliates were the counterparties or brokers with respect to the Partnership's/Master's assets. During the reporting period and prior periods, credit risk with respect to exchange-traded instruments was reduced to the extent that, through MS&Co./CGM, the Partnership's/Master's counterparty was an exchange or clearing organization. The Partnership continues to be subject to such risks with respect to MS&Co.  The risk to the limited partners that have purchased Redeemable Units is limited to the amount of their share of the Partnership's net assets and undistributed profits. This limited liability is a result of the organization of the Partnership as a limited partnership under New York law.  During the reporting period and prior periods, the Advisor concentrated the Partnership's/Master's trading in energy-related markets. Concentration in a limited number of commodity interests may have subjected the Partnership's/Master's account to greater volatility than if a more diversified portfolio of contracts had been traded on behalf of the Partnership/Master. The Partnership continues to be subject to such risk.  The General Partner monitors and attempts to control the Partnership's risk exposure on a daily basis through financial, credit and risk management monitoring systems, and accordingly, believes that it had effective procedures for evaluating and limiting the credit and market risks to which the Partnership may have been subject. These monitoring systems generally allowed the General Partner to statistically analyze actual trading results with risk-adjusted performance indicators and correlation statistics. In addition, online monitoring systems provided account analysis of futures, forward and option contracts by sector, margin requirements, gain and loss transactions and collateral positions. (See also "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for further information on financial instrument risks included in the notes to financial statements.)  The majority of these instruments matured within one year of the inception date. However, due to the nature of the Partnership's business, these instruments may not have been held to maturity.  Other than the risks inherent in U.S. Treasury bills, money market mutual fund securities, commodity futures, options and swaps trading, the Partnership/Master knew of no trends, demands, commitments, events or uncertainties which would have resulted in or which are reasonably likely to have resulted in the Partnership's/Master's liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way. The Limited Partnership Agreement provides that the General Partner may cause the Partnership to cease trading operations and liquidate all open positions under certain circumstances, including a decrease in net asset value per Redeemable Unit to less than $400 as of the close of business on any business day.  (i) The Partnership has made no material commitments for capital expenditures.  (ii) The Partnership's capital consists of the capital contributions of the partners as increased or decreased by gains or losses on trading and by expenses, interest income, redemptions of Redeemable Units and distributions of profits, if any. Gains or losses on trading cannot be predicted. Market movements in commodities are dependent upon fundamental and technical factors which the Advisor may or may not be able to identify, such as changing supply and demand relationships, weather, government, agricultural, commercial and trade programs and policies, national and international political and economic events and changes in interest rates. Partnership expenses consist of, among other things, clearing, ongoing selling agent, management and General Partner fees. The level of these expenses is dependent upon the level of trading and the ability of the Advisor to identify and take advantage of price movements in the commodity markets, in addition to the level of net assets maintained. In addition, the amount of interest income earned by the Partnership is dependent upon (1) the average daily equity maintained in cash in the Partnership's account, (2) the amount of U.S. Treasury bills and/or money market mutual fund securities held by the Partnership and (3) interest rates over which neither the Partnership nor MS&Co. has no control.  For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, there were no additional subscriptions of Redeemable Units. For the year ended December 31, 2014, there were additional subscriptions of 618.3640 Redeemable Units totaling $2,183,662.  No forecast can be made as to the level of redemptions in any given period. A limited partner may require the Partnership to redeem its Redeemable Units at their net asset value as of the end of a month on three business days' notice to the General Partner. There is no fee charged to limited partners in connection with redemptions. Redemptions generally are funded out of the Partnership's cash holdings. For the year ended December 31, 2016, 3,117.2810 limited partner Redeemable Units were redeemed totaling $9,564,202 and 82.0610 General Partner Redeemable Units were redeemed totaling $275,000. For the year ended December 31, 2015, 7,478.0770 limited partner Redeemable Units were redeemed totaling $24,577,583 and 36.7020 General Partner Redeemable Units were redeemed totaling $124,863. For the year ended December 31, 2014, 16,433.1240 limited partner Redeemable Units were redeemed totaling $56,783,495, 293.8710 General Partner Redeemable Units were redeemed totaling $992,661 and 464.0795 Special Limited Partner Redeemable Units were redeemed totaling $1,589,117.  Redeemable Units were sold to persons and entities who are accredited investors as that term is defined in Rule 501(a) of Regulation D under the Securities Act.  (c) Results of Operations.  For the year ended December 31, 2016, the net asset value per Redeemable Unit increased 6.5% from $3,162.09 to $3,366.10. For the year ended December 31, 2015, the net asset value per Redeemable Unit decreased 7.7% from $3,424.23 to $3,162.09. For the year ended December 31, 2014, the net asset value per Redeemable Unit decreased 4.2% from $3,572.94 to $3,424.23.  The Partnership experienced a net trading gain of $5,146,609 before fees and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016. Gains were primarily attributable to the Partnership's trading of commodity futures in natural gas. The net trading gain (or loss) realized from the Partnership is disclosed under "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."  The Partnership recorded its most significant gains during the last week of July as the Partnership benefitted from a move from net short positioning in natural gas futures to net long. Driven by increasingly hot, dry weather in the U.S., a seasonably weak increase in inventories, and growing demand from power generation, natural gas prices rallied strongly in the final days of the month. Gains were also achieved during September from the Partnership's long positioning as a surge in natural gas prices during the second week of the month provided most of the Partnership's gains for the month. The release of industry reports which showed a flattening supply outlook combined with increased demand nationally for natural gas drove prices higher in September. The Partnership also recorded gains throughout the latter half of August as the Partnership's advisor increased overall long exposure at the same time that natural gas prices began to rally, spurred by extremely hot temperatures in the U.S. which bolstered cooling demand from homes and businesses. During October, gains were achieved late in the month as mild weather patterns in the U.S. caused natural gas prices to plunge, benefitting the Partnership's short positions. Gains were also achieved during May as prices fell dramatically over the first several days of the month and followed with choppy price action closing out a volatile first week, benefitting the Partnership's short positioning. A portion of the Partnership's gains for the year was offset by losses incurred during February from long positions in natural gas futures as mild weather throughout much of the U.S. limited demand for natural gas and moved prices dramatically lower. The Partnership's net long positioning was also negatively affected during February after the release of U.S. Energy Information Administration (the "EIA") reports which indicated that output from U.S. shale formations was overwhelming demand for fuel and inflated the largest natural gas supply glut in the U.S. in four years. Losses were recorded during November from the Partnership's net short natural gas positioning as prices rallied sharply over the month's final days. Additional losses were experienced during April as choppy price actions dominated natural gas markets during the first half of the month. A spike in natural gas prices due to unseasonably cold weather in the Northeastern U.S. during the latter half of April also adversely affected the Partnership's positions. Smaller losses were recorded during the early days of March as a sharp drop in natural gas prices negatively affected the Partnership's long positions.  The Partnership experienced a net trading loss of $1,976,332 before fees and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015. Losses were primarily attributable to the Partnership's trading of commodity futures in natural gas.  The Partnership recorded the most significant losses during February. Losses were incurred at the start of the February due to short positions in natural gas futures after severe weather in the U.S. Midwest and Northeast spurred demand for heating from homes  and businesses. In the middle of February, weather again drove natural gas prices higher as much of the country faced colder-than-normal temperatures. Additionally, an industry report released in mid-February indicated that the number of working natural gas rigs in the U.S. decreased during January adding further upward pressure to gas prices. During December, losses were experienced as milder-than-normal weather throughout much of the U.S. pushed natural gas prices lower, negatively affecting the Partnership's net long positioning. Additional losses were recorded during June as an increase in prices early in the month resulted in losses for the Fund's short-biased positions. Later in June, following a move to a net long positioning, the Fund recorded further losses as prices moved lower on weak cooling demand driven by mild weather in much of the U.S. Losses were also incurred during July as falling natural gas prices driven by robust supplies, mild temperatures, and low demand in the U.S. negatively affected the Partnership's net long bias during the month. The Partnership's natural gas positions also recorded smaller losses during April, May, and October. A portion of the Partnership's losses during the year was offset by gains achieved during March as a fall in natural gas prices at the start of the month positively affected short positions. The Partnership's short positioning bias also benefitted from the release of an Energy Information Agency report in the middle of March which indicated that residential and business natural gas consumption fell during the early stages of the month. Mild weather that blanketed many of the major gas-consuming regions in the U.S. throughout March combined with the release of a report which showed that natural gas inventories advanced from the same period in the previous year to help the Partnership's short positions record profits during the latter half of March. Smaller gains were recorded during November.  Interest income on 80% of the Partnership's average daily equity maintained in cash during each month was earned at the monthly average of the 4-week U.S. Treasury bill discount rate. Any interest earned on the Partnership's account in excess of the amount described above, if any, will be retained by MS&Co. and/or shared with the General Partner. All interest earned on U.S. Treasury bills and money market fund securities will be retained by the Partnership. Interest income earned for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2016 increased by $28,948 and $91,664, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in 2015. The increase in interest income is primarily due to higher 4-week U.S. Treasury bill discount rates along with additional interest income earned on U.S. Treasury bills during the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the corresponding periods in 2015. Interest earned by the Partnership will increase the net asset value of the Partnership. The amount of interest income earned by the Partnership depends on (i) the average daily equity maintained in cash in the Partnership's account, (ii) the amount of U.S. Treasury bills and/or money market mutual fund securities held by the Partnership and (iii) interest rates over which neither the Partnership nor MS&Co. has control.  Clearing fees are based on the number of trades executed by the Advisor for the Partnership. Accordingly, they must be compared in relation to the number of trades executed during the period. Clearing fees for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2016 decreased by $25,300 and $164,042, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in 2015. The decrease is primarily due to a decrease in the number of trades made by the Advisor during the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the corresponding periods in 2015.  Ongoing selling agent fees are calculated as a percentage of the Partnership's net asset value as of the end of each month and are affected by trading performance and redemptions. Accordingly, they must be analyzed in relation to the fluctuations in the monthly net asset values. Ongoing selling agent fees for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2016 decreased by $42,501 and $301,129, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in 2015. The decrease is primarily due to lower average net assets during the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the corresponding periods in 2015.  Management fees are calculated as a percentage of the Partnership's net asset value as of the end of each month and are affected by trading performance and redemptions. Accordingly, they must be analyzed in relation to the fluctuations in the monthly net asset values. Management fees for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2016 decreased by $26,498 and $188,277, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in 2015. The decrease is primarily due to lower average net assets during the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the corresponding periods in 2015. In addition, no management fee was charged to the Partnership for the period January 1, 2015 to January 31, 2015.  General Partner fees are paid to the General Partner for administering the business and affairs of the Partnership, including, among other things,  Special Limited Partner profit share allocations are based on the new trading profits generated by the Advisor at the end of the quarter, as defined in the advisory agreement among the Partnership, the General Partner and the Advisor. There were no profit share allocations made for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. The Special Limited Partner will not receive a profit share allocation until the Advisor recovers the net loss incurred and earns additional new trading profits for the Partnership.  The Partnership pays professional fees, which generally include legal, accounting expenses, administrative, filing, reporting and data processing fees. . . .

People come to TurboTax AnswerXchange for help and answers—we want to let them know that we're here to listen and share our knowledge. We do that with the style and format of our responses. Here are five guidelines:

Keep it conversational. When answering questions, write like you speak. Imagine you're explaining something to a trusted friend, using simple, everyday language. Avoid jargon and technical terms when possible. When no other word will do, explain technical terms in plain English.
Be clear and state the answer right up front. Ask yourself what specific information the person really needs and then provide it. Stick to the topic and avoid unnecessary details. Break information down into a numbered or bulleted list and highlight the most important details in bold.
Be concise. Aim for no more than two short sentences in a paragraph, and try to keep paragraphs to two lines. A wall of text can look intimidating and many won't read it, so break it up. It's okay to link to other resources for more details, but avoid giving answers that contain little more than a link.
Be a good listener. When people post very general questions, take a second to try to understand what they're really looking for. Then, provide a response that guides them to the best possible outcome.
Be encouraging and positive. Look for ways to eliminate uncertainty by anticipating people's concerns. Make it apparent that we really like helping them achieve positive outcomes.

In making this determination, the related amount of indebtedness secured by the primary residence up to its fair market value may be excluded in calculating net worth.  However, indebtedness secured by the residence in excess of the value of the home is considered a liability and should be deducted from net worth.

B.	An individual whose gross income exceeded $200,000 in each of the two most recent calendar years, or whose joint gross income with the individual’s spouse exceeded $300,000 in each of the two most recent calendar years and, in either case, the individual has reasonable expectation of his single or joint gross income, respectively, reaching the same level in the current year.

C.	A partnership, corporation, limited liability company or business trust that either (i) is 100% owned by individuals who are accredited investors under (a) or (b) above, or (ii) was not formed for the specific purpose of investing in the Fund and whose total assets exceed $5,000,000.
D.	An employee benefit plan:  (i) whose investment decision is made by a plan fiduciary (as defined in ERISA §3(21)) that is a bank, savings and loan association, insurance company or registered investment adviser; (ii) whose total assets exceed $5,000,000 as of the date of a subscription agreement; or (iii) if a self-directed plan, whose investment decisions are made solely by persons who are accredited investors.

E.	A U.S. bank, U.S. savings and loan association or other similar U.S. institution acting in its individual or fiduciary capacity.

F.	A broker-dealer registered pursuant to §15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

G.	An organization described in §501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code with total assets exceeding $5,000,000 and not formed for the specific purpose of investing in the Fund.

H.	Any trust with total assets exceeding $5,000,000, not formed for the specific purpose of investing in the Fund, and whose purchase is directed by a person with such knowledge and experience in financial and business matters that he is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of the prospective investment.

I.	A plan established and maintained by a state or its political subdivisions, or any agency or instrumentality thereof, for the benefit of its employees, and which has total assets in excess of $5,000,000.

J.	An insurance company as defined in §2(13) of the Securities Act of 1933, or a registered investment company.

* The Net Expense Ratio includes management fees, other operating expenses and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses. If Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses were excluded, the Net Expense Ratio would be 1.45% for DXMAX, 2.20% for DXMCX, and 1.20% for DXMIX.  The Fund’s Adviser, Rafferty Asset Management, LLC (“Rafferty”) has entered into an Operating Services Agreement with each Fund. Under this Operating Service Agreement, Rafferty has contractually agreed to pay all expenses of each Fund through September 1, 2018 other than the following: management fees, Rule 12b-1distribution and/or service fees, any front-end or contingent deferred sales loads, acquired fund fees and expenses, taxes, swap financing and related costs, dividends or interest on short positions, other interest expenses, brokerage commissions and extraordinary expenses such as litigation or other expenses outside the typical day-to-day operations of the Fund. If these expenses were included, the net expense ratio would be higher.
The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.

  Addressing The Top Misconceptions About Alternative Investments    


Alternative strategies have the potential to be a viable way for investors, whether institutional or retail, to reduce risk in their investment portfolios.


  Alternatives? Too Many, or Not Enough?    


The key to risk-adjusted returns and diversification is not the number of securities – it’s their correlation – or, really, non-correlation – to each other, that’s paramount.


  A Correlation Misconception    


Some clients confuse negative correlation with low (or non-) correlation. They mistakenly believe that returns for investments with low correlation move in opposite directions from each other.

 The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost; current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted.

Short term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. For additional information, see the fund(s) prospectus.
Each Direxion Fund share price is calculated as of the close of regular trading, usually as of 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time, each day the New York Stock Exchange is open for business. Each fund seeks to meet its investment objective relative to the value of the target index or benchmark as of 4:00 p.m.
Shares of Direxion Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Market Price returns are based upon the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 PM Eastern time (when NAV is normally determined), and do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times. Fund returns assume that dividends and capital gains distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at NAV. Some performance results reflect expense subsidies and waivers in effect during certain periods shown. Absent these waivers, results would have been less favorable.
After-Tax and After-Tax, Post Sales Returns
Tax-adjusted returns and tax cost ratio are estimates of the impact taxes have had on a fund. We assume the highest tax rate in calculating these figures. These returns follow the SEC guidelines for calculating returns before sale of shares. Tax-adjusted returns show a fund’s annualized after tax total return for the one, three and five year periods, excluding any capital-gains effects that would result from selling the fund at the end of the period. To determine this figure, all income and short-term capital gains distributions are taxed at the maximum federal rate at the time of distribution. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a 15% rate. The after tax portion is then assumed to be reinvested in the fund. State and local taxes are not included in our calculations. For more information, please consult your tax consultant.
Distribution Dates

Payable and Ex-Date – With regard to mutual funds, this is the day on which declared distributions (dividends or capital gains) are deducted from the fund’s assets before it calculates its net asset value (NAV). The NAV per share will drop by the amount of the distribution per share.
Record Date – Date by which a shareholder must officially own shares in order to be entitled to a dividend.

Types of Distributions

Income Dividend – A portion of a company’s profit paid to common and preferred shareholders.
Long Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for more than one year.
Short Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for less than one year

How This New Fuel Source Is Set to Create Billions in New Wealth for Investors…
























 
































HOME


























How This New Fuel Source Is Set to Create Billions in New Wealth for Investors… 

By MONEY MORNING STAFF REPORTSIt can light and heat your home…
Run factories…
Propel space ships…
It can even power the ENTIRE U.S. electrical grid…
Even tech giants like Google are getting in early to related technologies – they’ve invested $1.8 billion into solar and wind power systems that simply will not work when it’s cloudy or not windy…
 
That is, without the use of this fuel.
And Apple is investing nearly $1 billion in the same thing!
Everywhere you look, America’s biggest companies are investing in systems that will be compatible with this fuel including:

Facebook
Amazon
AT&T
General Motors
Costco
Target

The list goes on.
But to truly reap the benefits and rewards of investing in OBL, you must act quickly to stake your claim before the mainstream media blows this story open and ordinary investors become privy to this opportunity. 
Historically, those who invested early in new energy sources made fortunes that allowed them total financial freedom.
Looking back, according to our estimates…

A $100 investment in Standard Oil would now be worth $153,285…
A $1,000 investment would be worth $1.5 million…
A $10,000 investment would be worth $15.3 million…

We are talking about staggering generational wealth, the kind that could make your family mega-rich today – and keep it that way 100 years from now.
And it all starts with ONE COMPANY at the heart of this massive shift.
Even if you only start with a few dollars, that’s fine. As you saw, even a thousand bucks could make you a fortune.
With an opportunity like this – pure ground floor – it doesn’t always matter how much you put in… what matters is that you get in early.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
