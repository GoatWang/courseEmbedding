Q:

Why do we wear wedding rings on our left hand?



A:
The custom of wearing wedding rings on the left hand originated in the third century B.C. in Greece. Physicians of that time incorrectly believed that a vein in the third finger of the left hand ran directly into the heart. Therefore, it made compelling sense that this body part should be chosen to bear a symbol of eternal love. The vein was known as "Vena Amoris," the "Vein of Love."

Q:
What are some of the social problems caused by urbanization?


A:
Some of the problems that develop from urbanization are a strain on basic services, increased poverty, poor public education, sanitation problems and rising crime rates. Urbanization, which is basically rapid urban growth, also brings with it a condition referred to as "urban sprawl" in which scattered urban development results in traffic congestion, environmental deterioration and the loss of open space and parks. In many of the high-density living areas in megacities, which are cities with populations more than five million, significant portions of the inhabitants, sometimes as high as 40 percent, live in a state of environmental degradation, poor security and irreversible poverty.

Above table reports Labor Condition Application(LCA) for H1B visa and Labor Certification(LC) for green card filed by Us 23 Lodge, Llc, Siam Square. The data only indicates the number of applications filed by Us 23 Lodge, Llc, Siam Square. It does not mean that Us 23 Lodge, Llc, Siam Square actually got the visa and hired the workers.Our LCA data includes LCA submitted for not only new employment, but also continuation or change in previously approved employment, new concurrent employment, change in employer and amended petition. Usually, only LCA for new employment needs H1B Visa quota if it is not cap-exempt. Us 23 Lodge, Llc, Siam Square has not filed any labor petitions for foreign workers from fiscal year 2014 to 2016. However, Us 23 Lodge, Siam Square had applied for LCA for H1B visa or LC for green card before 2012. You can still apply for their new openings. Be sure to contact their HR department or hiring managers for their updated work visa policy.Department of Labor(DOL) typically certifies more than 3 times the number of foreign work requests than the number of H1B visas issued by USCIS. So there is no one to one relationship between the number of workers certified by the DOL and the number of H1B work visas issued by the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS).
