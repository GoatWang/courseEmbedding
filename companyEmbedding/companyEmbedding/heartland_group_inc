Who We Are
She fell in love. She got married. And she started an agency. Barbara Campbell Determan left the University of Illinois to work for a livestock publication then transitioned into animal health sales. She was the first female sales representative hired by Upjohn and Iowa became her home. While on the road, she met her future husband, and they created their new home on Steve’s family farm south of Early, Iowa.
If you know Barb, you know she was not content to be still. In addition to her work on the farm and being a volunteer 4-H leader extraordinaire, she was hungry to follow her calling – work with agribusiness to help them tell their stories. And that’s when Heartland Marketing Group’s predecessor was launched.
Today, Heartland Marketing Group works with clients in the agribusiness, public policy, and advocacy sectors.
Heartland Marketing Group’s first full-time employee is still on staff. Ann Trimble-Ray came to HMG after college with writing skills, a farm background, and storytelling ability. Today she works closely with clients to develop and implement communications strategies. Ann writes most of HMG’s copy, edits all of it, and takes care of customers.
Katie Kaufman, our graphic designer, keeps our customers looking good with her skills. From logos to layouts, Katie helps tell a visual story. She also helps us stay organized, accountable, and on-time.

   	Jen Hoaglund also works on graphic design projects for our customers and has specific expertise in website coding and development. As our newest addition, she offers fresh eyes and ideas for storytelling. 

Our Team

Barbara Campbell Determan
President/Owner/Strategist

Barb grew up on a diversified farm in west central Illinois and attended the University of Illinois where she majored in Ag Communications. Her career includes livestock publication experience, animal health sales, and, courageously, small business ownership.
In addition to her work at HMG, Barb served on the National Pork Producers Council Board of Directors and was President of the organization in 2001-2002. She also served on the Iowa 4-H Foundation Board of Directors, serving as Chair in 2012. Recently, Barb was nominated by Iowa Governor Terry Branstad to serve on the Iowa Great Places Advisory Board and also was elected to the United States Animal Health Association Board.
Barb and Steve continue to farm and are the parents of three grown children: Andy, Dan, and Kourtney. Steve is Heartland Marketing Group’s Business Manager, taking care of accounting functions, IT responsibilities, and fixing what’s broken. Together they are leaders of the Early Achievers 4-H Club and active members of the Early United Methodist Church.


Ann Trimble-Ray
Vice President of Opportunities 

An Iowa farm girl, Ann graduated from Morningside College with a degree in Mass Communications, Print Emphasis, had no idea she’d remain in her first job out of college her entire career. Her responsibilities and capabilities have grown over the years as Heartland Marketing has evolved. 
Beyond her work at HMG, Ann serves on district and statewide committees for the United Methodist Church and was nominated by Governor Terry Branstad to serve on Judicial Nominating Commission, District 2B. She and her husband, Roger, are parents of one daughter, Becca, and have one amazing grandson, Ethan. Ann is also an active member of the Early United Methodist Church. 


Jen Hoaglund
Graphic Designer 

Jen worked for a web design firm then made the leap to join the team at HMG full-time. She comes to HMG with 13 years of design experience after graduating from The Creative Center in 2004 and looks forward to being able to do a broader scope of graphic projects. Jen loves small town life and is president of the Kiron Heritage Association where she lives.


Katie Kaufman
Graphic Designer 

Just out of college with a degree in graphic design along with a communications minor from Buena Vista University, Katie joined Heartland Marketing Group’s design team. Katie lives in Alta, Iowa. Prior to her graduation, Katie completed an internship with Buena Vista Regional Medical Center where she worked with clientele throughout the hospital. She also has expertise in photography and integrated communications. Two years ago, Katie traveled the Virgin Islands, which she enjoyed as it gave her a new sense of culture. She also enjoyed being an active member of the Graphic Design Club at BVU. Katie looks forward to working with our customers and building her portfolio with Heartland Marketing Group.




What We Do
One of our clients tells others we fill the gaps. Our expertise is in marketing communications. Our desire to help our customers succeed means we add skills, find partners, and do everything we can to achieve that goal. We strategize. We write. We design. We deliver. Using our decades of experience and ever-growing skills, we help you tell your story. No one is like you. Make sure your customers and prospects know it!

Strategic Marketing Plans
Developing a strategy for your company communications sets you on the right course for success. These plans can be for the year, a new product or service announcement, change in business, or any other opportunity to tell your story. We work closely with you to understand your needs, then define the audience to be addressed, and deliver the message in a timely, effective, and creative way. 


Visual Identity
The way you look is important. Does your visual identity – logo, signage, wearables, printer materials – reflect your business appropriately? We can help you look good! We’re intent on consistency, quality, and bold statements. 


Meetings & Events
One great way to share your story is by hosting an event. An unbelievable amount of detail goes into successful event planning. And we have helped organize events for thousands and focus groups of six. You also have the opportunity to tell your story by participating in an industry trade show. The secret is to make the most of this event with proper displays, messaging, staffing, and with us on your team. 


Media Relations
Working with media requires skill, patience, connections, and persistence. We have these in abundance! A coordinated media relations effort gives you a megaphone for your message and amplifies your story as it’s told to the masses. 


Website Development
Websites are like pets. They require constant attention, feeding, nurturing, and, every so often, a thorough cleaning. Working with partners with extensive skills, we can help you design a website to attract attention, provide relevant information, and tell your story. 


Sales & Communication Tools
You have a great story to tell and we have the tools to help you tell it most effectively: brochures, newsletters, blogs, websites, advertisements, and so much more! None of our projects are the same because we custom-design every project to meet your needs, your audience, and your goals.





Our Work
We hope you will take a few minutes to go through our portfolio of work. We are proud of the work we have done for our clients and as these examples will show, have a breadth and depth of experience few other communications agencies can offer. When you work with us, you always work with the principals of the agency. We don't have layers of bureaucracy, we build relationships. And we want to help you tell your story.
