    1.5 Specific dsDNA Quantification UV/VIS-based cDrop™ Method vs Picogreen® Fluorescent Assay

  Precise quantification and normalization of isolated genomic DNA is critical for advanced molecular testing in life science research and molecular diagnostics. UV-Vis based quantification has long been the method of choice, mainly because of its convenience. However, determining the DNA concentration based on the absorbance at 260nm suffers from interference of components such as RNA, proteins and phenols. Alternative methods, such as the PicoGreen® based Quant-iT™ assay, based on fluorescence enhancement upon binding with dsDNA have been developed to address this issue.

    1.3 Micro-volume Protein Quantification using the DropSense96 Droplet Plate Reader

  The measurement of protein concentration in aqueous samples is an important assay in biochemistry research and protein production facilities. Spectrophotometric protein quantification assays are commonly used methods to rapidly determine the concentration of a protein. They utilize the direct UV absorbance of the protein at 280nm in combination with its extinction coefficient or an indirect dye-based methods like BCA, Lowry and Bradford assays.

    1.2 DropSense96 and its DropPlates, a Versatile Tool for Nucleic Acid and Protein Droplet Quantification

  As the demand for molecular tests increases, automated systems for biomolecule isolation and sample analysis are becoming popular. These facilitate integration of the complete molecular test in a full automatic set-up with liquid robots and bar-coded sample tracking resulting in a significant higher throughput while minimizing tedious manual repetitive tasks. The Trinean technology is a unique combination of the DropSense96 droplet plate reader, the 96well DropPlate microfuidic consumables and the DropQuant analytical software enabling direct quantification of small biomolecule samples in these high throughput, automated workflow.

    1.14 Droplet UV/VIS Quantification of Native Proteins in Biopharmaceutical Processing

  Biopharmaceuticals are mainly produced by microbial fermentation or in animal cell cultures. As a consequence, a cascade of procedures including purification and characterization are required throughout the processing chain to obtain the protein at the desired level of purity and potency. Within these processes, quantification of the protein of interest is mandatory at critical steps to maintain confidence in the processing
results and fidelity in the end product.

    1.20 Quantification of His-tagged IgG antibodies after IMAC Ni-column purification

  Trinean introduces a new cDrop™ application suited for the quantification (OD280) of IgG antibodies and derivatives like Fab fragments during purification by IMAC Ni-columns using imidazole-containing buffers.

    Dye-free quantification of Oragene®/saliva DNA extracts using the Trinean DropSense96® Droplet Reader and cDrop™ Spectral Analysis Software

  Saliva samples collected with Oragene® self-collection kits from DNA Genotek offer a non-invasive and proven method for accessing high quality and quantity DNA for genomic testing and analysis. Proper quantification of the extracted DNA is a critical step
for most downstream applications. Trinean has developed a specific quantification protocol for DNA from Oragene/saliva samples using the DropSense96® droplet reader and the cDrop™ spectral decomposition software. A comparative analysis using a PicoGreen® fluorescent quantification assay shows a comparable specificity for dsDNA quantification. Since the read-out
of 96 samples with the DropSense96 is performed in 5 minutes without any prior mixing or incubation, this technology is a viable alternative to fluorescent quantification assays.

    1.17 Maxwell®16 Blood purification Kit App and Maxwell®16 LEV Blood DNA Kit App

  A spectral content profiling application on the cDrop™ software is available for quantification and contamination analysis of DNA isolations from blood using the Maxwell® 16 Blood DNA purification Kit and The Maxwell®16 LEV Blood DNA Kit. In this note we describe how to use this application and how to export and interpret the results.

    1.7 Quantifying Amplicons in Non-Purified PCR Reactions: Direct Assessment of Product Yield

  The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a fundamental tool in molecular biology and clinical testing. Most genetic tests rely upon the power of PCR to enrich specific target-sequences prior to analysis. Analytical methods like sequencing are relatively expensive and labs want to minimize the resources spent on samples that don't meet the requirements of concentration and quality to deliver a reliable result.

    1.19 Qiagen® EZ1 Tissue DNA app

  A spectral content profiling application on the cDrop™ software is available for quantification and contamination analysis of DNA isolations from cells using the Qiagen® EZ1 Tissue DNA kit. In this note we describe how to use this application and how to export and interpret the results.

    1.10 cDrop Protocol for TRIzol RNA Extract Quantification and Content QC

  This cDrop protocol is developed for specific RNA quantification of extracts from a variety of sample origins (human, animal, plant) using extraction kits based on the
one-step extraction method using a guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol- chloroform reagent-mix developed by Chomczynski (1). Commercial available variants include the TRIzol® kit (Invitrogen), TRI Reagent® (MRC), RNAzolTM (MRC) and RNA STAT-60TM (Tel-Test).

    All-Purpose Protein Sample QC Using a Novel Micro-Volume Platform with Spectral Content Profiling Software

  Accurate total protein quantitation of purified proteins, cell lysates, affinity-column fractions or other complex protein samples is crucial for robust biochemical testing during biopharmaceutical development as well as production. As the presence of chemicals doesn't allow simple A280 protein quantification, more labor-intensive alternatives for quantification are used. Examples are the colorimetric Bradford or BCA assay, which negate to a large extent the presence of contaminants but require multiple steps and show variation depending on the sample composition and time point of measuring within the ongoing reaction.

    Precise Nucleic Acid Quantification Using Lab-on-a-chip Spectroscopy and the cDrop Quantification Algorithm

  Precise quantification and quality control of isolated genomic DNA is critical for the success of downstream applications such as next-generation sequencing. Traditionally, two quantification methods have been used routinely: (1) UV/Vis spectroscopy and (2) fluorescence-based assays (i.e. PicoGreen) that utilize DNA intercalating agents.

    Sample Processing for the UK Biobank Genotyping Project

  A project was initiated in 2013 to perform SNP genotyping on all UK Biobank participants. The aim of the project (which was to be completed within an 18-24 month timeframe) was to generate high quality genotype data and to make these data available for researchers, via the UK Biobank Showcase system. This poster describes the sample processing workflow, presents a comparison between the two quantification methods used in the project (Trinean DropSense® 96 and PicoGreen) and provides a summary of the genotyping metrics for the (approx.) first 180,000 samples analysed.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.

No sell buffer

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year

4 Biotech Stocks with Bright Prospects in 2017

 Biotech, a happening but highly volatile sector, again found itself in rough waters this year due to the drug pricing issue. This is evident from the 20.8% decline witnessed by the NASDAQ Biotechnology Index in the year-to-date period. Besides, strained balance sheets and macroeconomic woes are not making things any easier.  What the Sector Went Through  Even though exorbitant drug prices have always been a concern, the issue of drug price hikes initially made it to the headlines in Sep 2015 due to former U.S. presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's "price gouging" tweet. Since then, several well-known companies like Mylan N.V. MYL  and Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc. VRX  have drawn immense flak for massive increases in drug prices. While Clinton's strong criticism of drug price hikes cast a shadow over the entire sector initially, Donald Trump's unexpected victory in November sent them rallying. This was probably because Trump had not been as vocal as Clinton about drug price hikes during the campaign. As a result, the biotech sector witnessed a 9% increase post the election results. However, the post-election rally came to an abrupt halt when the President-elect clarified that his intentions were misinterpreted and that he actually plans to target excessive drug price hikes. Winner of Time's "Person of the Year" title, Trump stated in an interview with the magazine, "I'm going to bring down drug prices. I don't like what has happened with drug prices."    But will the next year mark a turnaround for this sector? Let's find out.  As usual, mergers and acquisitions, and licensing deals in the sector continued to be in the limelight in 2016. Horizon Pharma plc acquired California-based Raptor Pharmaceuticals Corp., while Pfizer Inc. took over oncology-focused biotech company Medivation, Inc. for approximately $14 billion. Again, Shire plc merged with Baxalta Incorporated in a deal worth approximately $32 billion. This trend should continue in 2017 as companies begin developing new therapies and interesting pipeline candidates. Collaborations between large-cap and development-stage companies should continue, particularly in the immuno-oncology space and to some extent in other therapeutic areas like autoimmune and cardiovascular.    Interestingly, several products gained approval this year. Eli Lilly and Company gained accelerated approval in the U.S. for Lartruvo, in combination with doxorubicin, for the first-line treatment of soft tissue sarcoma. Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc. received a huge boost with the regulatory nod for Exondys 51 for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Biogen Inc. and Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. got a boost with the FDA approving their spinal muscular atrophy treatment Spinraza within three months of the regulatory filing. Apart from new product approvals, biotech companies continue to work on label expansion of their existing drugs to boost their commercial potential. Note that a big development in the medical space is the ongoing focus on biosimilars. This is an opportunity that biotech companies are vying to capitalize on because of its high-revenue potential. Meanwhile, the widespread outbreak of the deadly Zika virus has brought companies such as Inovio Pharmaceuticals, Inc. among others into the limelight. The future of the biotech sector is shrouded in uncertainty until Trump formalizes his healthcare plan. Nevertheless, the abovementioned factors indicate that this might be the perfect time to invest in some solid biotech stocks. Forget the gym, finding great stocks should be your New Year's resolution! Don't miss out on our new Top 10 Stocks for 2017 list, which has been hand-picked from 4,400 stocks covered by the Zacks Rank.  Be one of the first to see this year's list   here>>    4 Outperformers for the New Year  With the help of the Zacks Stock Screener  , we have picked four biotech stocks with a Zacks #2 (Buy) and a VGM Score  of "A" or "B." Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum, and the score is a weighted combination of these three metrics. Such a score allows you to reduce the negative aspects of stocks and zero in on the outperformers. We have finally picked the stocks that have outperformed the Medical - Biomedical and Genetics  industry.   Performance of Top Picks Vs Sector (Last 3     Months)          Investors can safely bet on Tarrytown, NY-based Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. REGN  , which is focused on the development of treatments for eye disorders, cholesterol management, rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, atopic dermatitis, pain, cancer and infectious diseases. Its flagship product, Eylea, continues to drive the top line. Regeneron has surpassed earnings expectations in all the three reported quarters of 2016. The stock has a long-term earnings growth rate of 21.5%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2016 earnings improved 3.8% and 1.8% in 2017 over the last 60 days. The company's expected growth rate for the current year is 5.6% and 5.1% for 2017. Though the stock lost 5.8% in the past three months, it has outperformed the industry's decline of 6.6%. The stock has a VGM Score of "B". You can see  the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy)   stocks here   . South San Francisco, CA-based, Exelixis, Inc. EXEL  , a cancer-focused company, is a good pick too. The company has a VGM Score of "B." It posted an average positive surprise of 38.52% in the trailing four quarters. While the Zacks Consensus Estimate for loss narrowed approximately 23% for 2016, earnings estimates for 2017 have increased 25% over the last 60 days. The company's expected growth rate is 42.4% and 110.7% for 2016 and 2017, respectively. In the past three months, the stock has gained 19%, outperforming the industry. We also suggest investing in Mountain View, CA-based VIVUS, Inc. VVUS  . VIVUS delivered an average positive surprise of 59.73% in the trailing four quarters. The developer of treatments for obesity, sleep apnea, diabetes and sexual health has a VGM Score of "A." The Zacks Consensus Estimate for loss has narrowed approximately 34.9% for 2016 and 7.4% for 2017 over the last 60 days. The company's expected growth rate for the current year is 33.9%. We note that in the past three months, the stock gained 2.6% and hence outperformed the industry. Last but not least, we have picked Copenhagen, Denmark-based Genmab A/S GNMSF  , which is focused on the development of differentiated antibody therapeutics for the treatment of cancer. The stock has a VGM Score of "B." The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings surged 305.9% in 2016 and 4.3% in 2017 over the last 60 days. The company's expected growth rate is 10.7% and 16.4% for 2016 and 2017, respectively. In the past three months, the stock inched up 0.6%, thereby outperforming the industry.  Bottom Line  The drug pricing issue is here to stay. However, the need of the hour is to strike a balance between innovation and affordability. In fact, the CEO of Regeneron finds price hikes "ridiculous" and feels that "as an industry, we have to innovate and innovate." Moreover, Allergan Inc.'s AGN  CEO, Brent Saunders even issued a document on the website entitled "Our Social Contract with Patients," which outlines a plan of self-regulatory policies. It remains to be seen if other companies indeed follow suit.   Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

Incyte Sees Upgrade From Vetr Crowd 

Small Cancer Biotech Space in Focus, 3 Stocks Up 100% & More 


 
Merus NV (NASDAQ: MRUS) and Incyte Corporation (NASDAQ: INCY) announced a global strategic research collaboration agreement aimed at discovering and developing bispecific antibodies on Wednesday. Shares of Merus have spiked almost 45 percent since.
According to the contact, Incyte will pay Merus $120 million upfront and purchase 3.2 million shares of the company at $25 per share — $80 million in stock — to get exclusive rights to as many 11 of the latter’s bispecific antibody research programs, including two preclinical immuno-oncology projects.
Following the announcement, Benzinga had a conversation with Merus CEO Ton Logtenberg and Chief Business Officer Hui Liu, who offered some insight into the company and the agreement.
Making A Difference
Benzinga asked about what might separate Merus’ antibodies from the rest of the market or other treatments that could possibly be out there.
“First of all, the bispecifics that we develop have the natural IgG format, and that translates into dependable manufacturing and development, as well as predictable behavior in vivo, meaning half-life and low immunogenicity,” Logtenberg explained. “So, that is sort of the core of the technology.”
In addition, he continued, “I think what plays into the bispecific world is the ability to address two different targets. The best known application of this approach is the T-cell engager, in which [the] C3 [component] is addressed on a T-cell, and the other arm of the bispecific binds to a target expressed by tumor cells, and that redirects the T-cell to get activated and recognize the tumor cell resulting in a killing.”
However, the chief executive supplemented, “Merus has gone beyond that, and based on our functional assays – that we very elaborately apply in our preclinical programs, we have found that targeting two different targets on the same tumor cell or tumor stem cell [...] that gives new biologies and modes of action that are very attractive, and that go above and beyond combinations of monoclonal antibodies.”
“That is just one additional application,” he assured. “Other applications are based on addressing two different targets that may be either on immunomodulatory cells and/or tumor cells and/or other players in the oncology space, and that indeed go beyond the T-cell engager approach.
“I think what Incyte has seen, and what Merus has been propagating as bispecifics, will yield products that are differentiated and have effective modes of action,” he concluded.
Plans For 2017
Benzinga: With the Incyte deal closed and the cash in hand, what is Merus going to focus on going into 2017? 
Logtenberg: First of all, 2017 is going to be an important year because we have milestones coming up that are relevant for the progression of our clinical programs, both 128 and 117. So, obviously for a company at our stage, those are important progressions that we would like to report on.
A second important element is that, with the cash available through this deal and with a new collaboration in place, we are going to update our investors and our shareholders on the strategic elements of our plan going forward; and, of course, that has shifted based on this new deal. We are looking forward to doing that.
Again, as we mentioned in the call, we are looking for partners that have exciting target pairs and biology that would fit our bispecific antibody platform to work with. So, we hope to continue those discussions and work with other parties as well and it’s fair to say that this strategic deal with Incyte is, of course, very important to us, so we’ll work with our new partners towards creating molecules that make a lot of sense in terms of being attractive for and relevant for treating cancer patients.
[...]
For the clinical programs, we have communicated that we are working towards interim results for 128 towards the end of the first quarter of 2017, and top line results for this HER2, HER3 program in the second half of 2017, for multiple tumor indications, as well as report in the second half of 2017 on the progress we’re making in the AML program MCLA-117 with projected safety results, as well as hopefully some results on the efficacy of the compound.
