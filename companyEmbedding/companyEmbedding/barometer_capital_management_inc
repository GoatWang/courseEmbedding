Renaissance Water Barometer - Antique Wood Frame - 14 Inches Tall 


                        The River City Renaissance Water Barometer is a historic piece of art that quickly  indicates changes in barometric pressure. The barometer is composed of antique  wood spools found in abandoned textile mills in England. The spools were used  to hold thread, cotton, and yarn that were spun into                        
                             fabric. The spindles and  wooden base date back to 1907-1913 and were used in a factory in Calder Valley,  Yorkshire which wove the thread into a cotton tartan fabric. Each barometer has a cotton sticker from 1917 placed on its base. These stickers    were made in New York in 1917 and found in a cupboard with the original invoice. History of the Barometer   Renaissance scientist, Evangelista Torricelli (1608-1647), discovered the first    barometer, proving that air pressure was subject to change. It is believed that    Goethe, the famous German playwright, developed this simple but effective barometer    using the principles established by Torricelli. How does it Work?   The Weatherball quickly indicates any changes in atmospheric pressure. The air    trapped by the liquid maintains a steady pressure. When high pressure and good    weather are approaching, the liquid is pushed down the spout. When low pressure    and bad weather invade your region greater pressure trapped inside the Weatherball    causes the liquid in the spout to rise. If liquid spills out of the top you    should take shelter The glass barometer is made from mouth-blown glass in the United Kingdom. As    with all antique and hand-made items, the colors and decorations vary slightly.    We consider this to be a special part of their history and character. Additional Info:    Warranty: 2 Year Limited Warranty    Item Dimensions: 14.3 x 4.5 x 4.5 inches    Item Weight: 1.0 lbs.    Made in United Kingdom

Barometer was formed in 2001, and today, Barometer remains an independent partner-owned firm with 26 employees that manages money for over 450 families with over $2.5 billion under management.   The partners created Barometer to offer investment services suited to the unique objectives of a private investor. As opposed to traditional institutional investment companies who measure success with relative returns, Barometer believes private investors are more interested in strategies aimed at generating a return above zero, while focusing on preservation of capital  Source: Barometer Capital Management Inc.Unique Value PropositionThe Disciplined Leadership Approach™ combines a top-down market and sector risk assessment model with a bottom-up quantitative security selection process. Risk levels in various markets, sectors and asset classes are assessed and reassessed to determine the appropriate degree of exposure in each mandate versus holding cash or short term deposits. This allows us to focus portfolios in productive pockets of strength in market leading securities. Distilling our holdings, along with our willingness to hold significant cash positions in the absence of clear market leadership has helped us to have consistently positive returns.  Portfolio diversification is important. However, over diversification can lead to market-like, correlated returns. As active managers, our goal is not to simply mimic an index, rather to produce absolute returns. Whether equity portfolio, which is typically made up of 20-30 positions, balanced portfolio, which holds 30-40 positions or high-income portfolio at 40-50 positions, a portfolio that is focused provides diversification while allowing the most dynamic, best performing securities to make a difference.

Renaissance Water Barometer - Antique Wood Frame - 14 Inches Tall 


                        The River City Renaissance Water Barometer is a historic piece of art that quickly  indicates changes in barometric pressure. The barometer is composed of antique  wood spools found in abandoned textile mills in England. The spools were used  to hold thread, cotton, and yarn that were spun into                        
                             fabric. The spindles and  wooden base date back to 1907-1913 and were used in a factory in Calder Valley,  Yorkshire which wove the thread into a cotton tartan fabric. Each barometer has a cotton sticker from 1917 placed on its base. These stickers    were made in New York in 1917 and found in a cupboard with the original invoice. History of the Barometer   Renaissance scientist, Evangelista Torricelli (1608-1647), discovered the first    barometer, proving that air pressure was subject to change. It is believed that    Goethe, the famous German playwright, developed this simple but effective barometer    using the principles established by Torricelli. How does it Work?   The Weatherball quickly indicates any changes in atmospheric pressure. The air    trapped by the liquid maintains a steady pressure. When high pressure and good    weather are approaching, the liquid is pushed down the spout. When low pressure    and bad weather invade your region greater pressure trapped inside the Weatherball    causes the liquid in the spout to rise. If liquid spills out of the top you    should take shelter The glass barometer is made from mouth-blown glass in the United Kingdom. As    with all antique and hand-made items, the colors and decorations vary slightly.    We consider this to be a special part of their history and character. Additional Info:    Warranty: 2 Year Limited Warranty    Item Dimensions: 14.3 x 4.5 x 4.5 inches    Item Weight: 1.0 lbs.    Made in United Kingdom

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
