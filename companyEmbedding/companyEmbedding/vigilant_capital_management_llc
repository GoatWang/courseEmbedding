Careers



Our Clients
Our clients are comprised of a select group of high net worth individuals and families, and certain non-profit and institutional entities. It is our responsibility to shepherd their capital, providing them with the best opportunity to achieve their financial objectives.
By limiting the clients with whom we work, we are able to focus on each client relationship, thus giving us the best opportunity to truly understand what each client is trying to accomplish. This, in turn, enables us to construct an appropriate investment portfolio and to ensure that each client’s unique wealth-planning needs are properly addressed.
We manage between $2 million and $20 million on behalf of our typical client. We do not have a minimum relationship size but we do assess a minimum annual fee of $20,000.

Measuring Markets – Asset Allocation Guide 1-2016
 For investors, this past year proved frustrating despite economic conditions that would have seemingly been more constructive for markets. An improving economic backdrop in Europe and Japan, strong payroll gains and impressive auto sales in the U.S., along with extremely accommodative monetary conditions around the globe, all seemed to support opportunity for gain.

Measuring Markets – 3Q15
 The recent sell-off of risk assets has been described by some as the muchanticipated and long-waited correction. But corrections only occur when uncertainty and anxiety arise, not simply because investors expect them. And while it is one thing to say that you are expecting a correction, it is entirely another when you are experiencing one and need to act accordingly.

Measuring Markets – 1Q15
 Each January, we join the parade of market observers reflecting on the year just passed and pontificating on the year ahead. We admit to this being a rather futile exercise; every year certain forecasts may materialize, but to attempt to predict economic and market outcomes with regular success can prove to be a fool’s errand.

Winter 2013 – View from the Pier
 With all of the attention focused on Washington politics, it is easy to overlook improving economic conditions domestically and abroad. The post-Great Recession recovery has been one of the weakest in a century’s time as we never experienced the coiled-spring effect that usually occurs as an economy comes out of contraction.

Summer 2011 – View from the Pier
 Our long-term view has been that the mature economies of the world, those that have dominated global economic activity for decades, are destined for slower growth in the years ahead. History is filled with examples of aging populations that downshift from heady growth to slower overall activity, but the transition in play for the United States, most of Europe and Japan is an accelerated one and is exacerbated by the enormous amount of leverage that now suffocates these economies.

Winter 2011 – View from the Pier
 While the Great Recession of 2008 is twenty-four months behind us, it still remains fresh in the minds of investors, consumers and policy-makers alike. And rightfully so, for, although the economic environment feels better today, the repercussions of the events of that period and the policy decisions executed as a means of extraction from it, are likely to remain present, sometimes obvious and sometimes not, for years to come.

Fall 2010 – View from the Pier
 The model for economic recovery is simple: Government stimulus pumps cash and incentives into the system, which encourages private consumption and investment, which, in turn, creates jobs and income. Because people have repressed spending during the lean period, pent-up demand exists and, as folks begin to spend again, confidence rises and the handoff from government to the private sector is underway, with a little boost from the “multiplier effect”.

Spring 2010 – View from the Pier
 As we enter a new decade, massive intervention by governments and central banks are helping the global economy emerge from the Great Recession. The measures taken to climb from the depths of the credit crisis have been nothing short of awesome in scale and scope.
