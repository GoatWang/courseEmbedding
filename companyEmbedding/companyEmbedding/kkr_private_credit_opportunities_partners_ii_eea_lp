Industry PerspectiveAlternative Credit in Europe+ Read more
We believe KKR’s Credit platform  has a combination of characteristics that allows us to offer clients a diverse range of investment solutions and to deliver strong investment performance. These key differentiating factors are:
Global Presence:With a team of over 140 investment professionals in New York, San Francisco, London, Dublin, Singapore, Sydney, and Mumbai as of March 31, 2017, the KKR  Credit team has a global reach with a local presence. This allows our investment professionals to obtain deep insight into companies, management teams, and other stakeholders in our portfolio companies and markets. 

Depth of Analysis: Our investment teams are organized into industry groups. Our professionals, who are experts in their fields, utilize this structure to address the complexities of investing in global businesses. The teams can also leverage the intellectual capital of KKR’s entire network, where appropriate, to gain an edge in analyzing prospects and performance of corporate issuers.

Differentiated Sourcing Model: KKR has a long track record of sourcing investment opportunities and deploying capital globally and across the capital structure. This experience has resulted in a deep and established network of relationships with banks, advisors, companies, sponsors and trading counterparties. It is this network that we believe gives us a competitive advantage of finding and identifying investments for our clients.
The KKR Credit platform is composed of the Marketable Securities Division and the Alternative Investments Division. This platform offers clients a broad range of active investment strategies globally, that represent a wide range of risk/return and liquidity profiles:




Alternative Investments Division




Special Situations: Deep value investing in distressed or event driven situations; the provision of debt or equity to companies requiring bespoke solutions and opportunistic investments to capitalize on KKR intellectual capital
Mezzanine: Directly sourced mezzanine financings
Direct Lending: Direct lending focuses on proprietarily sourced senior debt financings
Long/Short Credit: Fundamental long/short credit investing, employing a market-neutral strategy focused primarily on the corporate credit markets






Marketable Securities Division
