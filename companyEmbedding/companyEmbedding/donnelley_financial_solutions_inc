(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Company Overview  Donnelley Financial Solutions, Inc. ("Donnelley Financial," the "Company") is an industry leading financial communications and data services company that supports global capital markets compliance and transaction needs for its corporate clients and their advisors (such as law firms and investment bankers) and global investment management compliance and analytics needs for mutual fund companies, variable annuity providers and broker/dealers. The Company provides content management, multi-channel content distribution, data management and analytics services, collaborative workflow and business reporting tools, and translations and other language services in support of its clients' communications requirements. The Company operates in two business segments:   United States. The United States segment is comprised of three reporting units: capital markets, investment markets, and language solutions and other. The Company services capital market and investment market clients in the United States by delivering products and services to help create, manage and deliver financial communications to investors and regulators. The Company provides capital market and investment market clients with communication tools and services to allow them to comply with their ongoing regulatory filings. In addition, the U.S. segment provides clients with communications services to create, manage and deliver registration statements, prospectuses, proxies and other communications to regulators and investors. The U.S. segment also includes language solutions and commercial printing capabilities.   International. The International segment includes operations in Asia, Europe, Latin America and Canada. The international business is primarily focused on working with international capital markets clients on capital markets offerings and regulatory compliance related activities within the United States. In addition, the International segment provides services to international investment market clients to allow them to comply with applicable SEC regulations, as well as language solutions to international clients.   Corporate. The Company reports certain unallocated selling, general and administrative activities and associated expenses within Corporate, including, in part, executive, legal, finance, communications and certain facility costs. In addition, certain costs and earnings of employee benefit plans, such as pension and other postretirement benefits plan expense and share-based compensation, are included in Corporate and are not allocated to the reportable segments. Prior to the Separation, many of these costs were based on allocations from RR Donnelley & Sons Company ("RRD"); however, beginning October 1, 2016, the Company will incur such costs directly.  Products and Services  The Company separately reports its net sales and related cost of sales for its products and services offerings. The Company's services offerings consist of all non-print offerings, including document composition, compliance related EDGAR filing services, transaction solutions, data and analytics, content storage services and language solutions. The Company's product offerings primarily consist of conventional and digital printed products and related shipping costs.  Spin-off Transaction  On October 1, 2016, Donnelley Financial became an independent publicly traded company through the distribution by RRD of approximately 26.2 million shares, or 80.75%, of Donnelley Financial common stock to RRD shareholders (the "Separation"). Holders of RRD common stock received one share of Donnelley Financial common stock for every eight shares of RRD common stock held on September 23, 2016. RRD retained approximately 6.2 million shares of Donnelley Financial common stock, or a 19.25% interest in Donnelley Financial, as part of the Separation, but expects to dispose of the common stock that it retained in the 12-month period following the Separation. Donnelley Financial's Registration Statement on Form 10, as amended ("Form 10), was declared effective by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") on September 20, 2016. Donnelley Financial's common stock began regular-way trading under the ticker symbol "DFIN" on the New York Stock Exchange on October 3, 2016. On October 1, 2016, RRD also completed the previously announced separation of LSC Communications, Inc. ("LSC"), its publishing and retail-centric print services and office products business.  Executive Overview  Third Quarter Overview  Net sales decreased by $7.2 million, or 3.1%, for the third quarter of 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year. There was a $1.1 million, or 0.5%, decrease due to changes in foreign exchange rates. In addition to the impact of foreign exchange rates, the decrease in net sales was due to lower capital markets transactions and compliance volume, partially offset by an increase in virtual data room and translation services.  On September 30, 2016, in connection with the Separation, the Company entered into a $350.0 million senior secured term loan B facility (the "Term Loan Credit Facility") and a $300.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the "Revolving Facility," and, together with the Term Loan Credit Facility, the "Credit Agreement"). On September 30, 2016, also in connection with the Separation, the Company issued $300.0 million of 8.25% senior unsecured notes due October 15, 2024. The issuance of the notes was part of a debt exchange that resulted in the settlement of certain of RRD's bonds. Borrowings under the Term Loan Credit Facility were used to provide $340.2 million of cash to RRD, pursuant to the Separation agreement, as of September 30, 2016.  On October 1, 2016, Donnelley Financial recorded net pension plan liabilities of $68.3 million (consisting of a total benefit plan liability of $317.0 million, net of plan assets having fair market value of $248.7 million), as a result of the transfer of certain pension plan liabilities and assets from RRD to the Company upon the legal split of those plans. Refer to Note 5, Retirement Plans, to the Condensed Combined Financial Statements for further details regarding the Company's pension and other postretirement benefit plans.  Non-GAAP Measures  The Company believes that certain Non-GAAP measures, such as Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA, provide useful information about the Company's operating results and enhance the overall ability to assess the Company's financial performance. The Company uses these measures, together with other measures of performance under GAAP, to compare the relative performance of operations in planning, budgeting and reviewing the performance of its business. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA allows investors to make a more meaningful comparison between the Company's core business operating results over different periods of time. The Company believes that Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA, when viewed with the Company's results under GAAP and the accompanying reconciliations, provides useful information about the Company's business without regard to potential distortions. By eliminating potential differences in results of operations between periods caused by factors such as depreciation and amortization methods, historic cost and age of assets, financing and capital structures, taxation positions or regimes, restructuring, impairment and other charges and gain or loss on certain equity investments and asset sales, the Company believes that Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA can provide a useful additional basis for comparing the current performance of the underlying operations being evaluated.  Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA excludes restructuring, impairment and other charges-net. A reconciliation of GAAP net earnings to Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 for these adjustments is presented in the following table:   Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 2015 2016 2015 (in millions) Net earnings $ 10.2 $ 16.8 $ 59.9 $ 81.1 Restructuring, impairment and other charges-net 1.7 1.4 3.6 3.3 Depreciation and amortization 9.8 10.3 30.1 32.0 Interest (income) expense-net (0.1 ) 0.3 0.3 0.9 Income tax expense 7.9 11.1 39.3 52.6 Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA $ 29.5 $ 39.9 $ 133.2 $ 169.9  Three Months Ended September 30, 2016  2016 Restructuring, impairment and other charges-net. The three months ended September 30, 2016 included $1.3 million for employee termination costs and $0.4 million of lease termination and other restructuring costs.  Three Months Ended September 30, 2015  2015 Restructuring, impairment and other charges-net. The three months ended September 30, 2015 included $0.9 million for employee termination costs and $0.5 million of lease termination and other restructuring costs.  Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016  2016 Restructuring, impairment and other charges-net. The nine months ended September 30, 2016 included $2.3 million for employee termination costs, $1.2 million of lease termination and other restructuring costs and $0.1 million for other charges associated with the Company's decision to withdraw in 2013 from certain multi-employer pension plans serving facilities that continued to operate.  Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015  2015 Restructuring, impairment and other charges-net. The nine months ended September 30, 2015 included $1.7 million for employee termination costs, $1.5 million of lease termination and other restructuring costs and $0.1 million for other charges associated with the Company's decision to withdraw in 2013 from certain multi-employer pension plans serving facilities that continued to operate.  OUTLOOK  Competition  Technological and regulatory changes, including the electronic distribution of documents and data hosting of media content and advances in technology, continue to impact the market for our products and services. One of the Company's competitive strengths is that it offers a wide array of communications products, compliance services and technologies, a global platform, exceptional sales and service and regulatory domain expertise, which provide differentiated solutions for its clients.  The financial communications services industry, in general, is highly competitive and barriers to entry have decreased as a result of technology innovation. Despite some consolidation in recent years, the industry remains highly fragmented in the United States and even more so internationally with many in-country alternative providers. The Company expects competition to increase from existing competitors, as well as new and emerging market entrants. In addition, as the Company expands its product and service offerings, it may face competition from new and existing competitors. The Company competes primarily on product quality and functionality, service levels, subject matter regulatory expertise, security and compliance characteristics, price and reputation.  The impact of digital technologies has been felt in many print products, most acutely in the Company's mutual fund, variable annuity and public company compliance business offerings. Historically, the Company has been a high-touch, service oriented business. Technology changes have provided alternatives to the Company's clients that allow them to manage more of the financial disclosure process themselves through collaborative document management solutions. For years, the Company has invested in its own applications, ActiveDisclosure, FundSuiteArc and Venue to serve clients and increase retention and has invested to expand capabilities and address new market sectors. The future impact of technology on the business is difficult to predict and could result in additional expenditures to restructure impacted operations or develop new technologies. In addition, the Company has made targeted acquisitions and investments in its existing business to offer clients innovative services and solutions, including acquisitions of EDGAR Online and MultiCorpora and investments in Mediant, Peloton and eBrevia that further solidify the Company's position as a technology service leader in the industry.  The Company's competitors for SEC filing services for capital markets clients include full service financial communications providers, technology point solution providers focused on financial communications and general technology providers. The Company's competitors for SEC filing services for investment markets clients include full service traditional providers, small niche technology providers and local and regional print providers that bid against the Company for printing, mailing and fulfillment services. Language solutions competes with global and local language service providers and language/globalization software vendors.  Market Volatility/Cyclicality  The Company is subject to market volatility in the United States and world economy, as the success of the transactional offering is largely dependent on the global market for IPOs, secondary offerings, mergers and acquisitions, public and private debt offerings, leveraged buyouts, spinouts and additional miscellaneous transactions. The Company mitigates some of that risk by offering services in higher demand during a down market, like document management tools for the bankruptcy/restructuring process, and also moving upstream from the filing process with products like Venue, the Company's data room solution. The Company also attempts to balance this volatility through supporting the quarterly/annual public company reporting process through its EDGAR filing services and ActiveDisclosure product, its investment markets regulatory and shareholder communications offering and continues to expand into adjacent growth businesses like language solutions and data and analytics, which have recurring revenues and are not as susceptible to market volatility and cycles. This quarterly/annual public company reporting process work also subjects the Company to filing seasonality shortly after the end of each fiscal quarter, with peak periods during the course of the year that have operational implications. Such operational implications include the need to increase staff during peak periods through a combined strategy of hiring additional full-time and temporary personnel, increasing the premium time of existing staff, and outsourcing production for a number of services. The International segment is particularly susceptible to capital market volatility as most of the International business is capital markets transaction focused. Additionally, clients and their financial advisors have begun to increasingly rely on web-based services which allow clients to autonomously file and distribute compliance documents with regulatory agencies, such as the SEC. While the Company believes that its ActiveDisclosure and FundSuiteArc solutions are competitive in this space, competitors are continuing to develop technologies that aim to improve clients' ability to autonomously produce and file documents to meet their regulatory obligations. The Company continues to remain focused on driving recurring revenue in order to mitigate market volatility.  Raw Materials  The primary raw materials used in the Company's printed products are paper and ink. The paper and ink supply is sourced from a small set of select suppliers in order to ensure quality consistency that meets the Company's performance expectations and provides for continuity of supply. The Company believes that the risk of incurring material losses as a result of a shortage in raw materials is unlikely and that the losses, if any, would not have a materially negative impact on the business.  Financial Review  In the financial review that follows, the Company discusses its condensed combined results of operations, cash flows and certain other information. The Company has not previously operated as an independent, stand-alone company, but rather as a part of RRD. There are limitations inherent in the preparation of all carve out financial statements due to the fact that the Company's business was previously part of a larger organization. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Company's condensed combined financial statements and the related notes.  Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 as Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2015  The following table shows the results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:   2016 2015 $ Change % Change (in millions, except percentages) Services net sales $ 139.4 $ 142.1 $ (2.7 ) (1.9 %) Products net sales 85.0 89.5 (4.5 ) (5.0 %) Net sales 224.4 231.6 (7.2 ) (3.1 %) Services cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) 64.2 71.1 (6.9 ) (9.7 %) Services cost of sales with RRD affiliates (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) 8.7 9.3 (0.6 ) (6.5 %) Products cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) 62.0 50.9 11.1 21.8 % Products cost of sales with RRD affiliates (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) 11.5 12.9 (1.4 ) (10.9 %) Cost of sales 146.4 144.2 2.2 1.5 % Selling, general and administrative expenses (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) 48.5 47.5 1.0 2.1 % Restructuring, impairment and other charges-net 1.7 1.4 0.3 21.4 % Depreciation and amortization 9.8 10.3 (0.5 ) (4.9 %) Income from operations $ 18.0 $ 28.2 $ (10.2 ) (36.2 %)  Combined  Net sales of services for the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased $2.7 million, or 1.9%, to $139.4 million, versus the three months ended September 30, 2015, including a $1.0 million, or 0.7%, decrease due to changes in foreign exchange rates.

Donnelley Financial Solutions Makes Strategic Investment in SOXHUB
SOXHUB now backed by multi-billion dollar financial services company




















CHICAGO, March 27, 2017 – Donnelley Financial Solutions (NYSE:DFIN) today announced that it has made a strategic investment in SOXHUB, a leading provider of enterprise SOX and audit management software, bringing an entirely new set of SOX compliance capabilities to ActiveDisclosure, its cloud-based financial disclosure management solution. Built specifically to address the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the SOXHUB platform has helped companies of all sizes streamline and manage their SOX programs.
“This investment demonstrates our ongoing commitment to continually enhance our technology and make ActiveDisclosure the most comprehensive compliance solution available today,” said Craig Clay, President, Global Capital Markets at Donnelley Financial Solutions. “Until now, SOX controls have largely been managed manually through multitudes of spreadsheets and data links in a cumbersome process. With our investment in SOXHUB, we are now able to provide our clients with a superior way to manage their SOX requirements, saving them both time and money.”
SOXHUB provides accounting and audit teams with a cloud-based solution for effectively managing SOX and internal controls documentation, testing, and certifications. The ease of use and intuitive design empower audit and accounting teams to free up valuable time and resources normally dedicated to the administrative activities of SOX compliance, allowing for greater focus on more value-added business objectives.
“Accounting and audit teams need an easier solution to collaborate, report, and manage information,” said Daniel Kim, Executive Vice President at SOXHUB. “Spreadsheets are useful for organizing data, but they are not ideal for repetitive, collaborative, enterprise-wide processes, like a company’s SOX compliance. Together, SOXHUB and Donnelley Financial Solutions will now provide our shared customers with a powerful, purpose-built tool to effectively manage their compliance needs, giving them the freedom to pursue more critical, growth-oriented initiatives for their companies.”
Rachel Rose, Director of SOX and Accounting Operations at Engility, Inc., a leading provider of integrated services for the U.S. government added, “Donnelley Financial Solutions was the logical provider for us to help transform our process with an innovative SOX solution.  The automation of our SOX compliance requirements has enabled our team to work more efficiently than ever before.”
Donnelley Financial Solutions’ ActiveDisclosure allows privately held and public companies of all sizes and industries to collaborate on documents and to comply with disclosure requirements mandated by the Securities and Exchange Commission and other regulatory agencies.  ActiveDisclosure accelerates and simplifies the process of creating, managing, and disseminating critical business communications.
