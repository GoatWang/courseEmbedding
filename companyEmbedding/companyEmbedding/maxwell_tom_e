Maxwell, Tom -- "Bush Rod" 6' 4wt Bamboo Rod





Sold Out


$1,250.00 US






For sale here is a Tom Maxwell "Bush Rod" 6' 4wt 2/2. Serial no. 624-S. The rod is in excellent condition. All sections are full length and straight. Medium-dark cane with pale gold silks and dark purple tipping. The rod features the "top hat" logo just above the winding check as well as Maxwell's initials - TLM. Bright guides. Ring hook-keeper. A very petite cigar grip, characteristic of Maxwell. The grip measures 4 1/2" and has protective plastic over it. Nickel-silver cap and ring reel seat also rather slender. The sliding band has a fine knurling on it. 
The rod has a staggered ferrule design, the tip 3'11" and the butt section 2'1". The "ferrule plug” seems to be a spare blank that was turned in a lathe to act as a ferrule plug. This ferrule plug may not be original to the rod -- it still retains its old wraps and varnish.
The rod's second tip was made at a later date - the cane is lighter and the wraps though very close in color do not match. "DB" is inked within the ferrule wraps, perhaps the initials of the maker of this tip. The original tip is the one with the tip top wrapped in black, which is original.
Swiss style ferrules size 12/64, the fit is perfect with a satisfying pop upon separation. The rod has a dry-fly action on the faster side of medium-fast that brings to mind tossing dries to brookies in the Catskills. Rod comes with original bag with leather tab and original tube with brass fittings save a replacement aluminum cap. Don't miss a chance to own a unique Maxwell rod at an affordable price!

Publisher's Description▼▲
Now with a new foreword by Henry Blackaby and Tom Blackaby.L. E. Maxwell writes, "The cross is the key to all situations as well as to all Scripture."By relating the cross as essential to the life of the believer, Professor L.E. Maxwell simply and practically shows how an understanding of our identification with Christ in his death and resurrection can lead to life as it was meant to be lived. It is by living with a cross-centered perspective that we can have both victory over sin and power to serve God well.Maxwell's heart and vision for training up young poeple with the truth of God's Word and the necessity of evangelism shines forth in this little book. Readers know authenticity when they read it--and Maxwell exudes it.


Author Bio▼▲
L.E. MAXWELL founded Prairie Bible Institute in Three Hills, Alberta, Canada, in 1922. In his fifty-seven years of service with the school, he held many titles, including professor, principal, and president. A prolific author, he wrote many including Women in Ministry, Born Crucified, and Crowded to Christ. He is now at home with his Lord.

            Drawing upon other spiritual writers, as well as personal and Biblical observations, Maxwell beautifully presents the proper place of the cross of Christ applied to the Christian's experience. This is a "must read" book that renders much needed help for the pathway of true Christian maturity.

	Thomas L. Maxwell

	General Manager, Military Propulsion Engineering
	GE Aviation
	BSAAE ’69

	In recognition of his technical and managerial leadership of numerous aircraft engine programs

	Tom Maxwell remembers the first time he put his child on a plane to fly somewhere by himself. That happened around 20 years ago, but Maxwell works in the aviation industry, so ensuring the safety of the product he produces is a mission he takes seriously and personally.

	“Our purpose is to field a product that keeps its promise to the customer,” Maxwell says. “When my son got on that plane by himself, it impressed on me how important it is that the industry deliver on its promise.”

	Maxwell grew up in Pennsylvania in the height of the space race. “Sputnik launched in 1957, and in the 10 years after that everyone with any aptitude for math was being counseled to go into engineering,” he says. “Aeronautical was a natural choice. Really, the whole nation rallied behind the initiative to beat Russia to the moon.”

	Maxwell chose Purdue for his undergraduate studies, then went on to earn a master’s degree in aerospace engineering from the University of Cincinnati and an MBA from Xavier University. He stayed in the Cincinnati area to work his way up the ladder at GE Aviation, where he now heads the development and operation of all military engines.

	“We spend about $600 million a year developing new military products, so that is part of my focus. We also get feedback every day on 15 major product lines, each of which has numerous models, so often that feedback determines what my focus will be on a particular day.”

	For example, Maxwell is responsible for the 25,000 GE military engines that are out in the field, including 80 percent of the engines powering Air Force aircraft in Afghanistan and Iraq.

	“The desert environment is hard on engines,” says Maxwell. “So we work hard to keep the Air Force’s engines running and to resolve any problems that arise.”

	Maxwell has worked on a wide variety of interesting projects in his time at GE. In a previous position he oversaw the team effort between GE and Rolls-Royce to develop the F136 engine for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. That program has continued and the first engines are scheduled to deliver in 2012. He also was tasked with establishing a new Military Product Support Engineering organization to better serve military customers.

	Maxwell says the most rewarding thing about his work is how much his customers trust him. Everything else, such as earning a Distinguished Engineering Alumni Award, is an added bonus.

	“I never expected to have this honor, and I truly appreciate it,” he says. “Sometimes you’re lucky to have your achievements exceed your dreams. This award is icing on the cake. I truly am honored.”

Maxwell Ticket Information
One of the most distinct R&B artists of his generation, Maxwell kicked off his career in the 1990s with the release of his debut album, “Maxwell’s Urban Hang Suite.” Though he takes inspiration from traditional gospel, funk, and soul music, this GRAMMY Award winner has created a highly original body of work using his trademark falsetto and introspective songwriting. Over the course of his career, fans have fallen in love with his catalog of music, including hits like “Pretty Wings” and “Ascenscion (Don’t Ever Wonder).” Since he came back to the stage in 2009, every Maxwell tour has given fans around the world the chance to listen to this neo soul icon’s best songs live.

Experience
Vivid Seats

Going to watch your favorite team, band, or show can create memories that will last a lifetime… but finding and buying your tickets can be frustrating and costly. That's why we created Vivid Seats - to give you the best seats in the house with the best value in the industry. Go ahead… live large AND spend less.






















All Access Selection
It all starts with finding the tickets, and Vivid Seats has the top relationships in the industry. When it matters most—for the biggest and hottest events—no one can beat Vivid Seats' selection. We work hard to find the best seat choices at the lowest prices. From a front-row 'dream seat' to an affordable 'just get me in' upper balcony, we have choices for whatever fits your needs and your budget.




VIP Service
Ever notice how the service is always better in the VIP areas? Well, that's our approach for all our customers! We have the most responsive sales and customer service center in the industry; we handle any and all of your concerns from start-to-finish; and we never force you to track down the seller if you have a question. We pledge to work vigorously on your behalf so you can focus on getting excited for your event and not worry about your order. Please call us anytime at 866.848.8499!




Backstage Security
Vivid Seats is the safest, most secure site to purchase live event tickets in the industry. Many other ticketing sites pass along your credit card information to whoever is selling the tickets—but not us! We believe your personal information should stay private and secure. We follow best-in-class web security protocols, and back all your purchases with our 100% Buyer Guarantee: you will safely and securely get the authentic tickets you ordered, on-time, and supported by our dedicated and helpful in-house customer service team.




Rockstar Savings
We know the right tickets to your favorite event can be expensive, which is why we keep our prices as low as possible. We invest heavily in technology and automation, all to keep costs down and pass the savings on to you. No other full-service provider offers the affordability that we do, making us the clear value leader in the industry. Buy with us and bring a larger group, save enough to pay for souvenirs, or just sit closer for your dollar. So, stop shopping around—discover Vivid Seats and get the best value in tickets!

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
