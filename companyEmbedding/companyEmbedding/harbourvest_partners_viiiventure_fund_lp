            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)

The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link.

Global investment firm HarbourVest Partners said Wednesday that it has closed $3.6 billion for Dover Street VIII L.P, a global secondary fund.

It will also invest in portfolios of operating companies, manager spin-outs and structured transactions.
PRESS RELEASE
10 July 2013 – HarbourVest Partners, LLC (“HarbourVest” or the “Firm”), a leading private markets investment firm, today announced the final close of Dover Street VIII L.P. (“Dover VIII”), a global secondary fund, at $3.6 billion. The fund closed above its $3.0 billion target and was oversubscribed. HarbourVest’s prior secondary-focused fund, Dover Street VII, was a $2.9 billion fund.
Dover VIII will make secondary investments in venture capital, leveraged buyout, and other private equity assets, as well as portfolios of operating companies, manager spin-outs, and structured transactions. The investors in Dover VIII include a broad array of institutions such as corporate pensions, public pensions, endowments, Taft Hartley plans, and foundations from around the globe.
Throughout its 27-year history as an active participant in the secondary market, HarbourVest has acquired private equity assets of all stages, types, vintages, and geographies and worked with all types of sellers, including financial institutions, corporations, pension plans, governmental entities, endowments, and family offices.
“Since our first secondary investment in 1986, HarbourVest has helped pioneer the global secondary market,” said Brett Gordon, Managing Director at HarbourVest Partners, LLC. “A critical component of our success is our ability to leverage HarbourVest’s platform of relationships with fund managers across the private markets which give us informed insight into the secondary assets we evaluate. We use this unique perspective to identify attractive assets that offer compelling investment opportunities for our clients. Our team also brings proven experience solving complex problems and creating tailor-made solutions for sellers. This credibility often makes us a preferred counterparty for sellers.”
Dover VIII has already closed on four transactions, the largest of which is the acquisition of the assets of Conversus Capital. At the time of acquisition, Conversus was the world’s largest publicly-traded portfolio of third party private equity funds. The Conversus transaction was announced in July 2012 and completed in December 2012. Dover VIII portfolio has already generated gains as well as early realizations, which have allowed HarbourVest to make an initial distribution to the fund’s investors.
As evidenced with the Conversus transaction, the 2011 take private of Absolute Private Equity and the completion of 45 secondary direct transactions, HarbourVest’ s secondary team is a market leader in providing innovative liquidity solutions. In addition to being one of the most experienced buyers of traditional limited partnership interests, its success in executing non-traditional transactions has enabled HarbourVest to build differentiated portfolios.

Management Contract & Fees:

                            The Investment Manager does not charge the Company a management fee on investments in HarbourVest funds. HarbourVest does charge a management fee in each of the funds. Therefore, as a limited partner in the HarbourVest funds, HVPE bears the same management fee as all other investors in each of those funds, the cost of which is incorporated in the Realised Gain (Loss) on Investment category above. A management fee will be paid for any parallel investments made by the Company consistent with the fees charged by the fund alongside which the parallel investment is made. The management fees and performance allocations of the HarbourVest funds in which the Company is invested are: 1. Primary Investments - Management fee of 0.85% of committed capital; Performance allocation - none. 2. Secondary Investments - Management fee of 0.85% - 1.15% of committed capital; Performance allocation - 10% - 12.5%. 3. Direct Investments - Management fee of 0.85% - 2.25% of committed capital; Performance allocation - 10% - 20%. Direct investments made through HarbourVest's fund-of-funds are generally subject to an average annual management fee of 0.85% of commitments. Direct investments made through HarbourVest's co-investment funds are generally subject to an average annual management fee of 1.00% of invested capital. Direct investments made through HarbourVest's direct funds are generally subject to an average annual management fee of 1.75% to 2.25% of committed capital. Anson Fund Managers Limited as Company's Secretary and Administrator receives administration fee of £22,000 p.a. and a secretarial fee of £25,000 p.a. and an additional value fee equal to 1/12 of 0.005% of the net asset value of the Company above USD100m as at the last business day of each month.
