GoPro Inc. seems to have found more fat in its organization, just a few months after a round of job cuts, with claims that more layoffs won't hurt its product development cycle. Earlier on Wednesday, GoPro 

                            
                            
                                  
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
                                  
                                    GPRO, +0.50%

                            
                                  
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
                                         surprised investors with news that it was cutting 270 more jobs, forecasting revenue on the high end of its guidance, and profitability on an adjusted, or EBITDA, basis in 2017. The sent the stock soaring 16% in morning trade Thursday, putting it on track for the biggest one-day gain in 11 months. About one hour after the open, volume was already more the double the full-day average. GoPro’s shares are still worth about half what they were at their 52-week high. And last week Goldman Sachs downgraded the stock to a sell, citing a number of its challenges, including saturation in its core camera market, a new competitor and worries about its cash flow.

GoPro executives, on a brief conference call with analysts, said the additional job cuts were a result of a thorough review of all its business operations and procedures.  “We are confident that we are not making those trade-offs,” said Charles “C.J.” Prober, who was named chief operating officer in January, when asked whether the additional job cuts would affect new product development. “By being more focused we feel we are improving our efficiency and doing fewer things, better.” Executives also said GoPro has enough cash and doesn't see a need to draw on its line of credit. The news comes just a few months after GoPro’s bombshell in late November that it was cutting 15% of its workforce, including the closure of its once-vaunted entertainment division and a recall of its new Karma drone. GoPro has since relaunched the Karma drone, but so far reviews have been tepid. The Verge surmised that Karma is a good starter kit for current GoPro users, but if you don’t already own one, “there is no reason to settle for a drone with a spotty track record and a total lack of cutting-edge features.” The consumer drone market is dominated by DJI Technology of China, and the number of players has been dwindling.







Analysts and investors are counting on the company to keep on launching new products this year. CEO and co-founder Nick Woodman told analysts on the call that last year the company went through herculean efforts, launching new cameras, editing software, a drone and getting them all to work together. “We have shifted from a revolutionary year to an evolutionary year,” Woodman said, adding that its new products are reliable and are succeeding for customers. “It is far less risky to evolve than to be revolutionary.” But any investors hoping for major new products this year may have to reset their expectations. It sounds like GoPro is looking at incremental upgrades, at least this year, as it deals with an even more competitive market. Skepticism is probably the best bet until a turnaround is really evident. GoPro’s stock has lost over 1% year to date, while the S&P 500 index

How Venezuela chaos could spark oil rally OPEC has failed to achieve 
              
              Political and economic turmoil in Venezuela could fuel a rise in oil prices—something the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, despite it’s efforts to cut back production, hasn’t been able to do.              
              
            

12:40 p.m. July 28, 2017






What a constant stream of oil company spending cuts means for crude prices
              
              Oil companies are sounding a recurring theme: lower exploration and production spending estimates. Will that lead to a rally in oil prices?              
              
            

5:47 p.m. July 27, 2017

Beyond Tesla: 7 stocks driving the autonomous car revolution
              
              Look at these component manufacturers rather than the car companies, says Jeff Reeves.

These 7 highly taxed companies need Congress to finally act on tax reform
              
              It wasn’t Trump’s “movement” that lifted stocks late last year, says Jeff Reeves. It was the promise of lower corporate tax rates.

Extremely low volatility could lead to a sharp, but short-lived, decline in stocks 
              
              Still, a chart of the S&P 500 reveals an undercurrent of bullishness, says Lawrence G. McMillan.

Who trades options the most? Millennial investors
              
              Millennials are frequently criticized by market experts for the way they invest—or, more accurately, the way they’re not investing—but recent research indicates that at least some young market participants are going about things in a more sophisticated way than they’re typically given credit for.

Dollar turns lower for the week following GDP report
              
              The U.S. dollar fell on Friday, erasing its gains for the week after a read on economic growth came in below expectations, though analysts said the beleaguered currency was potentially nearing a bottom.              
              
            

3:47 p.m. July 28, 2017






Dollar rises from 13-month low
              
              The U.S. dollar rises on Thursday, gaining against major rivals in what analysts suggest a mild consolidation following precipitous declines over recent weeks.

DescriptionOne of the greatest songwriters of all time offers a frank and riveting account of his life and the stories behind the hits. Over the past six decades, Burt Bacharach's legendary songwriting has touched millions of devoted listeners all over the world. In Anyone Who Had a Heart, Bacharach steps out from behind the music to give an honest, engaging look at his life-from his work with Hal David, Dionne Warwick, Elvis Costello, and many others to his tumultuous marriages and the devastating fate of his beloved daughter. Growing up in Forest Hills, New York, during the 1930s and '40s, Burt Bacharach fell in love with music after sneaking into a Manhattan jazz club to see the legendary Dizzy Gillespie. After a stint in the Army during the Korean War, he toured the world with Marlene Dietrich, wrote an endless string of hits, scored numerous Hollywood films, married the glamorous movie star Angie Dickinson, and composed the music for the huge Broadway hit Promises, Promises. While he soared professionally, Bacharach's private life was dominated by the never-ending search for love-and the heartbreak that comes when it is lost-which is reflected in his greatest songs. His first three marriages ended in divorce. His long-running partnership with the late Hal David suffered a bitter split that lasted seventeen years. Throughout the highs and lows, Bacharach steadfastly pursued his muse-a quest that continues to this day. Anyone Who Had a Heart is the story of a man who has always expressed his deepest feelings through his music. Filled with the emotional power that defines Burt Bacharach's most unforgettable songs, his memoir offers a candid backstage look at show business as well as the personal struggles of an artist whose incredible body of work has earned him a unique position in the American cultural landscape.

Professional reviews"More of an audio history than a memoir, this work primarily succeeds in revealing the incredibly talented musician Burt Bacharach as egocentric, pompous, and privileged. Bacharach's perspectives are voiced by Tony Call, who does an adequate job in bringing the subject to life. However, his unadorned narration suffers from several instances of uninformed phrasing and pauses that make listeners' contextual understanding more difficult. Jeff Woodman expressively handles all the other male voices; Therese Plummer voices the female interviewees such as ex-wife Angie Dickinson. The interviews are topically and directly presented and excerpted. The three voices, each with its own merits, make for a confusing excursion into the highs and lows of one of the most successful and prolific songwriters ever. This is a flawed memoir from an undisputed major artist.  W.A.G. "
