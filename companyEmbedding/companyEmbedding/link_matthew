Matthew's Beginning is an intriguing submission of original fiction which focuses on the extraordinary life and harrowing exploits of the main character.
The middle of three brothers, Matthew shares their disgust and hatred for their stepfather, Ben Lucas. Routinely assaulting their mother and showing very little love and support for the family, Ben quickly became a figure of both fear and derision. 
One particular day, Matthew's elder brother Joshua steals money from Ben's wallet and buys a ring. Once he discovers the missing money, Ben threatens violence. Instead of cowering Matthew takes credit for taking the money and suggests Ben beat him instead of his mother.
Impressed by Matthew's nerve and guts, Ben forms a new respect for the young man.
A few days later, he shares a secret possession as well as a cruel ultimatum which makes a significant impression on Matthew and alters his perspective in many ways. From this foundation, a very entertaining tale is constructed.

Digital Millennium Copyright Act Notice Form
The Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") is a United States copyright law that provides guidelines for online service providers in case of copyright infringement. Below is the information that should be present in these notices. It is designed to make submitting notices of alleged infringement to us as straightforward as possible while reducing the number of notices that we receive that are fraudulent or difficult to understand or verify. The form of notice specified below is consistent with the DMCA, which can be found at the U.S. Copyright Office website, http://www.copyright.gov.
To file a notice of infringement with us, you must provide us with the items specified below. Please note that you will be liable for damages (including costs and attorneys' fees) if you materially misrepresent that the material is infringing your copyright. Accordingly, if you are not sure whether material infringes your copyright, we suggest that you first contact an attorney.
This notice and any attachments we receive will be forwarded to the alleged infringer, who will then have the opportunity to file a counter notification pursuant to Sections 512(g)(2) and (3) of the DMCA. Should a properly filed counter notification be filed, you will be notified and have 10 business days within which to file for a restraining order in Federal Court to prevent the reinstatement of the material.

Tire and Tread Marking System





Matthews Marking Systems offers a unique large character ink jet printing system developed specifically for printing onto uncured rubber, where the ink must withstand the curing process; including tire and tread marking.  The robust design of the ACIS (Agitating & Circulating Ink System) significantly reduces the time required to clean and maintain equipment. The printer utilizes a fast dry, HAPS free, curable, white pigmented ink, which will not transfer in the mold, leaving no shadow of the previous mark and no adverse effect on the finished product.  Print and record real time information, such as shift codes, time, and date for traceability, as well as barcodes and 2D codes.
Compared to traditional contact printers, ink jet is ideal for rubber marking as it:

Reduces down time between recipe changes
Eliminates damage to the rubber
Easily interfaces with PLC or mainframe controls

Matthews’ rubber marking system features the most reliable drop-on-demand technologies in the industry, our 8000+ series print head. The exclusive macro-valve technology provides for tremendous reliability, easy maintenance, and dramatically lower ink consumption, while maintaining impressive print quality and speed.

Successful installations in the harshest environments
6 billion cycles before tuning, outlasting the competition
Handles non-porous and pigmented inks without typical clogging issues

Overview
The birth narrative, the baptism and temptation of Jesus, the beginnings of his Galilean ministry, and the Sermon on the Mount are all brilliantly illumined by Ulrich Luz’s expert textual and historical-critical analysis and theological commentary. Luz brings special attention to the subsequent history of Christian appropriation of Matthew in homiletical and artistic interpretation, and addresses the terrible legacy of Christian anti-Judaism. This volume completes Luz’s 3-volume commentary on the Gospel of Matthew in the Hermeneia series. A translation of the earlier German edition of Matthew 1–7 appeared in Fortress Press’ Continental Commentary series. The text has been thoroughly revised and updated.
In the Logos edition, this volume is enhanced by amazing functionality. Important terms link to dictionaries, encyclopedias, and a wealth of other resources in your digital library. Perform powerful searches to find exactly what you’re looking for. Take the discussion with you using tablet and mobile apps. With Logos Bible Software, the most efficient and comprehensive research tools are in one place, so you get the most out of your study.

Overview
The goal of the Cornerstone Biblical Commentary series is to clearly convey every thought contained in the Bible by presenting the message of each passage as well as an overview of other issues surrounding the text in an accessible but high-level discussion of scriptural interpretation.
The nearly 40 scholars, many of whom participated in the creation of the New Living Translation, are well-known and represent a wide spectrum of theological positions with the evangelical community.
The 11th volume of the Cornerstone Biblical Commentary series, written by David L. Turner and Darrel L. Bock, includes the entire NLT text of the books of Matthew and Mark. It provides students, pastors, and laypeople with up-to-date, evangelical scholarship designed to increase their exegetical and theological knowledge.
As the first Gospel in the Christian canon and the first book of the New Testament, Matthew has attracted significant attention. It contains the Sermon on the Mount, the Lord’s Prayer, the Beatitudes and End Times parables and prophecies. It describes the nature of the kingdom of heaven, and reveals the Messiah to a Jewish audience. In his accessible commentary, David L. Turner explores the central themes of the Gospel of Matthew, along with interpretive challenges, and the relationship between Matthew and the other Synoptic Gospels. This commentary also includes a detailed outline of the Gospel and an extensive bibliography.
The Gospel of Mark contains the shortest and most succinct account of the life of Jesus. In fact, says Darrell L. Bock in the introduction to his commentary, “Mark is more a Gospel of action than of teaching.” Jesus and his disciples move from city to city, and the stories are punctuated by little more than the favorite Markan transition: “Immediately.” Yet Mark, more than any other Gospel, highlights Jesus as the suffering Son of Man, and provides rich parallels to Old Testament themes. And the end of the Gospel shows that the experience of rejection and suffering challenged even the apostle’s commitment to discipleship. Both the original and modern readers have much to learn from the Gospel of Mark and Darrell L. Bock's commentary and exposition.
With the Logos edition of the Matthew, Mark Cornerstone Biblical Commentary, you can read the commentary on the text alongside the New Living Translation, as well as the Greek text in your digital library! Perform powerful searches and word studies and click your way to Greek and Hebrew definitions. What’s more, you can also link the Cornerstone Biblical Commentary to the other commentaries in your library for quick and accurate research for scholarly projects, sermon preparation, and personal study.


Key Features

Introductions to the historical and cultural context, the literary style, and the major themes and theological concerns
Exegetical and textual notes
Commentary pays special attention to context and major theological themes



Praise for the Print Edition
An enormously helpful series for the layperson and pastor alike because it centers on the theological message of each book and ties it directly to the text. This approach has been needed for some time and will be an invaluable supplement to other commentary series.
—Grant Osborne
A treasure house of insight into the biblical text. Written by some of the best scholars working today, it is an essential tool for pastors, students, church leaders, and lay people who want to understand the text and know how it relates to our lives today. Like the New Living Translation text it uses as its base, this commentary series is extremely readable.
—Tremper Longman

The energy you bring to each moment is your most valuable asset, because it empowers you to make the most out of your time. Knowing that your time on earth is limited, but being unaware of how much time you have, places much more value on being able to discern the difference between behaviors that add value and the actions that aren't worth the effort. And while all people struggle with time management, leaders, in particular, need to be efficient so they can continue inspiring others.
As a life coach and licensed therapist, I've had the privilege of working with many leaders who are passionate about changing themselves and the world. Part of our work together is deciding which actions are aligned with their master plan and which behaviors are not aligned with their values. Through our work, I've identified several things that are not worth the time, energy, and effort that all successful leaders avoid.
Below are 10 actions that all of the best leaders avoid to maximize their efficiency.
1. Always being the first person to speak and share their opinion.
It's easy to get locked into social patterns, and when people value your thoughts, it's quickly established that your opinion matters more than others. However, collaborative teams are more efficient when you listen more than you speak. Allow the group to run itself and it'll save you time and energy.
2. Telling other people what to do rather than embodying the characteristics you value.
In the long run, being the change that you want to see in the world is more efficient than pretending to be someone or something you're not. It wastes energy constantly telling everyone to do something that you are unwilling to do yourself, because as the leader, you don't set the example--you are the example--and people follow actions, not words.
3. Buying expensive material items to impress people you don't like.
When you start buying things with the intention of showing others instead of enjoying yourself, you need to check in with yourself. Often, trying to impress others is rooted in feelings of inferiority, and unfortunately, buying things to impress others is an expensive, never-ending habit. A much more efficient strategy is to address the root cause with a therapist or coach.
4. Pretending to like things--like alcohol or sports--to fit in (rather than standing out).
Some of my young, entrepreneurial clients once pretended to enjoy alcohol despite having celiac disease, because they were afraid of being the only one not drinking. Later in life, these clients realized that they wasted years of their lives being miserable, when they could've embraced their individuality. Don't be afraid to stand out.
5. Trying to please other people at the expense of your own wellbeing.
Set appropriate boundaries with yourself and others. Stop sacrificing your mental, physical, and emotional health to appease other people--it's not worth it. The most effective leaders are the ones that know how to say no.
6. Focusing too much on the past or worrying about the future (rather than being present).
The fastest way to waste energy is to live in the past or dream about the future. The more present you are, the more effective you become, because you can only take action in the here-and-now. Practice being present by re-establishing a meditation practice (even if it's short).
7. Agreeing with other people's opinions instead of critically thinking for yourself.
It wastes time to blindly follow others, because you end up doing things that aren't aligned with the things you value most. Think critically about yourself and the world around you so that you can make appropriate decisions and be responsible for your actions.
8. Sacrificing quality for speed.
Whether we're discussing the quality of a product or the quality of employees, when you start focusing too much on output, you end up wasting energy. At one time or another, you'll have to go back and correct the numerous shortcomings of a hyper-focus on speed rather than careful consideration of quality.
9. Comparing yourself to others instead of maximizing your talents.
No matter what you do, someone in this world--probably a 10 year old genius--is better than you. There's plenty of opportunity to go around, so stop wasting time and energy feeling sorry for yourself and start taking action. You are your most valuable asset, so invest in your own personal and professional growth.
10. Avoiding issues--emotional and business--rather than confronting them immediately.
Putting difficult conversations on hold seems efficient at first, but can be extremely problematic over time. The less you deal with them up front, the greater their impact later. Instead of avoiding uncomfortable dialogues, confront them head-on. If you value your time and want to maximize your energy, then as a leader, you need to stand out--you need to be the person you've always wanted to become.

                                         (Reuters)
                                    
                                




Actor Matthew Perry has decided to say adios to his Los Angeles home, putting it on the market for $13.5 million Friday.






Perry, 47, best known for his role as Chandler Bing in NBC’s long-running sitcom “Friends,” bought the three-bedroom, five-bathroom residence in 2011 through a trust for $8.65 million, according to property records.
He once owned a Malibu home through the same trust, but sold it for $10.65 million in 2014.
Mr. Perry has reportedly been living in New York where his play, The End of Longing, is now enjoying a run off-broadway, after premiering in London last year.
Located in Bird Streets, a popular showbiz enclave in Hollywood Hills, this custom home features walls of glass wrapping around the 10,628-square-foot living space, looking out onto downtown Los Angeles and the Pacific Ocean in the distance, according to the listing with Greg Holcomb and Cassandra Petersen of The Partners Trust.
There is a “premiere-worthy” screening room on the lower level, befitting the needs of an actor.



Outdoor entertainment space includes an infinity pool with a cascading wall of water, covered sitting areas and fire pits.

Bird Streets, named after its many Avian-themed streets, is home to many Hollywood A-listers, including Leonardo DiCaprio, Tobey Maguire, Jodie Foster and Keanu Reeves.
Listing agents didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. A rep for Mr. Perry declined to comment.
Variety first reported the listing.
