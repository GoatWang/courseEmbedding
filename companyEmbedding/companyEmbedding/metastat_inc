Focused on Preventing Aggressive Cancer from Spreading 







MetaStat, Inc. (MTST) is a biotechnology company focused on discovering and developing personalized diagnostic and therapeutic treatment solutions for cancer patients. Our "driver-based" diagnostic biomarkers, based on the Mena protein isoforms, also serve as novel therapeutic targets for anti-metastatic drugs. Unlike surrogate cancer markers, which are indirect measures of cancer and its progression, driver-based biomarkers are the critical components of intracellular cancer pathways responsible for driving the aggressive activity of cancer cells. Our core expertise includes an understanding of the mechanisms and pathways that drive aggressive cancer, tumor cell invasion and metastasis.
MetaStat is developing therapeutic product candidates based on a novel approach that makes intracellular Mena protein isoforms drugable targets. MetaStat' s head office, research laboratories, and state-of-the-art CLIA-certified diagnostic laboratory are located in Boston, MA.

The Mena Protein Isoforms



The Mena Protein Isoforms
The Mena protein is a key potentiator and modulator of cellular migration and is a prometastatic factor. Mena is involved in the nucleation and polymerization of actin, being a cellular regulator of assembling and dynamic of cytoplasmic actin networks.  It belongs to the Ena/VASP (enabled/VASP) family, along with VASP and Ena-VASP-like, being encoded by Mena gene located on chromosome 1.
Mena is found in the developing embryo where it is an important actor in the developing nervous system among other functions. It facilitates and organizes formation, extension and navigation of growing nerve fibers through tissue to link with other neurons, forming the proper circuits needed for a functional nervous system. Its expression decreases from embryonic to adult life. Studies have revealed that Ena/VASP proteins are involved in those processes where dynamic actin reorganization is necessary, such as neural closure, phagocytosis, hemostasis, chemotaxis, cell migration, cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesions, fibrillogenesis, or fibroblastic motility.
However in metastatic cancer cells, high levels of the Mena protein accumulate and influence a number of intracellular (inside the cell) signaling pathways. Mena facilitates a dangerous process whereby tumor cells send out a well-organized protuberance that invades surrounding tissue and pulls the remainder of the cell behind it. Mena modulates the strength and direction of this invasive process. Mena steers the migrating cancer cell in the direction of blood vessels through its ability to modulate the metastatic cell’s response to chemical signals that attract it to blood vessels.
Mena is present in cancer cells in more than one form. These different varieties, called isoforms, are similar but slightly different in structure. Protein isoforms, despite their similarity in structure, can sometimes have very large differences in their influence on cells. We have identified the most dangerous isoform of Mena,  named MenaINV (Mena invasive). Mena11A, on the other hand, is the Mena isoform that seems to exert a much more positive influence on the cell’s behavior, reducing the ability of cells to break away from the tumor and invade and migrate toward blood vessels.
Our driver-based Mena isoform protein diagnostic biomarkers also serve as novel therapeutic targets for anti-metastatic drugs. Our breakthrough was the discovery of a novel approach through a proprietary mechanism of action to make intracellular Mena isoform proteins drugable targets.

MenaCalc™ Platform



MenaCalc™ Platform
The MenaCalc™ test is a next generation driver-based assay that measures the aggressiveness of a patient’s tumor and predicts the likelihood the cancer will spread. Information provided by the MenaCalc™ test allows oncologists to personalize treatment strategies and improve outcomes based on the patient’s individual tumor biology. The MenaCalc™ test is intended for use in patients with all molecular subtypes of early stage (stage 1-3) invasive breast cancer including triple negative (TNC) and Her2-positive (HER2+) breast cancer as well as squamous cell carcinoma of the lung, and a number of other epithelial-based tumors.
The MenaCalc™ test  is a fully automated quantitative immunofluorescence assay performed on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue from a biopsy. Using proprietary digital pathology and image analysis methods, the assay quantifies expression levels of the Mena protein and the Mena11a isoform. The Mena protein and its isoforms are key potentiators and modulators of cellular phenotype, migration, invasion, and metastasis. Overexpression of MenaINV and downregulation of Mena11a in tumor cells correlate with metastatic potential. Clinical studies have demonstrated the MenaCalc™ score is associated with increased risk of systemic metastasis and decreased overall survival.
In January 2016, the MenaCalc™ assay was analytically validated under CLIA in our state-of-the-art CLIA-certified commercial laboratory located in Boston, MA.
High-Risk Patients
Patients with aggressive tumors that are more likely to spread are stratified as high-risk.  High-risk patients are often treated with adjuvant chemotherapy to prevent disease recurrence and the development of systemic metastasis.
Data from the MenaCalc™ Breast assay as shown in Figure 1 is representative of a high MenaCalc™ score, which is associated with higher risk for the development of metastasis.
Figure 1: Overexpression of Pan Mena (yellow) is shown  in this tumor section from a patient with early stage invasive breast cancer.
Low-Risk Patients
Patients with less aggressive, indolent tumors that are less likely to spread are stratified as low-risk. Low-risk patients can be spared from the harmful side effects and expense of chemotherapy as the risks of adverse events and the development of future malignancies associated with adjuvant chemotherapy outweigh any marginal benefits.
Data from the MenaCalc™ Breast assay as shown in Figure 2 is representative of a low MenaCalc™ score, which is associated with lower risk for the development of metastasis.
Figure 2: Overexpression of the Mena11a isoform (red) is shownin this tumor section from a patient with early stage invasive breast cancer.
Clinical Summary
Results from a study of 403 patients with axilliary node-negative invasive breast cancer confirming earlier results that MenaCalc™ Breast was a strong predictor of disease-specific survival. Patients who had high MenaCalc™ scores had a 2.2-fold greater risk of death compared to patients with low MenaCalc™ scores when controlled for other traditional clinical factors. Results from this study was published in BMC Cancer by Forse et al. in June 2015.
In April 2015, positive results were presented from a clinical study of 201 patients demonstrating MenaCalc™ Lung as an independent prognostic factor and predictor of metastasis in patients with early stage NSCLC at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting. Results from this study demonstrated that MenaCalc™ Lung scores were significantly higher in patients with Squamous Cell Carcinoma as compared to other subtypes. High MenaCalc™ Lung scores were associated with decrease 5-year disease specific survival in all patients, and were significantly associated with survival in the squamous-only population.

Focused on Preventing Aggressive Cancer from Spreading 







MetaStat, Inc. (MTST) is a biotechnology company focused on discovering and developing personalized diagnostic and therapeutic treatment solutions for cancer patients. Our "driver-based" diagnostic biomarkers, based on the Mena protein isoforms, also serve as novel therapeutic targets for anti-metastatic drugs. Unlike surrogate cancer markers, which are indirect measures of cancer and its progression, driver-based biomarkers are the critical components of intracellular cancer pathways responsible for driving the aggressive activity of cancer cells. Our core expertise includes an understanding of the mechanisms and pathways that drive aggressive cancer, tumor cell invasion and metastasis.
MetaStat is developing therapeutic product candidates based on a novel approach that makes intracellular Mena protein isoforms drugable targets. MetaStat' s head office, research laboratories, and state-of-the-art CLIA-certified diagnostic laboratory are located in Boston, MA.
