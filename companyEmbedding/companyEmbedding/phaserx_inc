Our Mission



PhaseRx is dedicated to transforming families’ lives by creating better treatments for children with inherited diseases, actually correcting the problems at the source by replacing missing or damaged enzymes to allow the body’s natural processes to work.
We are developing a portfolio of mRNA products for inherited liver diseases, and in 2018 we expect to achieve clinical proof of concept in the first set of therapies to treat children born with life-threatening inherited liver diseases.
PhaseRx’s technology replaces missing or defective enzymes inside the liver cells, correcting the underlying cause of inherited liver diseases. This is achieved by intracellular enzyme replacement therapy (i-ERT) which targets synthesis of delivered mRNA specifically to liver cells.
Our current product portfolio focuses on treating urea cycle disorders (UCDs), which can result in cumulative and irreversible brain damage due to the liver’s inability to process ammonia from the blood. We believe our i-ERT technology can be applied to a significant number of other inherited liver diseases.
Market Opportunity
We are dedicated to transforming patients’ and families’ lives. We believe the intracellular enzyme replacement therapy (i-ERT) market opportunity is completely untapped and validated by the current $4 billion worldwide conventional enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) market. By replacing defective enzymes operating within cells, i-ERT is expected to enable the treatment of diseases which cannot be treated with conventional ERT, such as urea cycle disorders. In addition to urea cycle disorders, we expect our i-ERT therapeutic platform to be applicable to a significant number of other inherited liver diseases that cannot be treated with conventional ERT.
The FDA Orphan Drug Program provides economic incentives to encourage companies to develop treatments for rare diseases. This program has substantially increased industry research for orphan diseases since inception, and we expect to benefit from economic incentives available from this program.
Our technical advantages combined with the FDA incentives create an opportunity for positive social impact as well as commercial success.
Health Impact
Urea cycle disorders are typically diagnosed between birth and the age of twelve, and can lead to devastating consequences, including cumulative and irreversible brain damage, coma and death.

UCD patients live with a constant risk of becoming very sick due to increased levels of ammonia in the blood which cause brain damage and potentially fatal ammonia toxicity.
The only cure for UCDs is a liver transplant. Currently available drug treatments do not correct the disease, and do not eliminate the risk of life-threatening crises.

Without correction, even on the best available treatment (a strict diet, dietary supplements and ammonia scavengers) patients continue to be at risk for life-threatening crises caused by high blood ammonia.
Our i-ERT approach is designed to replace the missing urea cycle enzyme, return function to the urea cycle, and correct the damaging and potentially fatal build-up of ammonia in the blood in UCD patients.
Ultimately, we believe our therapies have the potential to eliminate the need for liver transplants in the most severely affected OTCD patients.
Innovative Delivery
A key challenge with mRNA therapeutics is effective delivery. Our Hybrid mRNA TechnologyTM platform is specifically designed to overcome barriers to administration of mRNA, and represents a sophisticated solution for delivering mRNA therapeutics.

Our technology platform combines a lipid nanoparticle with a proprietary polymer technology
The lipid nanoparticlethat encapsulates and protects the fragile mRNA in the blood and delivers it to liver cells.
The polymer facilitates delivery of mRNAs into cells’ cytoplasm (intracellular delivery).
Preclinical data suggest that our Hybrid mRNA TechnologyTM enables high levels of synthesis of the desired protein with good tolerability and without loss of effectiveness with repeat dosing.

Progress
Led by a team with extensive expertise in nucleic acid delivery technology, we have already generated positive preclinical data for two pipeline compounds and are progressing rapidly toward clinical trials.

Treatment with our lead product, PRX-OTC, has shown normalization of blood ammonia levels and100 percent survival in OTC-deficient hyperammonemic mice (the standard model for this disease), as well as a promising safety profile.
Similarly, PRX-ASL therapy showed statistically significant reduction in ammonia levels following two weeks of mRNA treatment in mice deficient in the enzyme argininosuccinate lyase (ASL).
Based on our preclinical data, the company expects to achieve lowering of blood ammonia in our Phase 2a and 2b clinical proof-of-concept studies for PRX-OTC in 2018.
Lowering of blood ammonia is believed to be an approvable endpoint for the UCDs, since it was the basis for the FDA’s approval of current treatments to treat the UCDs in 2013.

Intellectual Property
We have a strong intellectual property portfolio covering the world’s major pharmaceutical markets, with over 30 patents issued and many patent applications pending which are either exclusively licensed from the University of Washington or invented by our own scientists. This patent portfolio covers: the polymer technology, Hybrid mRNA TechnologyTM, and structures of mRNA.

Pipeline

 






 


 

PhaseRx has developed a therapeutics platform applicable to a host of diseases. Our initial focus is on three urea cycle disorders (UCDs) as first targets as we believe we can achieve life changing impacts within a reasonable timeframe:

PRX-OTC for Ornithine Transcarbamylase Deficiency (OTCD)
PRX-ASL for ArgininosuccinateLyase Deficiency (ASLD)
Argininosuccinatesynthetase 1 (ASS1) deficiency

PhaseRx believes its approach helps mitigate the costs and risks associated with biotech drug development, which are often attributable to a poor understanding of the disease biology and the mechanism of action of the drug candidate, as well as the need for large clinical trials and uncertainty about approvable endpoints. We believe our costs and risks will be lower because:

The biology of our disease programs is well understood: our target diseases are caused by a bad gene inherited from parents that results in a defective or missing enzyme inside the liver cell.
The mechanism of action of our therapeutics is clear: we are simply replacing the missing enzyme using our intracellular enzyme replacement therapy approach.
Clinical proof of concept can be obtained in relatively few patients: We believe we can obtain clinical proofs of concept in very few (10-20) patients, and ultimately achieve product registration based on 30-40 patients, as opposed to hundreds or even thousands of patients needed to obtain clinical proof of concept and registration in other diseases, such as cancer, diabetes, etc.

There is an approvable endpoint in lead programs: We believe lowering of blood ammonia is an approvable endpoint for our lead urea cycle disease (UCD) programs, since an ammonia scavenger was approved by FDA in 2013 for the treatment of the UCDs on the basis of lowering blood ammonia. Also, ammonia can be quickly and readily measured by a blood assay.

Future Indications Include:





Organic Acidemias
Glycogen Storage Diseases
Porphyria
Hyperoxalurea





Phenylketonuria
Tyrosinemia
Wilson’s Disease

Download this Press Release ()



SEATTLE, Nov. 8, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- PhaseRx, Inc. (NASDAQ: PZRX), a biopharmaceutical company developing treatments for life-threatening inherited liver diseases in children, today announced positive results from the company's single escalating dose response study in non-human primates. The administration of mRNA delivered using the company's proprietary Hybrid mRNA TechnologyTM platform in a large animal model was safe and well tolerated at all dose levels tested – an important step prior to advancing its lead mRNA drug candidate towards clinical development. The company has previously shown therapeutic effect in its lead program, PRX-OTC, in the preclinical model of Ornithine Transarbamylase Deficiency ("OTCD"), including both lowering of blood ammonia and rescue of 100% of treated mice.   

In the non-human primate study, human Erythropoietin ("hEPO") mRNA dosed at 0.1, 0.3 and 1.0 mg/kg delivered with the Hybrid mRNA TechnologyTM platform demonstrated dose-dependent increases in levels of hEPO protein with a very favorable safety profile. Elevations of hEPO protein levels at three orders of magnitude above normal physiological levels were achieved. In addition, a commensurate increase was also seen in reticulocyte count, a cell type expressed in response to hEPO which was robust and seen in all dose groups. The formulation was extremely well tolerated in non-human primates with no statistically significant dose-related changes in liver enzymes or cytokines, including IL-6, TNF-a, IFN-g, IL-12, or IP-10. 
"We have now demonstrated that our mRNA delivery system is safe in a large animal study," said Robert W. Overell, Ph.D., president and chief executive officer. "These data together with previously demonstrated efficacy in the mouse model increase our confidence in the safety and the therapeutic potential of our mRNA delivery technology and our lead program, PRX-OTC.  We plan to complete IND-enabling studies in 2017 and initiate human studies of PRX-OTC in 2018 in OTC deficient patients."
About PhaseRx
PhaseRx is a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to developing products for the treatment of children with inherited enzyme deficiencies in the liver using intracellular enzyme replacement therapy (i-ERT). PhaseRx's initial product development focus is on urea cycle disorders, a group of rare genetic diseases that generally present before the age of twelve and are characterized by the body's inability to remove ammonia from the blood with potentially devastating consequences for patients. The company's i-ERT approach is enabled by its proprietary Hybrid mRNA TechnologyTM platform. PhaseRx is headquartered in Seattle. For more information, please visit www.phaserx.com. 
Safe Harbor Statement
This press release contains "forward-looking statements." Such statements may be preceded by the words "intends," "may," "will," "plans," "expects," "anticipates," "projects," "predicts," "estimates," "aims," "believes," "hopes," "potential" or similar words. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, are based on certain assumptions and are subject to various known and unknown risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the company's control, and cannot be predicted or quantified and consequently, actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Such risks and uncertainties include, without limitation, risks and uncertainties associated with (i) the fact that the company has incurred significant losses since its inception and anticipates that it will continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future, (ii) the company being dependent on technologies it has licensed and that it may need to license in the future to develop its products, (iii) the fact that the company will need to raise substantial additional funding to bring its planned products through clinical trials, regulatory approval, manufacturing and marketing and to become profitable, (iv) the fact that the company's Hybrid mRNA Technology has not previously been tested beyond company preclinical studies, and that mRNA-based drug development is unproven and may never lead to marketable products, (v) the fact that all of the company's programs are in preclinical studies or early stage research, so the company cannot predict how these results will translate into results in humans, nor can it be certain that any company product candidates will receive regulatory approval or be commercialized, (vi) the fact that development of the company's product candidates will be expensive and time-consuming, and if the development of company product candidates does not produce favorable results or is delayed, the company may be unable to commercialize these products, (vii) the company expecting to continue to incur significant research and development expenses, which may make it difficult to attain profitability, (viii) the company becoming dependent on collaborative arrangements with third parties for a substantial portion of its revenue, and its development and commercialization activities being delayed or reduced if it fails to initiate, negotiate or maintain successful collaborative arrangements, (ix) the company's ability to adequately protect its proprietary technology from legal challenges, infringement or alternative technologies and (x) the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries being intensely competitive, with competition from existing drugs, new treatment methods and new technologies that may prove to be more effective or marketable than the company's products. More detailed information about the company and the risk factors that may affect the realization of forward looking statements is set forth in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including the company's prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, with the SEC on May 23, 2016. Investors and security holders are urged to read these documents free of charge on the SEC's web site at http://www.sec.gov. The company assumes no obligation to publicly update or revise its forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

Style Scores:



NA Value | NA Growth | NA Momentum | NA VGM                


The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Growth Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The three scores are based on the trading styles of Growth, Value, and Momentum.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B.
