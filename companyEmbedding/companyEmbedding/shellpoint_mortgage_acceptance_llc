“We put the customer first, and that’s a huge factor in our success.
”

- Bruce Williams
Co-CEO, Shellpoint Partners







Our Philosophy
Building A Solid Foundation For Innovation
You can’t be an innovative leader without first ensuring that trust, integrity, and sound practices are the cornerstone of your firm. That’s why we developed these founding principles:

Transparency in all of our transactions
We provide our investors at all levels with the appropriate access to information so they can make intelligent, informed decisions with confidence.


Prioritize people in all of our dealings
We recognize that lending is a people business as much as it’s a numbers business. On the other end of every transaction, someone’s dream hangs in the balance. We never forget that.


Do the right thing when faced with tough choices
We understand that trust is earned, not granted. When the right choice is the harder choice, we are willing to make it and stand behind it.


Make informed, intelligent investment decisions, always
We know that risk is an inherent part of lending. We avoid unnecessary risk by building the highest standards of due diligence into every decision. Plus, we place our capital right alongside that of our investors. When everyone has skin in the game, the game is generally more fair and honest for everyone involved.

By applying this 4-prong approach to every single decision and transaction we face, we have built a firm foundation, strong enough to support the new and improved mortgage market.

SHELLPOINT PARTNERS LLC
FORM S-3 REGISTRATION STATEMENT
TO ISSUE NON-AGENCY RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE-BACKED
SECURITIES
DECLARED EFFECTIVE BY SEC
  


 
NEW YORK, NY, May 8, 2013 – Shellpoint
Partners LLC (“Shellpoint” or the “Company”), a New York-based specialty finance company formed in 2010,
today announced that the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) has declared effective Shellpoint’s shelf
registration statement (the “Shelf Registration Statement”). Shellpoint filed the Shelf Registration Statement through
its subsidiary depositor, Shellpoint Mortgage Acceptance LLC (“Shelly Mac”), and through Shelly Mac may now issue public
residential mortgage-backed securities (“RMBS”) off of its shelf.
 
Shellpoint has initially funded its shelf
with $2 billion of issuance capacity. According to Shellpoint Co-CEO Saul Sanders, “Funding the shelf with substantial capacity
shows our commitment to bringing urgently needed private capital back into the housing market. We intend to be a significant issuer
of new issue RMBS and help define the new market standards and practices that will restore a healthy housing market as one of the
vital cornerstones of the economy.”
 
Shellpoint intends to securitize only those
loans originated by its wholly-owned subsidiary, New Penn Financial, LLC (“New Penn Financial”). New Penn Financial,
founded in 2008 and based in Plymouth Meeting, PA, offers agency, government-backed and prime-quality non-agency residential mortgage
loans to borrowers in 47 states (including the District of Columbia). “Shellpoint and New Penn Financial were both formed
after the start of the housing crisis,” said Mr. Sanders. “We look forward to proving our commitment to quality, responsible
loan manufacturing and our understanding of the lessons from the housing crisis.”
 
Mr. Sanders and Shellpoint’s other Co-CEO,
Bruce Williams, both long-time veterans of the securitization industry, are on Shellpoint’s Board of Directors. The Chairman
of Shellpoint’s Board of Directors is Lewis S. Ranieri, a securitization pioneer and Chairman of Ranieri Partners LLC, which
has interests in a variety of real estate-related platforms and is a part-owner of Shellpoint.
 
About Shellpoint Partners LLC
Shellpoint
is a specialty finance company focused on the U.S. residential mortgage market. One of its primary goals is to provide additional
options and liquidity to quality borrowers who do not fit the existing underwriting criteria for agency or government-backed mortgages.
Shellpoint hopes that providing these additional options and liquidity will help the housing market recover through the return
of private capital and the expansion of access to mortgage credit for such borrowers.

As
a prospective RMBS issuer and industry participant, Shellpoint is also committed to helping define the new market standards and
practices that will support the growth of a healthy and responsible RMBS market.

About New Penn Financial, LLC
Established
in 2008 amidst a challenging era for the U.S. real estate and mortgage industries, New Penn Financial has been able to enjoy substantial
growth by focusing on quality originations without the challenges and legacy issues faced by many other existing mortgage lenders.

presence built on competitive interest rates, exceptional customer service, and healthy lending practices.

that encourages and supports the continued growth of New Penn Financial. Benefiting from Shellpoint's financial and leadership
assets, New Penn Financial is a lender devoted to developing new loan products and serving diverse customers, including those who
meet agency and government-backed mortgage criteria as well as creditworthy borrowers who do not. New Penn Financial offers an
expanding portfolio of mortgage options that meet the needs of more borrowers and help them to achieve their goal of home ownership.
Based in Plymouth
Meeting, PA, New Penn Financial is currently licensed as a mortgage originator in 47 states (including the District of Columbia)

We were not engaged to, and
did not perform an audit, examination or review, the objectives of which would be the expression of an opinion or conclusion, respectively,
on the accuracy of the information on the Selected Loans. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion or conclusion. Had we
performed additional procedures, other matters might have come to our attention that would have been reported to you.
 
The procedures performed were
applied based on methodologies and information included in the Data File or provided by the Company, without verification or evaluation
of such methodologies and information by us; therefore, we express no opinion or any other form of assurance regarding (i) the
reasonableness of the methodologies, assumptions or information provided to us by the Company, (ii) the physical existence of the
Selected Loans, (iii) the reliability or accuracy of the Loan File Documents, the Data File, or data and documents furnished to
us by the Company which were used in our procedures, or (iii) matters of legal interpretation.
 
The procedures performed were
not intended to address, nor did they address: (i) the conformity of the origination of the Selected Loans to stated underwriting
or credit extension guidelines, standards, criteria or other requirements, (ii) the value of collateral securing any such Selected
Loans being securitized, (iii) the compliance of the originator of the Selected Loans with federal, state, and local laws and regulations,
or (iv) any other factor or characteristic of the Selected Loans that would be material to the likelihood that the issuer or the
asset-backed security will pay interest and principal in accordance with applicable terms and conditions. The procedures performed
were not intended to satisfy any criteria for due diligence published by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization
(“NRSRO”).
 
The terms of our engagement
are such that we have no obligation to update this report because of events and transactions that may subsequently occur.

	PRE-OFFERING
	REVIEW OF THE MORTGAGE LOANS



	Introduction



	The Sponsor, prior
	to including the mortgage loans in the mortgage pool, conducted a review for the purpose of providing reasonable assurance that
	the disclosure regarding the mortgage pool in this prospectus supplement is accurate in all material respects. In conducting the
	review, the Sponsor engaged third parties to assist it with certain elements of the review. The review conducted by the Sponsor,
	including the portions of the review conducted with the assistance of the third parties, is referred to herein as the “Sponsor’s
	pre-offering review.” The Sponsor determined the nature, extent and timing of the Sponsor’s pre-offering review and
	the level of assistance provided by any third party. The Sponsor does






	S-

	56










	 


	 






	not attribute any
	of the findings and conclusions of the Sponsor’s pre-offering review to any of the third parties. The review conducted with
	the assistance of third parties was conducted with respect to 100% of the mortgage loans included in the final mortgage pool. The
	results of the reviews prepared by the third parties were shared with the underwriter. The underwriter reviewed these findings
	in connection with its preparation for the offering of the offered certificates.


	[The Sponsor’s
	pre-offering review included a credit and compliance component and a component consisting of a review of the independent appraisals
	of the mortgaged properties obtained by the originators in connection with the origination of the mortgage loans (referred to herein
	as the “original appraisals”), as more fully described below. None of the procedures conducted as part of the Sponsor’s
	pre-offering review constituted, either separately or in combination, an independent underwriting of the mortgage loans. In addition,
	the procedures conducted as part of the review of the original appraisals were not re-appraisals of the mortgaged properties. To
	the extent that valuation tools were used as part of the appraisal review process they should not be relied upon as providing an
	assessment of value of the mortgaged properties comparable to that which an appraisal might provide. They also are not an assessment
	of the current value of any of the mortgaged properties.]


	[The Sponsor’s
	pre-offering review also included a component consisting of procedures designed to verify the Sponsor’s data regarding the
	characteristics of the mortgage loans, which data were used to generate the numerical information about the mortgage pool included
	in this prospectus supplement. In addition, the review included the recalculation by a third party of numerical disclosures regarding
	the mortgage loans selected by the Sponsor and appearing in this prospectus supplement.]


	[See

	“—Limitations
	of the Pre-

	offering

	Review Process

	” below and “

	Risk Factors—Pre-offering Review of the Mortgage
	Loans Underlying the Certificates May Not Reveal Aspects of the Mortgage Loans Which Could Lead to Losses

	[As noted above
	under the Risk Factor captioned “

	Pre-offering Review of the Mortgage Loans Underlying the Certificates May Not Reveal
	Aspects of the Mortgage Loans Which Could Lead to Losses

	,” there can be no assurance that the Sponsor’s pre-offering
	review uncovered all relevant factors relating to the origination of the mortgage loans, their compliance with applicable law and
	regulation and the original appraisals relating of the mortgaged properties or uncovered all relevant factors that could affect
	the future performance of the mortgage loans. The mortgage loans that were included in the pre-offering review may have characteristics
	that were not discovered, noted or analyzed as part of the pre-offering review that could, nonetheless, result in those mortgage
	loans failing to perform in the future.]

	[Investors are encouraged,
	in particular, to note the following with respect to the appraisal review that was conducted as part of the Sponsor’s pre-offering
	review.


	•          Differences
	may exist among and between estimated valuations due to the subjective nature of estimated valuations and appraisals, particularly
	between different appraisers estimating valuations or performing appraisals at different points in time, as well as among appraisers
	and other persons reviewing the appraisals or other valuations.


	•          Estimating
	or appraising the value of, and performing other analyses of, high-cost properties (such as most of the mortgaged properties) can
	involve challenges that may not generally be present with respect to properties whose values fall within the average price range
	of their respective markets. There may be fewer substitute properties available (from which to derive comparative values) in the
	high-cost residential property market, unique buyer attitudes and preferences, and more difficult to quantify “appeal”
	issues, any of which can make valuations in the high-cost home segment less precise than for more average-priced housing.


	•          Estimates
	of value for high-cost properties (such as the above-described) are imprecise. The unique nature of some of these properties, the
	use in some cases of highly customized and top-quality materials, overall interior design/appeal issues, and in many cases limited
	notations in the original appraisal report regarding key elements that drove the original property valuation, pose challenges for
	a subsequent reviewer. Also, the reviewer (or the preparer of an Limited Desktop Appraisal Analysis) does not typically have independent
	access to an interior inspection of the property and therefore is not able to independently analyze the interior appointments and
	amenities associated with the valuation of these types of properties.


	•          Appraisals
	and other valuations represent the analysis and opinion of the person performing the appraisal or valuation at the time it is prepared,
	and are not guarantees of, and may not be indicative of, the present or future value of the mortgaged property.]


	Investors are encouraged
	to make their own determination as the extent to which they place reliance on the limited loan review procedures carried out as
	part of the Sponsor’s pre-offering review.




	STATIC
	POOL INFORMATION


	[Static pool information
	with respect to mortgage loans similar to the mortgage loans of the issuing entity is attached as Annex A to this prospectus supplement.]


	[The Depositor does
	not have any material static pool information with respect to any mortgage loans of the same type as those included in the trust
	estate originated by the originator.]


	There can be no assurance
	that the rates of delinquencies, losses and prepayments experienced by the prior securitized pools will be comparable to delinquencies,
	losses and prepayments expected to be experienced by the mortgage loans owned by the Issuing Entity.




	MORTGAGE
	LOAN ORIGINATION



	General



	[All] of the mortgage
	loans were originated by New Penn Financial, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, referred to herein as New Penn, the Originator
	or the Sponsor, or acquired by New Penn from Correspondents (as defined below). All of the mortgage loans originated by New Penn
	or






	S-

	58










	 


	 






	acquired by New
	Penn from Correspondents will be serviced by [Name of Servicer]. [Identify any Correspondents or other third-party originator that
	originated 10% or more of the mortgage loans.] [The remainder of the mortgage loans were originated by various originators, none
	of which have originated more than 10% of the mortgage loans in the aggregate.]



	New Penn



	New Penn has been
	an originator of mortgage loans since February 2008 and has originated mortgage loans of the type backing the certificates offered
	hereby since July 2011. In total, New Penn originated approximately $__billion of mortgage loans in 2008 (its first year of origination),
	$__billion of mortgage loans in 2009, $__billion of mortgage loans in 2010, $__billion of mortgage loans in 2011, and, as of [September
	30, 2012], $__ billion of mortgage loans in 2012. Of these originations, approximately (i) $__ billion were originated pursuant
	to Fannie Mae underwriting guidelines, (ii) $__ billion were originated pursuant to HUD (i.e., FHA, VA or USDA) underwriting guidelines,
	and (iii) $__ million were originated pursuant to the underwriting guidelines applicable to the mortgage loans included in the
	mortgage pool (the “Underwriting Standards”). The remainder of the mortgage loans originated by New Penn or acquired
	from Correspondents by New Penn have been originated generally to underwriting guidelines of third-party investors.


	New Penn originates
	residential mortgage loans in the states where it is properly licensed through four different productions channels: Call Center,
	Retail, Wholesale and Correspondent. The relative contribution of each of these sources to New Penn’s origination business,
	measured by the volume of loans generated, fluctuates over time. Historical volumes are set forth in the table below.



	Call Center.

	New Penn’s Call Center origination channel employs direct response marketing and analytics in a “direct-to-consumer”
	business model, using internet, direct and indirect mail, email and telephone and various media strategies to source customers.
	As of [September 30, 2012], New Penn operates its Call Center business primarily out of __ offices located in __states.



	Retail.

	New
	Penn’s Retail origination channel sources customers through traditional referrals from realtors and builders. As of [September
	30, 2012], New Penn operates its Retail business primarily out of __ branches located in __states.



	Wholesale.

	New Penn’s Wholesale origination channel sources customers from select independent mortgage brokers. Mortgage brokers must
	pass New Penn’s detailed evaluation process and meet and maintain minimum financial, operational, ethical and other criteria
	in order to qualify for approval to source loans for this channel. New Penn’s Wholesale channel also develops origination
	business by building relationships with local community banks and credit unions and providing mortgage loan options to their customers.
	New Penn underwrites and closes loans originated through its Wholesale channel in its own name and does not allow mortgage brokers
	to make any credit decisions. In addition, New Penn will revalidate any credit documentation provided to it by a mortgage broker
	in connection with the related mortgage loan application, and that documentation must comply with the requirements of the Underwriting
	Standards. As of [September 30, 2012], New Penn operates its Wholesale business primarily out of __ offices located in __states.



	Correspondent.

	New Penn acquires qualifying mortgage loans from other unaffiliated originators (“Correspondents”). In order to qualify
	for participation in New Penn’s Correspondent purchase program, lending institutions undergo a detailed qualifying review
	and must meet prescribed criteria. Among other things, Correspondent lenders must (i) meet and maintain certain net worth and other
	financial standards, (ii) demonstrate experience in originating residential mortgage loans and (iii) meet and maintain certain
	operational standards. Although New Penn requires each Correspondent to comply






	S-

	59










	 


	 






	with New Penn’s
	underwriting guidelines and to provide comprehensive representations and warranties in support of its originations, New Penn nevertheless
	generally re-underwrites Correspondent mortgage loans concurrently with the Correspondent or prior to closing of the mortgage loan
	in order to ensure compliance with New Penn’s underwriting guidelines.


	[The following table
	describes the size, composition and growth of New Penn’s total residential mortgage loan production, by production channel,
	over the past three years and recent stub-period.]

	Approximately [__]%
	of the mortgage loans in the mortgage pool have been originated generally in accordance with the Underwriting Standards. [Disclosure
	of types of exceptions to the Underwriting Standards and statistical data regarding the exceptions to the extent material]. The
	Underwriting Standards are applied in accordance with applicable federal and state laws and regulations.




	New Penn Loan Products




	The majority of
	New Penn’s mortgage loan originations consist of residential mortgage loans originated and underwritten generally in accordance
	with Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or HUD (FHA, VA and USDA) underwriting guidelines.


	New Penn also originates
	non-agency mortgage loans, including the mortgage loans included in the mortgage pool. The mortgage loans included in the mortgage
	pool were [all] originated under the Underwriting Standards and consist of Core and Core Plus products (collectively, “Core
	and Core Plus Products”). Within Core Plus, two types of loan products are available: Foreign National and Investor. Borrowers
	who are non-United States citizens with (i) valid passports, (ii) valid visas, (iii) valid Social Security numbers or Individual
	Taxpayer Identification Numbers (“ITIN”) and (iv) a FICO score based on credit scores and reports issued by one of
	the [three standard United States credit bureaus], are eligible for a Core or Foreign National loan, and are evaluated pursuant
	to the Underwriting Standards applicable to each of those products (see

	“–Underwriting Standards”

	below).
	Foreign national borrowers who do not have a United States FICO score and either a Social Security number or an ITIN may only qualify
	for a Foreign National loan. Permanent resident aliens that have an alien registration receipt card are eligible for financing
	on the same terms as U.S. citizens, provided that the application file contains acceptable evidence of lawful permanent residency
	and otherwise qualifies under the Underwriting Standards. All references to a “Foreign National” borrower in this prospectus
	supplement shall mean a borrower that is only eligible for, and qualifies and obtains, a Foreign National loan.






	S-

	60










	 


	 






	New Penn offers
	the following Core and Core Plus loan products:


	•	          Fixed-rate,
	fully-amortizing first lien mortgage loans providing for level monthly payments of principal and interest and terms at origination
	of 10, 15, 20, 25 or 30 years;


	•	          Fully-amortizing
	adjustable-rate first lien mortgage loans having an original term to maturity of 30 years, with an initial fixed-rate period of
	5, 7 or 10 years and a related mortgage rate that adjusts in intervals of 1 year;


	•	          Fixed-rate,
	fully-amortizing first lien mortgage loans with an initial interest-only period of 10 years and terms at origination of 30 years
	(not available for Investor loans); and


	•	          Fully-amortizing
	adjustable-rate first lien mortgage loans having an original term to maturity of 30 years, with an initial fixed-rate period of
	10 years during which only payments in respect of interest are due (not available for Investor loans).


	A description of
	the Underwriting Standards applicable to Core and Core Plus Products is set forth below.




	Underwriting Standards





	General



	Core and Core Plus
	Products are designed for borrowers with strong credit and disposable income and significant reserves, and provide flexible financing
	solutions for such borrowers.


	In determining whether
	to approve a particular mortgage loan, New Penn evaluates many aspects of the mortgage loan beyond merely a “check the box”
	approach. In examining the characteristics of the mortgage loan, New Penn employs a variety of tools and processes and generally
	focuses on the borrower’s current credit, his or her willingness and ability to repay the mortgage loan and the property
	being used as collateral for the mortgage loan. New Penn also focuses on fraud prevention and compliance with applicable lending
	laws. Compensating factors such as length of employment, residual income, reserves and time in the residence may be used in some
	cases to mitigate risk in lending decisions when applicable. Equally important to the credit, willingness/ability to repay and
	collateral analysis, New Penn has a no-tolerance policy with respect to fraud. Mortgage loans as to which the loan files contain
	fraudulent documentation or information are immediately declined.


	As described more
	fully below under

	“–Full Documentation: Income, Assets, Employment”

	, New Penn’s Underwriting Standards
	for Core and Core Plus Products require full documentation for all borrowers, and do not permit limited, stated, alternative or
	no documentation options. New Penn’s full documentation policy also requires verification of income, employment and assets
	as provided in the Underwriting Standards.



	Credit Requirements



	New Penn originates
	mortgage loans using a “best execution” model, offering borrowers the most competitive loan products for which they
	qualify. The Core and Core Plus Products are generally available for borrowers with strong credit and significant reserves, income,
	and/or other compensating factors who do not qualify under agency guidelines. If a Core or Core Plus mortgage loan has a conforming
	balance, New Penn requires documentation in the credit file describing the reason the borrower does not qualify for an agency loan.






	S-

	61










	 


	 






	In each case, minimum
	and maximum guideline requirements may be increased or decreased subject to a cap or floor, respectively, based on the presence
	or absence of compensating factors, such as residual income or reserves, and other basic characteristics like loan-to-value ratio
	(“LTV”), debt-to-income ratio (“DTI”), FICO and loan balance. In addition, loan features such as an interest
	only option may increase certain minimum requirements, such as FICO, and/or decrease certain maximum requirements, such as LTV.
	Failure to meet a minimum or maximum requirement under the Underwriting Standards in the absence of an authorized and documented
	exception will result in the decline of an application.


	Generally, the Underwriting
	Standards require a minimum loan balance of $100,000 and all mortgage loans must be first lien mortgage loans. All mortgage loans
	generally require a minimum of six months’ PITI liquid reserves and all mortgage loans of $1 million or greater generally
	require a minimum of 12 months’ PITI liquid reserves. Any personal bankruptcies of a borrower must have been discharged at
	least 48 months prior to the related loan application, and any previous foreclosures must have been settled at least 96 months
	prior to the related loan application. The Underwriting Standards prohibit lending to politically exposed persons and persons who
	do not pass a comprehensive watchlist screening, including without limitation the OFAC SDN List and various governmental exclusionary
	lists. Generally, prepayment penalties are required on Investor mortgage loans, subject to applicable law.



	Core Product



	Core mortgage loans
	are generally subject to the following minimum and maximum requirements for purchase and refinance transactions, in each case subject
	to the effect of compensating factors and overall loan features as described herein and more fully in the Underwriting Standards.



	Purchase



	•           	Primary
	residences: maximum 85% LTV, with a minimum FICO score of 700 (680 with respect to a 10- or 15-year fixed rate
	mortgage loan). As LTV declines, FICO requirements may also decline; the minimum FICO score for a primary residence is 680
	(660 with respect to a 10- or 15-year fixed rate mortgage loan) at a maximum LTV of 80%. Second homes: maximum LTV of 80%,
	with a minimum FICO score of 740 (700 with respect to a 10- or 15-year fixed rate mortgage loan). As LTV declines, FICO
	requirements may also decline; the minimum FICO score for a second home is 680 at a maximum LTV of 75% (660 at a maximum LTV
	of 70% with respect to 10- or 15-year fixed rate mortgage loans).


	•           	Maximum
	front-end DTI of 35% and back-end DTI of 45%. Expanded DTI, to maximum front end/back end limits of 48%/58% (40%/50% for investment
	properties), are allowable with a minimum 18 months’ PITI liquid reserves.


	•           	Maximum
	loan amount of (i) $2,000,000 for primary residences, (ii) $1.5 million for second homes and (iii) $650,000 for investment properties.
	Maximum loan amount generally decreases as the LTV and/or DTI increases and/or the FICO score decreases, and is also subject to
	other compensating factors.



	Rate and Term
	Refinance



	•           	Primary
	residences: maximum 85% LTV, with a minimum FICO score of 720 (700 with respect to a 10- or 15-year fixed rate mortgage
	loan). As LTV declines, FICO requirements may also decline; the minimum FICO score for a primary residence is 680






	S-

	62










	 


	 






	at a maximum
	LTV of 80% (660 at a maximum LTV of 75% with respect to 10- or 15-year fixed rate mortgage loans). Second homes: maximum LTV of
	75% (80% with respect to 10- or 15-year fixed rate mortgage loans), with a minimum FICO score of 700. As LTV declines, FICO requirements
	may also decline; the minimum FICO score for a second home is 680 at a maximum LTV of 70% (75% LTV with respect to 10- or 15-year
	fixed rate mortgage loans).


	•           	Maximum
	front-end DTI of 35% and back-end DTI of 45%. Expanded DTI, to maximum front end/back end limits of 48%/58% (40%/50% for investment
	properties), are allowable with a minimum 18 months’ PITI liquid reserves.


	•           	Maximum
	loan amount of (i) $2,000,000 for primary residences, (ii) $1.5 million for second homes and (iii) $650,000 for investment properties.
	Maximum loan amount generally decreases as the LTV and/or DTI increases and/or the FICO score decreases, and is also subject to
	other compensating factors.



	Cash-out Refinance



	•           	Primary
	residences: maximum 85% LTV, with a minimum FICO score of 740 (720 with respect to a 10- or 15-year fixed rate mortgage loan).
	As LTV declines, FICO requirements may also decline; the minimum FICO score for a primary residence is 680 at a maximum LTV of
	75%. Second homes: maximum LTV of 70%, with a minimum FICO score of 680 (700 at a maximum LTV of 75% with respect to 10- or 15-year
	fixed rate mortgage loans). Generally, LTV and FICO requirements remain constant for cash-out refinances on second homes, except
	with respect to 10- or 15-year fixed rate mortgage loans, for which the minimum FICO score is 680 at a maximum LTV of 70%.


	•           	Maximum
	front-end DTI of 35% and back-end DTI of 45%. Expanded DTI, to maximum front end/back end limits of 48%/58% (40%/50% for investment
	properties), are allowable with a minimum 18 months’ PITI liquid reserves.


	•           	Maximum
	loan amount of (i) $1,000,000 for primary residences, (ii) $500,000 for second homes and (iii) $500,000 for investment properties.
	Maximum loan amount generally decreases as the LTV and/or DTI increase and/or the FICO score decreases, and is also subject to
	other compensating factors.



	Core Select Product



	New Penn also offers
	a “Core Select” product, which is a subset of its Core Product. Eligibility for a Core Select mortgage loan is generally
	more stringent in comparison to a Core mortgage loan. In addition to all requirements for Core mortgage loans, Core Select mortgage
	loans are also subject to additional requirements under the Underwriting Standards, including without limitation the following:


	•           	Maximum
	loan amount of $1,000,000.


	•           	Only
	15- and 30-year fixed rate purchase or rate and term refinance loans available (with no interest only option).


	•           	Primary
	residences: maximum 70% LTV (cap), with a minimum FICO score of 740 (floor). Second homes: maximum 60% LTV (cap), with a minimum
	FICO score of 740 (floor). Maximum front-end DTI of 33% and back-end DTI of 38%, with exceptions

		made on back-end
	DTI up to 40% if there are strong compensating factors (e.g., low LTV, larger reserves).


	•	           Minimum
	12 months PITI reserves (at least 6 months of which must be liquid).


	•	           Must
	have a minimum of 24 months prior mortgage payment history, with no delinquencies.


	•	           84
	months since bankruptcy discharge, if applicable.


	•	           Escrows
	for taxes and insurance are required unless prohibited by applicable law.


	•	           Foreign
	nationals who might otherwise qualify for a Core mortgage loan are not eligible.


	All references to
	Core mortgage loans in this prospectus supplement also include Core Select mortgage loans to the extent not inconsistent with the
	foregoing description.

	Foreign National
	Mortgage Loans



	A foreign national
	borrower who is a non-United States citizen with (i) a valid passport, (ii) a valid visa, (iii) a valid Social Security number
	or ITIN and (iv) a FICO score based on credit scores and reports issued by one of the [three standard United States credit bureaus]
	may be eligible for a Core mortgage loan. A foreign national borrower who is a non-United States citizen and either has or does
	not have the items listed in clauses (i) through (iv) of the previous sentence may be eligible for a Foreign National mortgage
	loan.


	Foreign National
	mortgage loans generally have a maximum loan amount of $650,000 and a maximum LTV of 65% for purchase transactions and 55% for
	refinance transactions (which may only be rate and term and cannot be cash-out refinance transactions). Foreign National borrowers
	may not have any previous bankruptcies or foreclosures. In determining whether the borrower has sufficient monthly income to meet
	his or her monthly obligation on the proposed mortgage loan and to meet monthly housing expenses and other financial obligations
	(including the borrower’s monthly obligations on the proposed mortgage loan), assets owned by the prospective borrower are
	not taken into account for income calculations.


	Foreign National
	loans require front-end/back-end DTI ratios of 35%/45%. Expanded DTIs are generally not available. A minimum of 24 months PITI
	liquid reserves is required with a minimum of 12 months’ PITI liquid reserves in a U.S. FDIC-insured bank or NCUSIF-insured
	credit union. Automated debit for monthly payments from a U.S. financial institution is also required for Foreign National loans.


	A domestic tri-merge
	credit report is run on all Foreign National borrowers. If this score is available, a minimum score of 680 is required, which floor
	may be increased depending on other factors. New Penn will also generally obtain an international credit report on borrowers residing
	in countries where such reports are available. If translation is required, as with all documentation completed in a foreign language,
	the translation must be completed by a qualified translator.

	Investor Product



	Investor mortgage
	loans are tailored to borrowers with proven experience in residential real estate investing who generally do not qualify for an
	agency investor product. An investor mortgage loan may have a maximum LTV of 65% if the borrower has a minimum FICO score of 680.
	As LTV declines, FICO requirements may also decline. The minimum FICO score for a borrower under an investor mortgage loan is 640,
	with a maximum LTV on the corresponding loan of 60%. The borrower must demonstrate a history and proficiency in residential real
	estate investing. New Penn will allow up to 20 properties in total for certain investor borrowers, although New Penn will finance
	no more than five of these properties, subject to a $2.5 million aggregate balance cap. As part of New Penn’s standard underwriting
	philosophy, New Penn may require more conservative standards within minimum and maximum thresholds based on various loan and borrower
	characteristics. Interest only loans are not available under the investor program, and a prepayment penalty is required as a disincentive
	to flipping. Investor program loans authorize the mortgagee to appoint a receiver in the event of delinquency (as further described
	in the applicable loan documentation).



	First-Time Home
	Buyers



	New Penn employs
	additional credit requirements for first-time home buyers, requiring, among other things, (i) a maximum loan amount of $1 million,
	(ii) primary residence only, (iii) a minimum of twelve months’ PITI liquid reserves, (iv) a 720 minimum FICO score, (v) a
	75% maximum LTV and (vi) a maximum payment shock limitation for ARM loans. First-time home buyers are only eligible for Core mortgage
	loans.



	Condominiums



	The Underwriting
	Standards permit mortgage loans on condominiums, subject to certain additional requirements for condominiums in certain areas or
	for which the mortgage loans do not satisfy Fannie Mae criteria relating to condominiums. Condominium loan amounts are generally
	limited to $500,000 except in certain major metro areas and as may otherwise be authorized on a case-by-case basis by senior management.



	Full Documentation: Income, Employment
	and Assets



	New Penn’s
	Underwriting Standards require full documentation and verification of a borrower’s income, employment and assets to determine
	whether the borrower reasonably can be expected to be able to repay the mortgage loan. This determination is based on the borrower’s
	income sources, employment history and past credit experience, which must be commensurate with the loan request. For example, information
	on the borrower’s credit report must corroborate information on the application. Prudent underwriting and analysis of credit
	and loan characteristics may warrant requests for additional information or documentation. If information is inconsistent (e.g.,
	occupancy, employment, income, etc.), the mortgage loan may be declined, but in any case, additional information is gathered to
	understand the inconsistency. Compensating or additional supporting information disclosed in the file may be taken into consideration.
	All files must include the completed initial application.


	The documentation
	submitted by the borrower in connection with an application must have been dated within 90 days of the closing of the mortgage
	loan.


	The Underwriting
	Standards provide for salaried/wage earners, self-employed borrowers and borrowers who are on a fixed income or who earn non-taxable
	income (e.g., Social Security income, retirement or pension income, alimony, child support, foster care payments, etc.). To qualify,
	the borrower’s income must be from a source likely to generate sufficient income to repay the debt and must demonstrate consistency,
	such that the amounts and sources used to qualify the borrower are reasonably






	S-

	65










	 


	 






	expected to remain
	stable and continue. Each source of income must also be reviewed with regard to the borrower’s ability to meet his or her
	total debt obligation. Varying types and levels of income documentation may be necessary for different types of income and loan
	programs. Generally, if a borrower’s income can be verified as received for a reasonable time period (i.e., one or more years)
	and is likely to continue for at least three more years based upon the totality of the circumstances, the income may be used as
	qualifying income.


	Employment must
	be stable to qualify a borrower, generally showing at least a two year history in the same job or jobs in the same or related field.
	Self-employed borrowers must be in the same business and the same field for the most recent four years, although two years may
	be considered if the borrower has been in the same field for four years. Other circumstances may also be acceptable on a case-by-case
	basis as long as the borrower demonstrates sufficient employment stability. For example, a borrower who changes jobs to advance
	within the same line of work may receive favorable treatment if this advancement can be verified; however, job changes without
	advancement or in different fields of work are reviewed carefully to ensure consistent or increasing income levels and the likelihood
	of continued stable employment. Additionally, borrowers are generally required to explain, in writing, any job gaps that exceed
	one month, and borrowers who re-enter the workforce with less than a two-year employment history must have been employed with their
	current employer for a minimum of six months, and provide a fully documented previous employment history.


	A borrower must
	also provide evidence of sufficient funds for the down payment, closing costs and reserves, when applicable. The fiscal position
	of the borrower, including accumulation of verifiable assets, is a strong indication of creditworthiness. An established pattern
	of savings demonstrates skill in financial management. Evidence that the savings are liquid also strengthens the loan transaction
	as these funds are readily available to repay debt obligations, pay unexpected expenses and provide protection against short term
	interruption of income.


	Core and Investor
	mortgage loans allow certain assets to be used for income qualification and do not require these assets to be withdrawn for this
	purpose. Different assets are subject to different formulas as provided under the Underwriting Standards. If an asset is being
	used in the calculation of any other type of income (e.g., dividends, interest, capital gains, etc.), the asset must be excluded
	from the “assets for income” calculation. Assets do not qualify for income calculations for Foreign National borrowers.


	For Foreign National
	borrowers, generally a minimum of 24 months’ PITI liquid reserves is required with a minimum of 12 months in a U.S. FDIC-insured
	bank or an NCUSIF-insured national credit union. Assets held in a foreign account are calculated to the current exchange rate with
	verification of the exchange rate provided in the loan file. Gift funds are not allowed in qualifying borrowers under the Foreign
	National loan guidelines.



	Income and Employment
	Verification



	New Penn employs
	a number of controls and requirements in verifying income and employment for non-self-employed borrowers. Generally, New Penn requires
	independent, written verification of employment from the employer’s human resources department or an officer or owner of
	the company, along with the most recent three months of pay stubs. Any W-2 submitted as proof of income or employment must contain
	all schedules, be computer-generated or typewritten and accompanied by an IRS Form 4506-T signed by the borrower. Additional validity
	checks are done on all submitted documentation.






	S-

	66










	 


	 






	The Underwriting
	Standards generally provide for a conservative approach in calculating income when income is declining or inconsistent, requiring
	further documentation and review. If the decline or inconsistency cannot be shown to be isolated or nonrecurring in nature, then
	the lowest annual compensation over the 2-year period prior to the date of loan application is used to qualify the borrower, assuming
	consistency of income can be established. If the borrower is paid on an hourly basis or does not work a regular 40 hour work week
	throughout the year, the borrower’s income generally must be averaged over the minimum employment history required. If there
	is an indication of declining income, the current income is used instead of the average, assuming consistency of income can be
	established. Bank statements (whether business or personal) are generally not allowed as income verification.


	For Foreign National
	mortgage loans, the Underwriting Standards permit salaried, retired and self-employed borrowers. Salaried borrowers must provide
	a letter from their employer stating current monthly salary and year-to-date earnings, as well as two months of valid pay stubs
	(although pay stubs may be waived if (i) the borrower is not employed within the United States, (ii) the employer does not provide
	pay stubs and (iii) alternative proof of employment is provided that is satisfactory under the Underwriting Standards). New Penn
	employs several controls and verification processes to ensure the accuracy and validity of the letter and other income and employment
	documentation. Generally, tax returns filed in foreign countries are not required and an executed IRS Form 4506-T is not required
	if the borrower is not required to file United States tax returns.


	Self-employed Foreign
	National borrowers are eligible under the Underwriting Standards, but borrowers generally must show self-employment for a minimum
	of four years. Unearned income is generally not counted as qualifying income but may be considered on a case-by-case basis. While
	Core mortgage loans and Investor mortgage loans allow income from a non-US source to be considered only if such income is paid
	by a corporate entity and is not subject to tax in any jurisdiction outside of the US, reasonable exceptions to this requirement
	are allowable under the Foreign National program.


	A verbal or electronic
	verification of employment (a “VOE”) is required for each Core and Core Plus Product mortgage loan. For non-self employed
	borrowers, a verbal VOE must be obtained within 10 calendar days of funding. New Penn employs controls to ensure the validity of
	the VOE. If the borrower has seasonal employment and (i) the verification occurs during the off season and (ii) the borrower is
	not currently working for that business, independent verification satisfactory to New Penn that the business exists and that the
	borrower worked for that business as stated on the loan application is required.


	For self-employed
	borrowers, New Penn requires submission of contact and other identifying information regarding the borrower’s business that
	New Penn independently verifies within 30 days prior to funding the mortgage loan. Satisfactory verification includes confirmation
	of the validity of this information by a qualified third party, such as a CPA, regulatory agency or an applicable licensing bureau
	(with all pertinent information documented if such confirmation is verbal), and through independent sources such as the Yellow
	Pages and/or the internet.


	New Penn employs
	similar requirements and controls for Foreign National borrowers. Additionally, for all Core and Core Plus Product mortgage loans,
	New Penn may in its discretion accept income and employment verification reports via approved third-party verification services
	on a case-by-case basis in lieu of standard income and employment documentation, but will maintain the same philosophical approach
	embedded in the Underwriting Standards and document any exceptions to the Underwriting Standards.






	S-

	67










	 


	 







	Asset Verification



	Assets must be sourced
	and seasoned for at least 90 days prior to closing and may be verified using (i) direct written verification, completed by the
	applicable depository, or (ii) recent and consecutive account statements covering a period of three months for each bank, investment
	portfolio or brokerage or mutual fund account. In each case, New Penn requires comprehensive information regarding the assets and
	accounts, and employs controls to ensure the validity of all such information.


	For Foreign National
	borrowers, a letter of reference on company letterhead from a financial or banking institution is also required to prove assets.
	Among other information, the letter must contain a description of the type of relationship between the borrower and the institution
	and how the accounts are held. New Penn employs controls to ensure the validity of all such information.


	The verification
	of assets (including the source of funds) for all Core and Core Plus Product mortgage loans generally may not be greater than 90
	days old at the time of closing. If the funds are required for closing, then the most recent account statement or statements will
	be required for validation of funds.



	Appraisals



	New Penn appraisals
	must be AIR compliant and also comply with the standards and practices established under applicable law, including USPAP and FIRREA.
	The appraiser must not have a direct or indirect interest, financial or otherwise, in the property or in the transaction. Selection
	criteria should ensure that the appraiser is independent of the transaction and is capable of rendering an unbiased opinion.


	An appraisal prepared
	by an individual who was selected or engaged by a borrower, property seller, real estate agent or other interested party is not
	acceptable. Transferred or “re-addressed appraisals” or appraisal reports that are altered by the appraiser to replace
	any references to the original client with the lender’s name are not acceptable. Additionally, the borrower, property seller,
	real estate agent or other interested party is not allowed to select an appraiser with respect to any Core and Core Plus Product
	mortgage loan.


	New Penn employs
	internal controls to ensure that only qualified and adequately trained underwriters, who are not involved in the loan production
	process, review appraisals. The underwriting review must confirm this independence and entail a comprehensive technical review
	of the appraiser’s analysis prior to making a final credit decision.


	New Penn underwriters
	use various fraud and valuation tools when reviewing appraisals. The required products vary in accordance with New Penn’s
	appraisal review process. The data as well as the appraisal report will be reviewed when determining acceptability of the appraisal
	report.


	Appraisals must
	be ordered through a New Penn-approved Appraisal Management Company (“AMC”). An AMC must pass a comprehensive application
	process and maintain certain standards to be a New Penn-approved AMC. All mortgage loans must also be reviewed against New Penn’s
	“Ineligible Appraiser List.” If an appraisal is completed though an appraiser on that list, additional appraisal products
	may be required. With respect to mortgage loans originated by New Penn, New Penn may, but is not required to, use E Street Appraisal
	Management LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of New Penn’s direct parent, Shellpoint Partners LLC. E Street Appraisal Management
	LLC is subject to the same requirements as any third-party AMC.


	If a property shows
	excessive appreciation over the last 12 months, New Penn requires a satisfactory explanation from the appraiser for the increase
	in value. Additional appraisal products may






	S-

	68










	 


	 






	be required at the
	underwriter’s discretion based on a review of the increase, the explanation provided to support the increase, an analysis
	of market trends, and a review of information provided via automated valuation tools. Generally, New Penn underwriters may request
	additional valuation information at any time during the underwriting process in their discretion.


	The Underwriting
	Standards require an independent review by an approved-AMC prior to delivery for underwriting review, and may require a further
	independent desk review by an approved-AMC certified staff appraiser based on results of the appraisal review in the underwriting
	process.


	The Underwriting
	Standards may require two appraisals under certain circumstances, including (i) for Core mortgage loans with a principal balance
	in excess of $750,000, and (ii) for Core Plus mortgage loans with a principal balance in excess of $500,000. The lower of the two
	appraised values will be used to determine LTV, unless the sales price is lower than both appraisals (in which case the sales price
	will be used to determine LTV). Appraisals must be completed by two different independent appraisers selected by two different
	New Penn-approved AMCs; provided, however, that under certain circumstances, one appraisal may be a transferred appraisal subject
	to a field review.


	For Correspondent
	mortgage loans, the Underwriting Standards require two appraisals, however only one of the appraisals is required to be acquired
	through a New Penn-approved AMC, provided that the appraiser providing the other appraisal is not on New Penn’s ineligible
	appraiser list and meets all of the other requirements set forth in the Underwriting Standards.


	Any appraisal considered
	in the underwriting process must be completed within 120 days of closing.



	Exceptions to the Underwriting Standards



	Exceptions to Underwriting
	Standards must be reviewed and approved by New Penn’s [Chief Credit Officer], and must be documented and maintained in the
	related credit file. Exceptions may be based on compensating or mitigating factors or may reflect pending underwriting guideline
	changes that have been approved but not yet released. Exceptions with respect to the mortgage loans included in the mortgage pool
	are detailed in this prospectus supplement.


	[

	INCLUDE DISCLOSURE
	REQUIRED BY ITEM 1110(b) OF REGULATION AB FOR ANY CORRESPONDENT OR OTHER THIRD-PARTY ORIGINATOR THAT ORIGINATED 20% OR MORE OF
	THE MORTGAGE LOANS IN THE MORTGAGE POOL
