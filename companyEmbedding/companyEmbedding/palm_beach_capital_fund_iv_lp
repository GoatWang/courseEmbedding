Palm Beach Capital Announces Investment in Neptune Research






May 16, 2017 03:15 PM Eastern Daylight Time



WEST PALM BEACH, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Palm Beach Capital Fund IV, L.P., through one of its investment 
      entities, today announced that it made an investment in Neptune Research 
      Inc. and the related FloTex, LLC (“NRI” or “Company”) a leading company 
      in the infrastructure repair and restoration business. Financial terms 
      were not disclosed.
    


      For more than 30 years, NRI has focused its strategic research 
      initiatives on the development, manufacturing and marketing of 
      state-of-the-art pipe repair solutions that withstand the tests of time, 
      water and other elements. The company’s Syntho-Glass® system has proven 
      to be reliable enough for the U.S. Navy, the Coast Guard, and 
      international natural gas and oil industry conglomerates to require 
      Syntho-Glass® availability for all pipe repairs.
    

      “This was an amazing opportunity for both NRI and FloTex to catapult to 
      the next level and we couldn’t have picked a better partner than Palm 
      Beach Capital. They have the knowledge and team to help us continue to 
      revolutionize the composite infrastructure business,” stated Chris 
      Lazzara, NRI’s Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer.
    

      The Company originally developed its pipe repair systems for application 
      within the marine industry. As the original inventors of the 
      moisture-cured, pre-impregnated composite material, NRI caught the 
      attention of the U.S. Navy and, in 1996, secured its first contract with 
      the U.S. government requiring NRI’s Syntho-Glass® system to be carried 
      aboard all Navy vessels. Since that time, the Company has doubled every 
      three years in size and revenues as the demand for its solutions 
      continues to grow. To support this demand, NRI has introduced an average 
      of one new product per year over the last four years, with each product 
      focusing on the Company’s participation in the evolution of leak repair 
      and pipe reinforcement.
    

      “We are excited to partner with Chris and the rest of the NRI team and 
      to provide the support necessary for the Company to realize the full, 
      global potential of NRI’s revolutionary solutions and service offering,” 
      commented Michael Chalhub, Palm Beach Capital Partner. “NRI represents a 
      unique opportunity for us to invest at an inflection point where such 
      innovative solutions are so well-timed within the energy, infrastructure 
      and composite industry.”
    

About Neptune Research & FloTex


      Founded in 1982 and headquartered in Riviera Beach, Florida, NRI has 
      been a premier provider of pre- and field-saturated composites that 
      restore, protect and reinforce pipes, pipelines and civil 
      infrastructures. NRI’s customer base includes companies in a wide 
      variety of industries, including construction, industrial, marine, 
      military, mining, municipalities, offshore, oil & gas distribution, oil 
      & gas transmission, and refining and petrochemical. NRI’s proprietary 
      products are made with moisture-curable and epoxy based carbon fiber, 
      fiberglass, Kevlar® and other aramid composite materials. For more 
      information, please visit the Company’s website at www.neptuneresearch.com.

Palm Beach Capital Announces Investment in The Midas Companies






June 07, 2017 08:23 PM Eastern Daylight Time



WEST PALM BEACH, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Palm Beach Capital Fund IV, L.P., through one of its investment 
      entities, today announced that it has made an investment in Midas 
      Utilities, LLC, Midas Flow Controls Mid-Atlantic, LLC and T.V. 
      Diversified, LLC (collectively “Midas” or “Company”), a seamlessly 
      integrated group of companies that provide a comprehensive range of 
      trenchless infrastructure rehabilitation services. Financial terms were 
      not disclosed.
    


      For more than 45 years, Midas has been family owned and operated by the 
      Ventresca family, serving the Mid-Atlantic region through a 
      comprehensive portfolio of rehabilitation services and products for 
      critical water, wastewater and industrial pipe infrastructure. In that 
      time, Midas has grown to one of the premiere full-scale infrastructure 
      solutions providers in the northeastern United States with more than 160 
      employees and offices in Maryland and Florida. Midas offers a seamlessly 
      integrated suite of specialty services designed to address all unique 
      sewer, water and utilities infrastructure needs, encompassing trenchless 
      solutions, flow control and utility (traditional dig) for complete 
      turnkey solutions. The Company currently provides services in nine 
      states with headquarters in Capitol Heights, Maryland.
    

      “We are very excited about partnering with Palm Beach Capital. PBC will 
      provide Midas the capital and access to strategic resources the Company 
      needs to leverage our four decades of experience and geographically 
      expand our trenchless infrastructure services,” stated David Ventresca.
    

      Over decades of organic and acquisitive growth, Midas’s services have 
      expanded to include pipe bursting, manhole rehabilitation services, 
      bypass pumping services, CCTV, lift station repairs, excavation and a 
      number of ancillary services. The Company’s trenchless solutions offer a 
      series of technology-driven processes that address infrastructure 
      rehabilitation and repair concerns without requiring conventional 
      excavation. Midas’s solutions provide several advantages for 
      environmentally sensitive and difficult-to-access areas that would incur 
      significant costs or damage by traditional digging.
    

      “We are excited to partner with the entire Midas team and to provide 
      them with the necessary growth capital to add additional resources and 
      equipment to expand their capabilities and geographic footprint,” 
      commented Michael Chalhub, Palm Beach Capital Partner and Chief 
      Operations Officer. “By numerous accounts, there is more than $1 
      trillion that needs to be spent in the U.S. to upgrade the vast, aging 
      water infrastructure system of mostly underground pipes; and we hope to 
      further position Midas as a leading provider to municipalities and 
      industrial clients for years to come.”
    

About The Midas Companies


      Founded in 1972 and headquartered in Capitol Heights, Maryland, Midas 
      offers a comprehensive portfolio of rehabilitation services and products 
      for critical water, wastewater and industrial pipe infrastructure

      suite of specialty services encompasses trenchless solutions, flow 
      control and utility (traditional dig) for complete turnkey solutions.

Palm Beach Capital Announces Investment in The Midas Companies
Tweet


Print



      Palm Beach Capital Fund IV, L.P., through one of its investment 
      entities, today announced that it has made an investment in Midas 
      Utilities, LLC, Midas Flow Controls Mid-Atlantic, LLC and T.V. 
      Diversified, LLC (collectively “Midas” or “Company”), a seamlessly 
      integrated group of companies that provide a comprehensive range of 
      trenchless infrastructure rehabilitation services. Financial terms were 
      not disclosed.
    

      For more than 45 years, Midas has been family owned and operated by the 
      Ventresca family, serving the Mid-Atlantic region through a 
      comprehensive portfolio of rehabilitation services and products for 
      critical water, wastewater and industrial pipe infrastructure. In that 
      time, Midas has grown to one of the premiere full-scale infrastructure 
      solutions providers in the northeastern United States with more than 160 
      employees and offices in Maryland and Florida. Midas offers a seamlessly 
      integrated suite of specialty services designed to address all unique 
      sewer, water and utilities infrastructure needs, encompassing trenchless 
      solutions, flow control and utility (traditional dig) for complete 
      turnkey solutions. The Company currently provides services in nine 
      states with headquarters in Capitol Heights, Maryland.
    

      “We are very excited about partnering with Palm Beach Capital. PBC will 
      provide Midas the capital and access to strategic resources the Company 
      needs to leverage our four decades of experience and geographically 
      expand our trenchless infrastructure services,” stated David Ventresca.
    

      Over decades of organic and acquisitive growth, Midas’s services have 
      expanded to include pipe bursting, manhole rehabilitation services, 
      bypass pumping services, CCTV, lift station repairs, excavation and a 
      number of ancillary services. The Company’s trenchless solutions offer a 
      series of technology-driven processes that address infrastructure 
      rehabilitation and repair concerns without requiring conventional 
      excavation. Midas’s solutions provide several advantages for 
      environmentally sensitive and difficult-to-access areas that would incur 
      significant costs or damage by traditional digging.
    

      “We are excited to partner with the entire Midas team and to provide 
      them with the necessary growth capital to add additional resources and 
      equipment to expand their capabilities and geographic footprint,” 
      commented Michael Chalhub, Palm Beach Capital Partner and Chief 
      Operations Officer. “By numerous accounts, there is more than $1 
      trillion that needs to be spent in the U.S. to upgrade the vast, aging 
      water infrastructure system of mostly underground pipes; and we hope to 
      further position Midas as a leading provider to municipalities and 
      industrial clients for years to come.”
    

About The Midas Companies


      Founded in 1972 and headquartered in Capitol Heights, Maryland, Midas

      suite of specialty services encompasses trenchless solutions, flow 
      control and utility (traditional dig) for complete turnkey solutions.
