John J. Toffey


1931 - 2017
Obituary
Condolences

































 John James Toffey, IV died April 1, 2017 in Canaan, CT where he had lived since 2015.A long-time resident of Great Barrington, MA, John was born May 24, 1931 in Brooklyn, NY to Helen Howard and John James Toffey, III. His father's military service had the family moving frequently, but his roots were firmly in Columbus and Cincinnati, Ohio, where he developed a lifelong passion for Cincinnati Reds baseball and Ohio State football. John attended the Columbus Academy, where he eventually taught, and Phillips Exeter Academy. After Army service in Korea, he graduated from The Ohio State University and received a master's in English from Columbia University.His long academic career began at The Kent School in 1958 where he taught English and coached baseball and football. In Kent he met and married Irene Tobin; they and their four children eventually settled in Great Barrington, MA, where John taught at Simon's Rock Early College. In 1975 he joined Berkshire School and taught English and served in various administrative and coaching capacities until his retirement in 1995.During a trip to Scotland John became fascinated by Scottish history, particularly the 18th century and the Edinburgh Enlightenment. A sabbatical fellowship in 1992 took him to St. Andrews University, where he delved deeply into "the intersection of the romantic and the rational," which led to his first book, A Woman Nobly Planned: Fact and Myth in the Legacy of Flora MacDonald.In 1996 John discovered a cache of letters from his father, Jack, to his family back at home during World War II. They were written when Jack was a Lieutenant Colonel serving with the Allied Forces in North Africa and Italy. Inspired, John began meticulously researching his father's time oversees tracking down and interviewing people who had served with his father, and working with historians who knew of and had written about him. The product was his second book: Jack Toffey's War: A Son's Memoir, a personal look at the war from the home front and the lines of battle. Telling this story was John's passion.In retirement he and Irene traveled extensively with a particular fondness for the British Isles and Italy. Most important, they treasured spending time with their 13 grandchildren in Kentucky, Cape Cod, Weston, MA and northwest Connecticut. They happily attended countless graduations, school concerts and sporting events of all kinds.In addition to having an encyclopedic knowledge of baseball and brilliant sense of humor, John loved language, music, and tradition. He kept up his teaching to the very end, offering literature classes on Shakespeare, the Civil War and - most recently - Moby Dick, perhaps his favorite work of all time.John was predeceased by his beloved Irene. He leaves his children, Hannah (Cameron Peters), John, (Deb), Joseph, and Edward (Katie). He leaves 13 grandchildren who adored him: John, Molly, Claire, Sam, and Will Toffey; Matthew, Megan, Daniel, and Annie Toffey; Connor Toffey; and Caroline, Chloe and Dexter Peters; two great-grandchildren: John James Toffey VII and Finley Irene Stone; sisters Anne Cushman and Barbara Bonner, dear friend Sally Brooke, as well as many nieces, nephews, brothers and sisters-in-law, and many inspired students.SERVICES: Calling hours will be at the Newkirk-Palmer Funeral Home, 118 Main Street, Canaan, CT on Monday, April 10 from 6 - 8 pm. A funeral service will be at the Kent School Chapel in Kent, CT on Tuesday, April 11 at 11:00 a.m. Burial to follow immediately in Kent School Cemetery.In lieu of flowers, contributions in John's memory can be made to Geer Village Senior Living or Housatonic Valley Regional High School Athletics.

Publisher's Description▼▲
Want to know more about the history of the Christian church?   The Learn Church History Pack offers a unique contextual view of how the Christian church spread and developed over the last 2,000 years. It did so, not in a vacuum, but in a setting of times, cultures, and events that both influenced and were influenced by the church. The pack contains Church History, Volume One by Everett Ferguson and Church History, Volume Two by John D. Woodbridge, and Frank A. James III.   Volume One explores the development of the church from the days of Jesus to the years prior to the Reformation. Filled with maps, charts, and illustrations, it offers overviews of the Roman, Greek, and Jewish worlds; insights into the churchs relationship to the Roman Empire, with glimpses into pagan attitudes toward Christians; the place of art and architecture, literature and philosophy, both sacred and secular; and much more, spanning the time from the first through the thirteenth centuries.   Volume Two shows how the church developed from the just prior to the Reformation and through the next five-hundred-plus years into the present-day. Filled with maps, charts, and illustrations, it gives primary attention to the history of Christianity in the West (western Europe and North America), but given the global and ecumenical environment of the twenty-first century, it also covers Africa, Eastern Europe, Asia, and Latin America.   The Learn Church History Pack offers readers the opportunity to learn about the history and development of the Christian church from the time of Christ up until the present day. It is a valuable resource for students, pastors, ministry leaders, and interested lay people who want to better understand that last 2,000 years of church history.

Overview



Creative Realities, Inc. is a Minnesota corporation that provides innovative
digital marketing technology solutions to retailers, brand marketers,
venue-operators, enterprises, non-profits and other organizations throughout the
United States and a growing number of international markets. Our technology and
solutions include: digital merchandising systems, interactive digital shopping
assistants and kiosks, mobile digital marketing platforms, digital way-finding
platforms, digital menu board systems, dynamic signage, and other digital
marketing technologies. We enable our clients' engagement with consumers by
using combinations of our technology and solutions that interact with mobile,
social media, point-of-sale, wireless networks and web-based platforms. We have
expertise in a broad range of existing and emerging digital marketing
technologies, as well as the following related aspects of our business: content,
network management, and connected device software and firmware platforms;
customized software service layers; hardware platforms; digital media workflows;
and proprietary processes and automation tools. We believe we are one of the
world's leading digital marketing technology companies focused on helping
retailers and brands use the latest technologies to create better shopping
experiences.



Our main operations are conducted directly through Creative Realities, Inc. and
under our wholly owned subsidiaries Creative Realities, LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company, Wireless Ronin Technologies Canada, Inc., a Canadian
corporation, and ConeXus World Global, LLC, a Kentucky limited liability
company.




We generate revenue in this business by:



       ?   consulting with our customers to determine the technologies and
           solutions required to achieve their specific goals, strategies and
           objectives;




       ?   designing our customers' digital marketing experiences, content and
           interfaces;




       ?   engineering the systems architecture delivering the digital marketing
           experiences we design - both software and hardware - and
integrating
           those systems into a customized, reliable and effective digital
           marketing experience;




       ?   managing the efficient, timely and cost-effective deployment of our
           digital marketing technology solutions for our customers;




       ?   delivering and updating the content of our digital marketing technology
           solutions using a suite of advanced media, content and network
           management software products; and




       ?   maintaining our customers' digital marketing technology solutions by:

           providing content production and related services; creating 
additional
           software-based features and functionality; hosting the
solutions;
           monitoring solution service levels; and responding to and/or managing
           remote or onsite field service maintenance, troubleshooting and support
           calls.




                                 Page 22 of 31





These activities generate revenue through: bundled-solution sales; service fees
for consulting, experience design, content development and production, software
development, engineering, implementation, and field services; software license
fees; and maintenance and support services related to our software, managed
systems and solutions.



We currently market and sell our technology and solutions primarily through our
sales and business development personnel, but we also utilize agents, strategic
partners, and lead generators who provide us with access to additional sales,
business development and licensing opportunities.



Our expenses are primarily comprised of three categories: sales and marketing,
research and development, and general and administrative. Sales and marketing
expenses include salaries and benefits for our sales, business development
solution management and marketing personnel, and commissions paid on sales. This
category also includes amounts spent on marketing networking events, promotional
materials, hardware and software to prospective new customers, including those
expenses incurred in trade shows and product demonstrations, and other related
expenses. Our research and development expenses represent the salaries and
benefits of those individuals who develop and maintain our proprietary software
platforms and other software applications we design and sell to our customers.
Our general and administrative expenses consist of corporate overhead, including
administrative salaries, real property lease payments, salaries and benefits for
our corporate officers and other expenses such as legal and accounting fees.




Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates




The Company's significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 of the
Company's condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this
filing. The Company's condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States. Certain accounting policies involve significant judgments, assumptions,
and estimates by management that could have a material impact on the carrying
value of certain assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
results could differ from those estimates.



Results of Operations



Note: All dollar amounts reported in Results of Operations are in thousands,
except per-share information.

The tables presented below compare our results of operations from one period to
another, and present the results for each period and the change in those results
from one period to another in both dollars and percentage change.



For the three months ended September 30, 2015, the financial results of ConeXus
are not included as the acquisition date was October 15, 2015. As a result of
this merger, the results of operations may not be entirely comparable and the
variances are explained in more detail in the analysis below.

 Sales



Sales decreased by $661 or 20% in 2016 compared to 2015. During 2015, the
Company made a significant realignment and reorganization of its sales, account
management, and business development personnel, which resulted in a
significantly reduced sales pipeline. The Company terminated a customer
relationship in August 2015 in connection with this initiative. This decrease
was offset by approximately $1.6 million of additional revenue from ConeXus,
which we merged with on October 15, 2015.



Gross Profit



Gross profit margin on a percentage basis increased to 49% in 2016 from 45% in
2015, and decreased by $190 in absolute dollars during the same period. The
increase in gross profit margin is the result of our acquisition of ConeXus, the
improved mix of higher margin services, a reduction of traditionally lower
margin hardware sales as a percentage of total sales, as well the winding down,
termination or renewal of certain customer relationships with modified business
terms as a result of our business realignment, integration and restructuring
initiative.



Sales and Marketing Expenses



Sales and marketing expenses generally include the salaries, taxes, and benefits
of our sales and marketing personnel, as well as trade show activities, travel,
and other related sales and marketing costs. Total sales and marketing expenses
on increased 13% to $280 in 2016 from $247 in 2015. The increase is primarily
due to an increase in payroll and related trade show expenses.



                                 Page 24 of 31





Research and Development Expenses
Research and development expenses increased to $218 in 2016 compared to $25 in
2015. The increase is attributable to the payroll related expenses of our
software development personnel and consultants responsible for maintaining,
supporting and enhancing our proprietary content management system platforms.
General and Administrative Expenses
Total general and administrative expenses increased 6% or $83 to $1,562 in 2016
from $1,479 in 2015. The increases were primarily due to an increase in related
information technology infrastructure costs and travel, offset by a decrease in
payroll expenses.



Depreciation and Amortization Expenses




Depreciation and amortization expenses increased 23% to $540 in 2016 from $439
in 2015 primarily due to the amortization of intangible assets acquired in
the
ConeXus merger transaction.



Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30,
2015




The tables presented below compare our results of operations from one period to
another, and present the results for each period and the change in those results
from one period to another in both dollars and percentage change.



For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the financial results of ConeXus
are not included as the acquisition date was October 15, 2015. As a result of
this merger, the results of operations may not be entirely comparable and the
variances are explained in more detail in the analysis below.

       ?   The first two data columns in each table show the dollar results for
           each period presented




       ?   The columns entitled "Change - Dollars" and "Change - %" show the
           change in results, both in dollars and percentages. For example, when
           net sales increase from one period to the next that change is shown as
           a positive. When net sales decrease from one period to the next, that
           change is shown as a negative in both columns.

NM - not meaningful



 Sales



Sales decreased by $25 or 0.3% in 2016 compared to 2015. During 2015, the
Company made significant realignment and reorganization of its sales, account
management, and business development personnel, which resulted in a
significantly reduced sales pipeline. The Company terminated a customer
relationship in August 2015 in connection with this initiative. This decrease
was offset by approximately $4.8 million of additional revenue from ConeXus,
which we merged with on October 15, 2015.



Gross Profit



Gross profit margin on a percentage basis increased to 51% in 2016 from 32% in
2015, and increased by $1,536 in absolute dollars during the same period. The
increase in gross profit margin and increase in absolute dollars are the result
of our acquisition of ConeXus, the improved mix of higher margin services, a
reduction of traditionally lower margin hardware sales as a percentage of total
sales, as well the winding down, termination or renewal of certain customer
relationships with modified business terms as a result of our business
realignment, integration and restructuring initiative.



Sales and Marketing Expenses



Sales and marketing expenses generally include the salaries, taxes, and benefits
of our sales and marketing personnel, as well as trade show activities, travel,
and other related sales and marketing costs. Total sales and marketing expenses
decreased 18% to $753 in 2016 from $921 in 2015. The decrease is primarily due
to a decrease in marketing and related trade show expenses.



                                 Page 26 of 31





Research and Development Expenses
Research and development expenses increased to $736 in 2016 compared to $510 in
2015. The increase is attributable to the payroll related expenses of our
software development personnel and consultants responsible for maintaining,
supporting and enhancing our proprietary content management system platforms.
General and Administrative Expenses
Total general and administrative expenses decreased 12% or $(646) to $4,751 in
2016 from $5,397 in 2015. The decreases were primarily due to a decrease in
payroll of $476 as the company recorded severance to a former executive of
$464
in the second quarter 2015.



Depreciation and Amortization Expenses
Depreciation and amortization expenses increased 25% to $1,614 in 2016 from
$1,296 in 2015 primarily due to the amortization of intangible assets acquired
in the ConeXus merger transaction.
Liquidity and Capital Resources




We incurred net losses and negative cash flows from operating activities for the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. At September 30, 2016, we had
cash and cash equivalents of $976 and a working capital deficit of $(8,420).
Cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016
was $3,738. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue
as a going concern. Management believes that, despite our losses to date and
while we can provide no assurance that our ongoing integration efforts will be
successful, the operations of the combined Company resulting from the completed
acquisitions and related restructuring actions will provide greater sales,
margin, scale and operating efficiencies, all of which we believe will
ultimately lead to operating profitability and positive cash flows from
operations. Additionally, the Company has entered into a Loan and Security
Agreement in August 2016 to raise additional financing which has lowered and
will continue to reduce our interest expense in the future.




See Note 8 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion
of the Company's debt obligations.



Operating Activities



We do not currently generate positive cash flow. Our operational costs have been
greater than sales generated to date. As of September 30, 2016, we had an
accumulated deficit of $(18,497). The cash flow used in operating activities was
$(3,738) and (1,953) for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively. The majority of the cash consumed by operations for both periods
was attributed to our net losses of $(3,883) and $(5,915) for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Included in our net losses were
non-cash charges totaling $1,884 and $1,415 for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.



Investing Activities



Net cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30,
2016 was $(314) compared to $(585) during 2015. The increase in cash used in
investing activities is primarily related to the capitalization of software
costs. We currently do not have any material commitments for capital
expenditures as of September 30, 2016, nor do we anticipate any significant
expenditures in 2016.



Financing Activities



Net cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September
30, 2016 was $3,667 compared to $2,229 in 2015. The decrease was primarily
related to less loans payable.



Contractual Obligations



We have no material commitments for capital expenditures, and we do not
anticipate any significant capital expenditures for the remainder of 2016.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we did not engage in any
off-balance sheet arrangements set forth in Item 303(a) (4) of Regulation S-K.
