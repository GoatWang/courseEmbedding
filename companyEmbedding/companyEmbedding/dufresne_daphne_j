BETHESDA, Md., June 10, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Daphne Dufresne, Managing Director and founding partner of RLJ Equity Partners, today announced she will leave the firm to pursue smaller, higher growth companies which are outside of the investment scope of RLJ Equity Partners.  Dufresne will serve as a Special Advisor to the firm.


Rufus Rivers, RLJ Equity Partners' Managing Partner stated, "I am deeply saddened that my partner for the last 10 years, and one of the founders of RLJ Equity Partners, has decided to leave the firm to pursue her passion to invest in small, high growth companies.  While I'm sad, I'm also excited for Daphne and I look forward to working with her in her new role as a Special Advisor to the firm which will allow us to continue to work on deals together.  Daphne is extremely bright and I wish her nothing but success in her new endeavors."     
Daphne Dufresne stated, "In 2006, I had the honor of partnering with one of the country's most successful businessmen, Robert L. Johnson, to establish RLJ Equity Partners and it has been an incredible journey.  We built an amazing investment team and we backed an outstanding group of 12 companies in RLJ Equity Fund I.  I found particular satisfaction working with the teams at Fleischmann's Vinegar, Media Source, LAI, and J&J Africa.  My partners Rufus Rivers, Jerry Johnson, Kelvin Walker, and the entire RLJ Equity Partners team have been a pleasure to work with and I know Fund II will be a great investment for our limited partners.  At this point in my career, I am seeking the flexibility to pursue smaller, higher growth companies and I look forwarding to maintaining a relationship with the firm as a Special Advisor."
Robert L. Johnson, RLJ Equity Partners' Chairman stated, "Daphne, for the past 10 years, has made a fantastic contribution to the growth and development of RLJ Equity Partners.  Her knowledge of the mid-market private equity business and her unique ability to source deals that generated high returns has been exemplary. I am confident that she will carry that same leadership and execution skill to her next opportunity and I want to wish her the very best of success."
Dufresne joined RLJ Equity Partners from Parish Capital Advisors, where she was a Venture Partner managing the direct investment and co-investment program. Formerly, Dufresne was a Principal at Weston Presidio Capital, a private equity organization with $3.4 billion of assets under management and also served as Associate Director in the Bank of Scotland's Structured Finance Group.
About RLJ Equity Partners RLJ Equity Partners is a middle-market private equity firm focused on generating long-term capital appreciation by investing in profitable and growing businesses led by strong management teams. Founded in 2006, RLJ originates structures and invests in traditional buy-outs, recapitalizations, and growth capital infusions.
