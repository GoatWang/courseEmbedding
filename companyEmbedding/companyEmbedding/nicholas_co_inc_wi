Why Nicholas Company
Nicholas Company is an independently owned investment firm that has operated under the same investment philosophy, process and management since its founding by Albert, “Ab”, O. Nicholas in 1967. Our philosophy is based on a fundamental, bottom-up approach to security selection with a long-term investment horizon.  Our process focuses on identifying securities offering secular growth characteristics, strong financial bases, reasonable valuations and downside risk. Our long-term approach deemphasizes the short-term impact of day-to-day market volatility and maintains a focus on the long-term potential of the securities in our portfolios. Providing a more consistent return with reduced volatility encourages investors to maintain market exposure and stay invested for the long run. The Nicholas investment style tends to appeal to investors willing to forego some upside in market cycles for a more consistent return with the potential for less downside risk. 
Invest with Nicholas Funds
Nicholas Funds offer six investment strategies that are open to investors on a direct basis, via a brokerage platform or through their financial adviser. We offer four equity strategies, a high yield corporate fund and a money market fund. A key objective for Nicholas Funds is to keep expense ratios low in an effort to return as much of the investment performance back to the shareholders. To accommodate the different methods investors choose to invest in mutual funds, Nicholas offers both Institutional Shares (“I Shares”) as well as “N Shares” for a select group of our Funds. The N Shares offers a 12b-1 and servicing fee for platforms, retirement plans and financial advisers.

Nicholas / Nicholas Funds / Nicholas Fund, Inc.






Nicholas Fund, Inc.


NICSX
Multi-cap Growth
Nicholas Fund, Inc. is our flagship fund with its long history beginning in 1969. The lead portfolio manager is David O. Nicholas, CFA with Michael L. Shelton serving as co-portfolio manager. Nicholas Fund was launched two years after Albert “Ab” O. Nicholas started Nicholas Company, Inc. Nicholas Fund utilizes a multi-cap growth strategy that allows the portfolio manager to pursue the best growth opportunities in the market without being constrained by arbitrary market capitalization guidelines. Nicholas Fund is generally focused on mid and larger capitalized stocks, but will invest in smaller companies where the investment team finds opportunity.

While the entire market spectrum is a target universe for this strategy, Nicholas Company has long had a primary focus on stocks with mid and small capitalizations. Early on we recognized the potential for these smaller sized companies to offer greater growth potential than larger cap stocks, and greater opportunity to identify companies that Wall Street may have overlooked. The Fund will invest in larger cap stocks that we believe may have fallen out of favor with Wall Street, offer significant valuation or growth opportunities and may lend stability to the portfolio with their consistent growth. Nicholas Fund offers a mix of companies with varying capitalizations, and the mix can change as stock valuations change. A critical component to the Fund’s style is buying stocks at valuations that offer the best opportunity over the long-run and that we believe may provide a margin of safety against declining stock prices. Nicholas has long been a proponent for buying stocks at valuations that are affordable relative to their long-term potential and owning them for the long-term… years, not days or months. We believe the Fund’s history suggests this approach can produce more consistent, risk-adjusted returns over time.

Investment Objective
Nicholas Fund, Inc. strives to increase the value of your investment over the long-term (“long-term growth”) by investing in a diversified portfolio that includes primarily medium- and large-sized companies. Small companies also may be considered. Our goal is to find what we believe are great companies and hold them for the long-term.
Investment Policies & Considerations
Nicholas Fund’s management team believes that company selection is a key to providing superior returns over time. Our goal is to find growth companies that are reasonably priced by identifying stocks that have low price-to-earnings ratios relative to their earnings growth or those that are attractively priced relative to book value. Above average earnings growth and strong future growth potential are important characteristics in the companies we consider. When selecting portfolio holdings, from among the stocks that meet our criteria, we often take a contrary view and choose lesser known or out-of-favor companies as they generally offer the best values. Some of the factors we consider in assessing companies include:

Growth rate of 10% or better
Consistent earnings
Return on equity (ROE) of 15% or an improving ROE
Debt to total capitalization of less than 50%
A price to earnings ratio lower than two times the growth rate
An enduring franchise or brand
Honest, capable management
Significant management ownership of stock
Long-term and short-term business momentum


It is our strong conviction that superior long-term results are achieved by minimizing capital losses in adverse markets. We do not attempt to forecast short-term market swings, but work to preserve gains and minimize losses using long-term, fundamental valuation techniques. Our portfolio turnover is moderate as our goal is to find, and hold, great companies. However, if a company’s stock is not meeting our expectations, or has become over valued, we will sell it.
At Nicholas, our watchword is patience. We believe it is a key to superior long-term results.

What are analysts saying about Abbott Laboratories stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Abbott Laboratories stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "For the majority of last one month, Abbott is trading above the broader Medical Products industry. We are optimistic about the company’s strong and consistent EPD and Medical Devices performance in the last reported first quarter. Overall, the company stands to benefit from the ongoing integration and synergy achievement of St. Jude. We are also looking forward to the company’s plans to focus on selling portfolio in core therapeutic areas. Recently, Abbott received CE mark for its TactiCath Sensor and Confirm Rx ICM products which is quite encouraging. The company also launched science-based nutrition drinks for better recovery from surgeries. On the flip side, Abbott’s sluggish pediatric business in China continues to hamper growth. Management is also concerned about the on-going economic problem in Venezuela that is expected to remain unresolved in the coming quarters." (6/21/2017)
2. Jefferies Group LLC analysts commented, "Investment summary: We are reiterating our Overweight rating for CORI and we are raising our PT by $2 to $12 following the positive donepezil patch bioequivalence results. Progress in the development of a proprietary pipeline is key, in our opinion, to the performance of the shares. Successful development of patch formulations of donepezil (Aricept) and/or memantine (Namenda) should position the company well to more-effectively monetize the transdermal drug delivery platform, in our opinion. Retention of meaningful commercialization rights could enable the company to turn the corner and pursue other opportunities more broadly, in our opinion. Corplex donepezil pilot study shows bioequivalence. Management reported that the Corplex donepezil pilot study met the FDA statistical criteria for bioequivalence. We note, too, that the patch was well-tolerated, with good skin and GI tolerability." (5/12/2017)

Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or loses arising from any use of this information. For each fund with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating ™ (based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund’s monthly performance, including the effects of sales charges, loads, and redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. (Each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages.) One cannot invest directly in an index. Fund holdings and/or sector weightings are subject to change at any time and are not recommendations to buy or sell any security. 
Past performance does not guarantee future results.
 
Investment Objective 

Nicholas High Income Fund, Inc. seeks to provide high levels of current income by investing in a diversified portfolio that includes primarily high yield bonds. Its secondary objective is capital appreciation. The Fund may invest in securities of any credit quality, as well as unrated securities.
Investment Policies & Considerations
We seek to add value by capitalizing on our ability to identify undervalued companies with outstanding growth potential. Our in-depth credit analysis considers each issuer’s financial resources, sensitivity to economic trends and conditions, operating history, management, and other factors. Our expertise in equity analysis enhances our bond assessments because high yield bonds and equity securities tend to respond to market fluctuation similarly.
We do not limit the maturities of the holdings in Nicholas High Income Fund, and the Fund may invest in both long- and short-term debt and equity securities.
Diversification does not assure a profit nor protect against loss in a declining market.

Industry experience: 33 years
Nicholas Company Tenure: 14 years
Portfolio Manager - Nicholas High Income Fund, Inc.
Larry Pavelec serves in a leadership position for Nicholas Company as the Chief Operating Officer and head of product distribution.  This position involves collaborating with the other senior members of the Management Committee on strategic initiatives for the Company.  He also serves as an analyst and client portfolio manager for the separately managed account equity portfolios and manager for the Nicholas High Income Fund, a high yield corporate bond fund.

As portfolio manager for the high yield corporate fund, he employs a bottom-up, value approach philosophy that focuses on companies with sufficient earnings growth and adequate asset coverage to meet debt obligations. Nicholas High Income Fund is generally positioned with a short-to-intermediate maturity structure and securities that we believe tend to provide more stability during difficult markets, while generating a market level of income consistent with the high yield corporate sector.

Larry joined Nicholas Company in 2003, to serve as the portfolio manager for the Nicholas High Income Fund and lead the product distribution effort.  Larry's career as a credit analyst and portfolio manager began in 1984 with M&I Investment Management Corp., where he focused on investment-grade corporate bonds, asset-backed securities and mortgage-backed securities. Before joining Nicholas, he was with Brandes Investment Partners as the co-manager for Brandes Fixed Income Partners, serving as portfolio manager and head of marketing for the firm.

Larry earned his B.S. in Finance from the University of Wisconsin at La Crosse. He has served on various non-profit boards over the years including the Mequon-Thiensville Education Foundation and North Shore County Club.  He has earned the right to use the CFA designation and is a member of the CFA Society Milwaukee.

Nothing on this web site should be considered a solicitation to buy or an offer to sell shares of any Nicholas Fund in any jurisdiction where the offer or solicitation would be unlawful under the securities laws of such jurisdiction. 
Please refer to each prospectus for important information about each investment company, including investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. 
Mutual fund investing involves risk; principal loss is possible. Small- and medium-capitalization companies tend to have limited liquidity and greater price volatility than large-capitalization companies. Investments in debt securities typically decrease in value when interest rates rise. This risk is usually greater for longer-term debt securities. Investment by the Funds in lower-rated and non-rated securities presents a greater risk of loss to principal and interest than higher-rated securities. 
Past performance does not guarantee future results.
Diversification does not assure a profit nor protect against loss in a declining market.

Since 1967
Why Nicholas Company
Nicholas Company is an independently owned investment firm that has operated under the same investment philosophy, process and management since its founding by Albert, “Ab”, O. Nicholas in 1967. Our philosophy is based on a fundamental, bottom-up approach to security selection with a long-term investment horizon.  Our process focuses on identifying securities offering secular growth characteristics, strong financial bases, reasonable valuations and downside risk. Our long-term approach deemphasizes the short-term impact of day-to-day market volatility and maintains a focus on the long-term potential of the securities in our portfolios. Providing a more consistent return with reduced volatility encourages investors to maintain market exposure and stay invested for the long run. The Nicholas investment style tends to appeal to investors willing to forego some upside in market cycles for a more consistent return with the potential for less downside risk. 
Invest with Nicholas Funds
Nicholas Funds offer six investment strategies that are open to investors on a direct basis, via a brokerage platform or through their financial adviser. We offer four equity strategies, a high yield corporate fund and a money market fund. A key objective for Nicholas Funds is to keep expense ratios low in an effort to return as much of the investment performance back to the shareholders. To accommodate the different methods investors choose to invest in mutual funds, Nicholas offers both Institutional Shares (“I Shares”) as well as “N Shares” for a select group of our Funds. The N Shares offers a 12b-1 and servicing fee for platforms, retirement plans and financial advisers.

The Nicholas Funds are offered only to United States residents, and information on this site is intended only for such persons. Nothing on this web site should be considered a solicitation to buy or an offer to sell shares of any Nicholas Fund in any jurisdiction where the offer or solicitation would be unlawful under the securities laws of such jurisdiction. 
Please refer to each prospectus for important information about each investment company, including investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. 
Mutual fund investing involves risk; principal loss is possible. Small- and medium-capitalization companies tend to have limited liquidity and greater price volatility than large-capitalization companies. Investments in debt securities typically decrease in value when interest rates rise. This risk is usually greater for longer-term debt securities. Investment by the Funds in lower-rated and non-rated securities presents a greater risk of loss to principal and interest than higher-rated securities. 
Past performance does not guarantee future results.
Diversification does not assure a profit nor protect against loss in a declining market.
