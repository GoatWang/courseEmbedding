AFTERWARD TO THE JAPANESE EDITION 
by Hiroshi Mimura (translated from Japanese by Yoko Kawai)
This book is a Japanese translation of Preserving the Worldâs Great Cities: The Destruction and Renewal of the Historic Metropolis by Anthony M. Tung. The original version, which was published in 2001, is a large volume of 500 pages that took me a month to read. The bookâs theme is highly pertinent to modern society in Japan. It describes how people across the world strive to preserve the culture of their cities and gives us perspective in regard to our own conservation efforts. By the time I'd finished reading, I found the book both grand and beautiful.
Encounter with the Author
		    In the autumn of 1993, a fax came to me at the Residential Environment Division, Department of Architecture, Kyoto University, from Anthony M. Tung, with whom I was not acquainted. Mr. Tung was conducting research on the conservation of architectural culture in historic cities across the world. He was coming to Kyoto as part of his research and offered to give a talk about preservation in New York. About a month later, Mr. Tung arrived at Kyoto University with his wife Janet. I described the conservation problems of the city and offered some relevant materials in English. He gave us a lecture on how New York protects its landmarks. I learned that there were several shared principles with those we use in Japan such as providing legal protection for significant "individual monuments," whole "conservation districts," and extended "historic landscapes." It impressed me that even as a center of market-driven capitalism, New York had enacted a strong preservation policy, protecting about twenty thousand landmarks. Several years later, in the summer of 2001, a thick parcel was sent to me by Mr. Tung. I opened it and began to read.
There are many scholarly volumes on the preservation of culture and landscape in the world's historic cities. Yet, this book was uniquely exciting. Why? First, in depicting social conflicts between the destruction and preservation of the metropolis, the narrative is scripted like a drama. The more you read, the more you are drawn into its stories. Second, in an effort to serve the general reader, the author translates architectural and planning jargon into common words. This also helps those of us who are scholars to rediscover issues that have been buried in the complication of academic language. With this book, readers who have visited a particular city, and those who have not, can put themselves within the dynamic upheaval of urban growth. I also liked the fact that the book is not blinded by a bias toward Western theories of architecture and covers conditions in neighborhoods in Asian as well as in developing countries.
Deeply wishing that people in Japan might have access to this work, I started to create a Japanese-language version by contacting professionals who had been in the front lines of the struggle to save our country's heritage. Together, we formed a group called STOK (Sekai TOshi-hozen Kenkyukai, or research group for the preservation of the cities of the world) and started the translation. In September 2004, members of the research group visited the author at his loft in New York as part of a collaborative process.
On the Book's Style and Structure
		    This volume is not an academic text with references and footnotes. Neither is it a journal of travels for mere entertainment. It is a penetrating book for the thoughtful mind. It reveals the ebb and flow of ideas in the changing metropolisâa presentation made possible because the author visited all the cities discussed here, inspected their destruction in the field, talked with professionals in planning and preservation, and carefully studied the documentation gathered in these journeys. What is most unique about this book is its style; i.e. it tells the reader a âhistorical dramaâ in which destruction and preservation are set in competition. Important people and groups appear on stage for every period and place. They insist upon the legitimacy of obliteration, selective destruction, or conservation of the old cityscapeâare overwhelmed by the conflict, or produce significant solutions. They are gods, emperors, popes, dictators, investors, the oppressed, travelers, architects, citizens, and mayors. The variety of these characters fills the book with excitement. The stage for these dramas are eighteen of the most renowned cities in the world. All of the scenarios and scenes are based on the authorâs meticulous research.
At the beginning of many chapters, Mr. Tung quotes from Le Citta Invisibili, written by Italo Calvino in 1972. A renowned Italian author of the twentieth-century, in Le Citta Invisibili, Calvino writes of imaginary cities by adapting the story of Il Milione (The Travels of Marco Polo), in which the Italian explorer of the thirteenth-century describes numerous colorful urban places for the Emperor Kublai Khan, to whom Polo had become a favored liegeman. In the afterward of the Japanese version of Le Citta Invisibili, the translator, Ryofu Yonekawa, remarks: âPolo's imaginary cities seem to us at first to be absurd comedies and mysteries. Then, beneath their surface innocence, we see a deeper meaning, dark as the ocean, and causing us to shudder. We wander into an endless city, a city without form, a cursed city, a machine city: reminding us of the modern metropolis. Here, fantasies become allegories. This reversed utopia, i.e. a story of non-existing places, presents many meaningful ideas in regard to the urban culture of our modern world.â (Mienai-toshi, 2003, Kawade Shobo Publishing)
Le Citta Invisibili seems to be a favorite book of Mr. Tung. Has he imagined himself as a modern-day Marco Polo gathering stories for the people of New York? Perhaps for Kublai Khan? I believe he has adopted a technique of symbolic representation from the Italian author, showing us the underlying allegorical meaning of the contradiction and anxiety intrinsic to our modern attitudes and thinking. The cities which Mr. Tung visited are, of course, not imaginary ones, and he describes them realistically. Yet, when readers reach Section III, toward the end of the book, they will find that the protection of historic architecture and townscapes in our quickly-changing modern world is a matter of moral significance for the author. Looking through his eyes, we perceive the current condition of preservation as but a phase in the evolving history of urban planning ethics and ideology. What constitutes destruction? What constitutes preservation? I realize that we are still at sea and am keenly aware that we will not attain a fruitful vision for the future without first seeking a virtuous ethic for the practice of architecture and the conservation of our cities.
Challenges in Conserving Cities
			  Thanks to world-wide efforts in the mid-twentieth century, the value of conserving architectural culture and urban heritage has finally started to be recognized. However, the theories and technology of preservation are still developing. How might we respond to critics that assert the usefulness of creation made possible by destruction? To whom do cultural properties and urban landscape belong? How may we save an urban landscape constituted of many small parts and owned by many different peopleâsome in the private sector, some in the public sector? Who should make such decisions on behalf of society? 
As a technical preservation matter, what is the proper approach when regulating permanent structures made of masonry, as compared to less durable buildings made of wood? How do we evaluate highly-renovated structures that may be consistent with the form of original buildings, but are largely made of new materials? How do we reconcile the different way that cultural value is perceived from within a society with how it is admired from without? Is it possible to define meaningful preservation policy in the midst of wars, oppressions, and revolutions? How do we expand the domain of preservation from individual buildings to large parts of the historic metropolis? Can the city be a museum of its history? Can it sustain social progress even in those parts largely composed of antiquated buildings? With our myriad differences of opinion, how might we all work together? The problems are hard and numerous. 
			This journey of this book will not only shed light on such challenges to the changing historic cities of the twenty-first century, but also allows us the joy of drawing beneficial lessons from a well-spring of allegories. To readers who never been to these places, here is an eye with which to see them keenly.

âItâs amazing! Literally, from the basement of my original Marc Anthony Salon came a line of professional hair products so renowned that they can now be found internationally. Marc Anthony products began because we wanted to ensure that all of our clients kept their salon-fresh look wherever they went. Our products are ultimately tailored to our clientsâ needs. From curly hair products to create curly hair styles and frizz control, to hair thickening products to create high volume and hold, we have the right product for Your Hair, Your Way.â
âFor a cut to sit well, hair has to be in great shape. Hair needs to move, be manageable and have shine to look amazing. Thatâs why Marc Anthony products have the highest caliber ingredients.â


âOn top of working with some of the topmost chemists, our largest point of difference is how we test the products. Our salons are where each product passes or fails. Our International Team of celebrity hair stylists put each product through its paces. We stand behind our brands because we use them in our salons each and every day. Thatâs the Marc Anthony True Professional difference.â

- Marc Anthony

Whether you pushed the "snooze" button one too many times on your alarm and slept in or are hurrying to save time in the locker room or before a night out, dry shampoo is your solution!  Often times, when beating the clock, shampooing hair in the traditional method is just not an option.  A dry shampoo and the ease of use is a great suitable alternative solution.  Modern, busy women swear by dry shampoos!  When your hair appears greasy, itâs usually just the roots (close to the scalp) that need to be refreshed.  Dry shampoos work wonders at reviving your day-old style, soaking up oil, masking odours and amping up volumeâno water required.  If youâre strapped for time and donât have time to wash your hair and you need to freshen up your locks dry shampoo serves as a fantastic solution.  Grab Marc Anthonyâs dry shampoo and fake your way to a perfectly washed hair day!
