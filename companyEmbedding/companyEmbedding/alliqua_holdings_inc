(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes above.  Forward-Looking Statements  This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains "forward-looking statements," which include information relating to future events, future financial performance, strategies, expectations, competitive environment and regulation. Words such as "may," "should," "could," "would," "predict," "potential," "continue," "expect," "anticipate," "future," "intend," "plan," "believe," "estimate," and similar expressions, as well as statements in future tense, identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements should not be read as a guarantee of future performance or results and may not be accurate indications of when such performance or results will actually be achieved. Forward-looking statements are based on information we have when those statements are made or our management's good faith belief as of that time with respect to future events, and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual performance or results to differ materially from those expressed in or suggested by the forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause such differences include, but are not limited to:  ? inadequate capital;  ? the uncertainty regarding the adequacy of our liquidity to pursue our complete business objectives;  ? our ability to obtain reimbursement from third party payers for our products;  ? our ability to achieve and maintain minimum sales requirements under our license agreements;  ? our ability to obtain and maintain regulatory approval of our existing products and any future products we may develop;  ? our ability to cure or obtain forbearance or waivers for existing covenant defaults under our outstanding indebtedness and to remain in compliance with our debt covenants;  ? market acceptance of our existing and future products;  ? loss or retirement of key executives;  ? our plans to make significant additional outlays of working capital before we expect to generate significant revenues and the uncertainty regarding when we will begin to generate significant revenues, if we are able to do so;  ? an unfavorable decision on product reimbursement;  ? adverse economic conditions and/or intense competition;  ? loss of a key customer or supplier;  ? entry of new competitors and products;  ? adverse federal, state and local government regulation;  ? technological obsolescence of our products;  ? technical problems with our research and products;  ? risks of mergers and acquisitions including the time and cost of implementing transactions and the potential failure to achieve expected gains, revenue growth or expense savings;  ? price increases for supplies and components; and  ? the inability to carry out research, development and commercialization plans.  For a discussion of these and other risks that relate to our business and investing in shares of our common stock, you should carefully review the risks and uncertainties described under the heading "Part I - Item 1A. Risk Factors" and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our Annual Report on form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. The forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement. We do not undertake any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which any such statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.  Overview  We are a regenerative technologies company that commercializes differentiated regenerative medical products which assist the body in the repair of human tissue.  Our commercial wound care portfolio currently consists of three product categories: wound bed preparation and stimulation, human biologics and antimicrobial protection. We currently market MIST(R) Ultrasound Healing Therapy, which uses painless, noncontact low-frequency ultrasound to stimulate cells below the wound bed to promote the healing process, Biovance(R) and Interfyl(TM) Human Connective Tissue Matrix, which are human biologic regenerative technologies, and TheraBond 3D(R), which is advanced dressing incorporating its proprietary TheraBond 3D(R) Antimicrobial Barrier Systems technology. We seek to broaden this product portfolio by identifying, acquiring and integrating technologies and products that enhance our product portfolio while diversifying our customer base and growing our sales footprint.  Recent Events  Senior Secured Term Loan Facility  As of September 30, 2016, we were in default of a covenant pertaining to trailing twelve-month revenue under our credit agreement as a result of our failure to achieve $22,250,000 of gross revenue for the twelve-month period ended September 30, 2016. As of September 30, 2016, we had an outstanding principal amount of approximately $13.8 million under this credit agreement. Under an agreement dated November 1, 2016, the lender agreed to forbear from exercising any rights and remedies related to the default until November 30, 2016, but has reserved the rights, commencing November 30, 2016, to pursue any rights and remedies available to it, including, but not limited to, declaring all or any portion of the outstanding principal amount to be immediately due and payable, imposing a default rate of interest as specified in the credit agreement, or pursing the lender's rights and remedies as a secured party under the UCC as a secured lender. In addition, the lender has a lien on substantially all of our assets and, as a result of the default, may seek to foreclose on some or substantially all of our assets after the expiration of the forbearance We are in negotiations with other financing parties to refinance this debt. However, no assurance can be given that we will be able to obtain additional debt to refinance our existing obligations on commercially reasonable terms or at all.  Acquisition  Consistent with our strategy of expanding our product portfolio of regenerative technologies, on October 5, 2016, we entered into a Contribution Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Contribution and Merger Agreement") with Alliqua Holdings, Inc., our wholly owned subsidiary ("New Alliqua"), Chesapeake Merger Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of New Alliqua ("Merger Sub"), and Soluble Systems, LLC ("Soluble"), pursuant to which, among other things, we will reorganize into a new holding company by merging Merger Sub with and into us, with us surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of New Alliqua. In addition, following the effective time of the merger, Soluble will contribute substantially all of its assets to New Alliqua, and New Alliqua will assume or payoff certain liabilities of Soluble, in exchange for certain consideration.  In the merger, (i) each outstanding share of our common stock, par value $0.001 per share, will automatically be converted into one share of New Alliqua's common stock, par value $0.001 per share, (ii) each of our outstanding options, restricted shares and restricted or phantom stock units will continue to vest or accelerate and will automatically be converted from a right to acquire our common stock to a right to acquire New Alliqua common stock on the same terms and (iii) each outstanding warrant will be converted into a right to acquire New Alliqua common stock on the same terms.  Subject to the terms and conditions of the Contribution and Merger Agreement, as part of the consideration for the asset contribution, Soluble will receive (i) newly issued shares of New Alliqua common stock representing approximately 37% of the total number of shares of issued and outstanding New Alliqua common stock (after giving effect to the new issuance and based on the number of shares of our common stock outstanding as of October 31, 2016), (ii) warrants to purchase an aggregate of 4,000,000 shares of New Alliqua common stock at an exercise price of $1.068 per share and (iii) credit for a portion of the payments made at closing by us to Soluble's senior lender and a third party supplier, which has been allocated to us and will not be considered an adjustment to the shares issuable as part of the equity consideration. The exact number of shares of New Alliqua common stock issuable to Soluble as part of the equity consideration will be determined at the closing of the transactions based on the value of certain indebtedness of Soluble that will be paid off or assumed by New Alliqua at closing and subject to certain other adjustments and escrow holdbacks set forth in the Contribution and Merger Agreement. In addition, the estimated ownership percentage above with respect to the shares of New Alliqua common stock to be issued to Soluble does not take into account (i) the issuance of additional shares of New Alliqua common stock upon any subsequent exercise of the warrants issued to Soluble and (ii) the issuance of any additional shares of our common stock or securities convertible into or exercisable for our common stock in connection with the financing contemplated by the Contribution and Merger Agreement.  The closing of the transactions contemplated by the Contribution and Merger Agreement is conditioned upon, among other things, us securing debt or equity financing, or combination, thereof, that results in gross proceeds of at least $45 million, inclusive of any current indebtedness of Soluble or us that is assumed, restructured or refinanced by the combined company. We currently expect to restructure the existing senior debt obligations for both us and Soluble totaling approximately $26.2 million. The balance of the proceeds would be used for costs related to the acquisition, as well as to meet our working capital requirements.  The transactions are expected to close during the first quarter of 2017, subject to the receipt of any required approvals and the satisfaction or waiver of the closing conditions contained in the Contribution and Merger Agreement. However, it is possible that factors outside the control of the parties could require the parties to complete the transactions at a later time or not complete it at all.  Soluble is the manufacturer and/or distributor of a line of advanced wound care products under the brand names TheraSkin(R) and TheraGauze(R). Soluble's lead product, TheraSkin(R), is a cryo-preserved human skin allograft for non-responsive chronic wounds. Soluble's patented SMRT Polymer technology is found in its advanced wound care dressing TheraGauze(R), which regulates moisture differentially across a wound bed to aid in wound healing without maceration.  Asset Sale  In order to add capital and to focus on future investments on commercializing our own regenerative technologies effective June 30, 2016, we entered into a purchase agreement (the "Purchase Agreement") with BSN medical, Inc. ("BSN") whereby we agreed to sell to BSN (i) all of the our rights, including all distribution rights, exclusivity rights, intellectual property rights and marketing rights (collectively, the "Rights") to the sorbion product line pursuant to its distribution agreement (as amended, the "Sorbion Agreement") with Sorbion GmbH & Co KG and (ii) the unsold inventory of sorbion products that we previously purchased in existence as of the closing, which occurred upon execution and delivery of the Purchase Agreement. In consideration for the sale of the Rights and the unsold sorbion inventory to BSN, BSN agreed to pay (i) $3.5 million related to the purchase of the Rights and the termination of the Sorbion Agreement and certain other agreements between the parties and (ii) up to $900,000 related to the unsold sorbion inventory upon our completion of the obligations to deliver all remaining and qualifying unsold sorbion inventory, with such payment amount varying based upon the condition of the sorbion inventory, as specified in the Purchase Agreement. The results of operations for the three and nine months ending September 30, 2016 and 2015 reflect our continuing operations.  Results of Operations  Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2015  Revenues, net. For the three months ended September 30, 2016 revenues increased by approximately $689,000, or 16%, to $4.8 million from $4.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in our overall revenue was primarily due to an increase in product sales.  The components of revenue were as follows for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands):   Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 2015 Revenues Product $ 4,355 $ 3,678 Contract manufacturing 519 507 Total revenues, net $ 4,874 $ 4,185  Our growth rates for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were as follows (in thousands):   Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 2015 Revenue growth $ 689 $ 2,989 % Growth over prior year 16 % 249 % Comprised of: % of organic growth* 16 % 159 % % of acquisition growth** 0 % 90 % 16 % 249 %  *2016 organic revenue growth represents growth from contract manufacturing and sales of our hydrogel, TheraBond, MIST, Biovance and Interfyl products. 2015 organic growth represents growth from all lines of business excluding MIST, which is included acquisition growth described below.  **2015 acquisition revenue growth represents growth from the sale of the MIST Therapy product line acquired in the purchase of Celleration.  Gross profit. Our gross profit was $3.1 million, or 64% of sales, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to gross profit of $2.7 million, or 66% of sales, for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Gross margin on our product sales was approximately 75% for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to 82% for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decline in our gross margin was primarily due to lower margins on MIST Therapy system sales. We expect our product gross margin to approximate 75% in future quarters, dependent upon product mix. We also expect our overall gross profit to increase as a result of product sales becoming a higher proportion of our total sales.  The components of cost of revenues are as follows for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands):   Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 2015 Cost of revenues Materials and finished products $ 1,098 $ 796 Stock-based compensation 5 91 Compensation and benefits 220 231 Depreciation and amortization 201 169 Equipment, production and other expenses 242 149 Total cost of revenues $ 1,766 $ 1,436  Selling, general and administrative expenses. The following table highlights selling, general and administrative expenses by type for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands):   Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 2015 Selling, general and administrative expenses Compensation and benefits $ 3,827 $ 3,824 Stock-based compensation 1,184 2,166 Professional fees 705 1,128 Marketing 413 507 Depreciation and amortization 838 822 Royalty fees 271 176 Other expenses 1,664 1,528 Total selling, general and administrative expenses $ 8,902 $ 10,151  Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $1.2 million, to $8.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $10.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  Compensation and benefits expense was approximately $3.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. Stock-based compensation decreased by $982,000, to $1.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $2.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in stock-based compensation is primarily due to the decrease in awards granted and the lower weighted average estimated fair value of options granted during the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015.  The increase in other selling, general and administrative expense, including professional fees, is primarily in support of our revenue growth. Other selling, general and administrative expenses consist of costs associated with our selling efforts and general management, including recruiting, information technology, travel, training and third party logistics.  Research and product development expenses. During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we incurred research and product development expenses of $164,000 and $192,000, respectively, related to a randomized controlled trial for our Biovance product in chronic diabetic foot wounds. We have experienced slower than expected patient enrollment and projected costs to complete the trial are significantly higher than we previously expected. In addition, we believe there is no longer a business need for this trial due to the amount of patient data currently available, our success in getting government and commercial insurance coverage for Biovance, and our recent increase in Biovance sales. Due to these factors, we have decided to terminate patient enrollment for the Biovance trial. We expect our research and product development costs related to this trial to continue through the completion of study close-down during the first quarter of 2017.  Milestone expense to licensor. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we incurred $1,000,000 of milestone expense for achieving two of the three milestones under the license agreement with HLI related to the launch of the Interfyl product. We initiated sales and marketing efforts of Interfyl in September 2016 and will pay HLI $500,000 related to the first commercial sale of Interfyl in the flowable matrix configuration and $500,000 related to the first commercial sale of Interfyl in the particulate form. Commercial sales of both configurations occurred in September 2016. We believe Interfyl will be a significant product offering in our portfolio of regenerative technologies, as it can be used in a broad range of surgical applications.  Acquisition-related expenses. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we incurred $715,000 in acquisition-related costs related to the planned acquisition of Soluble. During the three months ended September 30, 2015, we incurred $15,000 related to the acquisition of Celleration. Acquisition related costs include professional fees associated with due diligence and other activities related to acquisition. We expect to incur acquisition-related costs through the first quarter of 2017 when we anticipate closing the acquisition of Soluble.  Change in fair value of contingent consideration liability. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded an increase in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability of approximately $97,000 compared to an increase of $585,000 in the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase recorded during the three months ended September 30, 2016 is related to the accretion of the fair value of this liability.  Other income. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded other income of $100,000. We were required to perform certain services related to the transition of the sorbion business to BSN. As compensation, BSN paid us $100,000 for the services completed during the three months ended September 30, 2016. This compensation was recognized over the 90-day service period and is included in other income for the three months ended September 30, 2016.  Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015  Revenues, net. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 revenues increased by $5.1 million, or 61%, to $13.3 million from $8.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in our overall revenue was primarily due to increase in product sales.  The components of revenue were as follows for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands):   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 2015 Revenues Product $ 11,417 $ 6,608 Contract manufacturing 1,881 1,626 Total revenues, net $ 13,298 $ 8,234  Our growth rates for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were as follows (in thousands):   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 2015 Revenue growth $ 5,064 $ 5,689 % Growth over prior year 62 % 224 % Comprised of: % of organic growth* 11 % 161 % % of acquisition growth** 50 % 63 % 61 % 224 %  *2016 organic revenue growth represents growth from contract manufacturing and sales of our hydrogel, TheraBond, Biovance and Interfyl products and MIST subsequent to May 30, 2016. 2015 organic growth represents growth from all lines of business excluding MIST, which is included acquisition growth described below.  **2016 acquisition revenue growth represents growth from the sale of the MIST Therapy product line acquired in the purchase of Celleration through May 2016. 2015 acquisition growth represents growth from the sale of MIST.  Gross profit. Our gross profit was $8.3 million, or 63% of sales, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to gross profit of $4.6 million, or 56% of sales, for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Gross margin on our product sales was approximately 76% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to 71% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. We expect our product gross margin to approximate 75% in future periods, dependent upon product mix.

Compensation and benefits increased by $3.1 million, to $11.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $8.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in compensation and benefits was primarily due to the increase in the number of full-time employees during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to September 30, 2016 as a result of the acquisition of Celleration in May 2015, as well as increase in commissions related to the increase in revenue. Stock-based compensation decreased by $2.2 million, to $4.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $6.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.

 Celleration is a privately held medical device company, based in Eden Prairie, Minnesota, which is focused on developing and commercializing the MIST Therapy® therapeutic ultrasound platform for the treatment of acute and chronic wounds. Celleration's MIST Therapy System is an FDA 510(k) cleared device that uses painless, noncontact low-frequency ultrasound to stimulate cells below the wound bed in order to promote the healing process. Celleration generated total revenue of approximately $8.7 million during its fiscal year ended December 31, 2014. Since Celleration's MIST Therapy System was commercialized in 2005, MIST therapy has been performed more than 1.2 million times on over 85,000 patients in the U.S. and the U.K.

 Celleration's MIST Therapy System is supported by extensive clinical study data which has been produced in the past several years showing that MIST Therapy positively impacts critical aspects of the wound healing process. Most recently, in a prospective, randomized controlled trial conducted in 22 U.S. outpatient healthcare facilities and published in the January 2015 edition of Ostomy & Wound Management(1), MIST therapy demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in the healing rate over the standard of care treatment for venous leg ulcers. It is with this body of clinical data that the Mist Therapy was given a new reimbursement payment for outpatient services that became effective January 1, 2015, and we believe now more effectively reflects both the clinical efficacy and the economic benefits of the technology.

 "Celleration's innovative MIST therapy technology is positioned perfectly within Alliqua's business model," said David Johnson, Chief Executive Officer of Alliqua. "MIST therapy is a differentiated wound care treatment which is supported by a breadth of data that demonstrates its clinical efficacy and strong economic value proposition. Celleration's therapeutic devices, MIST and UltraMIST™, are FDA 510(k) cleared, receive favorable reimbursement and carry a high-margin profile.

 "Likewise, Celleration's focus on developing novel approaches for the treatment of wounds aligns exceptionally well with our vision of building a suite of advanced wound care solutions," continued David Johnson. "In addition to the differentiated product offering, we were attracted to Celleration's leadership role in advancing the science and practice of wound healing in working with medical professionals and providers, which, we believe, has helped the Company earn the favorable reimbursement decision in recent months. Further, this transaction will nearly double our sales force and we look forward to incremental improvements in sales force productivity as we begin marketing the combined company's suite of proprietary products. Finally, we are very pleased to welcome Mark Wagner, Celleration's President and CEO, who will be joining our Board of Directors upon the closing of the transaction."

 "This transaction presents an exciting opportunity for the two companies and their employees, who will be able to market a broader portfolio of treatments to a combined customer base and a common call point," commented Mark Wagner, Celleration's President and CEO. "With an impressive product portfolio and sales infrastructure, the combined company will be well-positioned to capitalize on the large and rapidly growing market for advanced wound care treatments. Both companies believe strongly in Evidence Based Medicine and delivering products that accelerate healing and minimize retreatment rates which, most importantly, benefits patients, payers and providers."

 Cowen and Company, LLC served as the Alliqua's exclusive financial advisor in connection with this transaction.

Financing 

 Alliqua has entered into a commitment letter for a Senior Secured Term Loan with Perceptive Advisors in the principal amount of $15.5 million in order to finance the initial cash purchase price.

 Further details of the acquisition and commitment letter can be found in Alliqua's Form 8-K that will be filed with the SEC.

Terms and Approvals 

 The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2015 and is subject to customary closing conditions, including Alliqua shareholder approval.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
