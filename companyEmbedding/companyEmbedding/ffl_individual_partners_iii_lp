  FFL Personal Guns | Federal Firearms License for Personal Use                Member LoginContact UsOur Blog  reviewed by nra national rifle association ffl123reviewed by nra national rifle association ffl123endorsed-by-gun-digestendorsed-by-gun-digestFeatured inFFL Dealer – Personal Gun Purchase   Jul   31  By  Brandon MaddoxIn: FFL123 FFL Blog  15  CommentsFFL License Personal UseOne of the biggest perks of having your own FFL License is being able to order firearms for personal use at much reduced prices. However, once you become a FFL dealer, it’s important that you keep track of your personal collection in the proper fashion.Starting with before you actually get your FFL license, go through your collection and decide if there is anything you’d like to sell. You’ll need to enter anything you might want to sell into your Acquisitions & Dispositions (A&D) book once you get one. Obviously, this is not required to move personal inventory to your FFL books, but a good best practice before you sell a “personal” firearm after getting an FFL.After you get your FFL license, and you decide to purchase a gun for your personal collection, you’ll need to enter it into your A&D book upon its arrival to your FFL licensed location. Then you can mark the gun out of your records as a disposition to yourself and no 4473 is required. You’ll want to be sure to keep your personal collection separate from your inventory either by storing them separately from your inventory or by labeling your personal collection as “not for sale” with a tag.If after a couple of months you decide you don’t like the new gun you transferred to yourself and want to resell it, you’ll need to put it back into your A&D book and sell it through your FFL. Any gun you’ve had in your personal collection less than a year will need to be sold through your license if you choose to sell it. For guns that have been in your collection for over a year, you may sell in a private sale as long as you keep a record of the date of that sale in a bound record and make note of the make, model, serial number, and caliber of the weapon. You’ll also need to record the name, address, and date of birth of the purchaser; and the purchaser will also need to be identified in any manner in which you’d identify a purchaser through a commercial sale (e.g., a driver’s license). If the private sale is to another licensee, the name and address of the licensee will need to be recorded. However, most FFL holders choose to sell everything through their FFL and perform a background check to ensure that the purchaser is legally able to own a firearm. It’s about as much paperwork to do it one way as to do it the other, so many FFL dealers hold the opinion that they may as well run the background check while they’re at it.A note should be made that this procedure is applicable to sole proprietor FFL licensees only, meaning FFL holders who applied as an individual and not a LLC, corporation, partnership, etc. Different rules apply to the situations of LLCs and partnerships.To learn how to become a FFL dealer and for more information on transferring firearms into your personal collection, Join FFL123.com today!Benefits of an FFL  See FFL123.com Customer Maps. Comments Jim Beckham Posted: June 14, 2014 Hello Brandon I used your FFL package a year ago to get my FFL. I applied under my LLC of whom I’m  the sole owner/manger. How do I transfer a firearm to myself for personal use, I know the ATF rules concerning corporations. jack coffey Posted: August 26, 2016 Ihave a Florida concealed weapon or firearm license . Can I buy a hand gun on the internet . My license number W2766508. thank you Brandon Maddox Posted: March 31, 2017 Local dealer will need to receive it and do the background check sir. john Posted: October 17, 2016 if I have a ffl and paid the SOT. can I then purchase a post 86 NFA weapon ? If so, what happens to this weapon if I give up my liscence? Brandon Maddox Posted: March 31, 2017 Yes. Need to sell to another dealer or government agency. Nikki Posted: May 1, 2017 If someone has their ffl, and they purchase a gun, do they have to use a different ffl? Does an ffl carrier have to wait 3 days like everyone else for a gun? Brandon Maddox Posted: May 2, 2017 Their FFL is fine for transfer.  No waiting period on FFL to FFL transfer. Lev Posted: May 16, 2017 In Arizona I can buy myself a weapon, use my own FFL LLC as transferring company and do a 4473 on myself with my Concealed Carry(no NICS check). It does not have to go to a second party FFL… This scenario was touched upon with my local IOI and clearly states have different procedures. Brandon Maddox Posted: May 16, 2017 ok Jay Posted: June 13, 2017 A female friend of mine purchased a handgun from a licensed firearms dealer, who happened to be an ex-coworker of hers. The licensed dealer made her purchase known to other people they had worked with, without her permission. Is there any law saying a dealer must keep that information private? Because of a scary situation she was going through, she didn’t want it to be known she was now the owner of a firearm. Brandon Maddox Posted: June 14, 2017 Dealer would need to keep all information private. Jim Posted: July 7, 2017 Brandon, I am looking into getting an FFL. Had considered a Collectors FFL, but that doesnt quite cover what I was looking for. I travel a great deal with my wife, she being what they call a Travel Nurse. We are both residents of Idaho, which I have a CCW for. I was looking into the FFL in regards to that when we are for example, in Virginia, would I be able to do an FFL to FFL purchase while out of state? Thanks for any input. Brandon Maddox Posted: July 7, 2017 Correct, FFL to FFL transfer does not require background check nor have restrictions on state of residency.Leave a Reply Click here to cancel reply.

History[edit]
FFL was founded in 1997 by Tully Friedman, together with Spencer Fleischer, David Lowe, and Christopher Masto. Prior to founding FFL, in 1984, Tully Friedman had co-founded Hellman & Friedman, one of the largest private equity firms globally, with Warren Hellman. In contrast to Hellman &Friedman, FFL focuses on smaller, middle market deals.
Spencer Fleischer, was a former member of Morgan Stanley's Investment Bankng Operating Committee and the Head of Investment Banking in Asia, Head of Corporate Finance for Europe, Head of UK Corporate Finance, Head of Investment Banking in Los Angeles, and Head of Corporate Finance in San Francisco.[7] David Lowe was Chairman and CEO of medical equipment maker ADAC Laboratories.[8] Christopher Masto was a Bain & Company consultant and previously an investment banker at Morgan Stanley.[9][10]

The firm's first private equity fund, Friedman Fleischer & Lowe Capital Partners closed in September 1999 with $333 million of investor commitments.[11] Almost five years later, the firm completed raising $811 million of investor commitments for its second fund, Friedman Fleischer & Lowe Capital Partners II in June 2004. In 2007, the firm raised its third investment fund, Friedman Fleischer & Lowe Capital Partners III, with $1.5 billion of investor commitments.[12]

Buds "Preferred Dealers" are listed in green and have agreed to accept all incoming ATF approved transfers of firearms purchased on www.budsgunshop.com.  When choosing a Preferred Dealer from our list, you will not need to contact the dealer to arrange a firearm transfer.  The transfer service and rate has been pre-approved for all Bud's customers.  However, completion and approval of ATF Form 4473 will still be required to take possession of any new or used firearm from your local dealer.


Our list of FFL's reflect only those we have already received from the dealers.  If you do not see your local FFL dealer listed, we have either not received a copy of the FFL, or we have not yet processed the FFL.  If you feel that your local FFL dealer should appear on this list, please first verify with your dealer that the FFL was actually sent to us via fax or email, and then contact us here.


This list was developed as a convenient way for our customers to see what local FFL dealers, including local Preferred Dealers, we already have on file.  This list is updated each day, and throughout the day. You may also use a local dealer that is not already on our list, however we will require a current copy of your dealer's FFL faxed to us at 1-800-804-5569 or scan/email here.


Although firearm transfer fees will vary greatly by region and dealer, average transfer fees range from $25 to $50 dollars.  Unless you are using a Bud's Preferred Dealer with published transfer rates, you will need to contact your local dealer to arrange the transfer and verify their rates.


Buds DOES NOT guarantee accuracy of information for non preferred dealers. Additional costs will apply to orders that experience shipping issues related to non preferred dealers.

In some cases, we may choose not to ship guns to certain dealers.  Though they may still appear on our list, these dealers are flagged and include comments indicating they are not to be used for transfers.

How To Buy a Gun Online










Purchasing a gun online is really, very easy.
 We have sold thousands online
  since creating BudsGunShop.com back in 2003.

There are only three simple steps

Find the gun you want You pay us directly for the firearm.
    (Click HERE for payment options)

Choose your FFL dealer (Federal Firearms License):
    We cannot ship a gun direct to you, we do ship to the local FFL dealer of your choice.
    Any legitimate gun store or gun dealer has an FFL license; pawn shops and collectors
    may also have them.

Pick up your gun:
    Inspect your gun before accepting the transfer.  If you are not happy for any reason leave the gun at the dealer.  
    We will have it picked up for free and offer you an exchange or refund at no cost.




Here is how to arrange a shipment and transfer:

Find a licensed FFL dealer in your area. (Click HERE for FFL dealers aready on file)
Contact the dealer and let them know you would like to receive a firearm for
    transfer from Budsgunshop.com.

Be sure to ask about their FFL transfer fee, commonly around $25 but varies by state.
If you agree to their fee, arrange the transfer with your FFL dealer.
    (We do not arrange the transfer)

Provide your dealer with our mailing address or toll free fax number where they
    can send a copy of their FFL.(if not already on file)

Once you have selected an FFL for your transfer, please indicate the dealers
    name (name on the FFL) on your order so we know where to ship your firearm.


To Speed Up Your Order:

If choosing an FFL dealer not already on file, please type the dealers name
     in the COMMENTS section of your order.
 Please include your ORDER NUMBER on any correspondence you or your FFL may send us.

It is best to locate a FFL dealer to transfer your gun before you place your order.
   However, you can place your order first and then provide us with your FFL dealer
   info before we ship.  We will hold your order for about 7 business days to give
   you time to locate a dealer and arrange a transfer.

If you have questions or concerns please CONTACT US or log-in to the web site to access Live Chat. We will be happy to address your concerns.
VERY IMPORTANT
Once the firearm is ready to be picked up at your FFL, Please INSPECT THE FIREARM
   THOROUGHLY to make sure it is exactly what you ordered and that there are no defects
   with the firearm. If there are any problems whatsoever, DO NOT ACCEPT THE TRANSFER !!
   We will gladly have the firearm picked up and returned to us at our expense and
   provide you with your choice of a replacement or full refund.   

Once you accept transfer, the gun is considered used and must be returned directly to
   the manufacturer for warranty repair or replacement.  Any returns to Budsgunshop.com
   AFTER accepting transfer from your dealer will be subject to a 10% restock fee,
   no exceptions.
