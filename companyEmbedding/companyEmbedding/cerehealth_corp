We have a wide range of high-quality incontinence products from trusted names in the industry. Products from top brands like Kendall, Prevail, Tena, Dignity, Tranquility, Depend, Wearever, Poise and FitRight are available. There are diapers, briefs, pads, liners, underpads, washcloths, wipes, bed-wetting control devices, wrist watch alarms, sensor pads and a lot more.
Handling Incontinence with the Right Products
Incontinence products can be very personal. (Read more on our blog.) What suits one may not suit another – in terms of comfort, needs and even pricing. Therefore, the product variety has to be vast to cater to all requirements in styles, brands and sizes.
Incontinence can be for both bladder and bowel. The latter is less common but there are products to take care of both types. All of these are from top manufacturers like Medline, First Quality-Prevail, Covidien/Medtronic, Attends Healthcare, SCA Personal Care, Hartmann USA, Principle Business Enterprises, Cardinal Health, Kimberly-Clark/Halyard, Salk, Abena, etc.
Light incontinence is easiest to deal with. There are several products that can help you with such a situation. A lot of thought has gone into their manufacture even though they may appear to be simple. They are designed for excellent absorbency and are also odor-proof because even the slightest smell can be embarrassing. The fabric is gentle and protects the skin from the urine preventing rash, irritation and discomfort. And they are extremely discreet, too.
Light incontinence products are available for both men and women. There are pads and liners, diapers, briefs, absorbent pouches, disposable underpads, bladder control pads, disposable male shields and guards plus absorbent underwear. They can be slipped inside regular underwear and remain unnoticeable. A soft, cloth-like topsheet wicks the moisture away and keeps the skin dry. The built-in odor shield neutralizes the pH level of the urine
Moderate Incontinence
Products for moderate incontinence are designed for optimum absorption, prevention of leakage and odor so as to provide a heightened sense of security. Diapers and briefs as well as protective underwear and pants help handle moderate-to-heavy incontinence.
Extra absorbency shields, liners and extra duty booster pads from Absorbent Products have a super absorbent core which locks away wetness, reduces odor and wicks moisture away from the skin. Their quilted design provides extra protection.
The belted undergarments from Attends are also meant for moderate absorbency. The super absorbent polymer locks the fluid in the core with its triple-tier moisture locking system.
There are moderate absorbency products for women from makers like Attends, Depend, First Quality, Hartmann, Tena, Poise and Salk. The protective underwear for women from First Quality-Prevail is developed to contour to a woman’ body shape. It has the feel and look of regular underwear, being thinner but stronger. It features QUIK WICK with MaxSoft to lock away moisture and the ammonia formed is reduced thus preventing odor.
For men, there are protective underwear, guards, boxers, duty pads and pouch from top makers.
The Depend Guards for Men has discreet cup-shaped protection right where the men need it. The Super Plus Underwear from Tena has Fit and Core Width between the legs which keeps the fluid away from the body.
Poise incontinence pads for women are thin and move with the body but they are super dry. They have leak-blocks on the sides for additional protection.
Medtronic Covidien’s Sure Care Plus Protective Underwear is a popular buy for moderate-to-heavy incontinence protection. Its tear-away sides offer easy removal and the Poly-fresh polymer core offers optimum absorbency with odor control. 
Heavy Incontinence
Heavy incontinence is easily manageable with products developed to provide stronger protection. Heavy bladder leakage can be due to overflow, reflex and functional incontinence. Although heavily built, these products are designed to be extremely discreet.
The heavy absorbency diapers from Cardinal Health have dual leak barriers and advanced core technology with improved absorption rates and skin dryness. Most of our products have odor control built-in features. For example, the adult briefs from Dignity have an innovative three-layer absorbent core which distributes fluid evenly while its odor neutralizer reduces ammonia formation. The Prevail Breezers from First Quality features Skin Smart Fabric, made with Vitamin E and natural botanicals aloe and chamomile to protect, soothe, and promote healthy skin.
Products are also classified under specific needs which include items to provide daytime or overnight protection.
The Sleep Overs Youth Pants from First Quality take care of moderate-to-heavy incontinence in older children. They feature Dri-Guard technology which has super absorbent core to help stop leaks before they start.
Tranquility Premium’s OverNight Disposable Absorbent Underwear is popular as a night-time garment. The inner leg Kufguards channel fluid to the core in order to contain large-volume episodes and bowel incontinence while the blue leg elastics ensure overnight protection by locking in the liquid while providing uninterrupted sleep.
For daytime protection, there are day pads from Tena which work well with Tena Comfort Pants. The pad has a soft, quick-dry topsheet which pulls in liquid fast keeping the surrounding area dry. The reusable incontinence briefs from Wearever are apt for daytime use and ideal for light-to-moderate incontinence.
Incontinence products are not restricted to underwear, diapers or briefs. We also have underpads to protect mattresses and chairs. There are washcloth and wipes to keep the area well sanitized and safe from rashes and skin breakdown. Dry and pre-moistened wipes as well as good quality washcloths are also available.
Booster pads from Attends, Tranquility and other makers are meant to provide extra protection when used in combination with another absorbent product like incontinence underwear, diaper or brief. It is designed to fit easily into the insides of an adult diaper, etc, and help reduce nighttime changes.
We also have mesh pants from Attends created to hold absorbent pads in place. These pants are washable and reusable and can be used with all disposable pads.
To get rid of used incontinence products, there are diaper disposable systems. These provide an odor-free hygienic environment with its double sealing lid system which keeps the odor locked inside. Also to eliminate accidents as much as possible, check out the bed-wetting alarm devices which give out a signal on the first signs of moisture.
Popular brands like Kendall, Prevail, Tena, Dignity, Tranquility, Depend, Wearever, FitRight, Poise, Carefor, Select, Abri-Flex, Sofnit, etc, provide strong credibility to these incontinence products.
Many factors are involved in the selection of a product –incontinence level, absorption capacity requirement, gender and lifestyle. Make your purchase time-saving and cost-effective by keeping these in mind.   show more   Pads and Liners Alarm Devices Diapers and Briefs Diaper Disposal System Underpads Washcloths and Wipes Protective Underwear and Pants    Narrow Results ByFilter By Manufacturer MEDLINE INDUSTRIES (72)  FIRST QUALITY - PREVAIL (57)  COVIDIEN/MEDTRONIC (53)  ATTENDS HEALTHCARE PRODUCTS (44)  SCA PERSONAL CARE (40)  HARTMANN USA, INC.

  ONLINE SINCE 2002  866-316-0162 My Account Cart Login     Advanced Search       Home    Wound Care  Wound Care  Taking care of a wound is critical for your overall health and well being. The faster the healing, the sooner you can go back to living a normal life. Finding the correct and best wound care product is the first step in caring for your wound and helps expedite its healing process.The right product for your need could be anything from basic first aid requirements and wound preps to compression bandages, gauze dressings, suture removers, medical gloves, odor control products and wound cleansers. Some extensive wounds may require dressing retainers, tapes, absorbent, sterile and non-sterile abdominal pads and a variety of eye pads that are safe and reliable.
How to care for a wound
 How to take care of your wound is important. There may be wounds that heal fast and there may be those that are difficult to treat. The major element that may pose a hurdle to healing is infection. An infected wound will bring in further complications and can take very long to heal. Keeping the wound area moist and covered for several days will promote wound healing. Wounds with heavy exudate need to be kept drier while at the same time maintaining the right moisture level.
 There are various products designed to differently handle a simple gash, infected wounds as well as difficult-to-treat ones. Several concerns associated with wounds exist such as wound infection care, wound skin care, after-surgery wound care and how to take care of a deep wound, etc.


 An important element in wound care is the dressing. There is a huge range in dressings with each defined for a specific function.
 Wound dressings do not heal but provide the conditions for healing. Dressings are designed to allow the natural healing process of the body by providing an optimal healing environment. There are wound dressings that absorb heavy exudate but also maintain the right level of moisture for the wound to heal. There are dressings that initiate autolytic debridement promoting growth of new tissues.
 An awareness of the dressing attributes and your wound type will help you in the selection of the right dressing and manage your wound effectively.
 Available are various types of wound dressings such as hydrogel dressings, alginate dressings, hydrocolloid dressings, transparent dressings, honey dressings, foam dressings and others. Each type is designed to treat varying levels of exudates and stages of wound. 
 Choosing a wound dressing will depend on three factors - wound type, its healing stage and location. Other than these, before selecting a wound dressing you will also have to keep in mind certain points –how dry or wet the wound is; will the dressing be used under compression; is the skin fragile; how cost effective it is, etc. A wound dressing may be key in wound care but is not the only product. To dress up a wound there are several other elements needed. 


First aid items and kits are a must-have in every home, school, office and should be a part of your luggage while on a trip. These are for treatment of minor injuries and might even be used for temporary relief in case of emergencies.
 Medical gloves are essential for handling a wound. Types of exam gloves or medical gloves include examination, surgical, burn and therapy gloves. There is a choice in material, texture and color. You can choose your exam gloves from textured, lightly textured or smooth. They are available in latex, non-latex, nitrile and vinyl with powder and powder-free. Sterile and non-sterile options are also there in exam gloves. 
 Before applying a wound dressing, it is essential to prep the wound site. For this you need wound prep products. These will keep the wound free of infections and prepare the environment for healing. Keeping a wound clean and learning how to clean an infected wound or clean a deep cut with these items is important. Antiseptic skin cleansers, prep pads and swabs, prepping balls, hydrogen peroxide and iodine solutions, adhesive tissues and Oat Beta-Glu can cream are all made by recognized manufacturers. Also to be found are wound measuring kits, applicators, moisture barriers, wound irrigation systems, drainage trays, wipes, sponges and more. Top-line manufacturers featured include Medline Industries, Dynarex Corporation, Nice Pak, Covidien, Hollister and more.


Gauze is meant to provide protection and cushion to the wounds and is a common wound prepping product. Available are woven/non-woven, cotton/polyester sponges from recognized brands. There are drain and IV sponges, packing strips, self-adhering and non-adhering pads, cover sponges, sterile and non-sterile sponges and more, all at great prices. Top quality gauzes are available from brands like Kendall, Avant Gauze and Bioguard.
 Taking care of a wound also involves ensuring the skin around the wound site is free of infections and aids in healing. Using the right skincare products will ensure a healthy skin. There are protective creams and ointments, antimicrobial/antifungal products, moisture barriers, moisturizers/skin conditioners, skin cleansers as well as odor eliminators. These will contribute towards an optimal healing environment.


Abdominal pads form an integral part of wound care because they are highly absorbent and provide padding and protection to wounds. There are top brands like Kendall and Caring with options in sizes and drainage intensity to suit all types of wounds. 
 Also useful are sterile absorbent cotton filler eye pads designed to protect the eye against harmful rays, infectious dirt and pollutants. These are found particularly handy after a minor eye surgery.
Wound cleansers, like topical wound sprays, saline wash, moisturizer sand wound flush, are also an essential element in wound care and help remove foreign debris, bacteria and impurities from a wound site. These are meant for multiple applications including cleaning ulcers, burns, tunneling, skin tears, incisions, traumatic wounds and minor skin irritations.


Compression bandages are used in the management of venous leg ulcers (read Treatments for Venous Ulcers) through application of sustained graduated compression. The Una Boot compression bandages use an application of a non-hardening zinc oxide paste in the treatment of venous stasis leg ulcers and skin graft on burn wounds.
 There are several types of tapes and bandages without which wound care would be incomplete. The latter support a wound dressing and hold splints and IVs in place. There are lint-free and latex-free bandages along with packing strips, arthro-pads and gauze rolls for burns. 
 Tapes have miscellaneous usage in wound care and are available in different material type like silk, soft cloth, paper, porous, silicone, foam, plastic and waterproof. They are conformable and soft yet with strong adhesive to ensure safe taping.


Dressing retainers hold bandages securely in place without needing adhesives. Range in dressing retainers include net bandages, spandages, elastic nets and tubular dressing retainers from trusted makers like Dumex/Derma Sciences, Medline, Medi- Tech, 3M and more.
Odor control is important during wound management. There could be odor issues associated with urine, feces, emesis and necrotic tissues or because of biological problems. Fresheners from MEDI-Aire, April Fresh and Enzymatic Rain are available.
 Wound care treatment also involves suture removal hence we offer suture removing scissors, tweezer-style staple removers, metal and plastic forceps and more for after-surgery wound care.
 Successful wound care would mean minimum scars. Browse through our solutions for effective lightening of wound scars in the form of specialized gels, wound care ointments, wound care creams and silicone gel sheets.

The Missing Link to HealthWhen you look around society today, you realize that obesity has become a major epidemic. As a result, we have developed numerous things to address this phenomena with more diet pills, weight loss programs, different ways to workout, intestinal surgeries, and the list goes on and on. To be fair, lots of these options work, however, some are harmful to the body like diet pills, but overall, people do lose the weight they want and are happy with the results.606, 2017

 Joint Health is the best natural anti-inflammatory and joint support product we have ever used. This product simply works!Brett Fischer, Fischer Sports Therapy and Conditioning ClinicI feel like I did in my 20’s! Taking the Core Health Pack has given me so much energy that I no longer need my daily nap when I get home from work. It truly is remarkable how much better and healthier I feel! Thank you for creating such an amazing product line.Linda Rolen
I wanted to let you know how much Core Health Products has helped me. 
I was on over the counter and prescription Acid Reflux meds for over 15 years.
I started taking the Digestive Enzymes and the Heart Health after attending your seminar at a meeting in San Antonio, Texas. My acid reflux was so bad that if I took a drink of just water without my medicine first, I would get acid reflux, not good. After my first week on core products I started backing off of my medicine and now as of this letter I have been off the medicine. That is all the time it took to stop the acid reflux. I am so happy that I came to your seminar and I share information about this product with everyone I know.Gene & Lady VaughnI am a college football player and last season got hurt.  I had surgery on my ACL and was given Joint Health right after surgery.  My doctors and I were shocked at how quickly I recovered just by taking the Joint Health.  My doctor said I was 2 months ahead of schedule and I recovered that much quicker just by using Joint Health.  I am now back on the field and feel amazing.  The other thing that shocked my doctor was that there was no scar tissue in the area which is typically unheard of.  Thanks Core Health.J.D. WoodFrom the first day I met you, I knew I had been introduced not only to a product that would completely revamp and change my life, but to a friend as well, who GENUINELY cares about the health of absolutely everyone in the world, from kids, adults, professional athletes & more. Your Core Health Products have done more for me than working out or eating right alone. Ashley Dawn McTuckerI was in a work accident several months ago and had a lot of scar tissue around the eye, I also had to have reconstructive face surgery.  I have been on the Core Pack and the Joint Health and have felt so good during my recovery time.
I have no scar tissue build up and my recovery has been quicker than expected by my doctors.  I feel great and energetic thanks to Core Health Product.Joshua V.Digestive Health is my new Favorite Item!!!  I have dealt with IBS since I was little and I started taking Digestive Health about 8 months ago.  I noticed a huge difference the first day I took it.  Ten minutes after taking Digestive Health I noticed a difference.  I am now sharing with all my family as they have also had the same issues.  I am grateful for this product.Raven S. from Kansas CityI have been taking the Core Health Pack for over a year and can tell a difference in my stamina and just having consistent energy.  I work 24/7 and hardly get sleep so I know with the Core Health Pack it has helped sustain my immune system.  Can’t go without it.Chet M.NUTRIENT UTILIZATION IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN JUST NUTRIENT CONSUMPTION.Shan Stratton, Nutritionist to the Pro’sI am in the Army at Fort Benning.  I had trouble with my knees and the doctors were contemplating surgery.  My mom sent me some Joint Health and told me to take 4 a day.  Shortly after I shared with my mom that the Joint Health has helped me with my knees and I am able to run better and I have so much more energy.  I cannot imagine not having my JOINT HEALTH.  Thank you to my mom for sharing and Core Health for providing the best!!!Ryan N.About 4 months ago I started working out and my friend shared with me what had helped her lose a bit of weight and thanks to incorporating the Digestive Health with my protein shakes and the Heart Health for fat loss I have lost 15lbs since starting on Core Health Products.  I love it and I notice a difference when I take my Heart Health.  I can tell when I don’t take it.  I guess if it’s good enough for the Pro’s then it’s good enough for me!!!Andrea B. from TulsaMy wife, son and I have been on the Wellness Program and since we have been taking core health our energy is amazing.  My son notices a difference when he does not take it and we have not gotten sick this winter which is usually inevitable. I know by taking a whole food supplement it has built our immune system to fight the common colds and flu.  My family and I love the product and are grateful for what it has done for our health.
Thank you!!!Bennie Walters and Family

Core Health Products
Core Health Products is a culmination of over 75 years of nutritional expertise, product formulation, health education, and hands on experience with the end user.
Core Health is owned and headed by Shan Stratton, renowned nutritional consultant to the NY Yankees, LA Dodgers, Arizona Diamondbacks, and many other professional organizations. Shan leads a company that prides itself in making sure the entire product line is created with integrity, purity, and effectiveness at the forefront of consideration.
Although Shan has worked with many teams and hundreds of athletes, his company was formed to address the health and wellness needs of the everyday person. Core Health Products is absolutely committed to putting the nutritional needs of the consumer first and foremost over profits or recognition.
A common theme throughout the entire product line is the emphasis on “nutrient utilization being more important than just nutrient consumption”. Core Health Products uses only the best and most natural whole food ingredients available. You will never find synthetics or fractionated nutrients. All minerals are amino acid chelated to ensure the highest level of absorption. The probiotics are stabilized, and the enzymes broad spectrum. Each and every ingredient has been carefully selected to fulfill a specific need, rather than to simply make the ingredient list look better. We also utilize only certified organic ingredients whenever organic sources are available.
Although we at Core Health Products fully recognize there are no miracle cures when it comes to health and wellness, we firmly believe you will not find a more complete, natural, and wholistic line of products than what we have developed. We are so confident in the quality and effectiveness of our products that we stand behind them with an unconditional 30-day money-back satisfaction guarantee.
Shan and his team know that you only get to experience life once. Therefore, everything we can do to help you more fully enjoy life with optimal health and vitality is an integral part of our mission.
You owe it to yourself to try the best. After all, your body deserves the best nutrition possible.

Product Description
Heart disease is the number one cause of death in the U.S. making cardiovascular health a top health priority. Keeping your heart healthy means maintaining healthy cholesterol levels, reducing inflammation, and ensuring healthy circulation and  blood pressure. Proper nutrition is vital to all these steps towards a healthy heart.
Core Health Product’s Heart Health is a superior product combining powerful heart-healthy ingredients like garlic and bilberry with effective levels of CoQ10, chromium, magnesium, and pomegranate in a unique proprietary blend.
Proprietary Heart Blend
Garlic, bilberry, and pomegranate are all natural foods with a history of use promoting heart health, and modern clinical studies have now demonstrated their potential to reduce cholesterol, improve circulation, and lower blood pressure. These natural antioxidants are combined with nutrients such as CoQ10, niacin, magnesium, and chromium that are essential to promoting healthy circulation, healthy blood pressure, and healthy blood lipids.
BioCore Lipase
Core Health Product’s Heart Health formula further differentiates itself by including a distinctive blend of lipases to ensure maximum lipase activity. Lipase is the enzyme required to break down fats. Including lipase in this unique formula helps ensure the body is able to better utilize fats; both consumed and stored.
Maximum Enzyme Delivery System (M.E.D.S.)
Every Core Health Product includes our proprietary nutrient delivery system, known as M.E.D.S.™. This proprietary system uses the power of enzymes and fully-utilizable micronutrients to delivery maximum results.
The exceptional combination of ingredients in Core Health Product’s Heart Health formula helps maintain a strong and healthy cardiovascular system, healthy blood pressure, and healthy blood lipid levels.
Key Benefits:

Supports a healthy cardiovascular system.
Promotes healthy blood pressure.
Supports healthy blood lipids.
Provides natural antioxidants for healthy circulation.
Increases the digestion and utilization of fats from food.
Includes M.E.D.S. to maximize results.




Core Heart Health Formula combines traditional heart healthy ingredients like garlic and bilberry with effective levels of CoQ10, chromium, magnesium and pomegranate in a unique proprietary blend.
 
BioCore®Lipo is a distinctive blend of a variety of lipases to ensure maximum lipase activity. Lipase is the enzyme that breaks down fats. Including lipase in this unique formula ensures the body is able to properly process fats.
 
Proprietary Heart Blend

Bilberry is naturally rich in antioxidants and has been the subject of recent research examining its potential circulatory and cardioprotective benefits. CHP’s bilberry is standardized to 25% anthocyanidins – an important group of antioxidants found in plants.
Chromium has been shown to enhance insulin function and promote healthy glucose and cholesterol levels. The chromium included in CHP’s Heart Health is a patented form of chromium that binds chromium to niacin (as nicotinic acid) and the amino acid, glycine, in a stable bond that allows it to be absorbed better and utilized better by the body because it is in the active form the body needs.
CoQ10 or coenzyme Q10 is the key component in the cell’s ability to generate energy. CoQ10 levels tend to fall as we age and are depleted by common medications used for diabetes and cholesterol (e.g. statin medications and glucophage). Researchers have found adequate CoQ10 levels are necessary for proper organ function.
Garlic has a long history of use and is used in Europe for healthy cholesterol levels and to support overall cardiovascular health. Over 2500 scientific papers have been published in the last 30 years examining the various aspects of the chemistry, pharmacology and clinical applications of garlic.
Magnesium is an essential mineral that is not only required for general health, but also plays a key role in promoting healthy blood pressure and cardiovascular health. Magnesium deficiency is linked to increased risk of cardiovascular disease. The magnesium in CHP’s Heart Health is patented amino acid chelated magnesium. 
Niacinamide is a form of the essential B vitamin – niacin. It plays an important role in cardiovascular health, healthy cholesterol levels and circulation.
Pomegranate is a natural concentrated source of vitamins and antioxidants, especially polyphenols and has been researched for its potential cardioprotective benefits. Unlike most pomegranate extracts, CHP’s pomegranate is standardized to contain 40% punicosides. Punicosides are the key active component of pomegranate thought to be responsible for its unique health benefits.

Product Description
Having healthy joints is critical to enjoying all that life has to offer.

The more than 50 million Americans with joint discomfort will tell you that even regular activity can become difficult when joint tissues start to break down due to age, injury, and even regular physical activity. When joint tissues such as cartilage begin to break down faster than they can be rebuilt, it can result in inflammation, pain, swelling, and ultimately in joint problems such as osteoarthritis. The inflammation associated with tissue degradation causes pain and swelling, and may actually speed the breakdown process. Providing the nutrients needed to build cartilage and minimize inflammation can be beneficial in combating this health concern.
Core Health Products’ Joint Health formula is a superior formulation that combines NEM® egg shell membrane with a proprietary blend of anti-inflammatory enzymes and an exclusive blend of antioxidant herbs and nutrients. These unique ingredients combine to support healthy cartilage formation, minimize cartilage degradation, and support the body’s natural healing processes.
NEM® Natural Egg Shell Membrane
This patented, natural egg shell membrane (NEM®) is a natural source of chondroitin sulfate, hyaluronic acid, collagen, and other glycosaminoglycans essential for healthy joints. Unlike glucosamine, which can take up to 60 days to produce an effect, NEM® has been clinically proven to provide relief in just 7-10 days. These superior, clinically proven results are what lead Core Health Products’ scientists to feature this ingredient as a core part of the Joint Health formula.
Proprietary Enzyme Blend
Protease enzymes support the natural healing processes and efficiency of the body in rebuilding damaged areas. Core Health Products’ Proprietary Enzyme blend includes a combination of protease enzymes, with two different proteases and bromelain. Bromelain is a special combination of protease enzymes derived from pineapple that has been shown to modulate the chemical messengers of the immune system associated with pain and inflammation. This advanced combination of enzymes provides anti-inflammatory benefits and helps improve recovery from exercise.
Proprietary Antioxidant & Herbal Blend
Grape seed extract, resveratrol, and quercetin are well-known antioxidants that have been researched for their benefits in modulating the body’s inflammatory processes, promoting recovery, and providing anti-aging benefits. Joint Health’s Proprietary Antioxidant Blend also includes an SOD precursor system made up of patented amino acid chelated copper, zinc, and manganese. These minerals are the building blocks your body requires to make more of its own super antioxidant enzyme – SOD (Super Oxide Dismutase). Vitamin C is critical for building and rebuilding cartilage, yet this critical nutrient is often low in the average diet. To ensure the body has all the building blocks for healthy joints, this blend includes a natural source of vitamin C (acerola cherry & rosehips) providing 200% of the daily value for vitamin C. Joint Health’s exclusive combination of potent antioxidant ingredients is combined with the powerful anti-inflammatory herb, Bowellia. This well-researched herb nutritionally supports the body’s healing processes and aids in recovery. These powerful ingredients also support the immune system’s natural anti-inflammatory processes.
Maximum Enzyme Delivery System (M.E.D.S.)
Every Core Health Products’ formula includes our proprietary nutrient delivery system known as M.E.D.S.™ This proprietary system uses the power of enzymes and fully-utilizable micronutrients to deliver maximum results.
The exceptional combination of ingredients in Core Health Products’ Joint Health helps to maintain healthy joints, promote faster recovery from exercise and competition, and optimize the body’s anti-inflammatory processes.
Key Benefits:

Promotes healthy muscles and joints.
Effectively supports the body in repairing tissue following an injury.
Enhances the body’s natural healing processes.
Optimizes the body’s anti-inflammatory processes.
Supports faster recovery from strenuous exercise and workouts.
Maximizes production of the body’s own powerful antioxidant enzyme (SOD) for even faster recovery.
Includes M.E.D.S. ™ to maximize results.




Joint Health Formula combines traditional joint health ingredients like boswellia with the power of proteolytic enzymes and the new, patented NEM® egg shell membrane to provide maximum benefits for joint health. 
NEM® is a new ingredient derived from natural egg shell membrane. It is a natural source of chondroitin sulfate, hyaluronic acid, collagen, and other glycosaminoglycans essential for healthy joints. This patented ingredient has been clinically proven to provide results in just 7-10 days.*
Proprietary Enzyme Blend

Bromelain is a special combination of protease enzymes derived from pineapples. In addition to general protease effects, bromelain has been shown to modulate the chemical messengers of the immune system (cytokines and prostaglandins). By modulating the activity of these specific messengers, bromelain is able to provide a wide range of benefits for joint health, and potentially improve recovery from exercise.
Protease 4.5 and 6.0 are protease enzymes that break down large protein molecules into smaller proteins and amino acids. As a natural part of healing, proteins can build up in an area of injury. Protease enzymes help break up waste protein, thereby supporting the body’s natural process to more efficiently rebuild and support healthy muscles and joints. Protease 4.5 and 6.0 each work within different pH ranges. By combining these enzymes into the proprietary blend, Core Health Product’s Joint Health formula is able to provide a broad spectrum of enzyme activity and maximize the benefits of protease enzymes.

Proprietary Antioxidant and Herbal Blend

Acerola Cherry is an excellent natural source of vitamin C, a critical nutrient for joint health. The body cannot build or repair joint tissues without adequate amounts of vitamin C. Joint Health contains 200% DV of Vitamin C from acerola cherry to provide a truly balanced joint health formulation with all the necessary building blocks for healthy joints.
Boswellia, a close relative of frankincense (B. sacra), has been used for many thousands of years as an astringent and anti-inflammatory. Modern researchers have found that boswellia’s beneficial properties come both from its antioxidant capabilities and its unique ability to inhibit the production of leukotrienes (chemical messengers of the immune system) associated with inflammation. Numerous double-blind placebo-controlled clinical studies have shown its potential benefits for joint health.
Grape Seed Extract, is one of the most powerful natural sources of proanthocyanidins, which help protect tissues from free radicals produced in conditions of inflammation. The grape seed extract used in Joint Health utilizes a patented, environmentally friendly water-based extraction process. This process is able to recover more of the potent OPCs from grape seed than other extraction methods, and maintains the natural integrity and potency of proanthocyanidin antioxidants.
Quercetin is a bioflavanoid found naturally in the skin of apples, red onions, citrus fruits, and red grapes. Its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties play a key role in the maintenance and heath of collagen, a key component of cartilage and joint tissues.
Resveratrol is best known for its anti-aging properties, but it is a powerful non-flavanoid antioxidant found naturally in grapes and other plants, and has been researched for its various potential health benefits. It is thought to work by modulating the enzymes and signaling pathways involved in the body’s inflammation and aging processes.
SOD Precursor System: SOD, or SuperOxide Dismutase, is a powerful antioxidant enzyme produced by the body and fights inflammation and supports recovery. Unfortunately, SOD production and activity decreases with age and is often low in individuals with certain health conditions. Joint Health’s SOD Precursor System provides the nutrient building blocks needed to support the body’s ability to produce SOD.

Can I still be a CHP affiliate?If you already have your own website, simply have your webmaster insert our affiliate banner link into your existing website. Then, all the visitors to your website who order CHP products will be your customers and you will earn commissions.Do I have to have a merchant account to be an affiliate?No. All orders placed on your personalized CHP website will be processed by CHP. You do not need to process orders, stock product, or ship product. CHP will handle all of that for you.What type of program does CHP use for its affiliate program?  CHP has combined the best of all the affiliate programs into one premier program. We use a combination of three programs (a pay-per-sale program, a residual program and two-tier program). You are paid anywhere from 10-30% commission when a customer you referred purchases from your personalized CHP website or linking from your own website. Our program has the additional benefit of lifetime commissions through the residual program. Once a customer orders from the site, that customer is forever your customer and you will earn commissions every time that customer orders products from CHP. We also offer a 2nd tier program in which you make additional 5% commissions from affiliates that you personally refer.How do I get paid as an affiliate?Commissions earned in the calendar month are paid on the 15th of the following month when a minimum of $100 has been earned. To receive your check, a W-9 must be filled out and submitted to CHP the month prior.How does an affiliate earn commissions?
As an affiliate, you have multiple income streams with CHP.

 10% – 30% (depending on your monthly sales dollars) affiliate commissions on all orders placed on your personal CHP website. Personal orders are not commissionable.
 5% affiliate referral commissions (2nd tier) on all orders placed on personally referred affiliate websites.

In addition to your online business, you can also create income from wholesale to retail case ordering. Your earning potential could increase up to 50% for qualifying professionals.

Do I have to order product myself to be an affiliate?  Yes, because being a product of the product only increases your sales potential. Your only requirement is either a monthly auto-ship of 2 or more products OR a 1 time purchase of our Starter Pack.What are the guidelines for selling CHP products in a retail location?We ask that all our affiliates who sell at a location stay within our online pricing of the product. Our company is based on honesty and integrity from the ingredients we select to the value of each product. All of our affiliates must hold true to these principles. Whenever CHP runs a special, this is a great time to pass that savings onto your customer as well.What products qualify for commissions?Qualifying commissionable sales are those that contain nutritional products sold at the retail/online price. Marketing and educational materials such as DVDs, cd’s and books do not qualify for commission. Wholesale case ordering only receives a flat 10% commission and does not qualify for monthly sales totals.Do I have to order product?Yes, because being a product of the product only increases your sales potential.

Unfortunately, increasingly busy lifestyles make this a bit difficult at times, so it s important to create a nutritional safety net for yourself by consuming diet and nutritional supplements that can boost your health. The wide variety of diet and nutritional supplements can make it difficult to know what s right for you, so learning the basics of choosing nutritional supplements is the first step to getting the best supplements for your needs   along with talking to your doctor about what you might need to take. With the wide selection of diet and nutritional supplements available at Every Day Low Prices at Walmart, you can easily find all the vitamins and minerals that make it easier to lead a healthy lifestyle. Why should you use supplements? Nothing can replace a diet rich in minerals and vitamins, but when life gets busy and your stress levels rise, you may struggle to find the time to source and prepare nutritious dishes every day. By choosing nutrition supplements, you and your entire family can get the nutrition you need every day, no matter what life throws at you. Alternatively, if you're overweight and would like to lose weight, you may find it helpful to use dieting supplements such as appetite suppressants or fat inhibitors that can control your appetite and help you deal with the constant feeling of hunger. Vitamins and minerals Besides supporting general health, vitamins and mineral supplements may help head off chronic conditions, so it's important to make sure that your risk of dietary deficiencies is low by taking supplements. Before making your choice, ensure that you know what to look for in a multivitamin supplement.  Start by reading the label to identify the nutrients included as well as the amounts per serving.  If you're looking for a daily supplement that's suitable for most individuals, get a combination of basic vitamins and minerals. Some of the essential ingredients in such supplements include vitamins C, B1, B2, B3, B6, A, folic acid, Vitamin E, iodine, zinc, magnesium, calcium and iron. Multiple types of multivitamins are targeted at helping individuals with specific conditions or nutritional needs. Women, for example, could take a supplement with folic acid when they're pregnant to help avoid some congenital disabilities. Middle-aged women can take calcium and vitamin D supplements to lower the risk of osteoporosis. Check the percentages to determine whether a certain supplement offers you 100 percent of the Daily Value (DV) for the vitamins and minerals included. You shouldn t take multivitamins that exceed the 100 percent recommended dose. Proteins and meal replacements Protein powders, protein bars and meal replacement supplements are a popular choice for those who engage in sports regularly. The human body needs large amounts of protein as part of a balanced diet, but just like in the case of vitamins and minerals, it may be difficult to get all the amount you need from food. protein shakes are available in multiple types, with the most common of them being protein concentrate, isolate and hydrolysate. Meal replacement shakes are often made with skim milk, and they're high in protein and fiber while being low in fat. They offer a high-energy meal, but they only have around 200 to 300 calories per serving. Protein bars are ideal for those moments you want a nutritious snack on the go. Diet supplements If losing weight is your goal, diet supplements can help you by curbing cravings and suppressing your appetite. Remember that these supplements aren't magic pills for losing weight and that they work well in combination with a nutritious, low-calorie diet and regular exercise. Chromium diet supplements are available in tablet form and they do a good job at reducing excess body fat while helping your body maintain normal sugar levels. Control your diet with an everyday weight loss kit that come complete with everything you need to embrace healthy eating, offering you a variety of breakfast options and snacks.

Get your purchases fast with our free two-day shipping programThere's so much convenience when it comes to online shopping. It's easy to find exactly what you're looking for all in one place when you shop with Walmart online. Plus, you can see all the items that you want to purchase and know immediately whether they're in stock or not. However, two issues that arise   that you don't deal with when you're shopping in store   is that you sometimes have to wait several days to get your purchases or pay a higher additional fee to get your purchases shipped faster. However, thanks to Walmart, you don t have to deal with either problem. We offer free two-day shipping on millions of the items that we sell, and it's all available to you without joining a membership club or paying extra fees for the privilege. Combine this with our low prices, every day, on everything, and you can get the things you want quickly at prices that fit your budget.How Walmart's free two-day shipping worksWhen you're looking at our website to find the types of items that you're interested in purchasing, the first step is to look for the logo that says 2-Day Shipping on the product page. Many of these items will also state Free store pickup or Free store pickup today below the free shipping information. If you see these words on the product page for your item, you have the additional option to pick the item up for free at your chosen Walmart location or receive it at your designated location for free as long as you spend $35 or more. If your purchase is less than $35, you can upgrade to free shipping for $5.99.On the left-hand side of all the pages on our website, you'll see a section that section labeled Shipping & Pickup. Beneath that, you'll find the option for 2-Day Shipping. Click the radio button next to 2-Day Shipping and the page will reload, displaying only items that are available for free two-day shipping. As long as you place your order by 2 p.m., you can expect delivery in two business days. This means that, if you order your item after 2 p.m. on a Friday, you won't receive it until the following Wednesday. However, if you order it on Tuesday before 2 p.m., you can expect to get it by the following Friday. Keep in mind that weekends and holidays don't count as business days for shipping. Also, be sure to note that the 2 p.m. cutoff time is relative to the time zone where we're shipping your item from, not the time zone from where you're ordering it.Other shipping optionsRemember that any item that's marked with 2-Day Shipping on its page is also eligible for free shipping on qualifying purchase amounts. Most of these items are also eligible for in-store pickup   many of them that same day   even if you order after 2 p.m. If you select an item that's not eligible for our free two-day shipping program, there are many others that are eligible for free three- to five-day shipping. Again, this free shipping is only for purchases of $35 or more. Items that are part of this shipping promotion include Marketplace and freight items, but shipping costs are based on location on a case-by case basis for these products.If you're ordering an item that we're not shipping to you   but one of our trusted partners is   it's possible that they might offer free shipping too.
