(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements, including the notes thereto, appearing elsewhere in this annual report. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to those discussed below and elsewhere in this report. Our unaudited financial statements are stated in United States Dollars and are prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.  Plan of Operations and Cash Requirements  We intend to devote our marketing efforts toward identifying ambulatory surgical centers (ASC) that currently have an incentive to be acquired by hospitals in order to increase compensation levels. We intend to reorganize ASCs and consolidate several such centers into larger entities that can immediately take advantage of higher reimbursement rates permitted by the reorganization. At the same time, we expect to institute the necessary medical records and management systems to make the transition to value based compensation.  Cash Requirements  We have incurred recurring losses to date. Our financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern and, accordingly, do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability and realization of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue in operation. We expect we will require additional capital to meet our long term operating requirements. We expect to raise additional capital through equity financing arrangements.  The following table provides selected financial data about our company as of the three and six months, ended January 31, 2017.  Results of Operations for the three months ended January 31, 2017 and 2016   For the Three Months Ended January 31, Statement of Operations Data: 2017 2016 Change ($) Total operating expenses $ 6,764 $ 7,607 $ (843 ) Other expenses $ 663 $ 723 $ (60 ) Net loss $ 7,427 $ 8,330 $ (903 )  During the three months ended January 31, 2017 and 2016, no revenues were recorded.  We had a net loss $7,427 for the three months ended January 31, 2017, and $8,330 for the same period ended January 31, 2016. The decrease in net loss of $903, was primarily due to the decrease in operating expenses.  Operating expenses for the three months ended January 31, 2017 and 2016 were $6,764 and $7,607, respectively. The operating expenses were primarily attributed to professional fees for maintaining reporting status with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and general and administrative expenses. Professional fees for the three months ended January 31, 2017, was $6,381 compared to $4,464 for the same period ended January 31, 2016. General and administration expenses decreased by $2,760, to $383 for the three months ended January 31, 2017, from $3,143 for the three months ended January 31, 2016, the decrease was primarily due to the decrease in management fee of $3,000 as the Company had stopped paying management fees to an officer since the year ended July 31, 2016.  Other expenses represent interest paid to a related party on funds advanced to the Company.  Table of Contents  Results of Operations for the six months ended January 31, 2017 and 2016   For the Six Months Ended January 31, Statement of Operations Data: 2017 2016 Change ($) Total operating expenses $ 15,005 $ 20,838 $ (5,833 ) Other expenses $ 1,355 $ 1,457 $ (102 ) Net loss $ 16,360 $ 22,295 $ (5,935 )  During the six months ended January 31, 2017 and 2016, no revenues were recorded.  We had a net loss $16,360 for the six months ended January 31, 2017, and $22,295 for the same period ended January 31, 2016. The decrease in net loss of $5,935 was primarily due to the decrease in operating expenses.  Operating expenses for the six months ended January 31, 2017 and 2016 were $15,005 and $20,838, respectively. The operating expenses were primarily attributed to professional fees for maintaining reporting status with the SEC and general and administrative expenses. Professional fees for the six months ended January 31, 2017, was $14,326 compared to $14,530 for the same period ended January 31, 2016. General and administration expenses decreased by $5,629, to $679 for the six months ended January 31, 2017, from $6,308 for the six months ended January 31, 2016, the decrease was primarily due to the decrease in management fee of $6,000 as the Company had stopped paying management fees to the Director since the prior year ended July 31, 2016.  Other expenses represent interest paid to a related party on funds advanced to the Company. The interest expense decreased by $102, to $1,355 for the six months ended January 31, 2017, from $1,457 for the six months ended January 31, 2016.   January 31, July 31, Change Balance Sheet Data: 2017 2016 ($) Cash $ 45,030 $ 60,084 $ (15,054 ) Working capital (deficiency) $ (18,169 ) $ (1,809 ) $ (16,360 ) Total assets $ 45,030 $ 60,084 $ (15,054 ) Total liabilities $ 63,199 $ 61,893 $ 1,306 Total stockholders' equity (deficit) $ (18,169 ) $ (1,809 ) $ (16,360 )  As of January 31, 2017, our current assets were $45,030 and our current liabilities were $63,199 which resulted in working deficiency of $18,169. As of January 31, 2017, our current assets were comprised of $45,030 in cash, compared to $60,084 in cash as of July 31, 2016. As of January 31, 2017, current liabilities were comprised of $10,598 in accounts payable and $52,601 in due to related parties, compared to $5,532 in accounts payable, $277 accrued interest due to related parties and $56,084 in due to related parties as of July 31, 2016.  As of January 31, 2017, our working capital decreased by $16,360 from a deficiency of $1,809 on July 31, 2016, to $18,169 on January 31, 2017, primarily due to decrease in cash at $15,054.   For the Six Months Ended January 31, Cash Flow Data: 2017 2016 Cash Flows used in Operating Activities $ (11,571 ) $ (24,345 ) Cash Flows provided by (used in) Financing Activities $ (3,483 ) $ 102,601 Net Increase (Decrease) in Cash During Period $ (15,054 ) $ 78,256  Table of Contents  Cash Flows from Operating Activities  We have not generated positive cash flows from operating activities. For the six months ended January 31, 2017, net cash flows used in operating activities was $11,571, consisting of a net loss of $16,360, reduced by an increase in accounts payable of $5,066 and increased by a decrease in accrued interest due to related parties of $277. For the period ended January 31, 2016, net cash flows used in operating activities was $24,345, consisting of a net loss of $22,295, reduced by an increase in accounts payable of $2,950 and increased by a payment made to a related party for $5,000.  Cash Flows from Financing Activities  We have financed our operations from the issuance of equity and loans from related parties. For the six months ended January 31, 2017, and 2016, we used $3,483 and generated $102,601 from financing activities, respectively. For the period ended January 31, 2017, the Company repaid $3,483 in loans to a related party. For the period ended January 31, 2016, we received $73,350 from the sale of common stock, an amount of $5,000 was contributed capital, repayment to related party loan for $2,399 and the release of restricted cash provided $26,650.  Limited Operating History; Need for Additional Capital  There is no historical financial information about us upon which to base an evaluation of our performance. We are a development stage corporation and have not generated any revenues from operations to fully implement our business plan. We cannot guarantee we will be successful in our business operations. Our business is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise, including limited capital resources, and competition from larger organizations. We will require equity and/or debt financing to provide for the capital required to implement our plans. We will require additional funds to operate for the next year.  We have no assurance that future financing will be available to us on acceptable terms. If financing is not available on satisfactory terms, we may be unable to continue, develop or expand our operations. Equity financing as envisioned by our Offering will result in additional dilution to existing shareholders.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  From May 20, 2014 (inception) through January 31, 2017, we have relied on funds loaned to us by Kratos Healthcare Inc ("Kratos"), a company controlled by an officer and director, to fund our initial working capital requirements. The current amount due is $52,601 in principal and Kratos has agreed to loan us additional amounts of up to a total of $75,000 (inclusive of cash advances to date).  In the event we are not successful in reaching our initial revenue targets, additional funds may be required, and we may not be able to proceed with our business plan for the development and marketing of our core services. Should this occur, we would likely seek additional financing to support the continued operation of our business. We anticipate that depending on market conditions and our plan of operations, we may incur operating losses in the foreseeable future. Therefore, our auditors have raised substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.  As of January 31, 2017, we have no employees. Other than our chief financial officer, who we have verbally agreed to pay for management services, our officers and directors are donating their time to the development of our company. As of January 31, 2017, an officer who is also a director and a shareholder was owed $NIL (July 31, 2016 - $NIL) for management fees and during the six months ended January 31, 2017, received cash payments of $NIL (2016 - $11,000) for management fees.  Contractual Obligations  As a "smaller reporting company", we are not required to provide tabular disclosure obligations.  Going Concern  As of January 31, 2017, our company had a net loss of $16,360 and has earned no revenues. Our company intends to fund operations through equity financing arrangements, which may be insufficient to fund its capital expenditures, working capital and other cash requirements for the year ending July 31, 2017. The ability of our company to emerge from the development stage is dependent upon, among other things, obtaining additional financing to continue operations, and development of our business plan. In response to these problems, management intends to raise additional funds through public or private placement offerings. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about our company's ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.  Table of Contents  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to stockholders.  Critical Accounting Policies  The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management's application of accounting policies. We believe that understanding the basis and nature of the estimates and assumptions involved with the following aspects of our financial statements is critical to an understanding of our financial statements.  Use of Estimates  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. The estimates and judgments will also affect the reported amounts for certain revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these good faith estimates and judgments.  Mar 14, 2017  (c) 1995-2017 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc. All Rights Reserved

services to improve search engine optimization, and expand our marketing efforts
through professional and social networking. We also expect to deploy additional
capital by contracting part-time lecturers to present or our ICD-10 and
management seminars at corporate and professional meetings. We believe that
such seminars are both a minor profit center as well as an adjunct to our
over-all marketing efforts.

In order to achieve maximum leverage from our marketing efforts, we will focus
on developing and promoting Internet web based seminars (Webinars), which in
addition to providing the specific information the attendees will be seeking,
will highlight our multiple training and consulting abilities. It is also
common in local healthcare settings (hospital staff, group practices) to present
a live seminar to a small group of attendees and provide it to a wider audience
via a live Internet feed. We expect to provide these seminars at no cost to the
sponsoring entity, which will pay the entire cost of providing the venue and
Internet connectivity.  Initially our officers will conduct the live seminars
and will not be compensated.  The minimum proceeds of this offering ($15,000 for
marketing) will allow us to proceed with the low-cost seminar/Webinar approach
to promoting our services by developing seminar content and integrating it with
the website.
 
With the maximum proceeds of our offering, in addition to the small seminar/ 
Webinars previously discussed, we will seek opportunities to provide full day 
seminars at professional meetings, such as the local or state medical
association, specialty associations, nursing associations, and healthcare
management associations. The additional $40,000 available for marketing if the
maximum amount of our offering is achieved will be sufficient to develop scripts
and audiovisual content for several full day seminars.  We hope that the success
of the small seminar/Webinar platform will help us establish the credibility to
present at larger venues.  Such associations have stringent criteria for
choosing seminar providers and we cannot reliability predict if we will be
successful in obtaining such opportunities.  All of our web development,
audiovisual materials and printed seminar materials are equally applicable to
either the small or large venues so the application of funds available from a
successful minimum offering to that of the maximum offering will result in a
seamless increase in the velocity with which we achieve our marketing
activities.
 
The amount allocated to working capital is arbitrary and is budgeted due to the
uncertainty of cash flow from our operations. If cash flow from operations is
sufficient to pay our on-going expenses we expect to hold these funds in
reserve.
 
We believe the anticipated minimum proceeds of this offering ($40,000), together
with cash on hand and anticipated cash flow from operating activities, will
allow us to conduct our operations for at least the next 12 months if the
minimum number of shares is sold and for an indeterminate longer time if the
maximum number of shares is sold.

There are no underwriting commissions involved in this offering.  Our common
stock will be sold on our behalf by our officers and directors.  Our officers
and directors will not receive any commissions or proceeds from the offering for
selling the shares on our behalf.


The healthcare management business is competitive and among qualified
participants has low barriers to entry. We compete locally, and will eventually
compete on a statewide basis, with a variety of primarily local companies that
offer similar services as ours. Based on our review of advertisements and
Internet web sites, we believe the majority of these companies are entrenched in
the conventional healthcare system and are themselves struggling to adapt to the
new requirements of healthcare as defined by the emerging standards of
accountable care. Others appear to be knowledgeable about the ICD-10 standards,
coding, and their possible impact on reimbursement rates. We hope to form
strategic alliances with companies that have demonstrable expertise in
specialized areas. Some of these companies have had many more years of business
experience, have proprietary processes, or have greater financial and personnel
resources, including marketing and sales organizations, and may be able to
provide their services at lower rates. We do not believe any one company holds
a dominant share of the local or statewide market on which we are focused.


Company Description
Panamera Healthcare Corporation offers management and consulting services to
healthcare organizations that are increasingly facing various stresses including
financial, organizational and information technology challenges. The reasons for
these stresses are multifactorial and include long-standing


 trends in
healthcare, but also include recent challenges brought about by the Affordable
Care Act, the mandated implementation of ICD-10-CM/PCS (International
Classification of Diseases, 10th Edition, Clinical Codification/Procedure Coding
System, "ICD-10"), and economic factors related to varying and uncertain
reimbursement rates.

Our initial contracts are with consulting firms that offer services similar to
ours but lack expertise in certain areas. The market is so vast that at this
point in our development we do not consider such collaborations as a threat to
our business, and we believe that collaboration may result in long-term benefits
to us.
