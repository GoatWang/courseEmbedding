Walker Products       Processor Vessels 
            Walker stainless steel process vessels meet or exceed customer application specifications because flexibility, efficiency and convenience features are built in.  Our premier process vessels are used in the processing of food, dairy, beverage, fine chemical and personal care products where there is a need for agitation matched to the process, controlled temperature transfer, or aseptic processing that requires an ASME pressure vessel.  We design to meet United States Public Health Service requirements and build to 3-A Sanitary Standards.  ASME, CRN and PED code stamping are available.      Mixer Vessels
            Walker stainless steel mixer vessels combine a host of design features for unprecedented processing flexibility for a variety of food, chemical, and pharmaceutical product applications.   From gentle agitation through mixing light, medium and heavy, viscous products, Walker has the perfect solution.        Storage Tanks
            Every stainless steel storage tank fabricated by Walker Engineered Products stands as proof of durability, convenience, and built-in efficiencies.  From round horizontal stainless steel storage tanks to vertical storage silos holding up to 70,000 gallons, Walker tanks serve the dairy, beverage and food processing industries. All Walker units meet or exceed 3A or USDA standards.       Tank Heads
            Walker is a prominent manufacturer of hydroformed tank heads.  We utilize various metals to shape stress-free tank heads that are polished, machined and beveled to perfection so they can be moved directly into a customer fabrication facility.  Walker has regulatory agency approvals from ASME, CRN, and PED.    Walker Fabrication and Engineering Capabilities        
            Custom Stainless Steel Fabrication Capabilities
            Walker can meet all customer specialized applications.  We build to print or we work with our customers to develop the exact stainless steel vessel for their requirements.  Or the resourceful engineers at Walker come up with their own customer-friendly innovations, such as the USDA-accepted horizontal CIP agitator.      
            Engineering Capabilities
            Walker has invested a lot of resources into research and design.  We use 3D modeling and design to render a more realistic picture of proposed pressure vessel design, for example, so our customer can see the vessel in real position.  We use finite element analysis to assure our customer that a vessel complies with seismic and wind load codes. Using integrated MRP to lay out a critical path and schedule improves our customer service from estimation to timely delivery.

If you have trouble walking, 1800wheelchair.com's walking aid store has the adult walkers, rollators, canes, crutches and walker accessories you need to help yourself become more mobile.  Whether you're looking for something to help your endurance or a little extra additional stability, we carry a full line of mobility products.
Walking aids come in all shapes, sizes and colors, and it can be difficult to determine which is the right one for you.  Our goal is to make your life easier.  Mobility is our job, and we take pride in helping you find the right tool to begin leading a more active lifestyle.  The following is a short guide to get you started on the path to a more mobile and independent life.  Our friendly customer service representatives are standing by to answer any questions you may have and give you all the information you're looking for. Please remember to consult with your doctor for medical advice.
Before purchasing a walking aid, you should properly assess your current mobility level. A healthy and relatively active person who becomes easily fatigued has different mobility needs than someone experiencing difficulty walking short distances. Here are some general guidelines to help you determine your mobility needs:

High Mobility Level:  You're in good health and still active yet need a little extra assistance.  Perhaps lately it seems that getting up out of a chair requires some extra effort. Maybe you find yourself getting tired and needing a break after too much time on your feet.  If this sounds like your situation, you may be looking for a walking aid to help your endurance, assist in transferring to your feet more easily, and maintain a normal gait. Products we suggest include: standard cane, seat cane, or a 3 and 4-wheel rollator.
Medium Mobility Level: Do you find stairs difficult and time-consuming?   Is your energy drained after walking more than a few minutes?  Or perhaps you need help establishing a sturdy base for your body.  You may be looking for stability, support and balance offered by the following products:   quad cane, standard adult walker, 2 wheel walker & 4 wheel rolling walkers.
Low Mobility Level: Do you have trouble getting to your feet from a seated position? Is walking even just a few steps strenuous?  You may find that a sturdy walking aid with four feet on the ground at all times will improve mobility and offer more independence. For you, we suggest the following items: large base quad cane, standard adult walker.
Sizing: Important to the purchase of any walking aid is fitting the user with the correct size.  We offer our large selection of products designed for users over 300 lbs., which we call heavy duty.  Many of our products are customizable for both standard sizes and the bariatric user.
Most importantly, you should always do some research beforehand, and always consult your doctor. Buy your walking aids with confidence. Rollings, walkers without wheels, canes, and crutches: we carry all top walking aid brands, like Dolomite Walkers. Do you need more information? Questions about available colors or other details? Please call our customer service department at 1-800-320-7140.

The brand's history traces back to the year 1908, when William A. Walker and his sons, Williard and Warren, started a 'Walker Operation'. In 1912, they began manufacturing ‘tire savers’, which took the weight off the tires when cars were stored for the winter. In 1916, a new production facility was built in Wisconsin, and the name 'Walker Manufacturing Company' was officially introduced. Later on, Walker became one of the leading jack manufacturers.

In 1932, the company patented its first but not last innovative product, the louvered tube that transformed the mufflers of the day, which were little more than tin cans. Thanks to the louvered tube muffler, Walker was first recognized as the industry leader. The company continued its line of innovations and created the first stainless steel muffler in 1941. With a growing number of vehicles on the road, the need for limiting pollutants arose, and in 1978, after years of researching and designing the forerunners of today's emissions control devices, Walker developed the first aftermarket catalytic converter.

Browse Wishlist    Weight22 lbsDimensions26 x 11 x 28 in2 reviews for R-3600 – 3-Wheel – 15 lbs 5 out of 5 vpapa4 – February 7, 2017:This is an outstanding rollator-walker, and I recommend it very highly. It has a sturdy steel frame, and yet is nicely lightweight at about 13 pounds. Having 3 wheels, it is narrow and its size makes it convenient for going through indoor doorways. It folds easily to a narrow width for easy placement in our car’s trunk, or even behind the front seat of our car. The hand brakes are easy to use and hold well. There are some especially unique features about this rollator. Its height is adjustable so that it can be comfortably used by someone over 6’ tall.  We have greatly appreciated that feature for my tall husband, so that he doesn’t need to be bent over to walk with it. Its wide 8” wheels give it stability and its movement is very nice for walking. It comes with a useful snap on pouch and a very handy and easily removable metal basket. There is a convenient tray that can be placed over that basket to hold items such as a drink or newspaper. We particularly find it useful to place a flashlight on top of that tray for walking in the dark in our home at night – making it have its own “headlight.” In every way, this is a well-made and excellent rollator-walker. usmedicalsupplies.com – December 21, 2012:It is Great This walker is better than pickets on a shirt!!!!!

BBB Reason for Ratings


        BBB rating is based on 13 factors: Get the details about the factors considered.
























BBB Reports On









Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration. Better Business Bureau encourages you to check with the appropriate agency to be certain any requirements are currently being met.
                    





Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.
                    





Government Actions









                        BBB reports on known significant government actions involving the business's marketplace conduct.
                    





Out of Business









                        BBB reports on a company that is out of business for three years from the date the company closes its doors or ceases to do business.
                    





Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.
                    





Bankruptcy









                        BBB reports on a business’s bankruptcy as long as the business remains in bankruptcy.
                    





Mail Returned









                        BBB reports when mail sent to the business was returned by the Postal Service.

As you grow older, or if you have certain medical conditions, you may need to be seen more frequently. Why choose Walmart? Consider the following advantages offered at our optical centers. Value you can count on: You're already familiar with Walmart's Every Day Low Prices. And our commitment to providing our customers with the top brands at low prices is only the beginning. We offer free in-store pickup and free shipping on qualifying purchases. So you can visit our Vision Center today or shop online at your convenience without having to pay a penny more. The convenience you need: We know how busy you are. Why make an extra trip when you can have your eyes examined, pick out new glasses or buy contacts right where you shop? Styles you want: Walmart's Vision Center stocks the best brands and hottest styles in eyewear. Whether you shop in-store or online, you're sure to find a style to flatter your face and express your own unique personality. Tips for Eyeglass Shopping  Flatter your face Best for oval faces: All shapes. Because oval-shaped faces have balanced features and gentle curves, they can wear nearly any frame shape. To add a little pizzazz, try square and rectangular frames, which contrast with your facial structure. Avoid frames that are overly large or too small to maintain the natural balance of your features. Best for round faces: Square, rectangular and angular. Angular shapes play off of your fuller cheeks and rounded chin. Other shapes to try include those that upsweep at the corners to emphasize your eyes. Best for square faces: Oval and round frames. Your facial structure is characterized by straight lines, including a square chin and a broad forehead. Choose frames with soft, rounded edges to balance the lines of your face, while allowing your features to shine. Best for a heart shaped face: Varies. There's no set rule. Look for frames that balance the varying widths of your facial features. For example, bottom-heavy frames balance the narrowness of the lower half of your face, while oval shapes can soften a more pointed chin. Frame materials Choose a frame material that offers the right balance between durability and design. Plastic, or zyl, frames are lightweight and pretty sturdy. They also offer one of the widest color ranges available. If you want something a little more sleek and modern, metal frames such as titanium, beryllium or monel deliver the style you are looking for. Hinge styles Don't forget about the importance of hinges. Standard barrel hinges are easy to repair and durable, but they aren't very flexible. If you're hard on your glasses, you may want to opt for flex hinges, which feature a tiny spring that gives the arms of the glasses a little extra movement, making them ideal for active adults and kids. Shopping Tips for Contact LensesWalmart Vision Centers are the one-stop eye care shop you can rely on for everything from prescription glasses and sunglasses to contact lenses. To help you pick the right contacts for you, consider the following factors: Types of contact lenses Best for people who want easy care: Disposable contact lenses. Use them once, then throw them away. These lenses should be removed at the end of each day. Although they are convenient, they tend to be more expensive than standard daily wear soft contact lenses. Best for people who don't mind a little extra maintenance: Daily wear. These reusable contact lenses require removal and cleaning at the end of every day. They can last up to one year, and they're one of the most economical options. Your optician can help provide recommendations about the types of cleaning solutions available. Best for people who don't want to remove their lenses every day: Extended wear lenses. Extended wear contact lenses are designed to wear continually for one to four weeks. Although they're convenient, sleeping in contacts can increase your chances of developing an eye infection, so be sure to talk to a Walmart Vision Center professional before choosing extended wear contacts for the first time. Contact lens brands If you already wear contact lenses, you may want to stick with the brand you're familiar with. But if you're new to contacts or interested in trying something new, you're in luck. Walmart's Vision Center carries all the major brand names that you trust at low prices you can count on. Whether you need new glasses, new contacts or a quick checkup, we're here to help. Schedule your next eye exam at the Walmart Vision Center nearest you.Show moreElectrode, Comp-166904567, DC-prod-dal1, ENV-prod-a, PROF-PROD, VER-1.15.0, SHA-06ca1a9068b558bd33bd1add57a0b13a52090f9f, CID-

Medications like prescription drugs and headache tablets are among the most likely things that you find in any medicine cabinet, but not the only things. Medicine takes many forms and can be in tubes, packets and bottles. There are medications specifically for adults, children and babies. Not everything found in a medicine cabinet is even medicine, although they are usually health-related. When you want to stock up your medicine cabinet, we have what you need, all at Every Day Low Prices.Pain relieversPain relievers come in three basic forms: aspirin, acetaminophen and Ibuprofen. A less common form is naproxen. For headaches and joint pain, acetaminophen, ibuprofen and naproxen are most effective. For muscle soreness use ibuprofen or naproxen. All four are effective on back, neck and shoulder pain and migraines.There are also specialty pain relievers that target joint and muscle pain, arthritis pain, menstrual cramps, urinary tract pain or migraine headaches. Some are designed specifically for children. Various pain relievers are designed for taking prior to going to bed since they cause drowsiness. These come in pill, caplet and capsule form and some children's mediation is available in flavored liquid form. There are also balms, creams and sprays that you can use for muscle and other topical pain.Cough, cold and fluWhen you or someone you love gets sick or is getting sick, it helps to have some medicine on hand to help ease the symptoms and lessen the severity and length of the illness. Items to have in your medicine cabinet include decongestants for stuffy noses and congested coughs, cough syrup and cough drops to treat coughs and sore throats, nasal sprays to relieve hay fever and allergy symptoms, chest rubs to reduce congestion and fever reducers to keep fevers from elevating too high. For chest congestion, an expectorant can help loosen phlegm and help you breathe and sleep better. Another item that can help reduce the severity of a cold is medicated vaporizing liquid (you will need an electric or battery-powered vaporizer).Digestion and nauseaFor people who deal with upset stomachs, diarrhea, indigestion and other stomach maladies, there are many medications to alleviate these issues. Antacids and over-the-counter drugs like omeprazole held relieve heartburn, either in pill, chewable tablet, or effervescent tablet form. Laxatives and stool softeners help relieve consitpation and are available in pill, liquid and suppository form. Fiber supplements and anti-diarrheal medications, such as loperamide, are designed to relieve diarrhea.There are also medications that can relieve several of these symptoms if they occur simultaneously. It's helpful to have medications that help relieve nausea or motion sickness.AllergiesAntihistamines and medications, such as fexofenadine, cetirizine, diphenhydramine and loratadine, all available over the counter at Walmart, can relive the symptoms associated with allergies. Whether you are afflicted by grass or tree pollens, pet dander or other air-borne substances, these medications can offer you relief for a few hours or all day. There are nasal sprays that offer immediate allergy relief as well.First aidJust like a fully stocked first aid kid, it always safe to be prepared and keep a good supply of first aid items handy in your medicine cabinet. There are numerous ointments and creams available that help heal cuts faster, relive the pain associated with burns and offer antibacterial and antibiotic properties. With many of these ointments, it is necessary to protect the affected area with bandages, and we have many different brands and styles.Rubbing alcohol and hydrogen peroxide are must-have items for keeping wounds clean and disinfected. For sprains, tape and flexible bandages can help add needed support. For sunburns, there are sprays and creams that lessen the pain and severity of the sunburn. Eye drops can help relieve eye pain, and eye wash can help clear the eyes of foreign objects.Other itemsThe list of other items that are useful in your home's medicine cabinet can run a wide gamut. Dental-related items like toothbrushes, toothpaste, dental floss and mouthwash are common items as are thermometers for checking temperatures. A well-stocked medicine cabinets helps you to be prepared for minor illnesses and first aid. Always talk with your doctor or pharmacist before taking any medications.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
