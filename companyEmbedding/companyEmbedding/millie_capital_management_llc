Welcome to Millie Capital Management LLCMillie Capital Management LLC, founded in 1991, is an SEC-registered investment advisory firm. We design investment plans for high net worth clients, and implement the portfolio management requirements of each plan.MCM uses time-tested principles of University endowments to protect and carefully manage client wealth. We select individual securities as well as funds. We screen investments so as to diminish risks to the environment or personal health.info@milliecapital.com








Our ServicesFinancial and Investment PlanningWe seek to optimize portfolio construction after considering all relevant client circumstances. This includes review of assets owned, loans, insurance, current and future household budgets, and family wealth transfer plans.   Learn MoreSpecialized ServicesSome clients were fortunate to build wealth through a private business that grew into a publicly-traded one. When a large portion of one’s net worth is tied up in a single stock or company, we can consult on building a path to diversification and optimizing the tax expense of doing so. The best time to start on this specialized service is early in the high growth phase of the business. We are also portfolio managers for the endowments of charitable organizations, and can tailor portfolios to their additional requirements.Financial CalculatorsWe provide access to a system of financial calculators that can help clients to build a framework for further discussions with us, concerning many of their financial decisions. While we cannot guarantee the accuracy of the inputs or the results obtained in any generic calculator, we encourage clients to build some scenarios and print them out for our review in the course of our ongoing financial counsel.Learn More

DIFFERENTIATED FROM OTHER WEALTH ADVISORS
We carry professional Errors and Omissions Insurance. We have a relatively large average portfolio size of $4.5 million. At that level, our annual fee is less than 0.81% of portfolio market value. We have continuously provided registered investment advisor services since 1991, as a fiduciary. We screen individual securities on socially responsibility grounds. We use two well-recognized, low cost national firms for custody and brokerage services: Schwab Institutional and Ameritrade Institutional.



 

Investment Process
We select all securities after considering a wide variety of research reports. Typical sources are J.P. Morgan, Goldman Sachs, Credit Suisse, and RBC, and these detailed reports provide a baseline for additional screening. We obtain all reports electronically, and can read them the day they are published. In certain market environments, we may also emphasize certain industries or sectors, such as health care or information technology, if their characteristics and outlook are better than for the economy in general. We also obtain research from respected economists, as we scan for incipient signs of recessions and recoveries.

Our Services





Financial Advisory and Planning
We seek to optimize portfolio construction after considering all relevant client circumstances.  This includes review of assets owned, loans, insurance, current and future household budgets, and family wealth transfer plans.  We then seek to understand a client’s risk tolerance, and financial goals.  Finally we present a recommended portfolio structure, and estimate the future returns and volatility of such a structure.
After portfolio management commences, we continue to counsel on client financial issues, including updating the estimated maximum withdrawal rate of cash for the retirement years.  We endeavor to meet with each client at least annually.
As a fiduciary to each client, our recommendations are based on what is in the client’s best interest.  Many others in the investment industry, such as brokers working on commissions, do not adhere to this standard.
Personal Portfolio Management 
Following our financial planning work, we implement the client's asset management needs.  We develop an Investment Policy Statement, linking the financial planning goals to long term investment returns that a well diversified portfolio has historically generated.  As client needs evolve, that client's Personal Portfolio Management can also be adjusted.  We have 25 years' experience selecting individual securities for personal portfolios.  We also use certain specialized, low-cost mutual funds and exchange-traded funds, where appropriate.  We report on portfolio progress each quarter, providing comparisons with the appropriate asset class benchmarks.

Welcome to Millie Capital Management LLCMillie Capital Management LLC, founded in 1991, is an SEC-registered investment advisory firm. We design investment plans for high net worth clients, and implement the portfolio management requirements of each plan.MCM uses time-tested principles of University endowments to protect and carefully manage client wealth. We select individual securities as well as funds. We screen investments so as to diminish risks to the environment or personal health.info@milliecapital.com








Our ServicesFinancial and Investment PlanningWe seek to optimize portfolio construction after considering all relevant client circumstances. This includes review of assets owned, loans, insurance, current and future household budgets, and family wealth transfer plans.   Learn MoreSpecialized ServicesSome clients were fortunate to build wealth through a private business that grew into a publicly-traded one. When a large portion of one’s net worth is tied up in a single stock or company, we can consult on building a path to diversification and optimizing the tax expense of doing so. The best time to start on this specialized service is early in the high growth phase of the business. We are also portfolio managers for the endowments of charitable organizations, and can tailor portfolios to their additional requirements.Financial CalculatorsWe provide access to a system of financial calculators that can help clients to build a framework for further discussions with us, concerning many of their financial decisions. While we cannot guarantee the accuracy of the inputs or the results obtained in any generic calculator, we encourage clients to build some scenarios and print them out for our review in the course of our ongoing financial counsel.Learn More

DIFFERENTIATED FROM OTHER WEALTH ADVISORS
We carry professional Errors and Omissions Insurance. We have a relatively large average portfolio size of $4.5 million. At that level, our annual fee is less than 0.81% of portfolio market value. We have continuously provided registered investment advisor services since 1991, as a fiduciary. We screen individual securities on socially responsibility grounds. We use two well-recognized, low cost national firms for custody and brokerage services: Schwab Institutional and Ameritrade Institutional.



 

Investment Process
We select all securities after considering a wide variety of research reports. Typical sources are J.P. Morgan, Goldman Sachs, Credit Suisse, and RBC, and these detailed reports provide a baseline for additional screening. We obtain all reports electronically, and can read them the day they are published. In certain market environments, we may also emphasize certain industries or sectors, such as health care or information technology, if their characteristics and outlook are better than for the economy in general. We also obtain research from respected economists, as we scan for incipient signs of recessions and recoveries.
