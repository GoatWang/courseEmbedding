Arguments and Arguing

                The Products and Process of Human Decision Making                

                Third Edition                
Thomas A. Hollihan, Kevin T. Baaske
The latest edition of Arguments and Arguing contains the same balance of theory and practice, breadth of coverage, current and relevant examples, and accessible writing style that made previous editions so popular in hundreds of classrooms. The authors draw from classic and recent argumentation theory and research, contextualized with well-chosen examples, to showcase a narrative style of argumentation and the values and attitudes of audiences. Readers learn how to employ both formal and informal argumentative strategies in an array of communication forums�from interpersonal interactions to academic debate to politics to business. A newly added chapter on visual argumentation and a striking color photo insert demonstrate the value and power of visual elements in the construction of arguments.

The ability to argue is necessary if people are to solve problems, resolve conflicts, and evaluate alternative courses of action. While many are taught that arguing is counterproductive and arguments should be avoided, Hollihan and Baaske illustrate that arguing is an essential and fundamental human activity. Learning the art of effective argumentation entails a grasp of not only the strategies and principles of analysis and logical reasoning but also the importance of arguing in a positive and socially constructive fashion.

Reviews
�This text not only examines argument as an action but also how argument develops as an activity.�  � Shane Puckett, Louisiana Tech University

�Excellent text, with appropriate traditional argumentative theory and relevant advanced rhetorical theory. Easy to adapt to all varieties of argument courses. Extremely well organized and well written.�  � Russell T. Church, Middle Tennessee State University

�I enjoyed the text very much. My students found the material accessible and appreciated its affordability.�  � Mary Husain, California State University, Fresno

�The best and most teachable argumentation text I have read in years. Bless the authors for a text that focuses on argumentative concepts and not contest debating. Most of my students are pre-law or public relations and political communications majors, so this text will serve them well.�  �Don J. Stanton, Southwest Missouri State University

�A fine text. It offers an excellent balance of theory and practical application elements that allow me to offer students a complete resource.�  �Brendan Kelly, University of West Florida

PROFESSIONAL BUSINESS CARDS


“The BUSINESS CARD is one of the most important pieces of professional or personal identity.  It is sometimes the only piece of information left behind after a contact is made; just a small, but insistent, reminder of a person after their physical presence is gone. Everybody has a business card: all sizes and types of  businesses and professions. It is the common denominator at all business meetings or personal contacts.”
