National Bank Holdings Corporation About Us










About Us
 
National Bank Holdings Corporation is a bank holding company created to build a leading community bank franchise delivering high quality client service and committed to shareholder results. National Bank Holdings Corporation operates a network of 86 banking centers located in Colorado, the greater Kansas City region and Texas. Through the Company's subsidiary, NBH Bank, it operates under the following brand names: Bank Midwest in Kansas and Missouri, Community Banks of Colorado in Colorado, and Hillcrest Bank in Texas.
 
Our Beliefs
 
Common sense has never been common. If it were, the world would be a different place.
Things would run smoothly and on time. People would do what they say and say what they do. Everything would be fair, without all the small type.
And banks would only sell you what you need. When your banker looked at you they wouldn't just see a number, they'd see a dad or a mom or a graduate or a business owner. They'd understand the complexities of people's lives and offer simple solutions.
That's why we bank with common sense and we invite you to do the same.
That means straight talk, personal attention, and sensible, clear decisions from real people. No jibber jabber, no smoke and mirrors and no passing the buck. And no making you talk to a machine when what you need is a person.
If that makes sense to you, then you might be right for us.
And we might be right for you.
Where Common Sense Lives.
For more information, please view the video below.


 
Our Community Service
 
We've been told time again that getting the fundamentals right is the best way we can help the community. But we're not satisfied with that answer. We'd like to help in other ways too. That's why as a bank and as individuals, we put aside some time and money to help out. Here are a few things we do.
We help people understand money.
It's just common sense that people who understand what they're signing make better decisions, so we dedicate a portion of our time to providing financial education to our clients and the public. We also support institutions and other efforts in the community to improve people's understanding of financial products and how they work.
We help people find work.
If you want to work, we think you should be able to work. So we are dedicated to helping those who want to work get the jobs they are looking for. Not only do we hire a diverse range of local people ourselves, but we also volunteer for and support organizations that help people get back on their feet and move forward with their plans.
We help people find quality housing.
Without affordable housing, it's hard for people to get back on their feet and find the jobs they're looking for. That's why, in addition to providing financing for individual homes and developments, we also support organizations that provide quality low-income housing.

GREENWOOD VILLAGE, Colo., June 26, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- National Bank Holdings Corporation (NYSE:   NBHC, "NBH" or the "Company"), the parent company of NBH Bank, and privately owned Peoples, Inc. ("Peoples"), the bank holding company of Colorado-based Peoples National Bank and Kansas-based Peoples Bank, jointly announced today that they have entered into a definitive agreement for NBH to acquire Peoples, building NBH's scale in the home markets of the Colorado Front Range and the greater Kansas City region. 








"The transaction with Peoples bolsters our presence in our home markets of the Colorado Front Range and the greater Kansas City region.  More specifically, the acquisition provides a strong market position in the attractive Colorado Springs and Overland Park markets and expands our franchise into northern New Mexico.  In addition, we believe Peoples brings us one of the strongest retail Mortgage Banking platforms based within a community bank.  We expect this transaction will be strongly accretive and will accelerate NBH's trajectory toward our financial targets," said NBH CEO, Tim Laney.
The transaction adds approximately $865 million of assets, $483 million of loans held for investment and $719 million of deposits, as well as a complementary franchise-centric retail mortgage business, which originates over $1.0 billion of mortgage loans per year. Moreover, Peoples brings over 140 years of experience in serving its communities and the same dedication to common sense banking that has been at the core of NBH's success. 
"We believe that our companies are stronger together and that we share a common vision for delivering great returns by building quality relationships with our clients," Mr. Laney added.  "This merger will combine the best of both of our organizations and we look forward to welcoming Peoples' terrific team of bankers to our company."  
Wint Winter Jr., Chairman and CEO of Peoples, added "We are very pleased to be joining NBH. Our family has built Peoples over the past 5 decades with a focus on caring for our customers, employees and the communities we serve.  We found those same values at NBH and are proud to partner with the NBH family."
Under the terms of the agreement, Peoples shareholders will receive approximately $36.3 million of cash consideration and approximately 3.4 million shares of NBH common stock, subject to certain potential adjustments. The transaction, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter, has a value of $143 million in the aggregate, based on NBH's closing price of $31.55 on June 23, 2017. In addition, as part of the agreement, Peoples will divest or wind down its national mortgage business, operated out of its Kansas-based Peoples Bank by the end of 2017. 
NBH expects the transaction to result in a high-teens accretion to earnings per share in the first full year of operations, less than a 5% dilution to tangible book value with an earn back period of less than 3 years, and an internal rate of return of approximately 20%.
The transaction has been unanimously approved by the Board of Directors of each company and is subject to normal regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.  The required approval of Peoples' shareholders has been obtained.
Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, A Stifel Company, served as financial advisor to NBH in connection with this transaction and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz served as NBH's legal counsel. The Capital Corporation served as financial advisor to Peoples in connection with this transaction and Lathrop Gage LLP served as Peoples' legal counsel.

About Non-GAAP Financial Measures Certain of the financial measures and ratios we present, including "tangible book value" and "tangible book value per share" metrics, are supplemental measures that are not required by, or are not presented in accordance with, U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). We refer to these financial measures and ratios as "non-GAAP financial measures." We consider the use of select non-GAAP financial measures and ratios to be useful for financial and operational decision making and useful in evaluating period-to-period comparisons. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance by excluding certain expenditures or assets that we believe are not indicative of our primary business operating results or by presenting certain metrics on a fully taxable equivalent basis. We believe that management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting, analyzing and comparing past, present and future periods. 
These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP and you should not rely on non-GAAP financial measures alone as measures of our performance. The non-GAAP financial measures we present may differ from non-GAAP financial measures used by our peers or other companies. We compensate for these limitations by providing the equivalent GAAP measures whenever we present the non-GAAP financial measures and by including a reconciliation of the impact of the components adjusted for in the non-GAAP financial measure so that both measures and the individual components may be considered when analyzing our performance. 
The Company does not provide a reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to its comparable GAAP financial measures because it could not do so without unreasonable effort due to the unavailability of the information needed to calculate reconciling items and the variability, complexity and limited visibility of the adjusting items that would be excluded from the non-GAAP financial measures in future periods. When planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods, the Company does so primarily on a non-GAAP basis without preparing a GAAP analysis as that would require estimates for various cash and non-cash reconciling items (including items such as expected credit losses, stock-based compensation, acquisition- and disposition-related expenses, and restructuring costs) that would be difficult to predict with reasonable accuracy. For example, future expectations for credit losses depend on a variety of factors including general economic conditions that make estimation on a GAAP basis impractical.  Similarly, equity compensation expense would be difficult to estimate because it depends on the Company's future hiring and retention needs, as well as the future fair market value of the Company's common stock, all of which are difficult to predict and subject to constant change. It is also difficult to anticipate the need for or magnitude of a presently unforeseen one-time restructuring expenses. As a result, the Company does not believe that a GAAP reconciliation to forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures would provide meaningful supplemental information about the Company's forward-looking measures.
