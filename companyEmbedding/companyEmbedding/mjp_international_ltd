Heading toward a Sustainable Energy future
Meeting the challenges of a sustainable energy system











The world’s population is growing – the demand for energy is growing faster. This presents four core challenges for a sustainable energy system: security of supply, affordability, climate protection, and resource efficiency. It will take ingenuity to succeed.
					






Our Mission
To develop and distribute green technologies to our customers that effectively meet market demand and decrease the use of energy by the Human population on a per-person basis. Through excellent operations, and internal culture, we seek to most efficiently produce and distribute integrated technologies to improve the lives of our customers, provide for our employees, and achieve superior return to our shareholders in socially responsible manner.






Our Vision
To be a world class manufacturer and distributor of socially and environmentally beneficial products that would form an integral piece of energy grids the world over. To be on the forefront of renewable energy technology and to develop and run ideas that would ensure safe and renewable energy for all generations to come. To fulfill our world class vision of a place where every being is able to produce a clean energy output excess regardless of the amount of energy they consume through technology developed by our company. 

















About Us
Green energy is good for everyone, and we strive to bring solar and wind technologies to all!

							Green energy is the way to go as the Earth requires a renewable energy source that does not deplete its natural resources. This is just good common sense and is the only meaningful legacy that we can leave for our children, instead of spending and squandering the resources that Earth has. 

We are MJP International Ltd. We are a company based in the United States and firmly believe in renewable energy as the way to go forwards. This would be the defining generation that determines if life on Earth can proceed the way we know or if the outlook in the future would just be immensely bleak.

holders will receive all proceeds from this offering.


Competition in the newly emerging LED illumination industry is quite strong and
there are numerous competitors offering both LED illumination products as well
as alternative illumination products such as CFLs. There are a number of
companies already active in the sale and distribution of LED illumination
products that are substantially larger and better funded than we are and that
have significantly longer histories in the respective marketplace. Our principal
competitors all have greater financial, technical, managerial, and marketing
resources than we have.

Companies providing the same product or alternative products are not the only
competitive factor in the emerging LED illumination industry. LED illumination
technology can be described as a destructive industry. Due to the exceptionally
long life span of LED products, there will be a major reduction in maintenance
cost for commercial buildings and transportation services. As a result LED
distributors may experience market resistance from outside pressures, such as
labour unions who may feel their jobs are being threatened.

Currently, there are a number of companies establishing LED illumination
products manufacturing facilities in China. This is mainly due to the relatively
cheap labour force and a well-established supply chain system within the
country. Mexico is currently a strong exporter to the North American lighting
industry but is gradually losing market share to China. As well, many production
facilities in Europe and the United States have already shut down. Philips,
OSRAM, and General Electric are currently closing down plants, and will
potentially cease operations entirely within the United States.

Key Competitors 

The LED illumination industry is comprised of many players. However, there are
four dominant multinational players who maintain well established brands,
distribution networks, and client relationships.

. Philips Lumileds : One of the leading manufacturers of high-power LEDs, 
  Philips has many advanced LED manufacturing and operations facilities which 
  stretch across the globe and is dedicated to increasing the adoption of 
  solid-state illumination solutions. Over the last few years, Philips Lumileds
  has introduced numerous LED products. The company also supplies core LED 
  material, such as chips and WAFER technology as well as LED packaging, and 
  manufactures billions of LEDs annually. 

. OSRAM Sylvania: One of the largest manufacturers of lighting products in the 
  world, selling products in more than 150 countries. OSRAM makes Sylvania and 
  OSRAM branded lighting products, including LEDs, for residential and 
  commercial applications. OSRAM’s Opto-Semiconductors division creates high 
  performance LEDs, and is involved in lighting research, product designs, and 
  builds electronic control systems used to make lighting products. 

. General Electric (GE): A mega-corporation that includes technology, media, and
  financial services operations. GE is a leader in innovation; the company’s 
  products have dominated the North American market for decades. However, they 
  appear to be taking a secondary role in energy efficient lighting technology.
  This lag may be due to the company’s short-lived venture into high efficient
  incandescent light. 

. CREE: Originally an exclusively WAFER manufacturer, now has a LED lighting 
  division which has provided Cree with key retrofit technologies that convert 
  existing lighting fixtures to energy-efficient lighting, and thereby 
  accelerate the adoption of LED lighting in the general illumination market. 

Although there are some trends towards consolidation, the general lighting
fixture market remains largely regionally segregated and fragmented. Local
market access in the lighting fixture industry is therefore important. MJP will
establish a presence in the Calgary market while at the same time maintain
strategic relationships with manufacturers in China. By conducting the company’s
product souring in China, MJP aims to position itself at the forefront of this
emerging competitive strategy.


Company Description
MJP International Ltd. was incorporated in the State of Nevada on October 24, 
2012. We are a development stage company; having entered into the development 
stage on October 24, 2012. Founded in Calgary, Canada, we aim to capitalize on 
new opportunities found in the North American market for LED


 lighting. With 
China as the manufacturing backbone of future LED products, we have set up 
office in Guangzhou, China in search of high quality products offered by 
reputable manufacturers to be introduced to Canada, the United States, and 
abroad. Our President and Chief Executive Officer, Chris Tong Tang spends more 
than 50% of his time in the Southern China region, including Guangzhou and Hong
Kong. While there, he operates from our Guangzhou office. In addition to seeing
suppliers and sourcing and inspecting products at factories, he is also 
actively seeking to develop a market for our products in that region. 
---

On December 17, 2012, we entered into a Share Exchange Agreement with MJP 
Lighting Solutions Ltd. and the shareholders of MJP Lighting Solutions Ltd. 
pursuant to which we acquired MJP Lighting Solutions Ltd. and MJP Holdings Ltd.,
as our wholly owned subsidiaries. As a result of the acquisition, we issued 
12,000,000 shares of common stock in exchange for 100 percent of the outstanding
common shares of MJP Lighting Solutions and MJP Holdings. 

MJP Lighting Solutions, a British Virgin Islands company, with its main office
located in Hong Kong, was incorporated in October 31, 2012. MJP Lighting
Solutions operated through its then wholly owned subsidiary, MJP Holdings, of
Alberta, Canada. MJP Holdings was incorporated on July 19, 2010 under the laws
of the province of Alberta, Canada. MJP Holdings specializes in the sale and
distribution of LED lighting and technology solutions.

On January 1, 2012 we received a Letter of Authorization from Gysun 
Opto-Electronic Co. Ltd. pursuant to which we were designated as an authorized 
dealer in Canada for all LED products produced by Gysun Opto-Electronic Co.

Our executive offices are located at Suite 2806, 505-6th Street SW, Calgary, 
Alberta, Canada T2P 1X5. Our telephone number is (403) 237–8330.
