Paycom Names Stacey Pezold as Executive VP of Operations
Thu, Oct 04, 2012 15:26 EST




Pezold continues excellence through developing Paycom customer service


Oklahoma City – Oct. 4, 2012 
Paycom, one of the fastest-growing online payroll and HR technology companies in the nation with over 20 locations coast-to-coast, is pleased to announce an important promotion within their senior leadership team. Stacey Pezold has been named Executive Vice President of Operations and is responsible for the entire operations team at Paycom’s corporate headquarters in Oklahoma City and operations in Dallas-Fort-Worth, where Paycom provides customer service and sales support. 

Pezold is charged with delivering a customer experience that is different than any other in the business. 

“Everything we do, we do with the customer in mind,” Pezold said. “Our customers use our single application for all things employee related from hiring to retiring.” 

The highlight of Paycom’s customer service model is their focus on one point of contact by providing a designated specialist for every customer to ensure a positive experience. Pezold believes that a knowledgeable service professional produces happy customers. 

"My goal is to offer our customers the most highly trained service professionals in the business, professionals who are 100 percent focused on providing solutions to our customers and have the most comprehensive knowledge of our business, our company and our product offerings
,” Pezold said.
 “
Also, our goal is to continue to educate and empower our service professionals and train them as a customer resource so they are equipped to handle all of our customers’ needs. Our customer service model translates into a positive customer experience because when they call Paycom they get answers from a single point of contact.”

Pezold has held many positions throughout her nine year tenure to prepare her for her new role. She began her career at Paycom as a sales representative at Paycom’s Tulsa office, was promoted to manager and opened Paycom’s Chicago office as a regional manager in 2008. 
Her previous experience as a sales representative for Paycom helped her identify what Paycom sales representatives needed to be successful. As a result, Pezold is responsible for training and developing some of Paycom’s top executive sales representatives and built a centralized training program, Paycom University, in 2009, featuring customized curriculum for sales and operations departments. In 2011, she received the Stevie Award for Sales Training Manager of the Year.

“We value our employees and want to be known as one of the best places to work across the nation,” Pezold said. “We strive for excellence in our company culture, our customer experience and our employee experience. With tremendous growth year-after-year, it’s critical we continue to develop strong leaders prepared to take us to the next level.” 

Pezold grew up in Tulsa and attended Jenks High School. She graduated from Oklahoma State University with a degree in Journalism: Public Relations. She resides in Edmond with her husband, 10-year-old son and 5-month-old daughter.

 About Us
 Founded in 1998 in Oklahoma City, Paycom revolutionized the payroll industry by being the first to offer mid-sized businesses an alternative to installed payroll software. Using Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) technology, Paycom delivered its cutting-edge payroll software over the Internet to provide employers real-time access to their payroll information. What started as a single application for Payroll has expanded to a feature-rich suite of services that includes Time and Attendance, HR, Benefits, COBRA, Background Checks, Tax Credits, Applicant Tracking, Document Management, Expense Management and On-Boarding/Off-Boarding.
While Paycom’s application has grown, so has its commitment to the 1-to-1 service model that guarantees customers one point of contact for all their inquiries. The personal support provided by dedicated Payroll Specialists and the improved efficiencies provided by Paycom’s payroll and HR technology creates a unique value proposition that has catapulted Paycom as a leader in the online, mid-market payroll space. Paycom converts thousands each year from the largest payroll providers in the country.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/28/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

As with all your investments through Fidelity, you must make your own determination whether an investment is appropriate for you.  Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.  Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.  Illiquidity is an inherent risk associated with investing in real estate and REITs.  There is no guarantee the issuer of a REIT will maintain the secondary market for its shares and redemptions may be at a price which is more or less than the original price paid.  Closed-end funds can trade at a discount to their NAV.  Shareholders of Master Limited Partnerships may be treated as partners for tax purposes.  Partnerships issue a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) rather than a Form 1099 form for tax purposes. It lists the partner's share of income, deductions, credits, etc.  Speak with your tax advisor to determine how this may affect you.
