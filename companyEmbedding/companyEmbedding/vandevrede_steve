Meet the Terra Tech ( TRTC ) Family: Anthony Fabrizio 
December 15, 2014December 14, 2014 / terratechderekpeterson  / Leave a comment




Anthony Fabrizio- Biochemical Research Specialist, Terra Tech Corp.  Anthony Fabrizio, graduated from the University of San Francisco with an
undergraduate degree in chemistry with an emphasis in biochemistry. Upon completion of his undergrad degree Fabrizio continued a masters research degree focusing on electron transfer energetics within water and how hydrogen-bonding networks are modulated by solvation of
simple solutes. This research lead to better fundamental understanding of the Nobel prize winning theory of electron transfer as well as how it relates to biological systems. Fabrizio’s first contact with cannabinoids and the endogenous systems which they regulate was as an undergraduate due to his struggle with epilepsy. As a patient who was suffering from 20 seizures a week, Fabrizio was consulted by a friend to try medical cannabis. Fabrizio did not act on the consultation for the first few days until his seizure frequency became unbearable. Fabrizio tried medical cannabis for the first time. After 3 days with no seizures, Fabrizio took it upon himself to search the scientific literature available to him to verify if academic studies had been conducted in regards to cannabis and epilepsy. To his amazement, he found many thousands of published articles which addressed cannabis and its effects on not only epilepsy, but cancer, neurodegenerative disease, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, PTSD, autoimmune diseases, among many other ailments.
This finding began Fabrizio’s 6 year journey into researching and understanding cannabis, its therapeutically active constituents, and their parent systems known as the endocannabinoid and endovanilloid systems which are involved in a plethora of metabolic and biological processes. It became obvious quite quickly that the body of scientific literature reveals these chemicals and systems as a treasure chest of research tools into understanding a variety of diseases as well their potential biochemical cause. Fabrizio’s research culminated in a career path in which Fabrizio specializes in extraction techniques and application of research to create targeted cannabinoid and terpene profiles that better fit the needs of each patient and their particular ailment. In addition, Fabrizio acts as a biochemical research consultant as it pertains to cannabinoid and terpenoid-based therapeutic applications in California, Nevada, and most recently Florida.

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Terra Tech Corp. (OTCMKTS:TRTC) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: No ratings tracked in the last 12 months.Consensus Rating:N/A (Score: NaN)Consensus Price Target: N/A

Steve Jobs: the five Apple products 'that changed the world'

Steve Jobs, the Apple founder and former CEO who died today aged 56, leaves a 
  lasting legacy in the form of his revolutionary inventions. Here are the 
  five core Apple products that changed the face of the technology, music and 
  publishing industries.

 iPod   In October 2001 the face of the music industry was changed forever with the launch of a small palm-sized gadget called "the iPod".  The rectangular-shaped portable music device had a central-scroll wheel on the front and a small window for song selection. It could be charged with a "docking station" and songs could be loaded directly onto the music player from a computer.  There had been digital music players before, but the fresh look and simplistic usability put the Apple player in a class of its own among portable music devises.

 The first iPod was available in 5GB and 10 GB models and could hold up to 1,000 songs. The name iPod for a personal music player was coined by Apple copywriter Vinnie Chieco who supposedly got the idea after watching the pods in 2001: A space Odyssey.  In pictures: Apple iPod - a history  The second generation of the iPod was launched in 2002 with a touch-sensitive scroll wheel. Throughout 2002, 600,000 iPods were sold and by the end of 2003 iPod sales hit the two million mark.  Apple sold its 100 millionth iPod in April 2007 making it the fastest selling music player in history.  To date there have been several iPod versions released including the nano, shuffle and touch. More than 275 million iPods have been sold around the world.   iTunes   In April 2003, just as the third-generation iPod was released, Apple launched its online music store iTunes with 200,000 songs.  Before iTunes, music executives had failed to be convinced about the success of an online music market. But coupled with Apple's hugely-successful iPod - launched just two years earlier - Steve Jobs proved it was a market worth exploring.  The product was an immediate success selling one million songs in its first week and by December it had sold 25 million songs. In 2010 iTune song downloads hit 10 billion.  There have been several updates of iTunes, the most significant being the introduction of film purchase and rentals in 2008. This week, Apple announced that iTunes will be accessibly across all their devices as part of their move into "cloud" computing.   iPhone    The first iPhone was released in January 2007 to a huge fanfare. The phone catapulted Apple ahead of its smartphone rivals with its multi-touch screen. A year later the iPhone 3G was released and the App Store was launched.  In July this year App Store downloads hit 15 billion with the company having launched App subscriptions just a few months earlier in February.  To date Apple have sold 125 million iPhones around the world (as of August 8, 2011). The telephone is still gaining popularity with avid Blackberry-user Barack Obama, the US president, even suggesting he may switch to the iPhone.  Yesterday Apple launched the iPhone 4S with its voice-control function Siri, which promises to revolutionise the way people use their phones (again).  Video: Apple iPhone 4S revealed   Mac   In front of thousands of laughing delegates, a tuxedo-clad Steve Jobs unveiled the first Macintosh computer in January 1984. It started as a small white box in a bag and evolved into the waffer-thin machine it is today.  A year later he was interviewed in Playboy explaining "something called a mouse".  The Mac evolved into two main types of Apple computer; the iMac and MacBook. There are now nearly 60 million Mac users around the world.   iPad    The iPad - a Mac/ iPhone hybrid - was released in 2010. Although still in its relatively early years, the iPad has been a great success; maintaining its market presence where other tablet computers have faltered.  The availability of Apps on the device has been a particular success with many newspapers and magazines having launched versions of their publications for the device. The portable tablet is currently teetering on revolutionising the publishing industry.  To date there have been two iPad versions with 28 million units sold worldwide (as of June 6, 2011).
