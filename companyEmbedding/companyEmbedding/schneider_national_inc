Q:6

         requirements must be met.



Q:7
Is Dial-up supported with CrossRoads?


A:7
Dial-up access has been tested to work, however the experience will 
         be optimized via broadband connection.  Keep in mind that dial-up service is traditionally slow.



Q:8
My computer does not satisfy the security requirements, 
         what is this?


A:8
Typically this error will occur if the "Host Checker" takes to long to 
         respond to the server.  Click on "Try Again" to continue logging into the service.If that 
         does not correct the issue, please click here to manually install the Host Checker.



Q:9
Connecting to the CrossRoads service seems slow


A:9
At certain peak times of the day (generally, afternoons and evenings), 
         traffic on the Internet increases and can cause congestion and slow responses from web sites - 
         even with a cable modem or DSL connection.  If you experience slow response from a web site, 
         try the site at a later time.



Q:10
What does the "Host Checker" screen mean?


A:10
The "Host Checker" is the security check done on computers connecting 
         into the CrossRoads service.  This check is run to protect the Schneider network and 
         Schneider associate personal data from spyware or Malware.



Q:11
I get a warning saying that "There are other user sessions 
         in progress", what does this mean?


A:11
This warning indicates that you had another session open when you 
         logged back into this one.  Click "Continue the Session" to continue logging in.  This will 
         clean up the first session and allow you into the service.



Q:12
What does the "Cache cleaner" screen mean?


A:12
The "Cache Cleaner" is a service that is run to clean up Schneider 
         information that may be stored on non-Schneider computers when the user finishes their 
         session.  This protects Schneider's data.



Q:13
What is the blue icon that shows up in my task bar 
         after I login?


A:13
This icon is the "Host Checker" portion of the service, which 
         ensures that your computer is secure while using the CrossRoads service.  This does not 
         run while you are not connected to Schneider.If you donÂt properly sign out, this 
         service will continue to run for 15 minutes and then automatically shutdown.



Q:14
After I login I get a gear-like icon in my task bar, what is this?
         


A:14
You will see this icon only when you are connected with Schneider 
         computer.  This application creates the ability for your computer to access internal 
         applications like Microsoft Outlook.



Q:15
The security software installed on my home computer 
         is giving me warnings, what does this mean?


A:15
Listed below are three common security programs.  If your software 
         is not listed below, please review your user manual to understand what the prompts may 
         mean.  The CrossRoads service does not present a security risk to your computer.
Symantec - Norton Internet Security Suite
Below are some screen shots you may encounter while using Norton Internet 
         Security.  This is normal behavior.  These warnings may appear while the "Host Checker" 
         and "Cache Cleaner" services are running.  Click the "OK" buttons to continue 
         accessing the service.
 
 


McAfee - Internet Security Suite
Below are some screen shots you may encounter while using the McAfee Internet 
         Security Suite.  This is normal behavior.  These warnings may appear while the 
         "Host Checker" and "Cache Cleaner" services are running.  Click the "Grant 
         Access" buttons to continue accessing the service.
 
 


Zonelabs - ZoneAlarm Internet Security Suite
Below are some screen shots you may encounter while using the ZoneAlarm Internet Security 
         Suite.  This is normal behavior.  These warnings may appear while the "Host Checker" and 
         "Cache Cleaner" services are running.  Click the Allow buttons to continue accessing 
         the service.
 
 




Q:16
I have Antivirus software installed on my home computer; 
         will this cause me any problems?


A:16

         the commonly installed antivirus software.



Q:17
Why can't I open some documents in Transit and 
         Schneider Online Xpress?


A:17
Some documents are saved as Microsoft Word and Excel files.  Most are saved as 
         Adobe Acrobat (pdf) files.   These programs must be installed on the computer you are using to connect to 
         WebAccess in order to open these types of documents.  Adobe Reader is a free download, available from 
         Adobe's site: www.adobe.com

What should I do if I am unable to use CrossRoads?


A:18
