            Community Bank & Trust was founded in 1952 as a bank with a concentration on the needs of small businesses and consumers. The bank combines traditional banking services and face-to-face branch locations and contemporary telephone and Internet banking products and services. Based in Waco, Texas, Community Bank & Trust also has three branch locations in McLennan County. Each location offers financial services and provides a diversified line of products and services to consumers and businesses, which include demand, savings and time deposits, consumer finance, online banking, mortgage lending and commercial banking throughout its market area. Community Bank & Trust s original location at 18th and Washington Avenue in Waco was modernized in 1998 with a seven-lane motor bank, a drive-up automatic teller machine and the addition of a trust services building. Community Bank & Trust is Waco s oldest locally owned bank.

Security
This Internet Banking System brings together a combination of industry-approved security technologies to protect data for the bank and for you, our customer. It features password-controlled system entry, a VeriSign-issued Digital ID for the bank's server, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol for data encryption, and a router loaded with a firewall to regulate the inflow and outflow of server traffic.
Secure Access and Verifying User Authenticity
To begin a session with the bank's server the user must key in a Log-in ID and a password. Our system, the Internet Banking System, uses a "3 strikes and you're out" lock-out mechanism to deter users from repeated login attempts. After three unsuccessful login attempts, the system locks the user out, requiring either a designated wait period or a phone call to the bank to verify the password before re-entry into the system. Upon successful login, the Digital ID from VeriSign, the experts in digital identification certificates, authenticates the user's identity and establishes a secure session with that visitor.  At Community Bank & Trust, we take the safety and security of your personal information very seriously. As part of our ongoing efforts to employ the latest Online Banking and Bill Pay security technology, we have recently added Multi-Factor Authentication to our Online Banking and Bill Pay system.
Secure Data Transfer
Once the server session is established, the user and the server are in a secured environment. Because the server has been certified as a 128-bit secure server by VeriSign, data traveling between the user and the server is encrypted with Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol. With SSL, data that travels between the bank and customer is encrypted and can only be decrypted with the public and private key pair. In short, the bank's server issues a public key to the end user's browser and creates a temporary private key. These two keys are the only combination possible for that session. When the session is complete, the keys expire and the whole process starts over when a new end user makes a server session.
Router and Firewall
Requests must filter through a router and firewall before they are permitted to reach the server. A router, a piece of hardware, works in conjunction with the firewall, a piece of software, to block and direct traffic coming to the server. The configuration begins by disallowing ALL traffic and then opens holes only when necessary to process acceptable data requests, such as retrieving web pages or sending customer requests to the bank.
Using the above technologies, your Internet banking transactions are secure.
