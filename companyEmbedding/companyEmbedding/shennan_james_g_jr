Starbucks board member James G. Shennan, Jr. to retire following 27
      years of service; company expands its board of world-class, values-based
      leaders, attracting diversity in global technology, retail and consumer
      experience as it pursues its long-term plan for strong global growth and
      innovation

 SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
      Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ: SBUX) announced today the nominations of
      Rosalind Brewer, President and Chief Executive Officer of Sam’s Club,
      and executive vice president of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.; Jørgen Vig
      Knudstorp, Executive Chairman of the LEGO Brand Group; and Satya
      Nadella, CEO of Microsoft Corporation, to the Starbucks Board of
      Directors. Each are nominated for election to the Board at the company’s
      Annual Meeting of Shareholders on March 22, 2017, along with the
      nomination of the company’s current directors other than Mr. Shennan who
      is retiring from the Board immediately prior to the meeting.
    

      “For 45 years, the success of the Starbucks brand has been built upon
      the preservation of the trust, confidence and connection we have with
      our customers and partners,” said Howard Schultz, Starbucks chairman and
      ceo. “Innovation and pushing to alter the status quo are also core to
      our culture, and by welcoming three world-class, values-based leaders
      – Roz, Jørgen and Satya – to Starbucks Board of Directors upon their
      election at the Annual Meeting, we will strengthen our leadership and
      add unmatched expertise in technology, strategy, and retail to
      the company at a time of unprecedented change for our industry. I look
      forward to welcoming each of these leaders to Starbucks Board of
      Directors.”
    

Rosalind Brewer


Rosalind Brewer will bring to the Board extensive insight on large-scale
      operations and supply chain logistics based on her senior leadership
      positions with Sam’s Club and Walmart, as well as valuable experience in
      consumer products and distribution. Brewer will also provide vast
      experience in product development, product management, leadership,
      digital technology and innovation, and international operations and
      distribution. Brewer has served as President and Chief Executive Officer
      of Sam’s Club, a division of Walmart, since February 2012. Walmart
      recently announced her retirement from the company effective February 1,
      2017. She currently serves on the Board of Directors for Lockheed Martin
      Corporation and is Chair of the Board of Trustees for Spelman College,
      and formerly served as a director of Molson Coors Brewing Company.
    

      “For many years, I’ve looked to Starbucks as a leader in how companies
      should stay ahead of innovation, build trust and loyalty with customers
      and deeply engage in local and global communities. As an avid customer,
      I am delighted every day to see just how much this company focuses on
      honing its craft. It will be an honor to put my many years of retail and
      customer engagement to work on behalf of the brand, and to serve
      alongside such a talented group in doing so,” said Brewer.
    

Jørgen Vig Knudstorp


      To the Starbucks Board of Directors, Jørgen Vig Knudstorp will provide
      global executive leadership experience from one of the world’s most
      renowned toy manufacturers and recognizable brands. He will also bring a
      proven record of innovation and unique insight of brand and digital
      marketing, strategy, consumer products, and international operations and
      distribution to the Board. Knudstorp has served as Executive Chairman of
      the LEGO Brand Group, the controlling company to the LEGO Group since
      January 2017. From October 2004 to December 2016, he served as President
      and Chief Executive Officer of the LEGO Group.
    

      “I find Starbucks truly fascinating and inspiring because of its high
      quality products and customer experiences, the authenticity of the
      brand, the company’s caring approach to consumers and employees and not
      least the ambitious responsibility agenda,” said Knudstorp. “Starbucks
      was founded on a simple, essential idea and now the company has grown in
      to becoming a very strong, innovative brand with the potential to expand
      its global presence further. I am very excited to have been nominated to
      join the Board and to contribute to the continued development of this
      fantastic company.”
    

Satya Nadella


Satya Nadella will bring to the Starbucks Board extensive experience and
      an understanding of how technology will be used and experienced around
      the world. He will provide the Board with invaluable insight in
      international operations and distribution as Starbucks continues to
      focus on innovative ways to use technology to elevate the brand and grow
      its business. Nadella has served as Chief Executive Officer and a member
      of the Board of Directors of Microsoft Corporation, a leading
      productivity and platform company, since February 2014. He has held
      various leadership positions at Microsoft since joining the company in
      1992. Nadella currently serves on the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research
      Center board of trustees.
    

      “I’m honored to have been nominated to join the Board of this
      world-renowned company,” said Nadella. “As a regular customer myself,
      I’ve always admired Starbucks focus and deep passion for its customers
      and the communities it does business in and hope my years of experience
      in the technology industry will be of value to the company.”
    

James G. Shennan, Jr.


      Additionally, James (Jamie) Shennan, a Starbucks director since March
      1990, will retire from the Board effective immediately prior to the
      shareholder meeting in accordance with the company’s Corporate
      Governance Principles and Practices’ mandatory retirement age
      requirements.
    

      “For nearly three decades Jamie has been instrumental in the building of
      the Starbucks brand, our go-to-market strategy, and the globalization of
      our operations,” said Schultz. “He has fully appreciated the Starbucks
      culture and our mission from our earliest of days, and has made
      significant contributions in the evolution of our business. I’m
      eternally grateful to Jamie for his knowledge and counsel to me,
      personally, and to the Starbucks Board of Directors over the years.”
    

      If all nominees are elected by our shareholders at the Annual Meeting,
      the Board will have 14 members, including:
