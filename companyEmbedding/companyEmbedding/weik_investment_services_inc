Equity Analysis



















Our stock selection process is centered on fundamental security analysis and emphasizes companies that are industry leaders or dominate certain niches. These companies generally have certain competitive advantages or franchises. Our favorite idea is a company that earns a superior return on its capital and that we believe has the potential to continue to earn superior returns over many years.
We prefer companies that are strong cash flow generators. Our focus is on companies that produce cash in excess of their capital spending and dividend payouts. This free cash can be utilized proactively on behalf of the shareholders. Possible applications include acquisitions, share repurchases, and increased dividends. Management should be skilled with respect to the allocation of the company's capital.

We take a close look at the management team, which should have an ethical approach to doing business, a commitment to the shareholders, and an excellent track record. We believe that management should own a meaningful long-term holding in the shares of their company.
We typically seek to purchase stocks at a discount to what we judge to be their intrinsic value. We prefer to fill our portfolios with our favorite ideas purchased at compelling prices, but only under relatively rare conditions can we find that many marvelous opportunities. Thus, our portfolios may contain shares of good companies along with shares of outstanding ones. We seek a greater discount to intrinsic value when a company does not fully meet all of our criteria.
We consider qualitative and quantitative factors in making judgments about the intrinsic value of a business. Our efforts are focused on traditional security analysis. Portfolio cash reserves can expand when we are unable to find a sufficient number of our preferred companies at suitable prices. However, we do not attempt to time the market by making macro judgments about the economy or the market.
 








Our Services



















Since 1987, Weik Investment Services has been working closely with its clients to understand their investment objectives and develop customized portfolios to meet those objectives.
Portfolio allocations and strategies are developed through consultations with our clients. Once these guidelines are agreed upon, Weik Investment requests authorization to engage in the discretionary day-to-day management of the portfolio. Portfolios may be either invested for long-term capital appreciation or a combination of long-term capital appreciation and income. They are reviewed frequently by the investment team.
Weik Investment asks each client to select a broker or bank to custody their cash and securities. Thus, our clients receive independent monthly statements verifying their holdings and account activity. Our clients also receive quarterly reporting from Weik Investment that includes: a list of all securities and cash reserves; the investment return for various time periods; a reconciliation of the change in portfolio value; a list of all purchases and sales; a realized gain and loss report for the year to date; and a letter discussing strategies, results, and the market/economic environment.
At Weik Investment, clients are encouraged to call whenever they have a question or wish to discuss their investment program. In-person reviews are conducted periodically according to the needs and wishes of our clients. Our firm prides itself in being responsive to client inquiries.
Management fees are dependent upon account size and required services. Although Weik Investment offers a personalized service, its fees are less than that of many equity or balanced mutual funds.

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for CECO Environmental Corp. (NASDAQ:CECE) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 2 Hold Ratings, 1 Strong Buy RatingConsensus Rating:Buy (Score: 2.67)Consensus Price Target: $12.33 (26.11% upside)

Consensus Ratings for NN (NASDAQ:NNBR) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 1 Hold Rating, 2 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Buy (Score: 2.67)Consensus Price Target: $33.50 (16.32% upside)

Traditional and Roth IRAs | Ameriprise Financial



Skip to main content
























Traditional and Roth IRAs, rollovers and conversions


Key Points

Traditional and Roth IRAs offer tax advantages and a wide choice of investment options.
Ameriprise Financial offers a special beneficiary restriction for IRAs to control how assets are distributed.
You can consider, by reviewing the potential benefits and risks, a rollover from a 401(k) plan to an IRA. Consult with your advisor to discuss your individual situation.
An individual retirement account (IRA) can supplement your workplace retirement plan and provide an easy way to save for a confident retirement.







Contributing to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA may generate either tax-deferred or tax-free growth on the money you contribute. These earnings are then reinvested into your account and may generate even more earnings.
Traditional and Roth IRAs
There are two primary types of IRAs – Traditional and Roth. Each offers tax advantages and a wide variety of investment choices.
You can choose one or both depending on your tax situation and income, but all IRAs together are subject to the combined contribution limit.

Traditional IRAs are generally funded with pretax contributions and are taxed as ordinary income when withdrawing funds in retirement.
Roth IRAs are always funded with after-tax contributions and are tax free when you withdraw the money in retirement. You must satisfy rules on qualified distributions for the withdrawals to be considered tax-free.

You can make contributions throughout the year or in a lump sum by the contribution deadline (usually the tax return due date — not including extensions — in the following year). Yearly contribution limits are subject to change.
Workplace retirement plan rollovers
If you've changed jobs or recently retired, you may have multiple retirement plans with different providers. A rollover from an old workplace retirement plan to an Ameriprise® IRA may provide you with a more complete picture of your savings for retirement.
Some Ameriprise IRAs also have a unique feature that allows clients to restrict some beneficiaries from using the funds too quickly.
A workplace retirement plan rollover:

Provides greater control over the investment of your retirement assets
Allows a greater range of investment options than most employer retirement plans
May provide more distribution flexibility than an employer plan
Is not subject to a mandatory 20% withholding when rolled directly to an IRA
Provides flexible beneficiary and estate planning options
Maintains tax-deferred status of the account
Sometimes you can even rollover funds while you are still working

However, there are also some scenarios where it may make sense to leave assets in an employer plan. Some advantages to leaving assets in an employer qualified plan may include:

Special tax treatment for a lump sum distribution of appreciated employer stock
No 10% penalty for pre 59½ withdrawals if you leave your employer in the year you turn 55 or later*

	*For certain public safety workers in governmental plans, participants who stop working in the year they turn age 50 or can avoid the 10% penalty and 457(b) plans don’t have a 10% penalty at any age.
	 
Protection of assets from creditors; assets in ERISA qualified plans are protected under federal law while IRA asset protection outside of bankruptcy depends on state law
Access to competitively priced investments





Rollover assets to an IRA while still employed
By using this little known option, you may be able to transfer assets from your workplace 401(k) into a personal IRA while you’re still employed. Ask your advisor to help you explore the pros and cons of an in-service IRA rollover strategy.
Roth IRA conversions
You may want to consider converting a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA.
A Roth IRA offers a number of benefits that are not available with a traditional IRA or other pre-tax retirement plans, including:

Tax-free potential growth
Tax-free withdrawals
No lifetime required minimum withdrawals

A conversion of a pre-tax retirement plan to a Roth IRA is generally taxable in the year of the conversion so it is important to weigh the costs and benefits of a Roth IRA conversion. Consult your tax advisor to determine if a Roth conversion is right for you.
Take the next step
Contact an Ameriprise financial advisor today to learn more about your IRA, rollover and conversion options.

Mutual funds and mutual funds investment advice | Ameriprise Financial



Skip to main content
























Mutual funds


Key Points

Mutual funds offer the advantage of professional management
Investors in mutual funds may benefit from diversification
Ameriprise Financial offers access to more than 3,500 funds from nearly 300 fund companies







A mutual fund is a company that pools money from many investors and invests the money in stocks, bonds, short-term money market instruments, other securities or assets or a combination of these investments.
Because professional managers provide ongoing supervision of mutual fund holdings, mutual funds can be a quick and efficient means of managing money.
In addition, mutual funds may provide diversification, an important element of a well-rounded investment portfolio.
Access to a wide variety of fund families
An Ameriprise financial advisor can help you build a portfolio that's right for you, selecting from more than 3,500 funds from nearly 300 fund companies.
If you would like to see if a particular mutual fund is available at Ameriprise, search for it by name or ticker using the Mutual Fund Screener tool. You can use the tool to view a complete list of mutual funds and fund families available at Ameriprise.

Clients should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of a mutual fund carefully before investing. The prospectus contains this and other important information about the funds and should be read carefully before investing. For a free prospectus, which contains this and other important information about each fund, call Ameriprise Financial at 1.800.297.7378.

There's an advantage in working with a financial advisor who knows you – and your financial goals. That's what makes Edward Jones different from other investment firms. Supporting the relationship between you and your financial advisor shapes nearly every aspect of our business.
You may have seen one of our 12,000 offices in your community. That's because we believe you deserve more than a 1-800 number when it comes to your financial future.
What you may not know is that we're a Fortune 500 company with thousands of associates and sophisticated technology supporting your local financial advisor.
The Edward Jones approach in determining your goals, and developing tailored financial strategies, has been helping nearly 7 million clients for more than 90 years.
In fact, we like to think we became one of the largest financial services firms in the country by not acting that way. If you're ready to work with a different kind of investment firm—one that cares as much about why you're investing as what you invest in— you're ready to work with Edward Jones.

Focus On You

Focus On You




Every investment firm has principles. And they usually sound exactly the same. We believe Edward Jones is different in almost every way. Our principles were deliberately created with you in mind. We don't just talk about personal service. We're built to deliver it.
Your dedicated financial advisor – It's your financial future, so an 800-number or Internet search for financial advice doesn't cut it. You have a relationship with an Edward Jones financial advisor, who spends time to learn why you're investing and then develops a personalized strategy. No cookie-cutter plans here.
In your neighborhood – With more than 15,000 financial advisors, you shouldn't have to go far to find an Edward Jones office in your community. That means you can actually meet with a financial advisor to discuss what's important to you.
Tailored for individual investors - All of our resources – including investment research, online account access, easy-to-understand statements, sophisticated software and detailed reports – are developed with you in mind.
Experienced support team - Backing up this personal service is a Fortune 500 company with thousands of people and advanced technology. Your financial advisor uses these resources to develop the best strategy for you.
We spend the time and have the knowledge to help you sort through complicated financial questions. Most financial services firms claim to focus on you and your needs, but can they really do it? We believe Edward Jones is uniquely positioned from the ground up to provide the attention, respect and service you deserve.

Prepare for Your First Appointment 
Learn more



Prepare for Your First Appointment 




We're honored that you're considering working with us to help achieve your financial goals. Here are three ways you can prepare our first meeting.


Think about why you're investing
Understanding the "why" will help you be better prepared to discuss your goals and strategies to help reach them. What's important to you and your family? What do you want to achieve?


Gather your statements
If you've worked with a financial advisor before, it's helpful to know about your current investments and your experience to date. If you're new to the investing world, we promise to talk with you, not at you. Our goal is to empower you with the knowledge you'll need to pursue your goals.


Bring your questions
We want to make sure to answer any investment questions you may have, as well as how we can best work together. What do you expect? How often do you want to touch base?

We value the communities where we work, so we're committed to giving back. You'll find our associates serving clients in our offices, but you'll also find us investing our time and talents to support local organizations and great causes. Many Financial Advisors are on Chambers of Commerce and serve as board members and event coordinators for local organizations, and our associates volunteer, donate and support a variety of charitable organizations.







Tour De Ted
Each year, branch and Home Office associates take to the road to raise funds for cancer research for the firm's annual Tour de Ted. In memory of Ted Jones, former managing partner who died from cancer, the first Tour de Ted showcased the firm's community-oriented culture while paying tribute to the history of Edward Jones. Volunteers rode the path of the original "wire" that connected Pueblo, Colo., to St. Louis, Mo., which created our branch network.







Emergency Assistance
Sixteen Financial Advisors in Texas decided to set aside one day out of their busy schedules to give back to their community. They volunteered at the Montgomery County Emergency Assistance facility by painting offices and hallways, and sorting and tagging clothes.







School Supply Drive
Eight local Edward Jones Financial Advisors teamed up on behalf of school children, clearly demonstrating their commitment to family values. Their school supply drive brought in hundreds of classroom necessities, from notebooks and markers to tissues and cleaning wipes.







Habitat for Humanity
When investors wanted to save for a new home, Edward Jones was there to help. Associates from Ontario, Canada, helped a local family reach its goal of home ownership in another way when they came together for the Habitat for Humanity build in Amherstburg, Ont., the first such home built in this community.







Pedal the Cause
We're proud of our associates who joined the fight against cancer as Edward Jones Pedal the Cause riders. More than 200 bike riders from across the U.S. took to the streets (and the Katy Trail) to help fundraise for cancer research.







Walk to End Alzheimer's®
At Edward Jones, we live and work in the communities we serve. We want to make a difference in people’s lives, both in and out of the office. Alzheimer’s disease has a significant impact on individuals, family, friends and community. That’s why we’ve chosen to partner with the Alzheimer’s Association as the National Presenting Sponsor of the Walk to End Alzheimer’s®. We invite you to join us in the fight to end this terrible disease.
