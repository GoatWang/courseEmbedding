GoPro: Fixing GoPro's Development And Product Release Problems - GoPro (NASDAQ:GPRO) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»GoPro: Fixing GoPro's Development And Product Release ProblemsJun. 2.17 | About: GoPro (GPRO) Walter Banks Tech, gadgets, chipmakers, softwareByte Craft LimitedSummaryA close look at GoPro problems from a developer’s perspective concludes that the primary cause is a broken but fixable software development process.Open development problems dating back to the GoPro launch remain unfixed and are accumulating in GoPro’s current HERO5 product line.Nick Woodman may not have the skill set to manage product development but his passion for the GoPro action cameras has maintained GoPro’s public reputation.Hero5 product line.The development process at GoPro needs to be replaced. Nick Woodman is both part of the solution and part of the problem at GoPro.Future camera development at GoPro is going to depend on interoperability with other devices and software. GoPro will need to have the discipline to be compatible with these public standards.A recent Seeking Alpha article "GoPro: Time For Nick Woodman To Go" focused on Nick Woodman's execution failures on GoPro's initiatives following the high profile public launch of GoPro. The article concludes that Nick Woodman should be replaced. I am a long term embedded systems developer and have been looking at details of the product failures. I believe that the complete removal of Nick Woodman may actually hurt GoPro's chances for recovery. GoPro (NASDAQ:GPRO) stock has been declining exponentially since the fall of 2014, losing roughly half its value every nine to twelve months. The systemic failures and product delays are due to fixable problems with GoPro's development process. GoPro lacks the development discipline to deliver finished market-ready products. This is a problem that pressure from the investment community may actually be able to do something about. The technical and public press have been defining what is wrong with GoPro products. My focus is much more limited to "why are delivered products from GoPro faulty?" There has been essentially no public comment on this aspect of GoPro's decline. My perspective as an embedded systems developer and GoPro owner is to look at root causes of the failures rather than the specific details of each fault. The common cause is a development process that is missing structure and effectiveness.
 What is development process? Development process is the formal management of development. The components of development process include features and function, progress metrics to track time lines, and predicting completion dates. Development processes provide communication between company management and developers. Progress metrics are functionally similar to the role of accounting in a company. They both serve the same purpose: To plan future operations by tracking operational progress of business plans and to provide a cohesive measure of achievement. Failure to use formalized progress metrics in development is very similar to a company operating without accounting. Communication between management and developers is facilitated by progress metrics. Management may see a project that is currently a few days early on one of the development goals and two days late on another one. Developers looking at the same data will see that a specific software module is complete and a different module still does not meet required execution timing. A common database provides both groups meaningful information to perform their respective functions. Development completion is determined as an independent measure by progress metrics. This simplistic-sounding goal is a lot harder than it seems, especially for a software-dominated project. Project metrics can independently evaluate project status against the requirements list. Development protocols cover the whole development activity starting with product goals including market expectations, software design, software implementation, software testing, and validated release candidates. Each independently determines component completion. Without proper completion determination, a product will be released with compromised features - often essential features. The investment community sees the operational failures at GoPro as the problem. This is an over-simplified point of view when the details are examined. The operational failures they see are actually missing product development processes.
 Time pressure clouds clear thinking The HERO5 Black appeared to have overwhelming emphasis on the timely release of a new product, in the false belief that skipping essential steps in the product development process will somehow help their time line (it won't). As a developer and veteran of many projects, the HERO5 Black appeared to me to be a running prototype of a product that was released with the expectation that bugs and code problems could be dealt with later. It looked like a product that had missed a requirements review, had a rushed implementation phase, and lacked adequate software testing essential for the smooth release of a new product. GoPro had failed some of the most basic development protocols essential for any product. Nick Woodman's leadership Nick Woodman is GoPro's creative genius who excited both a customer base and an investment community with an innovative mounting system on a small, high performance video camera. I followed Nick Woodman's interviews at this year's CES as he tirelessly promoted the recently released HERO5 and explained away in simple terms the failure of the Karma drone. Nick Woodman, to his credit, has kept the public reputation of GoPro relatively intact. The founders of innovative companies are often reclusive technical types or gregarious promoters. Neither do well pivoting to the broader responsibility of managing a company. Company founders bring an essential product idea and very often don't cope with the development process that requires vision, focus and incremental baselines of progress. Creative people are continually improving, changing and revising ideas for their product. This behavior is at odds with the skill set needed by development management. Too often the same skill set that brought the innovation in the first place is interfering with orderly product development. The investment community describes Nick Woodman as not always making product announcements in their - or his own - best interest. The same communities are quick to acknowledge Nick Woodman's product passion. There is a gap, not a complete failure, in Nick Woodman's skill set, interest and experience. Nick Woodman is both part of the problem and part of the solution for GoPro. The earlier article is likely to remain a voice of frustration rather than a blueprint for successful change.
 Nick Woodman mentioned the HERO6 in a single sentence during the February GoPro earnings call ("GoPro (GPRO) Q4 2016 Results - Earnings Call Transcript"): "Yes, we can confirm there will be new cameras and other accessories released during the year and new camera namely being HERO6." No online comments on the HERO6 can be characterized as anything more than wild speculation or wishful thinking coming from this single sentence. Specifically, I can find no other public comment on the HERO6 that can be traced back to GoPro. Most of the media covered only the HERO6 part of Nick Woodman's comment. The other part of the sentence, mentioning cameras and accessories, could be far more important to GoPro's bottom line. These will potentially attract new customers to the GoPro core camera offerings. The GoPro Fusion, a 360-degree camera, was announced in April looking for Beta testers. Where is GoPro going? What are the technical risks? Cute little video cameras can no longer compete in an isolated world. Like the well-developed point and shoot cameras, standards on a number of levels are important. GoPro customers are becoming part of this need for component compatibility. In fact, many of GoPro's critics are starting to complain about this support requirement. GoPro's future depends on them gaining control of their development process to create and release reliable products that meet their customers' expectations. GoPro must master their own technology and support innovation, enabling technology to attract new markets. Changes in fixing the development process cannot wait. Development deficiencies accumulate over time, making the next project more difficult to complete. The same accumulation also makes product support increasingly more expensive because old faults remain unresolved. The next generation action camera (360/180-degree surround dome image) records video footage centered on the principal participant. This makes it possible to participate in the image during playback. The business model for these cameras is development-intensive and will likely require cooperating innovative products. The solution is likely already here; we just currently don't recognize it as the solution.
 Related technologies include interactive static display technology that is currently used in real-estate promotion, Google Earth and virtual reality gaming display technology. There will be no successful single-supplier vendor for this technology. The overlapping recreational application areas and social media needed for publication will not make this possible. Virtual reality, 360 video and 360 panoramic stills are evolving camera technologies that are not yet mature in action cameras. GoPro's announcement of Fusion in April adds GoPro to the growing list of two-sensor approaches to this. GoPro is going to be forced to be active, potentially in a leadership position of emerging interactive file format standards and interactive supporting software. The adoption of a recognized VR 360 video solution by the public would be a quantum leap in perceived function without a significant user cost increment. If that happens, it could reduce the demand for conventional video action cameras significantly in a very short period of time. Key technical indicators I would look for how GoPro fixes the development product process. As a product developer, I would measure how effectively the development process is being repaired by monitoring it over the next few months as an indicator of change. One of the leading technical indicators is how the accumulated software issues in the HERO5 are being handled in new software updates. I will look for robust support for SD cards and three innovation-enabling technologies: USB, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth. These are primarily communication and device handlers whose specifications and requirements are outside of the hands of GoPro. All are currently flawed in GoPro products. Their flaws cannot be explained away by GoPro saying, "This was our plan." GoPro's implementation of these technologies will be high on my list to judge where GoPro is going. All of the enabling technologies are essential to new product developments and to the transition of the HERO5 Black to a competitive point and shoot product. GoPro will face a future customer base that combines their high tech toys in various ways that will publicly define them as individuals on social media.
 What is going to happen at GoPro? There are several possible outcomes. 1. GoPro can fix their development process and get on track to produce stable and reliable products integrating into the action camera and point and shoot markets. From my point of view, Nick Woodman is an essential ingredient to maintain GoPro's public image as this transition takes place. The process may take a year to show results. It would be hard to put a good development process into place. For one thing, it is unlikely that Nick Woodman alone can do it. He has had a few years and it is still an unsolved problem. It is also, in my opinion, unlikely that GoPro would survive without his promotion. 2. If GoPro fails to fix their development process, it is hard to see any development project that would not exacerbate the problem. The incomplete development will continue to accumulate in new products. GoPro will be marginalized by competitive offerings. This is the reason that I will track innovative support technology as a leading indicator of their future capability. Competitors will come in two forms. They will create an innovation-friendly version of the GoPro camera with a combination of the GoPro camera capabilities and broad functional familiarity of the current crowd of digital and point and shoot cameras. Alternatively, they will move away from the GoPro video camera and find imaging technologies to create interactive viewing solutions completely outside of GoPro's dominance. 3. The third possible outcome that is to combine GoPro's IP with an established development-capable company. I am a developer, not an investor, and this possibility is well outside my experience or expertise. Quite a few established camera companies have created action camera products that have not succeeded for the same reason that the Karma drone initially failed. It is difficult to enter an established market without significant experience. Virtual reality companies have a similar problem with entering into the imaging markets. They generally have a lot of experience in dealing with image manipulation in computationally intensive real-time software. For these companies, buying GoPro's experience might be a good investment.
 GoPro's future depends on getting the development fundamentals fixed.

Early life and education[edit]
Woodman is the son of Concepcion (née Socarras) and Dean Woodman.[3][4][5][6] His father was born into a Quaker family and co-founded the investment bank Robertson Stephens;[3][7][8] and his mother is of Hispanic descent and re-married Irwin Federman, General Partner of U.S. Venture Partners in 1992.[4] Woodman grew up in Menlo Park, California[9] and Atherton, California,[10] attending the Menlo School, where he graduated in 1993.[11] He developed his interest in surfing during high school and formed the high school's first surfing club. Woodman would sell t-shirts at high school football games to raise money for the surfing club.[12] He earned a bachelor's degree in visual arts and a minor in creative writing from the University of California, San Diego in 1997.[13][10][14] After school, Woodman founded two startups, both of which never fully made it off the ground. The first was a website called EmpowerAll.com, which attempted to sell electronic goods for no more than a $2 markup, and the second was Funbug, a gaming and marketing platform that gave users the chance to win cash prizes. Woodman took the lack of success from both companies personally.[15] After failing to reach success on his own, Nick went home and received a $235,000 investment from his father,[16] an investment banker in Silicon Valley, [17] and used his parents connections to venture capital to launch his career as the head of GoPro.[18]
Career[edit]
While on hiatus in Australia and Indonesia on a surf trip, he used a 35mm camera attached to the palm of his hand by a rubber band to try to capture his surfing activities on film.[14] Seeing that amateur photographers like him – who wanted to capture quality action photos of their activities – had difficulties because either they could not get close enough to the action or were unable to purchase quality equipment at affordable prices, his trip became his inspiration to found GoPro.[14] His solution was to develop a belt that would attach the camera to the body.[14] Woodman and his future wife Jill financed the business by selling shell necklaces they bought in Bali (for $1.90) from their car along the California coast (for $60).[19] His mother loaned him $35,000 and let him borrow her sewing machine, which he used to sew camera straps while experimenting with early designs. His dad loaned him an additional $200,000, which Woodman immediately paid back out of company sales.[3] His desire for a camera system that could capture close up footage inspired the 'GoPro' name.[20][21] The original cameras he developed were point-and-shoot 35mm film cameras which mounted to the user's wrist. Woodman would go about selling his products while using his 1971 Volkwagen Bus that he named 'The Buscuit' as his mobile home.[12] The product has since evolved into a compact digital camera that supports WiFi, can be remotely controlled, has waterproof housing, records to a micro SD card, and is affordable to the average action sports enthusiast ($200–$400). Woodman would often act as the test engineer for their earlier products completing tasks such as attaching a GoPro to a car and driving at speeds of over 130 MPH. In 2004, he made his first big sale when a Japanese company ordered 100 cameras at a sports show.[14][19] Thereafter, sales doubled every year,[13] and in 2012, GoPro sold 2.3 million cameras.[14] In 2005, Woodman appeared on QVC to sell his GoPro Hero. In 2004, GoPro had about $150,000 in revenue which grew to about $350,000 in 2005. In December 2012, the Taiwanese contract manufacturer Foxconn purchased 8.88% of the company for $200 million which set the market value of the company at $2.25 billion making Woodman, who owned the majority of the stock, a billionaire.[14][19] On June 26, 2014, GoPro went public – closing the day at $31.34 a share. In 2014, Woodman was the highest paid US chief executive, paying himself $235 million.[22][23][24]
In 2015, GoPro developed a partnership with the NHL that would enable the NHL to use GoPro products to improve the viewing experience for fans.[25] Woodman has been invited to speak at various tech conferences and in October 2015, Woodman was a guest on the Late Show with Stephen Colbert and wore a GoPro camera for the entirety of the interview.[26] Woodman is set to appear as a shark investor in the sixth season of the show Shark Tank.[27] Woodman has invested $125,000 as of November 2015 on Shark Tank on two investments.[28]
At the beginning of 2016, GoPro started to make a series of job cuts. In January of 2016, Woodman's Company cut 100 jobs, or 7% of his workforce.[29] Later that year, in November 2016, GoPro cut an additional 15% of the GoPro workforce after attempting to branch out beyond its core business of action cameras, as the entertainment division failed to reach profitability.[30]
In December 2016, a class action lawsuit against GoPro was announced. The complaint alleges that GoPro made false and misleading statements to investors and/or failed to disclose flaws in the Company's drones, overstating customer demand, and GoPro's public statements were materially false and misleading. [31][32]
2016 proved to be a tough year for GoPro.[33] With the many changes at and involving GoPro, including numerous job cuts, and falling stock prices, Woodman was listed as one of the year's worst CEOs. [34]
Awards[edit]

2013 National Award Winner of the EY Entrepreneur of the Year Award.
2014 Winner of the Technology and Engineering Emmy Award in the category of Inexpensive Small Rugged HD Camcorders. Woodman brought his GoPro onstage for his acceptance speech.[23][35]

Philanthropy[edit]
After a successful IPO, the couple donated 5.8 million shares of GoPro stock to the Jill + Nicholas Woodman Foundation, a new fund they created at the Silicon Valley Community Foundation in 2014. [36] From 2014 to 2017, the value of the stock donated declined from $500 million to $50.3 million because of the dramatic decline in GoPro stock. Woodman was one of the biggest donors in the tech industry that year; however, it angered investors.[37][38][39]
In March 2014, Woodman was honored for his philanthropic work with BUILD at their 5th annual gala in San Francisco.[40]
Personal life[edit]
Woodman is married to Jill R. Scully[41] and they have three children.[13][14] They live in Woodside, California.[42] Woodman is known as the "mad billionaire" due to his unconventional behavior and eccentricities.[14] Woodman is a strong believer in following one's passions as a way to success stating, "I’m a big believer that when you’re pursuing your passions, your best ideas come to you. Your passions are a bit like your fingerprints: Everybody has them; everybody’s are different. One’s passions may just be a guidebook to one’s life.”[27] In 2015, Woodman hosted an AMA on Reddit. Woodman has often cited his fear of failure as a catalyst for his success stating, "When I got out of college, I gave myself till I was 30 to invent a product. If I couldn't do it by then, I would just get a real job. And that fear – the fear of a real job – motivated me to be an entrepreneur."[43]
In December 2015, Woodman commissioned a 180-foot yacht, estimated to cost between $35 million and $40 million. The boat, expected to be delivered in 2017, is four decks high and comes with a Jacuzzi pool, swim platform, sweeping sun decks, and dining areas. [44]

History[edit]
The company was founded by Nick Woodman in 2004.[3] He was motivated by a 2002 surfing trip to Australia in which he was hoping to capture quality action photos, but could not because amateur photographers could not get close enough or buy quality equipment at reasonable prices.[4] His desire for a camera system that could capture the professional angles inspired the 'GoPro' name.[5][6]
Woodman raised a portion of his initial capital by selling bead and shell belts for under US $20 from his VW van[7] and, later, fashionable camera straps. He also received over $230,000 from his parents to invest in the business.[8][9]
In 2004, the company sold its first camera system, which used 35 mm film.[5] Digital still and video cameras were later introduced. As of 2014[update], a fixed-lens HD video camera with a wide 170-degree lens was available; two or more can be paired to create 360 video.[5][10]
On June 4, 2014, the company announced the appointment of former Microsoft executive Tony Bates as President reporting directly to Woodman.[11]
In January 2016, GoPro partnered with Periscope for live streaming.[12]
After growing the number of employees by more than 500 in 2015, the company responded to weak sales in the fourth quarter by cutting about 7% of its workforce (100 workers) in January 2016.[13]
At its peak, a share of GoPro was valued at $86, but on September 27, 2016, only $16.79.[14]
In November 2016, the company announced it was laying off an additional 200 employees in an effort to reduce costs. The company also announced that President Tony Bates would be stepping down at the end of 2016.[15]
Corporate actions[edit]
On March 30, 2011, GoPro acquired CineForm. The acquisition included the CineForm 444 video codec used in the film Slumdog Millionaire. The company claimed that the codec "makes HD and 3D editing faster and more convenient without sacrificing image quality". It was incorporated in the company's 3D Hero System shortly after the acquisition.[16][17]
In March 2013, GoPro issued a DMCA takedown notice to website DigitalRev.com, which had posted a review[18] of its product, citing trademark use as a breach of copyright. This notice was retracted 10 days later, citing "erroneous enforcement".[19][20]
On February 29, 2016, GoPro spent $105 million and acquired two start-ups, namely, Stupeflix and Vemory, for their video editing tools Replay and Splice.[21][22]
IPO[edit]
On February 7, 2014, GoPro submitted a confidential filing for an initial public offering (IPO) with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).[23]
On May 19, 2014, GoPro filed its S-1 with the SEC without specifying the number of shares or their price. The company stated that they hoped to raise at least $100 million through the sale of shares, using the money to pay off debt in full ($111 million as of March 31, 2014) and "to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, technologies or assets". They said that they planned to list on the NASDAQ stock exchange using the symbol 'GPRO.'[24][25]
The expected price range was $21 to $24 a share; on June 25, 2014, GoPro sold 17.8 million shares to initial investors at $24 per share (totaling $427.2M).[26] At the IPO price the company was valued at $2.95 billion.[24] 1.5 percent of those shares were allotted to LOYAL3, a technology platform that allows small investors to participate.[27][28]
An important reason for GoPro's decision to go public was the potential to become a media company to generate additional revenue from the content its cameras create.[29][30]
Product lines[edit]
HERO cameras[edit]
Woodman worked on his first camera for two years after founding the company, eventually introducing the GoPro 35mm HERO in September 2004 at San Diego's Action Sports Retailer trade show.[31] In its first year GoPro sold $150,000 worth of products.[31] In 2006 the company introduced its first Digital HERO, with 10 second video capability, and generated $800,000 in revenue. The following year GoPro sales quadrupled to $3.4 million.[31]
In 2014, the company was selling the HERO3+ in editions of different colors. It was capable of filming in 16:9 aspect ratio, supporting 4K UHD video and 12MP still photographs.[32] The HERO4 was introduced on 24 September 2014.[33]
GoPro KARMA & GoPro KARMA Grip[edit]




GoPro drone Karma


The GoPro Karma is GoPro's consumer drone.[citation needed]
In 2014, GoPro entered into discussions with DJI for a private label model built with the GoPro branding. After the failure of these negotiations, GoPro entered into an agreement with 3D Robotics (3DR) for a similar partnership based on 3DR's flight controllers. 3DR failed to meet their agreed upon timelines. As a result, GoPro took full control of the development process in mid-2015.
Scheduled to be released early 2016, the GoPro Karma project was delayed several times before the GoPro Karma was announced with an introduction date of October 23, 2016. The Karma was released along with newer models of the HERO5 and Session cameras and features a removable handheld stabilizer (gimbal) integrated into the design. After a few customers complained about power failure during operation, GoPro recalled Karma drones and gave customers full refunds.[34]
In February 2017, GoPro re-launched the Karma Drone.[35]
Accessories[edit]
GoPro produces various mounting accessories for its cameras including a 3-way mount, suction cup, chest harness, jaws-type flexible clamp, dog harness, surfing mount, etc.[36]
Video editing[edit]
The company developed GoPro Studio, simple video editing software to edit camera footage,[37] with v2.5 released in October 2014. It was reported that GoPro intended to also become a content provider, also with a new app for the HERO5 called GoPro Quik to share, and edit videos easier.[30]
Content company[edit]
In April 2014, GoPro was listed by Adweek as one of the "Top 10 Best Brand Channels on YouTube" based on a combination of views, shares, comments and overall engagement.[38] Content is uploaded daily, an additional source of revenue for the company.[39]
As part of its transformation to a media company in 2014, GoPro created additional channels with GoPro content on YouTube, Virgin America, and Xbox Live.[29] This was extended to the PlayStation Network in 2015.[40]
HD HERO cameras[edit]
As of October 2014[update], GoPro sells three fixed-lens cameras, two without viewfinders and one including a touchscreen viewfinder. A 2-bit LCD on the front of the camera allows access to its menu system, which is controlled by the front and top shutter buttons. The HERO4 Black have dimensions of 41 mm × 59 mm × 30 mm and weighs 88 grams (152 grams with housing). Still images from 6 to 12 megapixels can be captured. The cameras are sold with a clear polycarbonate HD Housing with a glass lens that is rated shockproof and waterproof to 131 feet (40 m), with a quick-release buckle on the top and threads at the bottom to attach to all of the GoPro mounts. The housing has metal buttons that connect to the camera's controls and has a "skeleton" backdoor option to allow audio recording when the camera is used with a mount but without the need to be watertight or shockproof.[41][non-primary source needed]
Products[edit]
HERO cameras[edit]
35mm[edit]
The 35mm camera (model #001) became available on April 13, 2005. It had dimensions of 2.5 by 3 inches (64 by 76 mm) and weighed 0.45 pounds (200 g). It included the camera, a clear case with quick release, a camera strap and ski glove adapter lash. It could pivot "on the fly" and be functional to a depth in water of about 15 feet (5 m). It was described as a "reusable wrist camera" and included a roll of 24 exposure Kodak 400 film.
Digital[edit]
The Digital HERO released in 2006 (Model: SQ907 mini-cam) had a 640×460 camera and shot VGA definition 320X240 (10fps) video for a maximum of 10 seconds. The Digital HERO1 had 32 MB internal memory without SD slot.
Digital 3[edit]
The Digital HERO3 released in 2007 had a 3-megapixel camera and shot standard definition 512×384 video. It was rated up to 30 m (98.4 feet) in depth.[42]
Digital 5[edit]
The Digital HERO5 was first introduced on December 5, 2006. It had a 5-megapixel still photo sensor and supported standard definition (512×384) video capture. It ran on two AAA batteries, had 16 MB of internal memory and could function with a 2 GB SD card. Its housing was rated to 100 ft/30 meters depth. Its dimensions were 2.6 × 1.75 × 1.25 inches (66 × 44 × 32 mm). The camera is not designed to work with the newer HD HERO line of housings, although the standard screw mounts are indeed compatible.

HERO2[edit]
The HERO2 was launched on October 24, 2011. It has an 11 MP image sensor, improved low-light capability and records at up to 120 fps.[46] It was sold with three different accessory packages as the Outdoor, Motorsports, and Surf Editions.[47]
HERO3[edit]
In late 2012, GoPro announced the HERO3 line of cameras.[48] These new cameras came in three editions: black, silver and white.
All three versions of the HERO3 come in a new 30% smaller and 25% lighter package, with WiFi functionality built in. The change of the physical dimensions of the cameras compared to the previous generations (HERO1 and HERO2 were physically identical) means that some of the camera accessories for HD HERO Original and HERO2 are not compatible with HERO3, so GoPro made new versions of those accessories specifically for HERO3 (and mostly for HERO3+, see below). Those new versions of accessories are usually not compatible with older Hero camera generations. However, a lot of other accessories are compatible with all HD Hero camera generations.
The HERO3 Silver and Black cameras have significantly less battery endurance than the HD HERO Original and HERO2.[49] For example, in 720p resolution with 25/30 fps, while HD HERO Original and HERO2 have a stated battery runtime of 3 hours, HERO3 Silver Edition has a stated battery runtime of 2 hours, and HERO3 Black Edition has a stated battery runtime of 1.5 hours (the Black Edition's "most economical" setting is 1080p/30 fps, so this also partially contributes to its poor battery runtime).
The Black Edition[50][not in citation given] has a new 12 MP sensor that can capture 4K UHD digital video at 15 fps, 2.7K video at 30 fps, 1440p at 48 fps, 1080p at 60 fps, 960p at 100 fps, 720p at 120 fps and WVGA at 240 fps. The Black edition also includes the WiFi Remote. The Black Edition cannot record at 25/30 fps in 720p and WVGA resolutions; it can only record at very fast frame rates in those resolutions. This is a deliberate firmware limitation, as the manufacturer does not expect that this high-end camera model will be used at these lower resolutions and frame rates.
The Silver Edition uses the same 11 MP sensor as the HERO2, and the White edition uses the same 5 MP sensor as the HD HERO Original.

In October 2013, GoPro released the HERO3+, available in Black and Silver Editions,[51] replacing the HERO3 generation. The HERO3 White Edition remains as GoPro's low-end device.
The HERO3+ camera models claim dramatically improved low light performance and have a waterproof enclosure which is 20% lighter and 15% smaller than the HERO3's, according to the GoPro website. The HERO3+ camera housing is 20% smaller than the HERO3. The cameras are claimed to have improved image sharpness (close focus down to 7" vs about 3 ft on the HERO3, at the expense of distant focus which is slightly less sharp[clarification needed] with HERO3+), and better audio functionality with wind noise reduction. Battery life is claimed to be 30% longer than for the HERO3 model (both through better efficiency and a higher-capacity battery of the same dimensions).[49][52]
The Black Edition has video modes of 1440p48,[53] 1080p60, 960p100 and 720p120 as well as 4K15 and 2.7K30 and can shoot 12MP stills at up to 30 fps. Along with the increased resolution, the HERO3+ Black Edition also offers an optional function in firmware (called "SuperView") which increases the field of view. It has additional functions, including dynamic low light situation adjustment, higher-quality recording modes (higher bitrates, no white balance applied, etc.) etc. The Black Edition continues to include a Wifi Remote. It does not have the ability to record 25/30 fps in 720p and WVGA modes (it can only record at very fast frame rates in those lower resolutions). This is an intentional firmware limitation, as the manufacturer does not expect a camera with its capabilities to be used at low resolution and frame rate. The battery runtime of HERO3+ Black Edition is significantly longer than HERO3 Black Edition but 30–50% lower than the battery runtime of the older HERO2 and HERO1.
The Silver Edition has video modes of 1080p60 and 720p120 and can shoot 10MP stills at up to 10 fps.[54] In contrast to the Black Edition, the Silver Edition can record at 25/30 fps (or higher) in all supported resolutions. HERO3+ Silver Edition also has about 25%-50% longer battery runtime during recording than HERO3+ Black Edition (they both use the same batteries).[52] The difference in runtime depends on the resolution/fps combination, and whether WiFi and GoPro mobile application are used during recording. The difference in runtime increases as the fps is lowered and the additional functions are deactivated on both cameras. The battery runtime of HERO3+ Silver Edition is similar to the battery runtime of HERO2 and HERO1.
The HERO3 HD camera was awarded the 2013 Technology & Engineering Emmy Award for its contribution to television.[55]
HERO4[edit]




GoPro Hero 4 Silver Edition


In September 2014, GoPro announced the HERO4, available in Black Edition and Silver Edition,[44] which replace their respective HERO3+ generation predecessors. The HERO Session, a budget camera, was also announced.
The HERO4 Black Edition still has a 12 mp CMOS and a f/2.8 fixed maximum aperture and focus free. It adds Bluetooth connectivity, Highlight tag, Protune Available for photo and a new processor claimed by GoPro to be twice as fast as that of the HERO3+ Black Edition, doubling the frame rates in most resolutions. The HERO4 Black Edition can record 4K UHD video (3840×2160) at a frame rate of 24, 25 and 30 fps.[56] In Superview mode, 4k is only possible at 25 fps. Many other rates and resolutions are available. The HERO4 Black Edition still shoots stills at a maximum of 12MP with a maximum burst rate of 30 fps. With Wi-Fi disabled at 4k/30, GoPro claims the HERO4 Black Edition battery life to be 65 minutes, increasing to a maximum of 1h 50' at 720p/240.[57] The HERO4 Black battery is in a different form factor than its predecessors. Initial side-by-side comparisons of HERO3+ and HERO4 Black edition video results suggest that the newer model has more detail at long range and similar performance at close range.
The HERO4 Silver Edition is basically a HERO3 Black Edition with the addition of a micro speaker,[58] built-in touch screen display, Protune for photo and highlight tag the first GoPro with this, a lower clocked Cortex-A9 and missing the Black Editions integrated analog-to-digital converter which supports a wider variety of professional low-sensitivity external mics.[59] The video modes supported by the HERO4 Silver Edition are similar to those of the HERO3+ Black, due to the higher processing speed and thermal requirements of 4K video (3840×2160), but it supports Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and contains the same,[60][61] Ambarella Inc. A9[62] SoC as in the HERO4 Black.
The HERO Session, released July 6, 2015, is 50% smaller and 40% lighter comparing to other versions of the GoPro HERO4 camera.[63]
The HERO4 models maintain the H.264 video codec of previous versions and MP4 file formats. GoPro claims the mono microphone in both the Black and Silver Editions has twice the dynamic range of the HERO3+, and that the HERO4 Black and Silver Editions have improved low-light performance.

HERO+LCD[edit]
In June 2015, the company started to sell a new camera: GoPro HERO+LCD, which provides video recording at 1080p at 60 fps/and 8 megapixel photos. GoPro HERO+LCD has a touch screen to preview the shot to frame the scene perfectly and letting user easily navigate the menu.[67] New feature in the camera -Instant camera editing. GoPro HERO+LCD is waterproof, because it is built directly into a waterproof case (waterproof to 131 feet (40 m)). The device also includes a feature HiLight Tagging and built-in video editing function, which allows user to put a label on the main points while shooting video or in the process of view, which makes it possible to quickly find desired footage later. Technical specifications: video resolution 1080p 60 FPS / 720p 60 FPS, photo resolution 8 MP / 5 FPS burst, built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, user-friendly modes like QuikCapture, SuperView and Auto Low Light, waterproof to 131’ (40 m), built-in touch display.

However, it does not have an LCD built-in touch display and it is slightly lighter than HERO+LCD. The HERO+ weighs at 123 g whereas the HERO+LCD weighs 127 g. The housing also remained the same. This camera is priced at USD $199.99.

GoPro KARMA Drone[edit]




GoPro drone Karma


Karma Drone became available October 23, 2016. GoPro launched the highly anticipated Karma Drone for $799, which includes the Drone, controller, stabilizer, Karma Grip, and case. The drone can be bundled with a HERO5 Black for $1099 and with a HERO5 Session for $999. The drone is also compatible with the HERO 4 Black and Silver. Gross margins may come in below company averages initially, but over time the firm should cut out costs with each generation as they have done with the cameras. The Drone has 20 minutes of battery life.[70] The stabilizer can be taken out and attached to a Karma stick, which can be sold separately for $299.99 and the presentation of a downhill mountain biker POV with minimal shake. The Karma stick has greater than 1-hour battery life.
On November 8, 2016, Go Pro announced the recall of the Karma Drone following reports of loss of electrical power on the drone during operation.[71]
On February 1, 2017, the company announced that the Karma Drone will return to stores with a redesigned battery latch.[72]

History[edit]
The company was founded by Nick Woodman in 2004.[3] He was motivated by a 2002 surfing trip to Australia in which he was hoping to capture quality action photos, but could not because amateur photographers could not get close enough or buy quality equipment at reasonable prices.[4] His desire for a camera system that could capture the professional angles inspired the 'GoPro' name.[5][6]
Woodman raised a portion of his initial capital by selling bead and shell belts for under US $20 from his VW van[7] and, later, fashionable camera straps. He also received over $230,000 from his parents to invest in the business.[8][9]
In 2004, the company sold its first camera system, which used 35 mm film.[5] Digital still and video cameras were later introduced. As of 2014[update], a fixed-lens HD video camera with a wide 170-degree lens was available; two or more can be paired to create 360 video.[5][10]
On June 4, 2014, the company announced the appointment of former Microsoft executive Tony Bates as President reporting directly to Woodman.[11]
In January 2016, GoPro partnered with Periscope for live streaming.[12]
After growing the number of employees by more than 500 in 2015, the company responded to weak sales in the fourth quarter by cutting about 7% of its workforce (100 workers) in January 2016.[13]
At its peak, a share of GoPro was valued at $86, but on September 27, 2016, only $16.79.[14]
In November 2016, the company announced it was laying off an additional 200 employees in an effort to reduce costs. The company also announced that President Tony Bates would be stepping down at the end of 2016.[15]
Corporate actions[edit]
On March 30, 2011, GoPro acquired CineForm. The acquisition included the CineForm 444 video codec used in the film Slumdog Millionaire. The company claimed that the codec "makes HD and 3D editing faster and more convenient without sacrificing image quality". It was incorporated in the company's 3D Hero System shortly after the acquisition.[16][17]
In March 2013, GoPro issued a DMCA takedown notice to website DigitalRev.com, which had posted a review[18] of its product, citing trademark use as a breach of copyright. This notice was retracted 10 days later, citing "erroneous enforcement".[19][20]
On February 29, 2016, GoPro spent $105 million and acquired two start-ups, namely, Stupeflix and Vemory, for their video editing tools Replay and Splice.[21][22]
IPO[edit]
On February 7, 2014, GoPro submitted a confidential filing for an initial public offering (IPO) with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).[23]
On May 19, 2014, GoPro filed its S-1 with the SEC without specifying the number of shares or their price. The company stated that they hoped to raise at least $100 million through the sale of shares, using the money to pay off debt in full ($111 million as of March 31, 2014) and "to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, technologies or assets". They said that they planned to list on the NASDAQ stock exchange using the symbol 'GPRO.'[24][25]
The expected price range was $21 to $24 a share; on June 25, 2014, GoPro sold 17.8 million shares to initial investors at $24 per share (totaling $427.2M).[26] At the IPO price the company was valued at $2.95 billion.[24] 1.5 percent of those shares were allotted to LOYAL3, a technology platform that allows small investors to participate.[27][28]
An important reason for GoPro's decision to go public was the potential to become a media company to generate additional revenue from the content its cameras create.[29][30]
Product lines[edit]
HERO cameras[edit]
Woodman worked on his first camera for two years after founding the company, eventually introducing the GoPro 35mm HERO in September 2004 at San Diego's Action Sports Retailer trade show.[31] In its first year GoPro sold $150,000 worth of products.[31] In 2006 the company introduced its first Digital HERO, with 10 second video capability, and generated $800,000 in revenue. The following year GoPro sales quadrupled to $3.4 million.[31]
In 2014, the company was selling the HERO3+ in editions of different colors. It was capable of filming in 16:9 aspect ratio, supporting 4K UHD video and 12MP still photographs.[32] The HERO4 was introduced on 24 September 2014.[33]
GoPro KARMA & GoPro KARMA Grip[edit]




GoPro drone Karma


The GoPro Karma is GoPro's consumer drone.[citation needed]
In 2014, GoPro entered into discussions with DJI for a private label model built with the GoPro branding. After the failure of these negotiations, GoPro entered into an agreement with 3D Robotics (3DR) for a similar partnership based on 3DR's flight controllers. 3DR failed to meet their agreed upon timelines. As a result, GoPro took full control of the development process in mid-2015.
Scheduled to be released early 2016, the GoPro Karma project was delayed several times before the GoPro Karma was announced with an introduction date of October 23, 2016. The Karma was released along with newer models of the HERO5 and Session cameras and features a removable handheld stabilizer (gimbal) integrated into the design. After a few customers complained about power failure during operation, GoPro recalled Karma drones and gave customers full refunds.[34]
In February 2017, GoPro re-launched the Karma Drone.[35]
Accessories[edit]
GoPro produces various mounting accessories for its cameras including a 3-way mount, suction cup, chest harness, jaws-type flexible clamp, dog harness, surfing mount, etc.[36]
Video editing[edit]
The company developed GoPro Studio, simple video editing software to edit camera footage,[37] with v2.5 released in October 2014. It was reported that GoPro intended to also become a content provider, also with a new app for the HERO5 called GoPro Quik to share, and edit videos easier.[30]
Content company[edit]
In April 2014, GoPro was listed by Adweek as one of the "Top 10 Best Brand Channels on YouTube" based on a combination of views, shares, comments and overall engagement.[38] Content is uploaded daily, an additional source of revenue for the company.[39]
As part of its transformation to a media company in 2014, GoPro created additional channels with GoPro content on YouTube, Virgin America, and Xbox Live.[29] This was extended to the PlayStation Network in 2015.[40]
HD HERO cameras[edit]
As of October 2014[update], GoPro sells three fixed-lens cameras, two without viewfinders and one including a touchscreen viewfinder. A 2-bit LCD on the front of the camera allows access to its menu system, which is controlled by the front and top shutter buttons. The HERO4 Black have dimensions of 41 mm × 59 mm × 30 mm and weighs 88 grams (152 grams with housing). Still images from 6 to 12 megapixels can be captured. The cameras are sold with a clear polycarbonate HD Housing with a glass lens that is rated shockproof and waterproof to 131 feet (40 m), with a quick-release buckle on the top and threads at the bottom to attach to all of the GoPro mounts. The housing has metal buttons that connect to the camera's controls and has a "skeleton" backdoor option to allow audio recording when the camera is used with a mount but without the need to be watertight or shockproof.[41][non-primary source needed]

The 35mm camera (model #001) became available on April 13, 2005. It had dimensions of 2.5 by 3 inches (64 by 76 mm) and weighed 0.45 pounds (200 g). It included the camera, a clear case with quick release, a camera strap and ski glove adapter lash. It could pivot "on the fly" and be functional to a depth in water of about 15 feet (5 m). It was described as a "reusable wrist camera" and included a roll of 24 exposure Kodak 400 film.
Digital[edit]
The Digital HERO released in 2006 (Model: SQ907 mini-cam) had a 640×460 camera and shot VGA definition 320X240 (10fps) video for a maximum of 10 seconds. The Digital HERO1 had 32 MB internal memory without SD slot.
Digital 3[edit]
The Digital HERO3 released in 2007 had a 3-megapixel camera and shot standard definition 512×384 video. It was rated up to 30 m (98.4 feet) in depth.[42]
Digital 5[edit]
The Digital HERO5 was first introduced on December 5, 2006. It had a 5-megapixel still photo sensor and supported standard definition (512×384) video capture. It ran on two AAA batteries, had 16 MB of internal memory and could function with a 2 GB SD card. Its housing was rated to 100 ft/30 meters depth. Its dimensions were 2.6 × 1.75 × 1.25 inches (66 × 44 × 32 mm). The camera is not designed to work with the newer HD HERO line of housings, although the standard screw mounts are indeed compatible.

HERO2[edit]
The HERO2 was launched on October 24, 2011. It has an 11 MP image sensor, improved low-light capability and records at up to 120 fps.[46] It was sold with three different accessory packages as the Outdoor, Motorsports, and Surf Editions.[47]
HERO3[edit]
In late 2012, GoPro announced the HERO3 line of cameras.[48] These new cameras came in three editions: black, silver and white.
All three versions of the HERO3 come in a new 30% smaller and 25% lighter package, with WiFi functionality built in. The change of the physical dimensions of the cameras compared to the previous generations (HERO1 and HERO2 were physically identical) means that some of the camera accessories for HD HERO Original and HERO2 are not compatible with HERO3, so GoPro made new versions of those accessories specifically for HERO3 (and mostly for HERO3+, see below). Those new versions of accessories are usually not compatible with older Hero camera generations. However, a lot of other accessories are compatible with all HD Hero camera generations.
The HERO3 Silver and Black cameras have significantly less battery endurance than the HD HERO Original and HERO2.[49] For example, in 720p resolution with 25/30 fps, while HD HERO Original and HERO2 have a stated battery runtime of 3 hours, HERO3 Silver Edition has a stated battery runtime of 2 hours, and HERO3 Black Edition has a stated battery runtime of 1.5 hours (the Black Edition's "most economical" setting is 1080p/30 fps, so this also partially contributes to its poor battery runtime).
The Black Edition[50][not in citation given] has a new 12 MP sensor that can capture 4K UHD digital video at 15 fps, 2.7K video at 30 fps, 1440p at 48 fps, 1080p at 60 fps, 960p at 100 fps, 720p at 120 fps and WVGA at 240 fps. The Black edition also includes the WiFi Remote. The Black Edition cannot record at 25/30 fps in 720p and WVGA resolutions; it can only record at very fast frame rates in those resolutions. This is a deliberate firmware limitation, as the manufacturer does not expect that this high-end camera model will be used at these lower resolutions and frame rates.
The Silver Edition uses the same 11 MP sensor as the HERO2, and the White edition uses the same 5 MP sensor as the HD HERO Original.

In October 2013, GoPro released the HERO3+, available in Black and Silver Editions,[51] replacing the HERO3 generation. The HERO3 White Edition remains as GoPro's low-end device.
The HERO3+ camera models claim dramatically improved low light performance and have a waterproof enclosure which is 20% lighter and 15% smaller than the HERO3's, according to the GoPro website. The HERO3+ camera housing is 20% smaller than the HERO3. The cameras are claimed to have improved image sharpness (close focus down to 7" vs about 3 ft on the HERO3, at the expense of distant focus which is slightly less sharp[clarification needed] with HERO3+), and better audio functionality with wind noise reduction. Battery life is claimed to be 30% longer than for the HERO3 model (both through better efficiency and a higher-capacity battery of the same dimensions).[49][52]
The Black Edition has video modes of 1440p48,[53] 1080p60, 960p100 and 720p120 as well as 4K15 and 2.7K30 and can shoot 12MP stills at up to 30 fps. Along with the increased resolution, the HERO3+ Black Edition also offers an optional function in firmware (called "SuperView") which increases the field of view. It has additional functions, including dynamic low light situation adjustment, higher-quality recording modes (higher bitrates, no white balance applied, etc.) etc. The Black Edition continues to include a Wifi Remote. It does not have the ability to record 25/30 fps in 720p and WVGA modes (it can only record at very fast frame rates in those lower resolutions). This is an intentional firmware limitation, as the manufacturer does not expect a camera with its capabilities to be used at low resolution and frame rate. The battery runtime of HERO3+ Black Edition is significantly longer than HERO3 Black Edition but 30–50% lower than the battery runtime of the older HERO2 and HERO1.
The Silver Edition has video modes of 1080p60 and 720p120 and can shoot 10MP stills at up to 10 fps.[54] In contrast to the Black Edition, the Silver Edition can record at 25/30 fps (or higher) in all supported resolutions. HERO3+ Silver Edition also has about 25%-50% longer battery runtime during recording than HERO3+ Black Edition (they both use the same batteries).[52] The difference in runtime depends on the resolution/fps combination, and whether WiFi and GoPro mobile application are used during recording. The difference in runtime increases as the fps is lowered and the additional functions are deactivated on both cameras. The battery runtime of HERO3+ Silver Edition is similar to the battery runtime of HERO2 and HERO1.
The HERO3 HD camera was awarded the 2013 Technology & Engineering Emmy Award for its contribution to television.[55]
HERO4[edit]




GoPro Hero 4 Silver Edition


In September 2014, GoPro announced the HERO4, available in Black Edition and Silver Edition,[44] which replace their respective HERO3+ generation predecessors. The HERO Session, a budget camera, was also announced.
The HERO4 Black Edition still has a 12 mp CMOS and a f/2.8 fixed maximum aperture and focus free. It adds Bluetooth connectivity, Highlight tag, Protune Available for photo and a new processor claimed by GoPro to be twice as fast as that of the HERO3+ Black Edition, doubling the frame rates in most resolutions. The HERO4 Black Edition can record 4K UHD video (3840×2160) at a frame rate of 24, 25 and 30 fps.[56] In Superview mode, 4k is only possible at 25 fps. Many other rates and resolutions are available. The HERO4 Black Edition still shoots stills at a maximum of 12MP with a maximum burst rate of 30 fps. With Wi-Fi disabled at 4k/30, GoPro claims the HERO4 Black Edition battery life to be 65 minutes, increasing to a maximum of 1h 50' at 720p/240.[57] The HERO4 Black battery is in a different form factor than its predecessors. Initial side-by-side comparisons of HERO3+ and HERO4 Black edition video results suggest that the newer model has more detail at long range and similar performance at close range.
The HERO4 Silver Edition is basically a HERO3 Black Edition with the addition of a micro speaker,[58] built-in touch screen display, Protune for photo and highlight tag the first GoPro with this, a lower clocked Cortex-A9 and missing the Black Editions integrated analog-to-digital converter which supports a wider variety of professional low-sensitivity external mics.[59] The video modes supported by the HERO4 Silver Edition are similar to those of the HERO3+ Black, due to the higher processing speed and thermal requirements of 4K video (3840×2160), but it supports Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and contains the same,[60][61] Ambarella Inc. A9[62] SoC as in the HERO4 Black.
The HERO Session, released July 6, 2015, is 50% smaller and 40% lighter comparing to other versions of the GoPro HERO4 camera.[63]
The HERO4 models maintain the H.264 video codec of previous versions and MP4 file formats. GoPro claims the mono microphone in both the Black and Silver Editions has twice the dynamic range of the HERO3+, and that the HERO4 Black and Silver Editions have improved low-light performance.

HERO+LCD[edit]
In June 2015, the company started to sell a new camera: GoPro HERO+LCD, which provides video recording at 1080p at 60 fps/and 8 megapixel photos. GoPro HERO+LCD has a touch screen to preview the shot to frame the scene perfectly and letting user easily navigate the menu.[67] New feature in the camera -Instant camera editing. GoPro HERO+LCD is waterproof, because it is built directly into a waterproof case (waterproof to 131 feet (40 m)). The device also includes a feature HiLight Tagging and built-in video editing function, which allows user to put a label on the main points while shooting video or in the process of view, which makes it possible to quickly find desired footage later. Technical specifications: video resolution 1080p 60 FPS / 720p 60 FPS, photo resolution 8 MP / 5 FPS burst, built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, user-friendly modes like QuikCapture, SuperView and Auto Low Light, waterproof to 131’ (40 m), built-in touch display.
HERO+[edit]
In October 2015, GoPro released its third entry level camera: GoPro HERO+.[44] This camera has everything similar to the previous HERO+LCD like the 1080p 60 fps / 720p 60fps Video Resolution, 8 MP / 5 FPS burst photo resolution, built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, waterproof up to 40 m and other modes like Superview, Auto Low Light, QuikCapture and Timelapse mode which automatically captures photos at set time intervals from 0.5 to 60 seconds. However, it does not have an LCD built-in touch display and it is slightly lighter than HERO+LCD. The HERO+ weighs at 123 g whereas the HERO+LCD weighs 127 g. The housing also remained the same. This camera is priced at USD $199.99.
HERO5[edit]
HERO5 Black and HERO5 Session were introduced in September 2016.[68] In contrast to previous models, they are waterproof up to 10 m, support 4k video recording up to 30 fps, automatic upload of footage to cloud and voice controls.

GoPro KARMA Drone[edit]




GoPro drone Karma


Karma Drone became available October 23, 2016. GoPro launched the highly anticipated Karma Drone for $799, which includes the Drone, controller, stabilizer, Karma Grip, and case. The drone can be bundled with a HERO5 Black for $1099 and with a HERO5 Session for $999. The drone is also compatible with the HERO 4 Black and Silver. Gross margins may come in below company averages initially, but over time the firm should cut out costs with each generation as they have done with the cameras. The Drone has 20 minutes of battery life.[70] The stabilizer can be taken out and attached to a Karma stick, which can be sold separately for $299.99 and the presentation of a downhill mountain biker POV with minimal shake. The Karma stick has greater than 1-hour battery life.
On November 8, 2016, Go Pro announced the recall of the Karma Drone following reports of loss of electrical power on the drone during operation.[71]
On February 1, 2017, the company announced that the Karma Drone will return to stores with a redesigned battery latch.[72]

The Billionaire GoPro Founder Knew His Startup Would Make It When Two Boys Yelled At Him On The Beach

Nick Woodman, CEO and
  founder of GoPro.

GoPro




  Action footage and camera company GoPro went public Thursday
  morning.

  The stock was priced at $24, and now 
  it's trading at $33, a 36% pop.

  Its founder, self-made billionaire Nicholas Woodman, tells
  Bloomberg the first time he realized his company would be
  successful. Two young boys, about 12 years old, yelled out
  GoPro's slogan to him on the beach. GoPro hadn't done any
  advertising and it had only launched one product, a bulky wrist
  camera.

  Here's how Woodman remembers that day:

  Gopro had just launched our first camera. It was a 35-millimeter,
  big, bulky, film camera you wore on the wrist. It sold for $19.99
  in surf shops.





  So I’m checking the surf, wearing the camera, and these two
  little kids are going out surfing and they’re in their wetsuits
  and they have their surfboards. And they’re jogging by me and one
  of them nudges his friend and says, "Hey look! Dude, he’s got a
  GoPro.”

  As they run by me they turn around and say, “GoPro! Be a hero!”
  and throw me a little shocka [hand symbol]. No advertising or
  anything.

  I remember thinking, "They know the slogan. They said it back to
  me. It’s working!" By the
  way, a 12-year-old surfer is a very hard consumer to reach, so
  the fact that they were saying it back to me was very meaningful
  to me.

  Here's the video, 
  from Bloomberg:

Early life and education[edit]
Woodman is the son of Concepcion (née Socarras) and Dean Woodman.[3][4][5][6] His father was born into a Quaker family and co-founded the investment bank Robertson Stephens;[3][7][8] and his mother is of Hispanic descent and re-married Irwin Federman, General Partner of U.S. Venture Partners in 1992.[4] Woodman grew up in Menlo Park, California[9] and Atherton, California,[10] attending the Menlo School, where he graduated in 1993.[11] He developed his interest in surfing during high school and formed the high school's first surfing club. Woodman would sell t-shirts at high school football games to raise money for the surfing club.[12] He earned a bachelor's degree in visual arts and a minor in creative writing from the University of California, San Diego in 1997.[13][10][14] After school, Woodman founded two startups, both of which never fully made it off the ground. The first was a website called EmpowerAll.com, which attempted to sell electronic goods for no more than a $2 markup, and the second was Funbug, a gaming and marketing platform that gave users the chance to win cash prizes. Woodman took the lack of success from both companies personally.[15] After failing to reach success on his own, Nick went home and received a $235,000 investment from his father,[16] an investment banker in Silicon Valley, [17] and used his parents connections to venture capital to launch his career as the head of GoPro.[18]
Career[edit]
While on hiatus in Australia and Indonesia on a surf trip, he used a 35mm camera attached to the palm of his hand by a rubber band to try to capture his surfing activities on film.[14] Seeing that amateur photographers like him – who wanted to capture quality action photos of their activities – had difficulties because either they could not get close enough to the action or were unable to purchase quality equipment at affordable prices, his trip became his inspiration to found GoPro.[14] His solution was to develop a belt that would attach the camera to the body.[14] Woodman and his future wife Jill financed the business by selling shell necklaces they bought in Bali (for $1.90) from their car along the California coast (for $60).[19] His mother loaned him $35,000 and let him borrow her sewing machine, which he used to sew camera straps while experimenting with early designs. His dad loaned him an additional $200,000, which Woodman immediately paid back out of company sales.[3] His desire for a camera system that could capture close up footage inspired the 'GoPro' name.[20][21] The original cameras he developed were point-and-shoot 35mm film cameras which mounted to the user's wrist. Woodman would go about selling his products while using his 1971 Volkwagen Bus that he named 'The Buscuit' as his mobile home.[12] The product has since evolved into a compact digital camera that supports WiFi, can be remotely controlled, has waterproof housing, records to a micro SD card, and is affordable to the average action sports enthusiast ($200–$400). Woodman would often act as the test engineer for their earlier products completing tasks such as attaching a GoPro to a car and driving at speeds of over 130 MPH. In 2004, he made his first big sale when a Japanese company ordered 100 cameras at a sports show.[14][19] Thereafter, sales doubled every year,[13] and in 2012, GoPro sold 2.3 million cameras.[14] In 2005, Woodman appeared on QVC to sell his GoPro Hero. In 2004, GoPro had about $150,000 in revenue which grew to about $350,000 in 2005. In December 2012, the Taiwanese contract manufacturer Foxconn purchased 8.88% of the company for $200 million which set the market value of the company at $2.25 billion making Woodman, who owned the majority of the stock, a billionaire.[14][19] On June 26, 2014, GoPro went public – closing the day at $31.34 a share. In 2014, Woodman was the highest paid US chief executive, paying himself $235 million.[22][23][24]
In 2015, GoPro developed a partnership with the NHL that would enable the NHL to use GoPro products to improve the viewing experience for fans.[25] Woodman has been invited to speak at various tech conferences and in October 2015, Woodman was a guest on the Late Show with Stephen Colbert and wore a GoPro camera for the entirety of the interview.[26] Woodman is set to appear as a shark investor in the sixth season of the show Shark Tank.[27] Woodman has invested $125,000 as of November 2015 on Shark Tank on two investments.[28]
At the beginning of 2016, GoPro started to make a series of job cuts. In January of 2016, Woodman's Company cut 100 jobs, or 7% of his workforce.[29] Later that year, in November 2016, GoPro cut an additional 15% of the GoPro workforce after attempting to branch out beyond its core business of action cameras, as the entertainment division failed to reach profitability.[30]
In December 2016, a class action lawsuit against GoPro was announced. The complaint alleges that GoPro made false and misleading statements to investors and/or failed to disclose flaws in the Company's drones, overstating customer demand, and GoPro's public statements were materially false and misleading. [31][32]
2016 proved to be a tough year for GoPro.[33] With the many changes at and involving GoPro, including numerous job cuts, and falling stock prices, Woodman was listed as one of the year's worst CEOs. [34]
Awards[edit]

2013 National Award Winner of the EY Entrepreneur of the Year Award.
2014 Winner of the Technology and Engineering Emmy Award in the category of Inexpensive Small Rugged HD Camcorders. Woodman brought his GoPro onstage for his acceptance speech.[23][35]

Philanthropy[edit]
After a successful IPO, the couple donated 5.8 million shares of GoPro stock to the Jill + Nicholas Woodman Foundation, a new fund they created at the Silicon Valley Community Foundation in 2014. [36] From 2014 to 2017, the value of the stock donated declined from $500 million to $50.3 million because of the dramatic decline in GoPro stock. Woodman was one of the biggest donors in the tech industry that year; however, it angered investors.[37][38][39]
In March 2014, Woodman was honored for his philanthropic work with BUILD at their 5th annual gala in San Francisco.[40]
Personal life[edit]
Woodman is married to Jill R. Scully[41] and they have three children.[13][14] They live in Woodside, California.[42] Woodman is known as the "mad billionaire" due to his unconventional behavior and eccentricities.[14] Woodman is a strong believer in following one's passions as a way to success stating, "I’m a big believer that when you’re pursuing your passions, your best ideas come to you. Your passions are a bit like your fingerprints: Everybody has them; everybody’s are different. One’s passions may just be a guidebook to one’s life.”[27] In 2015, Woodman hosted an AMA on Reddit. Woodman has often cited his fear of failure as a catalyst for his success stating, "When I got out of college, I gave myself till I was 30 to invent a product. If I couldn't do it by then, I would just get a real job. And that fear – the fear of a real job – motivated me to be an entrepreneur."[43]
In December 2015, Woodman commissioned a 180-foot yacht, estimated to cost between $35 million and $40 million. The boat, expected to be delivered in 2017, is four decks high and comes with a Jacuzzi pool, swim platform, sweeping sun decks, and dining areas. [44]

Early life and education[edit]
Woodman is the son of Concepcion (née Socarras) and Dean Woodman.[3][4][5][6] His father was born into a Quaker family and co-founded the investment bank Robertson Stephens;[3][7][8] and his mother is of Hispanic descent and re-married Irwin Federman, General Partner of U.S. Venture Partners in 1992.[4] Woodman grew up in Menlo Park, California[9] and Atherton, California,[10] attending the Menlo School, where he graduated in 1993.[11] He developed his interest in surfing during high school and formed the high school's first surfing club. Woodman would sell t-shirts at high school football games to raise money for the surfing club.[12] He earned a bachelor's degree in visual arts and a minor in creative writing from the University of California, San Diego in 1997.[13][10][14] After school, Woodman founded two startups, both of which never fully made it off the ground. The first was a website called EmpowerAll.com, which attempted to sell electronic goods for no more than a $2 markup, and the second was Funbug, a gaming and marketing platform that gave users the chance to win cash prizes. Woodman took the lack of success from both companies personally.[15] After failing to reach success on his own, Nick went home and received a $235,000 investment from his father,[16] an investment banker in Silicon Valley, [17] and used his parents connections to venture capital to launch his career as the head of GoPro.[18]
Career[edit]
While on hiatus in Australia and Indonesia on a surf trip, he used a 35mm camera attached to the palm of his hand by a rubber band to try to capture his surfing activities on film.[14] Seeing that amateur photographers like him – who wanted to capture quality action photos of their activities – had difficulties because either they could not get close enough to the action or were unable to purchase quality equipment at affordable prices, his trip became his inspiration to found GoPro.[14] His solution was to develop a belt that would attach the camera to the body.[14] Woodman and his future wife Jill financed the business by selling shell necklaces they bought in Bali (for $1.90) from their car along the California coast (for $60).[19] His mother loaned him $35,000 and let him borrow her sewing machine, which he used to sew camera straps while experimenting with early designs. His dad loaned him an additional $200,000, which Woodman immediately paid back out of company sales.[3] His desire for a camera system that could capture close up footage inspired the 'GoPro' name.[20][21] The original cameras he developed were point-and-shoot 35mm film cameras which mounted to the user's wrist. Woodman would go about selling his products while using his 1971 Volkwagen Bus that he named 'The Buscuit' as his mobile home.[12] The product has since evolved into a compact digital camera that supports WiFi, can be remotely controlled, has waterproof housing, records to a micro SD card, and is affordable to the average action sports enthusiast ($200–$400). Woodman would often act as the test engineer for their earlier products completing tasks such as attaching a GoPro to a car and driving at speeds of over 130 MPH. In 2004, he made his first big sale when a Japanese company ordered 100 cameras at a sports show.[14][19] Thereafter, sales doubled every year,[13] and in 2012, GoPro sold 2.3 million cameras.[14] In 2005, Woodman appeared on QVC to sell his GoPro Hero. In 2004, GoPro had about $150,000 in revenue which grew to about $350,000 in 2005. In December 2012, the Taiwanese contract manufacturer Foxconn purchased 8.88% of the company for $200 million which set the market value of the company at $2.25 billion making Woodman, who owned the majority of the stock, a billionaire.[14][19] On June 26, 2014, GoPro went public – closing the day at $31.34 a share. In 2014, Woodman was the highest paid US chief executive, paying himself $235 million.[22][23][24]
In 2015, GoPro developed a partnership with the NHL that would enable the NHL to use GoPro products to improve the viewing experience for fans.[25] Woodman has been invited to speak at various tech conferences and in October 2015, Woodman was a guest on the Late Show with Stephen Colbert and wore a GoPro camera for the entirety of the interview.[26] Woodman is set to appear as a shark investor in the sixth season of the show Shark Tank.[27] Woodman has invested $125,000 as of November 2015 on Shark Tank on two investments.[28]
At the beginning of 2016, GoPro started to make a series of job cuts. In January of 2016, Woodman's Company cut 100 jobs, or 7% of his workforce.[29] Later that year, in November 2016, GoPro cut an additional 15% of the GoPro workforce after attempting to branch out beyond its core business of action cameras, as the entertainment division failed to reach profitability.[30]
In December 2016, a class action lawsuit against GoPro was announced. The complaint alleges that GoPro made false and misleading statements to investors and/or failed to disclose flaws in the Company's drones, overstating customer demand, and GoPro's public statements were materially false and misleading. [31][32]
2016 proved to be a tough year for GoPro.[33] With the many changes at and involving GoPro, including numerous job cuts, and falling stock prices, Woodman was listed as one of the year's worst CEOs. [34]
Awards[edit]

2013 National Award Winner of the EY Entrepreneur of the Year Award.
2014 Winner of the Technology and Engineering Emmy Award in the category of Inexpensive Small Rugged HD Camcorders. Woodman brought his GoPro onstage for his acceptance speech.[23][35]

Philanthropy[edit]
After a successful IPO, the couple donated 5.8 million shares of GoPro stock to the Jill + Nicholas Woodman Foundation, a new fund they created at the Silicon Valley Community Foundation in 2014. [36] From 2014 to 2017, the value of the stock donated declined from $500 million to $50.3 million because of the dramatic decline in GoPro stock. Woodman was one of the biggest donors in the tech industry that year; however, it angered investors.[37][38][39]
In March 2014, Woodman was honored for his philanthropic work with BUILD at their 5th annual gala in San Francisco.[40]
Personal life[edit]
Woodman is married to Jill R. Scully[41] and they have three children.[13][14] They live in Woodside, California.[42] Woodman is known as the "mad billionaire" due to his unconventional behavior and eccentricities.[14] Woodman is a strong believer in following one's passions as a way to success stating, "I’m a big believer that when you’re pursuing your passions, your best ideas come to you. Your passions are a bit like your fingerprints: Everybody has them; everybody’s are different. One’s passions may just be a guidebook to one’s life.”[27] In 2015, Woodman hosted an AMA on Reddit. Woodman has often cited his fear of failure as a catalyst for his success stating, "When I got out of college, I gave myself till I was 30 to invent a product. If I couldn't do it by then, I would just get a real job. And that fear – the fear of a real job – motivated me to be an entrepreneur."[43]
In December 2015, Woodman commissioned a 180-foot yacht, estimated to cost between $35 million and $40 million. The boat, expected to be delivered in 2017, is four decks high and comes with a Jacuzzi pool, swim platform, sweeping sun decks, and dining areas. [44]

Early life and education[edit]
Woodman is the son of Concepcion (née Socarras) and Dean Woodman.[3][4][5][6] His father was born into a Quaker family and co-founded the investment bank Robertson Stephens;[3][7][8] and his mother is of Hispanic descent and re-married Irwin Federman, General Partner of U.S. Venture Partners in 1992.[4] Woodman grew up in Menlo Park, California[9] and Atherton, California,[10] attending the Menlo School, where he graduated in 1993.[11] He developed his interest in surfing during high school and formed the high school's first surfing club.

Philanthropy[edit]
After a successful IPO, the couple donated 5.8 million shares of GoPro stock to the Jill + Nicholas Woodman Foundation, a new fund they created at the Silicon Valley Community Foundation in 2014. [36] From 2014 to 2017, the value of the stock donated declined from $500 million to $50.3 million because of the dramatic decline in GoPro stock. Woodman was one of the biggest donors in the tech industry that year; however, it angered investors.[37][38][39]
In March 2014, Woodman was honored for his philanthropic work with BUILD at their 5th annual gala in San Francisco.[40]

Early life and education[edit]
Woodman is the son of Concepcion (née Socarras) and Dean Woodman.[3][4][5][6] His father was born into a Quaker family and co-founded the investment bank Robertson Stephens;[3][7][8] and his mother is of Hispanic descent and re-married Irwin Federman, General Partner of U.S. Venture Partners in 1992.[4] Woodman grew up in Menlo Park, California[9] and Atherton, California,[10] attending the Menlo School, where he graduated in 1993.[11] He developed his interest in surfing during high school and formed the high school's first surfing club. Woodman would sell t-shirts at high school football games to raise money for the surfing club.[12] He earned a bachelor's degree in visual arts and a minor in creative writing from the University of California, San Diego in 1997.[13][10][14] After school, Woodman founded two startups, both of which never fully made it off the ground. The first was a website called EmpowerAll.com, which attempted to sell electronic goods for no more than a $2 markup, and the second was Funbug, a gaming and marketing platform that gave users the chance to win cash prizes. Woodman took the lack of success from both companies personally.[15] After failing to reach success on his own, Nick went home and received a $235,000 investment from his father,[16] an investment banker in Silicon Valley, [17] and used his parents connections to venture capital to launch his career as the head of GoPro.[18]
Career[edit]
While on hiatus in Australia and Indonesia on a surf trip, he used a 35mm camera attached to the palm of his hand by a rubber band to try to capture his surfing activities on film.[14] Seeing that amateur photographers like him – who wanted to capture quality action photos of their activities – had difficulties because either they could not get close enough to the action or were unable to purchase quality equipment at affordable prices, his trip became his inspiration to found GoPro.[14] His solution was to develop a belt that would attach the camera to the body.[14] Woodman and his future wife Jill financed the business by selling shell necklaces they bought in Bali (for $1.90) from their car along the California coast (for $60).[19] His mother loaned him $35,000 and let him borrow her sewing machine, which he used to sew camera straps while experimenting with early designs. His dad loaned him an additional $200,000, which Woodman immediately paid back out of company sales.[3] His desire for a camera system that could capture close up footage inspired the 'GoPro' name.[20][21] The original cameras he developed were point-and-shoot 35mm film cameras which mounted to the user's wrist. Woodman would go about selling his products while using his 1971 Volkwagen Bus that he named 'The Buscuit' as his mobile home.[12] The product has since evolved into a compact digital camera that supports WiFi, can be remotely controlled, has waterproof housing, records to a micro SD card, and is affordable to the average action sports enthusiast ($200–$400). Woodman would often act as the test engineer for their earlier products completing tasks such as attaching a GoPro to a car and driving at speeds of over 130 MPH. In 2004, he made his first big sale when a Japanese company ordered 100 cameras at a sports show.[14][19] Thereafter, sales doubled every year,[13] and in 2012, GoPro sold 2.3 million cameras.[14] In 2005, Woodman appeared on QVC to sell his GoPro Hero. In 2004, GoPro had about $150,000 in revenue which grew to about $350,000 in 2005. In December 2012, the Taiwanese contract manufacturer Foxconn purchased 8.88% of the company for $200 million which set the market value of the company at $2.25 billion making Woodman, who owned the majority of the stock, a billionaire.[14][19] On June 26, 2014, GoPro went public – closing the day at $31.34 a share. In 2014, Woodman was the highest paid US chief executive, paying himself $235 million.[22][23][24]
In 2015, GoPro developed a partnership with the NHL that would enable the NHL to use GoPro products to improve the viewing experience for fans.[25] Woodman has been invited to speak at various tech conferences and in October 2015, Woodman was a guest on the Late Show with Stephen Colbert and wore a GoPro camera for the entirety of the interview.[26] Woodman is set to appear as a shark investor in the sixth season of the show Shark Tank.[27] Woodman has invested $125,000 as of November 2015 on Shark Tank on two investments.[28]
At the beginning of 2016, GoPro started to make a series of job cuts. In January of 2016, Woodman's Company cut 100 jobs, or 7% of his workforce.[29] Later that year, in November 2016, GoPro cut an additional 15% of the GoPro workforce after attempting to branch out beyond its core business of action cameras, as the entertainment division failed to reach profitability.[30]
In December 2016, a class action lawsuit against GoPro was announced. The complaint alleges that GoPro made false and misleading statements to investors and/or failed to disclose flaws in the Company's drones, overstating customer demand, and GoPro's public statements were materially false and misleading. [31][32]
2016 proved to be a tough year for GoPro.[33] With the many changes at and involving GoPro, including numerous job cuts, and falling stock prices, Woodman was listed as one of the year's worst CEOs. [34]
Awards[edit]

2013 National Award Winner of the EY Entrepreneur of the Year Award.
2014 Winner of the Technology and Engineering Emmy Award in the category of Inexpensive Small Rugged HD Camcorders. Woodman brought his GoPro onstage for his acceptance speech.[23][35]

Philanthropy[edit]
After a successful IPO, the couple donated 5.8 million shares of GoPro stock to the Jill + Nicholas Woodman Foundation, a new fund they created at the Silicon Valley Community Foundation in 2014. [36] From 2014 to 2017, the value of the stock donated declined from $500 million to $50.3 million because of the dramatic decline in GoPro stock. Woodman was one of the biggest donors in the tech industry that year; however, it angered investors.[37][38][39]
In March 2014, Woodman was honored for his philanthropic work with BUILD at their 5th annual gala in San Francisco.[40]
Personal life[edit]
Woodman is married to Jill R. Scully[41] and they have three children.[13][14] They live in Woodside, California.[42] Woodman is known as the "mad billionaire" due to his unconventional behavior and eccentricities.[14] Woodman is a strong believer in following one's passions as a way to success stating, "I’m a big believer that when you’re pursuing your passions, your best ideas come to you. Your passions are a bit like your fingerprints: Everybody has them; everybody’s are different. One’s passions may just be a guidebook to one’s life.”[27] In 2015, Woodman hosted an AMA on Reddit. Woodman has often cited his fear of failure as a catalyst for his success stating, "When I got out of college, I gave myself till I was 30 to invent a product. If I couldn't do it by then, I would just get a real job. And that fear – the fear of a real job – motivated me to be an entrepreneur."[43]
In December 2015, Woodman commissioned a 180-foot yacht, estimated to cost between $35 million and $40 million. The boat, expected to be delivered in 2017, is four decks high and comes with a Jacuzzi pool, swim platform, sweeping sun decks, and dining areas. [44]

His dad loaned him an additional $200,000, which Woodman immediately paid back out of company sales.[3] His desire for a camera system that could capture close up footage inspired the 'GoPro' name.[20][21] The original cameras he developed were point-and-shoot 35mm film cameras which mounted to the user's wrist. Woodman would go about selling his products while using his 1971 Volkwagen Bus that he named 'The Buscuit' as his mobile home.[12] The product has since evolved into a compact digital camera that supports WiFi, can be remotely controlled, has waterproof housing, records to a micro SD card, and is affordable to the average action sports enthusiast ($200–$400). Woodman would often act as the test engineer for their earlier products completing tasks such as attaching a GoPro to a car and driving at speeds of over 130 MPH. In 2004, he made his first big sale when a Japanese company ordered 100 cameras at a sports show.[14][19] Thereafter, sales doubled every year,[13] and in 2012, GoPro sold 2.3 million cameras.[14] In 2005, Woodman appeared on QVC to sell his GoPro Hero. In 2004, GoPro had about $150,000 in revenue which grew to about $350,000 in 2005. In December 2012, the Taiwanese contract manufacturer Foxconn purchased 8.88% of the company for $200 million which set the market value of the company at $2.25 billion making Woodman, who owned the majority of the stock, a billionaire.[14][19] On June 26, 2014, GoPro went public – closing the day at $31.34 a share. In 2014, Woodman was the highest paid US chief executive, paying himself $235 million.[22][23][24]
In 2015, GoPro developed a partnership with the NHL that would enable the NHL to use GoPro products to improve the viewing experience for fans.[25] Woodman has been invited to speak at various tech conferences and in October 2015, Woodman was a guest on the Late Show with Stephen Colbert and wore a GoPro camera for the entirety of the interview.[26] Woodman is set to appear as a shark investor in the sixth season of the show Shark Tank.[27] Woodman has invested $125,000 as of November 2015 on Shark Tank on two investments.[28]
At the beginning of 2016, GoPro started to make a series of job cuts. In January of 2016, Woodman's Company cut 100 jobs, or 7% of his workforce.[29] Later that year, in November 2016, GoPro cut an additional 15% of the GoPro workforce after attempting to branch out beyond its core business of action cameras, as the entertainment division failed to reach profitability.[30]
In December 2016, a class action lawsuit against GoPro was announced. The complaint alleges that GoPro made false and misleading statements to investors and/or failed to disclose flaws in the Company's drones, overstating customer demand, and GoPro's public statements were materially false and misleading. [31][32]
2016 proved to be a tough year for GoPro.[33] With the many changes at and involving GoPro, including numerous job cuts, and falling stock prices, Woodman was listed as one of the year's worst CEOs. [34]
Awards[edit]

2013 National Award Winner of the EY Entrepreneur of the Year Award.
2014 Winner of the Technology and Engineering Emmy Award in the category of Inexpensive Small Rugged HD Camcorders. Woodman brought his GoPro onstage for his acceptance speech.[23][35]

Philanthropy[edit]
After a successful IPO, the couple donated 5.8 million shares of GoPro stock to the Jill + Nicholas Woodman Foundation, a new fund they created at the Silicon Valley Community Foundation in 2014. [36] From 2014 to 2017, the value of the stock donated declined from $500 million to $50.3 million because of the dramatic decline in GoPro stock. Woodman was one of the biggest donors in the tech industry that year; however, it angered investors.[37][38][39]
In March 2014, Woodman was honored for his philanthropic work with BUILD at their 5th annual gala in San Francisco.[40]
Personal life[edit]
Woodman is married to Jill R. Scully[41] and they have three children.[13][14] They live in Woodside, California.[42] Woodman is known as the "mad billionaire" due to his unconventional behavior and eccentricities.[14] Woodman is a strong believer in following one's passions as a way to success stating, "I’m a big believer that when you’re pursuing your passions, your best ideas come to you. Your passions are a bit like your fingerprints: Everybody has them; everybody’s are different. One’s passions may just be a guidebook to one’s life.”[27] In 2015, Woodman hosted an AMA on Reddit. Woodman has often cited his fear of failure as a catalyst for his success stating, "When I got out of college, I gave myself till I was 30 to invent a product. If I couldn't do it by then, I would just get a real job. And that fear – the fear of a real job – motivated me to be an entrepreneur."[43]
In December 2015, Woodman commissioned a 180-foot yacht, estimated to cost between $35 million and $40 million. The boat, expected to be delivered in 2017, is four decks high and comes with a Jacuzzi pool, swim platform, sweeping sun decks, and dining areas. [44]

Early life and education[edit]
Woodman is the son of Concepcion (née Socarras) and Dean Woodman.[3][4][5][6] His father was born into a Quaker family and co-founded the investment bank Robertson Stephens;[3][7][8] and his mother is of Hispanic descent and re-married Irwin Federman, General Partner of U.S. Venture Partners in 1992.[4] Woodman grew up in Menlo Park, California[9] and Atherton, California,[10] attending the Menlo School, where he graduated in 1993.[11] He developed his interest in surfing during high school and formed the high school's first surfing club. Woodman would sell t-shirts at high school football games to raise money for the surfing club.[12] He earned a bachelor's degree in visual arts and a minor in creative writing from the University of California, San Diego in 1997.[13][10][14] After school, Woodman founded two startups, both of which never fully made it off the ground. The first was a website called EmpowerAll.com, which attempted to sell electronic goods for no more than a $2 markup, and the second was Funbug, a gaming and marketing platform that gave users the chance to win cash prizes. Woodman took the lack of success from both companies personally.[15] After failing to reach success on his own, Nick went home and received a $235,000 investment from his father,[16] an investment banker in Silicon Valley, [17] and used his parents connections to venture capital to launch his career as the head of GoPro.[18]
Career[edit]
While on hiatus in Australia and Indonesia on a surf trip, he used a 35mm camera attached to the palm of his hand by a rubber band to try to capture his surfing activities on film.[14] Seeing that amateur photographers like him – who wanted to capture quality action photos of their activities – had difficulties because either they could not get close enough to the action or were unable to purchase quality equipment at affordable prices, his trip became his inspiration to found GoPro.[14] His solution was to develop a belt that would attach the camera to the body.[14] Woodman and his future wife Jill financed the business by selling shell necklaces they bought in Bali (for $1.90) from their car along the California coast (for $60).[19] His mother loaned him $35,000 and let him borrow her sewing machine, which he used to sew camera straps while experimenting with early designs. His dad loaned him an additional $200,000, which Woodman immediately paid back out of company sales.[3] His desire for a camera system that could capture close up footage inspired the 'GoPro' name.[20][21] The original cameras he developed were point-and-shoot 35mm film cameras which mounted to the user's wrist.

History[edit]
The company was founded by Nick Woodman in 2004.[3] He was motivated by a 2002 surfing trip to Australia in which he was hoping to capture quality action photos, but could not because amateur photographers could not get close enough or buy quality equipment at reasonable prices.[4] His desire for a camera system that could capture the professional angles inspired the 'GoPro' name.[5][6]
Woodman raised a portion of his initial capital by selling bead and shell belts for under US $20 from his VW van[7] and, later, fashionable camera straps. He also received over $230,000 from his parents to invest in the business.[8][9]
In 2004, the company sold its first camera system, which used 35 mm film.[5] Digital still and video cameras were later introduced. As of 2014[update], a fixed-lens HD video camera with a wide 170-degree lens was available; two or more can be paired to create 360 video.[5][10]
On June 4, 2014, the company announced the appointment of former Microsoft executive Tony Bates as President reporting directly to Woodman.[11]
In January 2016, GoPro partnered with Periscope for live streaming.[12]
After growing the number of employees by more than 500 in 2015, the company responded to weak sales in the fourth quarter by cutting about 7% of its workforce (100 workers) in January 2016.[13]
At its peak, a share of GoPro was valued at $86, but on September 27, 2016, only $16.79.[14]
In November 2016, the company announced it was laying off an additional 200 employees in an effort to reduce costs. The company also announced that President Tony Bates would be stepping down at the end of 2016.[15]
Corporate actions[edit]
On March 30, 2011, GoPro acquired CineForm. The acquisition included the CineForm 444 video codec used in the film Slumdog Millionaire. The company claimed that the codec "makes HD and 3D editing faster and more convenient without sacrificing image quality". It was incorporated in the company's 3D Hero System shortly after the acquisition.[16][17]
In March 2013, GoPro issued a DMCA takedown notice to website DigitalRev.com, which had posted a review[18] of its product, citing trademark use as a breach of copyright. This notice was retracted 10 days later, citing "erroneous enforcement".[19][20]
On February 29, 2016, GoPro spent $105 million and acquired two start-ups, namely, Stupeflix and Vemory, for their video editing tools Replay and Splice.[21][22]
IPO[edit]
On February 7, 2014, GoPro submitted a confidential filing for an initial public offering (IPO) with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).[23]
On May 19, 2014, GoPro filed its S-1 with the SEC without specifying the number of shares or their price. The company stated that they hoped to raise at least $100 million through the sale of shares, using the money to pay off debt in full ($111 million as of March 31, 2014) and "to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, technologies or assets". They said that they planned to list on the NASDAQ stock exchange using the symbol 'GPRO.'[24][25]
The expected price range was $21 to $24 a share; on June 25, 2014, GoPro sold 17.8 million shares to initial investors at $24 per share (totaling $427.2M).[26] At the IPO price the company was valued at $2.95 billion.[24] 1.5 percent of those shares were allotted to LOYAL3, a technology platform that allows small investors to participate.[27][28]
An important reason for GoPro's decision to go public was the potential to become a media company to generate additional revenue from the content its cameras create.[29][30]
Product lines[edit]
HERO cameras[edit]
Woodman worked on his first camera for two years after founding the company, eventually introducing the GoPro 35mm HERO in September 2004 at San Diego's Action Sports Retailer trade show.[31] In its first year GoPro sold $150,000 worth of products.[31] In 2006 the company introduced its first Digital HERO, with 10 second video capability, and generated $800,000 in revenue. The following year GoPro sales quadrupled to $3.4 million.[31]
In 2014, the company was selling the HERO3+ in editions of different colors. It was capable of filming in 16:9 aspect ratio, supporting 4K UHD video and 12MP still photographs.[32] The HERO4 was introduced on 24 September 2014.[33]
GoPro KARMA & GoPro KARMA Grip[edit]




GoPro drone Karma


The GoPro Karma is GoPro's consumer drone.[citation needed]
In 2014, GoPro entered into discussions with DJI for a private label model built with the GoPro branding. After the failure of these negotiations, GoPro entered into an agreement with 3D Robotics (3DR) for a similar partnership based on 3DR's flight controllers. 3DR failed to meet their agreed upon timelines. As a result, GoPro took full control of the development process in mid-2015.
Scheduled to be released early 2016, the GoPro Karma project was delayed several times before the GoPro Karma was announced with an introduction date of October 23, 2016. The Karma was released along with newer models of the HERO5 and Session cameras and features a removable handheld stabilizer (gimbal) integrated into the design. After a few customers complained about power failure during operation, GoPro recalled Karma drones and gave customers full refunds.[34]
In February 2017, GoPro re-launched the Karma Drone.[35]
Accessories[edit]
GoPro produces various mounting accessories for its cameras including a 3-way mount, suction cup, chest harness, jaws-type flexible clamp, dog harness, surfing mount, etc.[36]
Video editing[edit]
The company developed GoPro Studio, simple video editing software to edit camera footage,[37] with v2.5 released in October 2014. It was reported that GoPro intended to also become a content provider, also with a new app for the HERO5 called GoPro Quik to share, and edit videos easier.[30]
Content company[edit]
In April 2014, GoPro was listed by Adweek as one of the "Top 10 Best Brand Channels on YouTube" based on a combination of views, shares, comments and overall engagement.[38] Content is uploaded daily, an additional source of revenue for the company.[39]
As part of its transformation to a media company in 2014, GoPro created additional channels with GoPro content on YouTube, Virgin America, and Xbox Live.[29] This was extended to the PlayStation Network in 2015.[40]
HD HERO cameras[edit]
As of October 2014[update], GoPro sells three fixed-lens cameras, two without viewfinders and one including a touchscreen viewfinder. A 2-bit LCD on the front of the camera allows access to its menu system, which is controlled by the front and top shutter buttons. The HERO4 Black have dimensions of 41 mm × 59 mm × 30 mm and weighs 88 grams (152 grams with housing). Still images from 6 to 12 megapixels can be captured. The cameras are sold with a clear polycarbonate HD Housing with a glass lens that is rated shockproof and waterproof to 131 feet (40 m), with a quick-release buckle on the top and threads at the bottom to attach to all of the GoPro mounts. The housing has metal buttons that connect to the camera's controls and has a "skeleton" backdoor option to allow audio recording when the camera is used with a mount but without the need to be watertight or shockproof.[41][non-primary source needed]
Products[edit]
HERO cameras[edit]
35mm[edit]
The 35mm camera (model #001) became available on April 13, 2005. It had dimensions of 2.5 by 3 inches (64 by 76 mm) and weighed 0.45 pounds (200 g). It included the camera, a clear case with quick release, a camera strap and ski glove adapter lash. It could pivot "on the fly" and be functional to a depth in water of about 15 feet (5 m). It was described as a "reusable wrist camera" and included a roll of 24 exposure Kodak 400 film.
Digital[edit]
The Digital HERO released in 2006 (Model: SQ907 mini-cam) had a 640×460 camera and shot VGA definition 320X240 (10fps) video for a maximum of 10 seconds. The Digital HERO1 had 32 MB internal memory without SD slot.
Digital 3[edit]
The Digital HERO3 released in 2007 had a 3-megapixel camera and shot standard definition 512×384 video. It was rated up to 30 m (98.4 feet) in depth.[42]
Digital 5[edit]
The Digital HERO5 was first introduced on December 5, 2006. It had a 5-megapixel still photo sensor and supported standard definition (512×384) video capture. It ran on two AAA batteries, had 16 MB of internal memory and could function with a 2 GB SD card. Its housing was rated to 100 ft/30 meters depth. Its dimensions were 2.6 × 1.75 × 1.25 inches (66 × 44 × 32 mm). The camera is not designed to work with the newer HD HERO line of housings, although the standard screw mounts are indeed compatible.

HERO2[edit]
The HERO2 was launched on October 24, 2011. It has an 11 MP image sensor, improved low-light capability and records at up to 120 fps.[46] It was sold with three different accessory packages as the Outdoor, Motorsports, and Surf Editions.[47]
HERO3[edit]
In late 2012, GoPro announced the HERO3 line of cameras.[48] These new cameras came in three editions: black, silver and white.
All three versions of the HERO3 come in a new 30% smaller and 25% lighter package, with WiFi functionality built in. The change of the physical dimensions of the cameras compared to the previous generations (HERO1 and HERO2 were physically identical) means that some of the camera accessories for HD HERO Original and HERO2 are not compatible with HERO3, so GoPro made new versions of those accessories specifically for HERO3 (and mostly for HERO3+, see below). Those new versions of accessories are usually not compatible with older Hero camera generations. However, a lot of other accessories are compatible with all HD Hero camera generations.
The HERO3 Silver and Black cameras have significantly less battery endurance than the HD HERO Original and HERO2.[49] For example, in 720p resolution with 25/30 fps, while HD HERO Original and HERO2 have a stated battery runtime of 3 hours, HERO3 Silver Edition has a stated battery runtime of 2 hours, and HERO3 Black Edition has a stated battery runtime of 1.5 hours (the Black Edition's "most economical" setting is 1080p/30 fps, so this also partially contributes to its poor battery runtime).
The Black Edition[50][not in citation given] has a new 12 MP sensor that can capture 4K UHD digital video at 15 fps, 2.7K video at 30 fps, 1440p at 48 fps, 1080p at 60 fps, 960p at 100 fps, 720p at 120 fps and WVGA at 240 fps. The Black edition also includes the WiFi Remote. The Black Edition cannot record at 25/30 fps in 720p and WVGA resolutions; it can only record at very fast frame rates in those resolutions. This is a deliberate firmware limitation, as the manufacturer does not expect that this high-end camera model will be used at these lower resolutions and frame rates.
The Silver Edition uses the same 11 MP sensor as the HERO2, and the White edition uses the same 5 MP sensor as the HD HERO Original.

In October 2013, GoPro released the HERO3+, available in Black and Silver Editions,[51] replacing the HERO3 generation. The HERO3 White Edition remains as GoPro's low-end device.
The HERO3+ camera models claim dramatically improved low light performance and have a waterproof enclosure which is 20% lighter and 15% smaller than the HERO3's, according to the GoPro website. The HERO3+ camera housing is 20% smaller than the HERO3. The cameras are claimed to have improved image sharpness (close focus down to 7" vs about 3 ft on the HERO3, at the expense of distant focus which is slightly less sharp[clarification needed] with HERO3+), and better audio functionality with wind noise reduction. Battery life is claimed to be 30% longer than for the HERO3 model (both through better efficiency and a higher-capacity battery of the same dimensions).[49][52]
The Black Edition has video modes of 1440p48,[53] 1080p60, 960p100 and 720p120 as well as 4K15 and 2.7K30 and can shoot 12MP stills at up to 30 fps. Along with the increased resolution, the HERO3+ Black Edition also offers an optional function in firmware (called "SuperView") which increases the field of view. It has additional functions, including dynamic low light situation adjustment, higher-quality recording modes (higher bitrates, no white balance applied, etc.) etc. The Black Edition continues to include a Wifi Remote. It does not have the ability to record 25/30 fps in 720p and WVGA modes (it can only record at very fast frame rates in those lower resolutions). This is an intentional firmware limitation, as the manufacturer does not expect a camera with its capabilities to be used at low resolution and frame rate. The battery runtime of HERO3+ Black Edition is significantly longer than HERO3 Black Edition but 30–50% lower than the battery runtime of the older HERO2 and HERO1.
The Silver Edition has video modes of 1080p60 and 720p120 and can shoot 10MP stills at up to 10 fps.[54] In contrast to the Black Edition, the Silver Edition can record at 25/30 fps (or higher) in all supported resolutions. HERO3+ Silver Edition also has about 25%-50% longer battery runtime during recording than HERO3+ Black Edition (they both use the same batteries).[52] The difference in runtime depends on the resolution/fps combination, and whether WiFi and GoPro mobile application are used during recording. The difference in runtime increases as the fps is lowered and the additional functions are deactivated on both cameras. The battery runtime of HERO3+ Silver Edition is similar to the battery runtime of HERO2 and HERO1.
The HERO3 HD camera was awarded the 2013 Technology & Engineering Emmy Award for its contribution to television.[55]
HERO4[edit]




GoPro Hero 4 Silver Edition


In September 2014, GoPro announced the HERO4, available in Black Edition and Silver Edition,[44] which replace their respective HERO3+ generation predecessors. The HERO Session, a budget camera, was also announced.
The HERO4 Black Edition still has a 12 mp CMOS and a f/2.8 fixed maximum aperture and focus free. It adds Bluetooth connectivity, Highlight tag, Protune Available for photo and a new processor claimed by GoPro to be twice as fast as that of the HERO3+ Black Edition, doubling the frame rates in most resolutions. The HERO4 Black Edition can record 4K UHD video (3840×2160) at a frame rate of 24, 25 and 30 fps.[56] In Superview mode, 4k is only possible at 25 fps. Many other rates and resolutions are available. The HERO4 Black Edition still shoots stills at a maximum of 12MP with a maximum burst rate of 30 fps. With Wi-Fi disabled at 4k/30, GoPro claims the HERO4 Black Edition battery life to be 65 minutes, increasing to a maximum of 1h 50' at 720p/240.[57] The HERO4 Black battery is in a different form factor than its predecessors. Initial side-by-side comparisons of HERO3+ and HERO4 Black edition video results suggest that the newer model has more detail at long range and similar performance at close range.
The HERO4 Silver Edition is basically a HERO3 Black Edition with the addition of a micro speaker,[58] built-in touch screen display, Protune for photo and highlight tag the first GoPro with this, a lower clocked Cortex-A9 and missing the Black Editions integrated analog-to-digital converter which supports a wider variety of professional low-sensitivity external mics.[59] The video modes supported by the HERO4 Silver Edition are similar to those of the HERO3+ Black, due to the higher processing speed and thermal requirements of 4K video (3840×2160), but it supports Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and contains the same,[60][61] Ambarella Inc. A9[62] SoC as in the HERO4 Black.
The HERO Session, released July 6, 2015, is 50% smaller and 40% lighter comparing to other versions of the GoPro HERO4 camera.[63]
The HERO4 models maintain the H.264 video codec of previous versions and MP4 file formats. GoPro claims the mono microphone in both the Black and Silver Editions has twice the dynamic range of the HERO3+, and that the HERO4 Black and Silver Editions have improved low-light performance.

HERO+LCD[edit]
In June 2015, the company started to sell a new camera: GoPro HERO+LCD, which provides video recording at 1080p at 60 fps/and 8 megapixel photos. GoPro HERO+LCD has a touch screen to preview the shot to frame the scene perfectly and letting user easily navigate the menu.[67] New feature in the camera -Instant camera editing. GoPro HERO+LCD is waterproof, because it is built directly into a waterproof case (waterproof to 131 feet (40 m)). The device also includes a feature HiLight Tagging and built-in video editing function, which allows user to put a label on the main points while shooting video or in the process of view, which makes it possible to quickly find desired footage later. Technical specifications: video resolution 1080p 60 FPS / 720p 60 FPS, photo resolution 8 MP / 5 FPS burst, built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, user-friendly modes like QuikCapture, SuperView and Auto Low Light, waterproof to 131’ (40 m), built-in touch display.
HERO+[edit]
In October 2015, GoPro released its third entry level camera: GoPro HERO+.[44] This camera has everything similar to the previous HERO+LCD like the 1080p 60 fps / 720p 60fps Video Resolution, 8 MP / 5 FPS burst photo resolution, built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, waterproof up to 40 m and other modes like Superview, Auto Low Light, QuikCapture and Timelapse mode which automatically captures photos at set time intervals from 0.5 to 60 seconds. However, it does not have an LCD built-in touch display and it is slightly lighter than HERO+LCD. The HERO+ weighs at 123 g whereas the HERO+LCD weighs 127 g. The housing also remained the same. This camera is priced at USD $199.99.
HERO5[edit]
HERO5 Black and HERO5 Session were introduced in September 2016.[68] In contrast to previous models, they are waterproof up to 10 m, support 4k video recording up to 30 fps, automatic upload of footage to cloud and voice controls.

GoPro KARMA Drone[edit]




GoPro drone Karma


Karma Drone became available October 23, 2016. GoPro launched the highly anticipated Karma Drone for $799, which includes the Drone, controller, stabilizer, Karma Grip, and case. The drone can be bundled with a HERO5 Black for $1099 and with a HERO5 Session for $999. The drone is also compatible with the HERO 4 Black and Silver. Gross margins may come in below company averages initially, but over time the firm should cut out costs with each generation as they have done with the cameras. The Drone has 20 minutes of battery life.[70] The stabilizer can be taken out and attached to a Karma stick, which can be sold separately for $299.99 and the presentation of a downhill mountain biker POV with minimal shake. The Karma stick has greater than 1-hour battery life.
On November 8, 2016, Go Pro announced the recall of the Karma Drone following reports of loss of electrical power on the drone during operation.[71]
On February 1, 2017, the company announced that the Karma Drone will return to stores with a redesigned battery latch.[72]

History[edit]
The company was founded by Nick Woodman in 2004.[3] He was motivated by a 2002 surfing trip to Australia in which he was hoping to capture quality action photos, but could not because amateur photographers could not get close enough or buy quality equipment at reasonable prices.[4] His desire for a camera system that could capture the professional angles inspired the 'GoPro' name.[5][6]
Woodman raised a portion of his initial capital by selling bead and shell belts for under US $20 from his VW van[7] and, later, fashionable camera straps. He also received over $230,000 from his parents to invest in the business.[8][9]
In 2004, the company sold its first camera system, which used 35 mm film.[5] Digital still and video cameras were later introduced. As of 2014[update], a fixed-lens HD video camera with a wide 170-degree lens was available; two or more can be paired to create 360 video.[5][10]
On June 4, 2014, the company announced the appointment of former Microsoft executive Tony Bates as President reporting directly to Woodman.[11]
In January 2016, GoPro partnered with Periscope for live streaming.[12]
After growing the number of employees by more than 500 in 2015, the company responded to weak sales in the fourth quarter by cutting about 7% of its workforce (100 workers) in January 2016.[13]
At its peak, a share of GoPro was valued at $86, but on September 27, 2016, only $16.79.[14]
In November 2016, the company announced it was laying off an additional 200 employees in an effort to reduce costs. The company also announced that President Tony Bates would be stepping down at the end of 2016.[15]
Corporate actions[edit]
On March 30, 2011, GoPro acquired CineForm. The acquisition included the CineForm 444 video codec used in the film Slumdog Millionaire. The company claimed that the codec "makes HD and 3D editing faster and more convenient without sacrificing image quality". It was incorporated in the company's 3D Hero System shortly after the acquisition.[16][17]
In March 2013, GoPro issued a DMCA takedown notice to website DigitalRev.com, which had posted a review[18] of its product, citing trademark use as a breach of copyright. This notice was retracted 10 days later, citing "erroneous enforcement".[19][20]
On February 29, 2016, GoPro spent $105 million and acquired two start-ups, namely, Stupeflix and Vemory, for their video editing tools Replay and Splice.[21][22]
IPO[edit]
On February 7, 2014, GoPro submitted a confidential filing for an initial public offering (IPO) with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).[23]
On May 19, 2014, GoPro filed its S-1 with the SEC without specifying the number of shares or their price. The company stated that they hoped to raise at least $100 million through the sale of shares, using the money to pay off debt in full ($111 million as of March 31, 2014) and "to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, technologies or assets". They said that they planned to list on the NASDAQ stock exchange using the symbol 'GPRO.'[24][25]
The expected price range was $21 to $24 a share; on June 25, 2014, GoPro sold 17.8 million shares to initial investors at $24 per share (totaling $427.2M).[26] At the IPO price the company was valued at $2.95 billion.[24] 1.5 percent of those shares were allotted to LOYAL3, a technology platform that allows small investors to participate.[27][28]
An important reason for GoPro's decision to go public was the potential to become a media company to generate additional revenue from the content its cameras create.[29][30]
Product lines[edit]
HERO cameras[edit]
Woodman worked on his first camera for two years after founding the company, eventually introducing the GoPro 35mm HERO in September 2004 at San Diego's Action Sports Retailer trade show.[31] In its first year GoPro sold $150,000 worth of products.[31] In 2006 the company introduced its first Digital HERO, with 10 second video capability, and generated $800,000 in revenue. The following year GoPro sales quadrupled to $3.4 million.[31]
In 2014, the company was selling the HERO3+ in editions of different colors. It was capable of filming in 16:9 aspect ratio, supporting 4K UHD video and 12MP still photographs.[32] The HERO4 was introduced on 24 September 2014.[33]
GoPro KARMA & GoPro KARMA Grip[edit]




GoPro drone Karma


The GoPro Karma is GoPro's consumer drone.[citation needed]
In 2014, GoPro entered into discussions with DJI for a private label model built with the GoPro branding. After the failure of these negotiations, GoPro entered into an agreement with 3D Robotics (3DR) for a similar partnership based on 3DR's flight controllers. 3DR failed to meet their agreed upon timelines. As a result, GoPro took full control of the development process in mid-2015.
Scheduled to be released early 2016, the GoPro Karma project was delayed several times before the GoPro Karma was announced with an introduction date of October 23, 2016. The Karma was released along with newer models of the HERO5 and Session cameras and features a removable handheld stabilizer (gimbal) integrated into the design. After a few customers complained about power failure during operation, GoPro recalled Karma drones and gave customers full refunds.[34]
In February 2017, GoPro re-launched the Karma Drone.[35]
Accessories[edit]
GoPro produces various mounting accessories for its cameras including a 3-way mount, suction cup, chest harness, jaws-type flexible clamp, dog harness, surfing mount, etc.[36]
Video editing[edit]
The company developed GoPro Studio, simple video editing software to edit camera footage,[37] with v2.5 released in October 2014. It was reported that GoPro intended to also become a content provider, also with a new app for the HERO5 called GoPro Quik to share, and edit videos easier.[30]
Content company[edit]
In April 2014, GoPro was listed by Adweek as one of the "Top 10 Best Brand Channels on YouTube" based on a combination of views, shares, comments and overall engagement.[38] Content is uploaded daily, an additional source of revenue for the company.[39]
As part of its transformation to a media company in 2014, GoPro created additional channels with GoPro content on YouTube, Virgin America, and Xbox Live.[29] This was extended to the PlayStation Network in 2015.[40]
HD HERO cameras[edit]
As of October 2014[update], GoPro sells three fixed-lens cameras, two without viewfinders and one including a touchscreen viewfinder. A 2-bit LCD on the front of the camera allows access to its menu system, which is controlled by the front and top shutter buttons. The HERO4 Black have dimensions of 41 mm × 59 mm × 30 mm and weighs 88 grams (152 grams with housing). Still images from 6 to 12 megapixels can be captured. The cameras are sold with a clear polycarbonate HD Housing with a glass lens that is rated shockproof and waterproof to 131 feet (40 m), with a quick-release buckle on the top and threads at the bottom to attach to all of the GoPro mounts. The housing has metal buttons that connect to the camera's controls and has a "skeleton" backdoor option to allow audio recording when the camera is used with a mount but without the need to be watertight or shockproof.[41][non-primary source needed]
Products[edit]
HERO cameras[edit]
35mm[edit]
The 35mm camera (model #001) became available on April 13, 2005. It had dimensions of 2.5 by 3 inches (64 by 76 mm) and weighed 0.45 pounds (200 g). It included the camera, a clear case with quick release, a camera strap and ski glove adapter lash. It could pivot "on the fly" and be functional to a depth in water of about 15 feet (5 m). It was described as a "reusable wrist camera" and included a roll of 24 exposure Kodak 400 film.
Digital[edit]
The Digital HERO released in 2006 (Model: SQ907 mini-cam) had a 640×460 camera and shot VGA definition 320X240 (10fps) video for a maximum of 10 seconds. The Digital HERO1 had 32 MB internal memory without SD slot.
Digital 3[edit]
The Digital HERO3 released in 2007 had a 3-megapixel camera and shot standard definition 512×384 video. It was rated up to 30 m (98.4 feet) in depth.[42]
Digital 5[edit]
The Digital HERO5 was first introduced on December 5, 2006. It had a 5-megapixel still photo sensor and supported standard definition (512×384) video capture. It ran on two AAA batteries, had 16 MB of internal memory and could function with a 2 GB SD card. Its housing was rated to 100 ft/30 meters depth. Its dimensions were 2.6 × 1.75 × 1.25 inches (66 × 44 × 32 mm). The camera is not designed to work with the newer HD HERO line of housings, although the standard screw mounts are indeed compatible.

HERO2[edit]
The HERO2 was launched on October 24, 2011. It has an 11 MP image sensor, improved low-light capability and records at up to 120 fps.[46] It was sold with three different accessory packages as the Outdoor, Motorsports, and Surf Editions.[47]
HERO3[edit]
In late 2012, GoPro announced the HERO3 line of cameras.[48] These new cameras came in three editions: black, silver and white.
All three versions of the HERO3 come in a new 30% smaller and 25% lighter package, with WiFi functionality built in. The change of the physical dimensions of the cameras compared to the previous generations (HERO1 and HERO2 were physically identical) means that some of the camera accessories for HD HERO Original and HERO2 are not compatible with HERO3, so GoPro made new versions of those accessories specifically for HERO3 (and mostly for HERO3+, see below). Those new versions of accessories are usually not compatible with older Hero camera generations. However, a lot of other accessories are compatible with all HD Hero camera generations.
The HERO3 Silver and Black cameras have significantly less battery endurance than the HD HERO Original and HERO2.[49] For example, in 720p resolution with 25/30 fps, while HD HERO Original and HERO2 have a stated battery runtime of 3 hours, HERO3 Silver Edition has a stated battery runtime of 2 hours, and HERO3 Black Edition has a stated battery runtime of 1.5 hours (the Black Edition's "most economical" setting is 1080p/30 fps, so this also partially contributes to its poor battery runtime).
The Black Edition[50][not in citation given] has a new 12 MP sensor that can capture 4K UHD digital video at 15 fps, 2.7K video at 30 fps, 1440p at 48 fps, 1080p at 60 fps, 960p at 100 fps, 720p at 120 fps and WVGA at 240 fps. The Black edition also includes the WiFi Remote. The Black Edition cannot record at 25/30 fps in 720p and WVGA resolutions; it can only record at very fast frame rates in those resolutions. This is a deliberate firmware limitation, as the manufacturer does not expect that this high-end camera model will be used at these lower resolutions and frame rates.
The Silver Edition uses the same 11 MP sensor as the HERO2, and the White edition uses the same 5 MP sensor as the HD HERO Original.
HERO3+[edit]

In October 2013, GoPro released the HERO3+, available in Black and Silver Editions,[51] replacing the HERO3 generation. The HERO3 White Edition remains as GoPro's low-end device.
The HERO3+ camera models claim dramatically improved low light performance and have a waterproof enclosure which is 20% lighter and 15% smaller than the HERO3's, according to the GoPro website. The HERO3+ camera housing is 20% smaller than the HERO3. The cameras are claimed to have improved image sharpness (close focus down to 7" vs about 3 ft on the HERO3, at the expense of distant focus which is slightly less sharp[clarification needed] with HERO3+), and better audio functionality with wind noise reduction. Battery life is claimed to be 30% longer than for the HERO3 model (both through better efficiency and a higher-capacity battery of the same dimensions).[49][52]
The Black Edition has video modes of 1440p48,[53] 1080p60, 960p100 and 720p120 as well as 4K15 and 2.7K30 and can shoot 12MP stills at up to 30 fps. Along with the increased resolution, the HERO3+ Black Edition also offers an optional function in firmware (called "SuperView") which increases the field of view. It has additional functions, including dynamic low light situation adjustment, higher-quality recording modes (higher bitrates, no white balance applied, etc.) etc. The Black Edition continues to include a Wifi Remote. It does not have the ability to record 25/30 fps in 720p and WVGA modes (it can only record at very fast frame rates in those lower resolutions). This is an intentional firmware limitation, as the manufacturer does not expect a camera with its capabilities to be used at low resolution and frame rate. The battery runtime of HERO3+ Black Edition is significantly longer than HERO3 Black Edition but 30–50% lower than the battery runtime of the older HERO2 and HERO1.
The Silver Edition has video modes of 1080p60 and 720p120 and can shoot 10MP stills at up to 10 fps.[54] In contrast to the Black Edition, the Silver Edition can record at 25/30 fps (or higher) in all supported resolutions. HERO3+ Silver Edition also has about 25%-50% longer battery runtime during recording than HERO3+ Black Edition (they both use the same batteries).[52] The difference in runtime depends on the resolution/fps combination, and whether WiFi and GoPro mobile application are used during recording. The difference in runtime increases as the fps is lowered and the additional functions are deactivated on both cameras. The battery runtime of HERO3+ Silver Edition is similar to the battery runtime of HERO2 and HERO1.
The HERO3 HD camera was awarded the 2013 Technology & Engineering Emmy Award for its contribution to television.[55]
HERO4[edit]




GoPro Hero 4 Silver Edition


In September 2014, GoPro announced the HERO4, available in Black Edition and Silver Edition,[44] which replace their respective HERO3+ generation predecessors. The HERO Session, a budget camera, was also announced.
The HERO4 Black Edition still has a 12 mp CMOS and a f/2.8 fixed maximum aperture and focus free. It adds Bluetooth connectivity, Highlight tag, Protune Available for photo and a new processor claimed by GoPro to be twice as fast as that of the HERO3+ Black Edition, doubling the frame rates in most resolutions. The HERO4 Black Edition can record 4K UHD video (3840×2160) at a frame rate of 24, 25 and 30 fps.[56] In Superview mode, 4k is only possible at 25 fps. Many other rates and resolutions are available. The HERO4 Black Edition still shoots stills at a maximum of 12MP with a maximum burst rate of 30 fps. With Wi-Fi disabled at 4k/30, GoPro claims the HERO4 Black Edition battery life to be 65 minutes, increasing to a maximum of 1h 50' at 720p/240.[57] The HERO4 Black battery is in a different form factor than its predecessors. Initial side-by-side comparisons of HERO3+ and HERO4 Black edition video results suggest that the newer model has more detail at long range and similar performance at close range.
The HERO4 Silver Edition is basically a HERO3 Black Edition with the addition of a micro speaker,[58] built-in touch screen display, Protune for photo and highlight tag the first GoPro with this, a lower clocked Cortex-A9 and missing the Black Editions integrated analog-to-digital converter which supports a wider variety of professional low-sensitivity external mics.[59] The video modes supported by the HERO4 Silver Edition are similar to those of the HERO3+ Black, due to the higher processing speed and thermal requirements of 4K video (3840×2160), but it supports Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and contains the same,[60][61] Ambarella Inc. A9[62] SoC as in the HERO4 Black.
The HERO Session, released July 6, 2015, is 50% smaller and 40% lighter comparing to other versions of the GoPro HERO4 camera.[63]
The HERO4 models maintain the H.264 video codec of previous versions and MP4 file formats. GoPro claims the mono microphone in both the Black and Silver Editions has twice the dynamic range of the HERO3+, and that the HERO4 Black and Silver Editions have improved low-light performance.

HERO+LCD[edit]
In June 2015, the company started to sell a new camera: GoPro HERO+LCD, which provides video recording at 1080p at 60 fps/and 8 megapixel photos. GoPro HERO+LCD has a touch screen to preview the shot to frame the scene perfectly and letting user easily navigate the menu.[67] New feature in the camera -Instant camera editing. GoPro HERO+LCD is waterproof, because it is built directly into a waterproof case (waterproof to 131 feet (40 m)). The device also includes a feature HiLight Tagging and built-in video editing function, which allows user to put a label on the main points while shooting video or in the process of view, which makes it possible to quickly find desired footage later. Technical specifications: video resolution 1080p 60 FPS / 720p 60 FPS, photo resolution 8 MP / 5 FPS burst, built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, user-friendly modes like QuikCapture, SuperView and Auto Low Light, waterproof to 131’ (40 m), built-in touch display.
HERO+[edit]
In October 2015, GoPro released its third entry level camera: GoPro HERO+.[44] This camera has everything similar to the previous HERO+LCD like the 1080p 60 fps / 720p 60fps Video Resolution, 8 MP / 5 FPS burst photo resolution, built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, waterproof up to 40 m and other modes like Superview, Auto Low Light, QuikCapture and Timelapse mode which automatically captures photos at set time intervals from 0.5 to 60 seconds. However, it does not have an LCD built-in touch display and it is slightly lighter than HERO+LCD. The HERO+ weighs at 123 g whereas the HERO+LCD weighs 127 g. The housing also remained the same. This camera is priced at USD $199.99.

GoPro KARMA Drone[edit]




GoPro drone Karma


Karma Drone became available October 23, 2016. GoPro launched the highly anticipated Karma Drone for $799, which includes the Drone, controller, stabilizer, Karma Grip, and case. The drone can be bundled with a HERO5 Black for $1099 and with a HERO5 Session for $999. The drone is also compatible with the HERO 4 Black and Silver. Gross margins may come in below company averages initially, but over time the firm should cut out costs with each generation as they have done with the cameras. The Drone has 20 minutes of battery life.[70] The stabilizer can be taken out and attached to a Karma stick, which can be sold separately for $299.99 and the presentation of a downhill mountain biker POV with minimal shake. The Karma stick has greater than 1-hour battery life.
On November 8, 2016, Go Pro announced the recall of the Karma Drone following reports of loss of electrical power on the drone during operation.[71]
On February 1, 2017, the company announced that the Karma Drone will return to stores with a redesigned battery latch.[72]

Early life and education[edit]
Woodman is the son of Concepcion (née Socarras) and Dean Woodman.[3][4][5][6] His father was born into a Quaker family and co-founded the investment bank Robertson Stephens;[3][7][8] and his mother is of Hispanic descent and re-married Irwin Federman, General Partner of U.S. Venture Partners in 1992.[4] Woodman grew up in Menlo Park, California[9] and Atherton, California,[10] attending the Menlo School, where he graduated in 1993.[11] He developed his interest in surfing during high school and formed the high school's first surfing club. Woodman would sell t-shirts at high school football games to raise money for the surfing club.[12] He earned a bachelor's degree in visual arts and a minor in creative writing from the University of California, San Diego in 1997.[13][10][14] After school, Woodman founded two startups, both of which never fully made it off the ground. The first was a website called EmpowerAll.com, which attempted to sell electronic goods for no more than a $2 markup, and the second was Funbug, a gaming and marketing platform that gave users the chance to win cash prizes. Woodman took the lack of success from both companies personally.[15] After failing to reach success on his own, Nick went home and received a $235,000 investment from his father,[16] an investment banker in Silicon Valley, [17] and used his parents connections to venture capital to launch his career as the head of GoPro.[18]
Career[edit]
While on hiatus in Australia and Indonesia on a surf trip, he used a 35mm camera attached to the palm of his hand by a rubber band to try to capture his surfing activities on film.[14] Seeing that amateur photographers like him – who wanted to capture quality action photos of their activities – had difficulties because either they could not get close enough to the action or were unable to purchase quality equipment at affordable prices, his trip became his inspiration to found GoPro.[14] His solution was to develop a belt that would attach the camera to the body.[14] Woodman and his future wife Jill financed the business by selling shell necklaces they bought in Bali (for $1.90) from their car along the California coast (for $60).[19] His mother loaned him $35,000 and let him borrow her sewing machine, which he used to sew camera straps while experimenting with early designs. His dad loaned him an additional $200,000, which Woodman immediately paid back out of company sales.[3] His desire for a camera system that could capture close up footage inspired the 'GoPro' name.[20][21] The original cameras he developed were point-and-shoot 35mm film cameras which mounted to the user's wrist. Woodman would go about selling his products while using his 1971 Volkwagen Bus that he named 'The Buscuit' as his mobile home.[12] The product has since evolved into a compact digital camera that supports WiFi, can be remotely controlled, has waterproof housing, records to a micro SD card, and is affordable to the average action sports enthusiast ($200–$400). Woodman would often act as the test engineer for their earlier products completing tasks such as attaching a GoPro to a car and driving at speeds of over 130 MPH. In 2004, he made his first big sale when a Japanese company ordered 100 cameras at a sports show.[14][19] Thereafter, sales doubled every year,[13] and in 2012, GoPro sold 2.3 million cameras.[14] In 2005, Woodman appeared on QVC to sell his GoPro Hero. In 2004, GoPro had about $150,000 in revenue which grew to about $350,000 in 2005. In December 2012, the Taiwanese contract manufacturer Foxconn purchased 8.88% of the company for $200 million which set the market value of the company at $2.25 billion making Woodman, who owned the majority of the stock, a billionaire.[14][19] On June 26, 2014, GoPro went public – closing the day at $31.34 a share. In 2014, Woodman was the highest paid US chief executive, paying himself $235 million.[22][23][24]
In 2015, GoPro developed a partnership with the NHL that would enable the NHL to use GoPro products to improve the viewing experience for fans.[25] Woodman has been invited to speak at various tech conferences and in October 2015, Woodman was a guest on the Late Show with Stephen Colbert and wore a GoPro camera for the entirety of the interview.[26] Woodman is set to appear as a shark investor in the sixth season of the show Shark Tank.[27] Woodman has invested $125,000 as of November 2015 on Shark Tank on two investments.[28]
At the beginning of 2016, GoPro started to make a series of job cuts. In January of 2016, Woodman's Company cut 100 jobs, or 7% of his workforce.[29] Later that year, in November 2016, GoPro cut an additional 15% of the GoPro workforce after attempting to branch out beyond its core business of action cameras, as the entertainment division failed to reach profitability.[30]
In December 2016, a class action lawsuit against GoPro was announced. The complaint alleges that GoPro made false and misleading statements to investors and/or failed to disclose flaws in the Company's drones, overstating customer demand, and GoPro's public statements were materially false and misleading. [31][32]
2016 proved to be a tough year for GoPro.[33] With the many changes at and involving GoPro, including numerous job cuts, and falling stock prices, Woodman was listed as one of the year's worst CEOs. [34]
Awards[edit]

2013 National Award Winner of the EY Entrepreneur of the Year Award.
2014 Winner of the Technology and Engineering Emmy Award in the category of Inexpensive Small Rugged HD Camcorders. Woodman brought his GoPro onstage for his acceptance speech.[23][35]

Philanthropy[edit]
After a successful IPO, the couple donated 5.8 million shares of GoPro stock to the Jill + Nicholas Woodman Foundation, a new fund they created at the Silicon Valley Community Foundation in 2014. [36] From 2014 to 2017, the value of the stock donated declined from $500 million to $50.3 million because of the dramatic decline in GoPro stock. Woodman was one of the biggest donors in the tech industry that year; however, it angered investors.[37][38][39]
In March 2014, Woodman was honored for his philanthropic work with BUILD at their 5th annual gala in San Francisco.[40]
Personal life[edit]
Woodman is married to Jill R. Scully[41] and they have three children.[13][14] They live in Woodside, California.[42] Woodman is known as the "mad billionaire" due to his unconventional behavior and eccentricities.[14] Woodman is a strong believer in following one's passions as a way to success stating, "I’m a big believer that when you’re pursuing your passions, your best ideas come to you. Your passions are a bit like your fingerprints: Everybody has them; everybody’s are different. One’s passions may just be a guidebook to one’s life.”[27] In 2015, Woodman hosted an AMA on Reddit. Woodman has often cited his fear of failure as a catalyst for his success stating, "When I got out of college, I gave myself till I was 30 to invent a product. If I couldn't do it by then, I would just get a real job. And that fear – the fear of a real job – motivated me to be an entrepreneur."[43]
In December 2015, Woodman commissioned a 180-foot yacht, estimated to cost between $35 million and $40 million. The boat, expected to be delivered in 2017, is four decks high and comes with a Jacuzzi pool, swim platform, sweeping sun decks, and dining areas. [44]

Early life and education[edit]
Woodman is the son of Concepcion (née Socarras) and Dean Woodman.[3][4][5][6] His father was born into a Quaker family and co-founded the investment bank Robertson Stephens;[3][7][8] and his mother is of Hispanic descent and re-married Irwin Federman, General Partner of U.S. Venture Partners in 1992.[4] Woodman grew up in Menlo Park, California[9] and Atherton, California,[10] attending the Menlo School, where he graduated in 1993.[11] He developed his interest in surfing during high school and formed the high school's first surfing club. Woodman would sell t-shirts at high school football games to raise money for the surfing club.[12] He earned a bachelor's degree in visual arts and a minor in creative writing from the University of California, San Diego in 1997.[13][10][14] After school, Woodman founded two startups, both of which never fully made it off the ground. The first was a website called EmpowerAll.com, which attempted to sell electronic goods for no more than a $2 markup, and the second was Funbug, a gaming and marketing platform that gave users the chance to win cash prizes. Woodman took the lack of success from both companies personally.[15] After failing to reach success on his own, Nick went home and received a $235,000 investment from his father,[16] an investment banker in Silicon Valley, [17] and used his parents connections to venture capital to launch his career as the head of GoPro.[18]
Career[edit]
While on hiatus in Australia and Indonesia on a surf trip, he used a 35mm camera attached to the palm of his hand by a rubber band to try to capture his surfing activities on film.[14] Seeing that amateur photographers like him – who wanted to capture quality action photos of their activities – had difficulties because either they could not get close enough to the action or were unable to purchase quality equipment at affordable prices, his trip became his inspiration to found GoPro.[14] His solution was to develop a belt that would attach the camera to the body.[14] Woodman and his future wife Jill financed the business by selling shell necklaces they bought in Bali (for $1.90) from their car along the California coast (for $60).[19] His mother loaned him $35,000 and let him borrow her sewing machine, which he used to sew camera straps while experimenting with early designs. His dad loaned him an additional $200,000, which Woodman immediately paid back out of company sales.[3] His desire for a camera system that could capture close up footage inspired the 'GoPro' name.[20][21] The original cameras he developed were point-and-shoot 35mm film cameras which mounted to the user's wrist. Woodman would go about selling his products while using his 1971 Volkwagen Bus that he named 'The Buscuit' as his mobile home.[12] The product has since evolved into a compact digital camera that supports WiFi, can be remotely controlled, has waterproof housing, records to a micro SD card, and is affordable to the average action sports enthusiast ($200–$400). Woodman would often act as the test engineer for their earlier products completing tasks such as attaching a GoPro to a car and driving at speeds of over 130 MPH. In 2004, he made his first big sale when a Japanese company ordered 100 cameras at a sports show.[14][19] Thereafter, sales doubled every year,[13] and in 2012, GoPro sold 2.3 million cameras.[14] In 2005, Woodman appeared on QVC to sell his GoPro Hero. In 2004, GoPro had about $150,000 in revenue which grew to about $350,000 in 2005. In December 2012, the Taiwanese contract manufacturer Foxconn purchased 8.88% of the company for $200 million which set the market value of the company at $2.25 billion making Woodman, who owned the majority of the stock, a billionaire.[14][19] On June 26, 2014, GoPro went public – closing the day at $31.34 a share. In 2014, Woodman was the highest paid US chief executive, paying himself $235 million.[22][23][24]
In 2015, GoPro developed a partnership with the NHL that would enable the NHL to use GoPro products to improve the viewing experience for fans.[25] Woodman has been invited to speak at various tech conferences and in October 2015, Woodman was a guest on the Late Show with Stephen Colbert and wore a GoPro camera for the entirety of the interview.[26] Woodman is set to appear as a shark investor in the sixth season of the show Shark Tank.[27] Woodman has invested $125,000 as of November 2015 on Shark Tank on two investments.[28]
At the beginning of 2016, GoPro started to make a series of job cuts. In January of 2016, Woodman's Company cut 100 jobs, or 7% of his workforce.[29] Later that year, in November 2016, GoPro cut an additional 15% of the GoPro workforce after attempting to branch out beyond its core business of action cameras, as the entertainment division failed to reach profitability.[30]
In December 2016, a class action lawsuit against GoPro was announced. The complaint alleges that GoPro made false and misleading statements to investors and/or failed to disclose flaws in the Company's drones, overstating customer demand, and GoPro's public statements were materially false and misleading. [31][32]
2016 proved to be a tough year for GoPro.[33] With the many changes at and involving GoPro, including numerous job cuts, and falling stock prices, Woodman was listed as one of the year's worst CEOs. [34]
Awards[edit]

2013 National Award Winner of the EY Entrepreneur of the Year Award.
2014 Winner of the Technology and Engineering Emmy Award in the category of Inexpensive Small Rugged HD Camcorders. Woodman brought his GoPro onstage for his acceptance speech.[23][35]

Philanthropy[edit]
After a successful IPO, the couple donated 5.8 million shares of GoPro stock to the Jill + Nicholas Woodman Foundation, a new fund they created at the Silicon Valley Community Foundation in 2014. [36] From 2014 to 2017, the value of the stock donated declined from $500 million to $50.3 million because of the dramatic decline in GoPro stock. Woodman was one of the biggest donors in the tech industry that year; however, it angered investors.[37][38][39]
In March 2014, Woodman was honored for his philanthropic work with BUILD at their 5th annual gala in San Francisco.[40]
Personal life[edit]
Woodman is married to Jill R. Scully[41] and they have three children.[13][14] They live in Woodside, California.[42] Woodman is known as the "mad billionaire" due to his unconventional behavior and eccentricities.[14] Woodman is a strong believer in following one's passions as a way to success stating, "I’m a big believer that when you’re pursuing your passions, your best ideas come to you. Your passions are a bit like your fingerprints: Everybody has them; everybody’s are different. One’s passions may just be a guidebook to one’s life.”[27] In 2015, Woodman hosted an AMA on Reddit. Woodman has often cited his fear of failure as a catalyst for his success stating, "When I got out of college, I gave myself till I was 30 to invent a product. If I couldn't do it by then, I would just get a real job. And that fear – the fear of a real job – motivated me to be an entrepreneur."[43]
In December 2015, Woodman commissioned a 180-foot yacht, estimated to cost between $35 million and $40 million. The boat, expected to be delivered in 2017, is four decks high and comes with a Jacuzzi pool, swim platform, sweeping sun decks, and dining areas. [44]

In 2015, GoPro developed a partnership with the NHL that would enable the NHL to use GoPro products to improve the viewing experience for fans.[25] Woodman has been invited to speak at various tech conferences and in October 2015, Woodman was a guest on the Late Show with Stephen Colbert and wore a GoPro camera for the entirety of the interview.[26] Woodman is set to appear as a shark investor in the sixth season of the show Shark Tank.[27] Woodman has invested $125,000 as of November 2015 on Shark Tank on two investments.[28]
At the beginning of 2016, GoPro started to make a series of job cuts. In January of 2016, Woodman's Company cut 100 jobs, or 7% of his workforce.[29] Later that year, in November 2016, GoPro cut an additional 15% of the GoPro workforce after attempting to branch out beyond its core business of action cameras, as the entertainment division failed to reach profitability.[30]
In December 2016, a class action lawsuit against GoPro was announced. The complaint alleges that GoPro made false and misleading statements to investors and/or failed to disclose flaws in the Company's drones, overstating customer demand, and GoPro's public statements were materially false and misleading. [31][32]
2016 proved to be a tough year for GoPro.[33] With the many changes at and involving GoPro, including numerous job cuts, and falling stock prices, Woodman was listed as one of the year's worst CEOs. [34]
Awards[edit]

2013 National Award Winner of the EY Entrepreneur of the Year Award.
2014 Winner of the Technology and Engineering Emmy Award in the category of Inexpensive Small Rugged HD Camcorders. Woodman brought his GoPro onstage for his acceptance speech.[23][35]

Philanthropy[edit]
After a successful IPO, the couple donated 5.8 million shares of GoPro stock to the Jill + Nicholas Woodman Foundation, a new fund they created at the Silicon Valley Community Foundation in 2014. [36] From 2014 to 2017, the value of the stock donated declined from $500 million to $50.3 million because of the dramatic decline in GoPro stock. Woodman was one of the biggest donors in the tech industry that year; however, it angered investors.[37][38][39]
In March 2014, Woodman was honored for his philanthropic work with BUILD at their 5th annual gala in San Francisco.[40]
Personal life[edit]
Woodman is married to Jill R. Scully[41] and they have three children.[13][14] They live in Woodside, California.[42] Woodman is known as the "mad billionaire" due to his unconventional behavior and eccentricities.[14] Woodman is a strong believer in following one's passions as a way to success stating, "I’m a big believer that when you’re pursuing your passions, your best ideas come to you. Your passions are a bit like your fingerprints: Everybody has them; everybody’s are different. One’s passions may just be a guidebook to one’s life.”[27] In 2015, Woodman hosted an AMA on Reddit. Woodman has often cited his fear of failure as a catalyst for his success stating, "When I got out of college, I gave myself till I was 30 to invent a product. If I couldn't do it by then, I would just get a real job. And that fear – the fear of a real job – motivated me to be an entrepreneur."[43]
In December 2015, Woodman commissioned a 180-foot yacht, estimated to cost between $35 million and $40 million. The boat, expected to be delivered in 2017, is four decks high and comes with a Jacuzzi pool, swim platform, sweeping sun decks, and dining areas. [44]

Early life and education[edit]
Woodman is the son of Concepcion (née Socarras) and Dean Woodman.[3][4][5][6] His father was born into a Quaker family and co-founded the investment bank Robertson Stephens;[3][7][8] and his mother is of Hispanic descent and re-married Irwin Federman, General Partner of U.S. Venture Partners in 1992.[4] Woodman grew up in Menlo Park, California[9] and Atherton, California,[10] attending the Menlo School, where he graduated in 1993.[11] He developed his interest in surfing during high school and formed the high school's first surfing club. Woodman would sell t-shirts at high school football games to raise money for the surfing club.[12] He earned a bachelor's degree in visual arts and a minor in creative writing from the University of California, San Diego in 1997.[13][10][14] After school, Woodman founded two startups, both of which never fully made it off the ground. The first was a website called EmpowerAll.com, which attempted to sell electronic goods for no more than a $2 markup, and the second was Funbug, a gaming and marketing platform that gave users the chance to win cash prizes. Woodman took the lack of success from both companies personally.[15] After failing to reach success on his own, Nick went home and received a $235,000 investment from his father,[16] an investment banker in Silicon Valley, [17] and used his parents connections to venture capital to launch his career as the head of GoPro.[18]
Career[edit]
While on hiatus in Australia and Indonesia on a surf trip, he used a 35mm camera attached to the palm of his hand by a rubber band to try to capture his surfing activities on film.[14] Seeing that amateur photographers like him – who wanted to capture quality action photos of their activities – had difficulties because either they could not get close enough to the action or were unable to purchase quality equipment at affordable prices, his trip became his inspiration to found GoPro.[14] His solution was to develop a belt that would attach the camera to the body.[14] Woodman and his future wife Jill financed the business by selling shell necklaces they bought in Bali (for $1.90) from their car along the California coast (for $60).[19] His mother loaned him $35,000 and let him borrow her sewing machine, which he used to sew camera straps while experimenting with early designs. His dad loaned him an additional $200,000, which Woodman immediately paid back out of company sales.[3] His desire for a camera system that could capture close up footage inspired the 'GoPro' name.[20][21] The original cameras he developed were point-and-shoot 35mm film cameras which mounted to the user's wrist. Woodman would go about selling his products while using his 1971 Volkwagen Bus that he named 'The Buscuit' as his mobile home.[12] The product has since evolved into a compact digital camera that supports WiFi, can be remotely controlled, has waterproof housing, records to a micro SD card, and is affordable to the average action sports enthusiast ($200–$400). Woodman would often act as the test engineer for their earlier products completing tasks such as attaching a GoPro to a car and driving at speeds of over 130 MPH. In 2004, he made his first big sale when a Japanese company ordered 100 cameras at a sports show.[14][19] Thereafter, sales doubled every year,[13] and in 2012, GoPro sold 2.3 million cameras.[14] In 2005, Woodman appeared on QVC to sell his GoPro Hero. In 2004, GoPro had about $150,000 in revenue which grew to about $350,000 in 2005. In December 2012, the Taiwanese contract manufacturer Foxconn purchased 8.88% of the company for $200 million which set the market value of the company at $2.25 billion making Woodman, who owned the majority of the stock, a billionaire.[14][19] On June 26, 2014, GoPro went public – closing the day at $31.34 a share. In 2014, Woodman was the highest paid US chief executive, paying himself $235 million.[22][23][24]
In 2015, GoPro developed a partnership with the NHL that would enable the NHL to use GoPro products to improve the viewing experience for fans.[25] Woodman has been invited to speak at various tech conferences and in October 2015, Woodman was a guest on the Late Show with Stephen Colbert and wore a GoPro camera for the entirety of the interview.[26] Woodman is set to appear as a shark investor in the sixth season of the show Shark Tank.[27] Woodman has invested $125,000 as of November 2015 on Shark Tank on two investments.[28]

The complaint alleges that GoPro made false and misleading statements to investors and/or failed to disclose flaws in the Company's drones, overstating customer demand, and GoPro's public statements were materially false and misleading. [31][32]
2016 proved to be a tough year for GoPro.[33] With the many changes at and involving GoPro, including numerous job cuts, and falling stock prices, Woodman was listed as one of the year's worst CEOs. [34]

2013 National Award Winner of the EY Entrepreneur of the Year Award.
2014 Winner of the Technology and Engineering Emmy Award in the category of Inexpensive Small Rugged HD Camcorders. Woodman brought his GoPro onstage for his acceptance speech.[23][35]

Philanthropy[edit]
After a successful IPO, the couple donated 5.8 million shares of GoPro stock to the Jill + Nicholas Woodman Foundation, a new fund they created at the Silicon Valley Community Foundation in 2014. [36] From 2014 to 2017, the value of the stock donated declined from $500 million to $50.3 million because of the dramatic decline in GoPro stock. Woodman was one of the biggest donors in the tech industry that year; however, it angered investors.[37][38][39]
In March 2014, Woodman was honored for his philanthropic work with BUILD at their 5th annual gala in San Francisco.[40]
Personal life[edit]
Woodman is married to Jill R. Scully[41] and they have three children.[13][14] They live in Woodside, California.[42] Woodman is known as the "mad billionaire" due to his unconventional behavior and eccentricities.[14] Woodman is a strong believer in following one's passions as a way to success stating, "I’m a big believer that when you’re pursuing your passions, your best ideas come to you.

History[edit]
The company was founded by Nick Woodman in 2004.[3] He was motivated by a 2002 surfing trip to Australia in which he was hoping to capture quality action photos, but could not because amateur photographers could not get close enough or buy quality equipment at reasonable prices.[4] His desire for a camera system that could capture the professional angles inspired the 'GoPro' name.[5][6]
Woodman raised a portion of his initial capital by selling bead and shell belts for under US $20 from his VW van[7] and, later, fashionable camera straps. He also received over $230,000 from his parents to invest in the business.[8][9]
In 2004, the company sold its first camera system, which used 35 mm film.[5] Digital still and video cameras were later introduced. As of 2014[update], a fixed-lens HD video camera with a wide 170-degree lens was available; two or more can be paired to create 360 video.[5][10]
On June 4, 2014, the company announced the appointment of former Microsoft executive Tony Bates as President reporting directly to Woodman.[11]
In January 2016, GoPro partnered with Periscope for live streaming.[12]
After growing the number of employees by more than 500 in 2015, the company responded to weak sales in the fourth quarter by cutting about 7% of its workforce (100 workers) in January 2016.[13]
At its peak, a share of GoPro was valued at $86, but on September 27, 2016, only $16.79.[14]
In November 2016, the company announced it was laying off an additional 200 employees in an effort to reduce costs. The company also announced that President Tony Bates would be stepping down at the end of 2016.[15]
Corporate actions[edit]
On March 30, 2011, GoPro acquired CineForm. The acquisition included the CineForm 444 video codec used in the film Slumdog Millionaire. The company claimed that the codec "makes HD and 3D editing faster and more convenient without sacrificing image quality". It was incorporated in the company's 3D Hero System shortly after the acquisition.[16][17]
In March 2013, GoPro issued a DMCA takedown notice to website DigitalRev.com, which had posted a review[18] of its product, citing trademark use as a breach of copyright. This notice was retracted 10 days later, citing "erroneous enforcement".[19][20]
On February 29, 2016, GoPro spent $105 million and acquired two start-ups, namely, Stupeflix and Vemory, for their video editing tools Replay and Splice.[21][22]
IPO[edit]
On February 7, 2014, GoPro submitted a confidential filing for an initial public offering (IPO) with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).[23]
On May 19, 2014, GoPro filed its S-1 with the SEC without specifying the number of shares or their price. The company stated that they hoped to raise at least $100 million through the sale of shares, using the money to pay off debt in full ($111 million as of March 31, 2014) and "to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, technologies or assets". They said that they planned to list on the NASDAQ stock exchange using the symbol 'GPRO.'[24][25]
The expected price range was $21 to $24 a share; on June 25, 2014, GoPro sold 17.8 million shares to initial investors at $24 per share (totaling $427.2M).[26] At the IPO price the company was valued at $2.95 billion.[24] 1.5 percent of those shares were allotted to LOYAL3, a technology platform that allows small investors to participate.[27][28]
An important reason for GoPro's decision to go public was the potential to become a media company to generate additional revenue from the content its cameras create.[29][30]
Product lines[edit]
HERO cameras[edit]
Woodman worked on his first camera for two years after founding the company, eventually introducing the GoPro 35mm HERO in September 2004 at San Diego's Action Sports Retailer trade show.[31] In its first year GoPro sold $150,000 worth of products.[31] In 2006 the company introduced its first Digital HERO, with 10 second video capability, and generated $800,000 in revenue. The following year GoPro sales quadrupled to $3.4 million.[31]
In 2014, the company was selling the HERO3+ in editions of different colors. It was capable of filming in 16:9 aspect ratio, supporting 4K UHD video and 12MP still photographs.[32] The HERO4 was introduced on 24 September 2014.[33]
GoPro KARMA & GoPro KARMA Grip[edit]




GoPro drone Karma


The GoPro Karma is GoPro's consumer drone.[citation needed]
In 2014, GoPro entered into discussions with DJI for a private label model built with the GoPro branding. After the failure of these negotiations, GoPro entered into an agreement with 3D Robotics (3DR) for a similar partnership based on 3DR's flight controllers. 3DR failed to meet their agreed upon timelines. As a result, GoPro took full control of the development process in mid-2015.
Scheduled to be released early 2016, the GoPro Karma project was delayed several times before the GoPro Karma was announced with an introduction date of October 23, 2016. The Karma was released along with newer models of the HERO5 and Session cameras and features a removable handheld stabilizer (gimbal) integrated into the design. After a few customers complained about power failure during operation, GoPro recalled Karma drones and gave customers full refunds.[34]
In February 2017, GoPro re-launched the Karma Drone.[35]
Accessories[edit]
GoPro produces various mounting accessories for its cameras including a 3-way mount, suction cup, chest harness, jaws-type flexible clamp, dog harness, surfing mount, etc.[36]
Video editing[edit]
The company developed GoPro Studio, simple video editing software to edit camera footage,[37] with v2.5 released in October 2014. It was reported that GoPro intended to also become a content provider, also with a new app for the HERO5 called GoPro Quik to share, and edit videos easier.[30]
Content company[edit]
In April 2014, GoPro was listed by Adweek as one of the "Top 10 Best Brand Channels on YouTube" based on a combination of views, shares, comments and overall engagement.[38] Content is uploaded daily, an additional source of revenue for the company.[39]
As part of its transformation to a media company in 2014, GoPro created additional channels with GoPro content on YouTube, Virgin America, and Xbox Live.[29] This was extended to the PlayStation Network in 2015.[40]
HD HERO cameras[edit]
As of October 2014[update], GoPro sells three fixed-lens cameras, two without viewfinders and one including a touchscreen viewfinder. A 2-bit LCD on the front of the camera allows access to its menu system, which is controlled by the front and top shutter buttons. The HERO4 Black have dimensions of 41 mm × 59 mm × 30 mm and weighs 88 grams (152 grams with housing). Still images from 6 to 12 megapixels can be captured. The cameras are sold with a clear polycarbonate HD Housing with a glass lens that is rated shockproof and waterproof to 131 feet (40 m), with a quick-release buckle on the top and threads at the bottom to attach to all of the GoPro mounts. The housing has metal buttons that connect to the camera's controls and has a "skeleton" backdoor option to allow audio recording when the camera is used with a mount but without the need to be watertight or shockproof.[41][non-primary source needed]
Products[edit]
HERO cameras[edit]
35mm[edit]
The 35mm camera (model #001) became available on April 13, 2005. It had dimensions of 2.5 by 3 inches (64 by 76 mm) and weighed 0.45 pounds (200 g). It included the camera, a clear case with quick release, a camera strap and ski glove adapter lash. It could pivot "on the fly" and be functional to a depth in water of about 15 feet (5 m). It was described as a "reusable wrist camera" and included a roll of 24 exposure Kodak 400 film.
Digital[edit]
The Digital HERO released in 2006 (Model: SQ907 mini-cam) had a 640×460 camera and shot VGA definition 320X240 (10fps) video for a maximum of 10 seconds. The Digital HERO1 had 32 MB internal memory without SD slot.
Digital 3[edit]
The Digital HERO3 released in 2007 had a 3-megapixel camera and shot standard definition 512×384 video. It was rated up to 30 m (98.4 feet) in depth.[42]
Digital 5[edit]
The Digital HERO5 was first introduced on December 5, 2006. It had a 5-megapixel still photo sensor and supported standard definition (512×384) video capture. It ran on two AAA batteries, had 16 MB of internal memory and could function with a 2 GB SD card. Its housing was rated to 100 ft/30 meters depth. Its dimensions were 2.6 × 1.75 × 1.25 inches (66 × 44 × 32 mm). The camera is not designed to work with the newer HD HERO line of housings, although the standard screw mounts are indeed compatible.

HERO2[edit]
The HERO2 was launched on October 24, 2011. It has an 11 MP image sensor, improved low-light capability and records at up to 120 fps.[46] It was sold with three different accessory packages as the Outdoor, Motorsports, and Surf Editions.[47]
HERO3[edit]
In late 2012, GoPro announced the HERO3 line of cameras.[48] These new cameras came in three editions: black, silver and white.
All three versions of the HERO3 come in a new 30% smaller and 25% lighter package, with WiFi functionality built in. The change of the physical dimensions of the cameras compared to the previous generations (HERO1 and HERO2 were physically identical) means that some of the camera accessories for HD HERO Original and HERO2 are not compatible with HERO3, so GoPro made new versions of those accessories specifically for HERO3 (and mostly for HERO3+, see below). Those new versions of accessories are usually not compatible with older Hero camera generations. However, a lot of other accessories are compatible with all HD Hero camera generations.
The HERO3 Silver and Black cameras have significantly less battery endurance than the HD HERO Original and HERO2.[49] For example, in 720p resolution with 25/30 fps, while HD HERO Original and HERO2 have a stated battery runtime of 3 hours, HERO3 Silver Edition has a stated battery runtime of 2 hours, and HERO3 Black Edition has a stated battery runtime of 1.5 hours (the Black Edition's "most economical" setting is 1080p/30 fps, so this also partially contributes to its poor battery runtime).
The Black Edition[50][not in citation given] has a new 12 MP sensor that can capture 4K UHD digital video at 15 fps, 2.7K video at 30 fps, 1440p at 48 fps, 1080p at 60 fps, 960p at 100 fps, 720p at 120 fps and WVGA at 240 fps. The Black edition also includes the WiFi Remote. The Black Edition cannot record at 25/30 fps in 720p and WVGA resolutions; it can only record at very fast frame rates in those resolutions. This is a deliberate firmware limitation, as the manufacturer does not expect that this high-end camera model will be used at these lower resolutions and frame rates.
The Silver Edition uses the same 11 MP sensor as the HERO2, and the White edition uses the same 5 MP sensor as the HD HERO Original.
HERO3+[edit]

In October 2013, GoPro released the HERO3+, available in Black and Silver Editions,[51] replacing the HERO3 generation. The HERO3 White Edition remains as GoPro's low-end device.
The HERO3+ camera models claim dramatically improved low light performance and have a waterproof enclosure which is 20% lighter and 15% smaller than the HERO3's, according to the GoPro website. The HERO3+ camera housing is 20% smaller than the HERO3. The cameras are claimed to have improved image sharpness (close focus down to 7" vs about 3 ft on the HERO3, at the expense of distant focus which is slightly less sharp[clarification needed] with HERO3+), and better audio functionality with wind noise reduction. Battery life is claimed to be 30% longer than for the HERO3 model (both through better efficiency and a higher-capacity battery of the same dimensions).[49][52]
The Black Edition has video modes of 1440p48,[53] 1080p60, 960p100 and 720p120 as well as 4K15 and 2.7K30 and can shoot 12MP stills at up to 30 fps. Along with the increased resolution, the HERO3+ Black Edition also offers an optional function in firmware (called "SuperView") which increases the field of view. It has additional functions, including dynamic low light situation adjustment, higher-quality recording modes (higher bitrates, no white balance applied, etc.) etc. The Black Edition continues to include a Wifi Remote. It does not have the ability to record 25/30 fps in 720p and WVGA modes (it can only record at very fast frame rates in those lower resolutions). This is an intentional firmware limitation, as the manufacturer does not expect a camera with its capabilities to be used at low resolution and frame rate. The battery runtime of HERO3+ Black Edition is significantly longer than HERO3 Black Edition but 30–50% lower than the battery runtime of the older HERO2 and HERO1.
The Silver Edition has video modes of 1080p60 and 720p120 and can shoot 10MP stills at up to 10 fps.[54] In contrast to the Black Edition, the Silver Edition can record at 25/30 fps (or higher) in all supported resolutions. HERO3+ Silver Edition also has about 25%-50% longer battery runtime during recording than HERO3+ Black Edition (they both use the same batteries).[52] The difference in runtime depends on the resolution/fps combination, and whether WiFi and GoPro mobile application are used during recording. The difference in runtime increases as the fps is lowered and the additional functions are deactivated on both cameras. The battery runtime of HERO3+ Silver Edition is similar to the battery runtime of HERO2 and HERO1.
The HERO3 HD camera was awarded the 2013 Technology & Engineering Emmy Award for its contribution to television.[55]
HERO4[edit]




GoPro Hero 4 Silver Edition


In September 2014, GoPro announced the HERO4, available in Black Edition and Silver Edition,[44] which replace their respective HERO3+ generation predecessors. The HERO Session, a budget camera, was also announced.
The HERO4 Black Edition still has a 12 mp CMOS and a f/2.8 fixed maximum aperture and focus free. It adds Bluetooth connectivity, Highlight tag, Protune Available for photo and a new processor claimed by GoPro to be twice as fast as that of the HERO3+ Black Edition, doubling the frame rates in most resolutions. The HERO4 Black Edition can record 4K UHD video (3840×2160) at a frame rate of 24, 25 and 30 fps.[56] In Superview mode, 4k is only possible at 25 fps. Many other rates and resolutions are available. The HERO4 Black Edition still shoots stills at a maximum of 12MP with a maximum burst rate of 30 fps. With Wi-Fi disabled at 4k/30, GoPro claims the HERO4 Black Edition battery life to be 65 minutes, increasing to a maximum of 1h 50' at 720p/240.[57] The HERO4 Black battery is in a different form factor than its predecessors. Initial side-by-side comparisons of HERO3+ and HERO4 Black edition video results suggest that the newer model has more detail at long range and similar performance at close range.
The HERO4 Silver Edition is basically a HERO3 Black Edition with the addition of a micro speaker,[58] built-in touch screen display, Protune for photo and highlight tag the first GoPro with this, a lower clocked Cortex-A9 and missing the Black Editions integrated analog-to-digital converter which supports a wider variety of professional low-sensitivity external mics.[59] The video modes supported by the HERO4 Silver Edition are similar to those of the HERO3+ Black, due to the higher processing speed and thermal requirements of 4K video (3840×2160), but it supports Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and contains the same,[60][61] Ambarella Inc. A9[62] SoC as in the HERO4 Black.
The HERO Session, released July 6, 2015, is 50% smaller and 40% lighter comparing to other versions of the GoPro HERO4 camera.[63]
The HERO4 models maintain the H.264 video codec of previous versions and MP4 file formats. GoPro claims the mono microphone in both the Black and Silver Editions has twice the dynamic range of the HERO3+, and that the HERO4 Black and Silver Editions have improved low-light performance.

HERO+LCD[edit]
In June 2015, the company started to sell a new camera: GoPro HERO+LCD, which provides video recording at 1080p at 60 fps/and 8 megapixel photos. GoPro HERO+LCD has a touch screen to preview the shot to frame the scene perfectly and letting user easily navigate the menu.[67] New feature in the camera -Instant camera editing. GoPro HERO+LCD is waterproof, because it is built directly into a waterproof case (waterproof to 131 feet (40 m)). The device also includes a feature HiLight Tagging and built-in video editing function, which allows user to put a label on the main points while shooting video or in the process of view, which makes it possible to quickly find desired footage later. Technical specifications: video resolution 1080p 60 FPS / 720p 60 FPS, photo resolution 8 MP / 5 FPS burst, built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, user-friendly modes like QuikCapture, SuperView and Auto Low Light, waterproof to 131’ (40 m), built-in touch display.
HERO+[edit]
In October 2015, GoPro released its third entry level camera: GoPro HERO+.[44] This camera has everything similar to the previous HERO+LCD like the 1080p 60 fps / 720p 60fps Video Resolution, 8 MP / 5 FPS burst photo resolution, built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, waterproof up to 40 m and other modes like Superview, Auto Low Light, QuikCapture and Timelapse mode which automatically captures photos at set time intervals from 0.5 to 60 seconds. However, it does not have an LCD built-in touch display and it is slightly lighter than HERO+LCD. The HERO+ weighs at 123 g whereas the HERO+LCD weighs 127 g. The housing also remained the same. This camera is priced at USD $199.99.
HERO5[edit]
HERO5 Black and HERO5 Session were introduced in September 2016.[68] In contrast to previous models, they are waterproof up to 10 m, support 4k video recording up to 30 fps, automatic upload of footage to cloud and voice controls.

GoPro KARMA Drone[edit]




GoPro drone Karma


Karma Drone became available October 23, 2016. GoPro launched the highly anticipated Karma Drone for $799, which includes the Drone, controller, stabilizer, Karma Grip, and case. The drone can be bundled with a HERO5 Black for $1099 and with a HERO5 Session for $999. The drone is also compatible with the HERO 4 Black and Silver. Gross margins may come in below company averages initially, but over time the firm should cut out costs with each generation as they have done with the cameras. The Drone has 20 minutes of battery life.[70] The stabilizer can be taken out and attached to a Karma stick, which can be sold separately for $299.99 and the presentation of a downhill mountain biker POV with minimal shake. The Karma stick has greater than 1-hour battery life.
On November 8, 2016, Go Pro announced the recall of the Karma Drone following reports of loss of electrical power on the drone during operation.[71]
On February 1, 2017, the company announced that the Karma Drone will return to stores with a redesigned battery latch.[72]

History[edit]
The company was founded by Nick Woodman in 2004.[3] He was motivated by a 2002 surfing trip to Australia in which he was hoping to capture quality action photos, but could not because amateur photographers could not get close enough or buy quality equipment at reasonable prices.[4] His desire for a camera system that could capture the professional angles inspired the 'GoPro' name.[5][6]
Woodman raised a portion of his initial capital by selling bead and shell belts for under US $20 from his VW van[7] and, later, fashionable camera straps. He also received over $230,000 from his parents to invest in the business.[8][9]
In 2004, the company sold its first camera system, which used 35 mm film.[5] Digital still and video cameras were later introduced. As of 2014[update], a fixed-lens HD video camera with a wide 170-degree lens was available; two or more can be paired to create 360 video.[5][10]
On June 4, 2014, the company announced the appointment of former Microsoft executive Tony Bates as President reporting directly to Woodman.[11]
In January 2016, GoPro partnered with Periscope for live streaming.[12]
After growing the number of employees by more than 500 in 2015, the company responded to weak sales in the fourth quarter by cutting about 7% of its workforce (100 workers) in January 2016.[13]
At its peak, a share of GoPro was valued at $86, but on September 27, 2016, only $16.79.[14]
In November 2016, the company announced it was laying off an additional 200 employees in an effort to reduce costs. The company also announced that President Tony Bates would be stepping down at the end of 2016.[15]
Corporate actions[edit]
On March 30, 2011, GoPro acquired CineForm. The acquisition included the CineForm 444 video codec used in the film Slumdog Millionaire. The company claimed that the codec "makes HD and 3D editing faster and more convenient without sacrificing image quality". It was incorporated in the company's 3D Hero System shortly after the acquisition.[16][17]
In March 2013, GoPro issued a DMCA takedown notice to website DigitalRev.com, which had posted a review[18] of its product, citing trademark use as a breach of copyright. This notice was retracted 10 days later, citing "erroneous enforcement".[19][20]
On February 29, 2016, GoPro spent $105 million and acquired two start-ups, namely, Stupeflix and Vemory, for their video editing tools Replay and Splice.[21][22]
IPO[edit]
On February 7, 2014, GoPro submitted a confidential filing for an initial public offering (IPO) with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).[23]
On May 19, 2014, GoPro filed its S-1 with the SEC without specifying the number of shares or their price. The company stated that they hoped to raise at least $100 million through the sale of shares, using the money to pay off debt in full ($111 million as of March 31, 2014) and "to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, technologies or assets". They said that they planned to list on the NASDAQ stock exchange using the symbol 'GPRO.'[24][25]
The expected price range was $21 to $24 a share; on June 25, 2014, GoPro sold 17.8 million shares to initial investors at $24 per share (totaling $427.2M).[26] At the IPO price the company was valued at $2.95 billion.[24] 1.5 percent of those shares were allotted to LOYAL3, a technology platform that allows small investors to participate.[27][28]
An important reason for GoPro's decision to go public was the potential to become a media company to generate additional revenue from the content its cameras create.[29][30]
Product lines[edit]
HERO cameras[edit]
Woodman worked on his first camera for two years after founding the company, eventually introducing the GoPro 35mm HERO in September 2004 at San Diego's Action Sports Retailer trade show.[31] In its first year GoPro sold $150,000 worth of products.[31] In 2006 the company introduced its first Digital HERO, with 10 second video capability, and generated $800,000 in revenue. The following year GoPro sales quadrupled to $3.4 million.[31]
In 2014, the company was selling the HERO3+ in editions of different colors. It was capable of filming in 16:9 aspect ratio, supporting 4K UHD video and 12MP still photographs.[32] The HERO4 was introduced on 24 September 2014.[33]
GoPro KARMA & GoPro KARMA Grip[edit]




GoPro drone Karma


The GoPro Karma is GoPro's consumer drone.[citation needed]
In 2014, GoPro entered into discussions with DJI for a private label model built with the GoPro branding. After the failure of these negotiations, GoPro entered into an agreement with 3D Robotics (3DR) for a similar partnership based on 3DR's flight controllers. 3DR failed to meet their agreed upon timelines. As a result, GoPro took full control of the development process in mid-2015.
Scheduled to be released early 2016, the GoPro Karma project was delayed several times before the GoPro Karma was announced with an introduction date of October 23, 2016. The Karma was released along with newer models of the HERO5 and Session cameras and features a removable handheld stabilizer (gimbal) integrated into the design. After a few customers complained about power failure during operation, GoPro recalled Karma drones and gave customers full refunds.[34]
In February 2017, GoPro re-launched the Karma Drone.[35]
Accessories[edit]
GoPro produces various mounting accessories for its cameras including a 3-way mount, suction cup, chest harness, jaws-type flexible clamp, dog harness, surfing mount, etc.[36]
Video editing[edit]
The company developed GoPro Studio, simple video editing software to edit camera footage,[37] with v2.5 released in October 2014. It was reported that GoPro intended to also become a content provider, also with a new app for the HERO5 called GoPro Quik to share, and edit videos easier.[30]
Content company[edit]
In April 2014, GoPro was listed by Adweek as one of the "Top 10 Best Brand Channels on YouTube" based on a combination of views, shares, comments and overall engagement.[38] Content is uploaded daily, an additional source of revenue for the company.[39]
As part of its transformation to a media company in 2014, GoPro created additional channels with GoPro content on YouTube, Virgin America, and Xbox Live.[29] This was extended to the PlayStation Network in 2015.[40]
HD HERO cameras[edit]
As of October 2014[update], GoPro sells three fixed-lens cameras, two without viewfinders and one including a touchscreen viewfinder. A 2-bit LCD on the front of the camera allows access to its menu system, which is controlled by the front and top shutter buttons. The HERO4 Black have dimensions of 41 mm × 59 mm × 30 mm and weighs 88 grams (152 grams with housing). Still images from 6 to 12 megapixels can be captured. The cameras are sold with a clear polycarbonate HD Housing with a glass lens that is rated shockproof and waterproof to 131 feet (40 m), with a quick-release buckle on the top and threads at the bottom to attach to all of the GoPro mounts. The housing has metal buttons that connect to the camera's controls and has a "skeleton" backdoor option to allow audio recording when the camera is used with a mount but without the need to be watertight or shockproof.[41][non-primary source needed]
Products[edit]
HERO cameras[edit]
35mm[edit]
The 35mm camera (model #001) became available on April 13, 2005. It had dimensions of 2.5 by 3 inches (64 by 76 mm) and weighed 0.45 pounds (200 g). It included the camera, a clear case with quick release, a camera strap and ski glove adapter lash. It could pivot "on the fly" and be functional to a depth in water of about 15 feet (5 m). It was described as a "reusable wrist camera" and included a roll of 24 exposure Kodak 400 film.
Digital[edit]
The Digital HERO released in 2006 (Model: SQ907 mini-cam) had a 640×460 camera and shot VGA definition 320X240 (10fps) video for a maximum of 10 seconds. The Digital HERO1 had 32 MB internal memory without SD slot.
Digital 3[edit]
The Digital HERO3 released in 2007 had a 3-megapixel camera and shot standard definition 512×384 video. It was rated up to 30 m (98.4 feet) in depth.[42]
Digital 5[edit]
The Digital HERO5 was first introduced on December 5, 2006. It had a 5-megapixel still photo sensor and supported standard definition (512×384) video capture. It ran on two AAA batteries, had 16 MB of internal memory and could function with a 2 GB SD card. Its housing was rated to 100 ft/30 meters depth. Its dimensions were 2.6 × 1.75 × 1.25 inches (66 × 44 × 32 mm). The camera is not designed to work with the newer HD HERO line of housings, although the standard screw mounts are indeed compatible.

HERO2[edit]
The HERO2 was launched on October 24, 2011. It has an 11 MP image sensor, improved low-light capability and records at up to 120 fps.[46] It was sold with three different accessory packages as the Outdoor, Motorsports, and Surf Editions.[47]
HERO3[edit]
In late 2012, GoPro announced the HERO3 line of cameras.[48] These new cameras came in three editions: black, silver and white.
All three versions of the HERO3 come in a new 30% smaller and 25% lighter package, with WiFi functionality built in. The change of the physical dimensions of the cameras compared to the previous generations (HERO1 and HERO2 were physically identical) means that some of the camera accessories for HD HERO Original and HERO2 are not compatible with HERO3, so GoPro made new versions of those accessories specifically for HERO3 (and mostly for HERO3+, see below). Those new versions of accessories are usually not compatible with older Hero camera generations. However, a lot of other accessories are compatible with all HD Hero camera generations.
The HERO3 Silver and Black cameras have significantly less battery endurance than the HD HERO Original and HERO2.[49] For example, in 720p resolution with 25/30 fps, while HD HERO Original and HERO2 have a stated battery runtime of 3 hours, HERO3 Silver Edition has a stated battery runtime of 2 hours, and HERO3 Black Edition has a stated battery runtime of 1.5 hours (the Black Edition's "most economical" setting is 1080p/30 fps, so this also partially contributes to its poor battery runtime).
The Black Edition[50][not in citation given] has a new 12 MP sensor that can capture 4K UHD digital video at 15 fps, 2.7K video at 30 fps, 1440p at 48 fps, 1080p at 60 fps, 960p at 100 fps, 720p at 120 fps and WVGA at 240 fps. The Black edition also includes the WiFi Remote. The Black Edition cannot record at 25/30 fps in 720p and WVGA resolutions; it can only record at very fast frame rates in those resolutions. This is a deliberate firmware limitation, as the manufacturer does not expect that this high-end camera model will be used at these lower resolutions and frame rates.
The Silver Edition uses the same 11 MP sensor as the HERO2, and the White edition uses the same 5 MP sensor as the HD HERO Original.
HERO3+[edit]

In October 2013, GoPro released the HERO3+, available in Black and Silver Editions,[51] replacing the HERO3 generation. The HERO3 White Edition remains as GoPro's low-end device.
The HERO3+ camera models claim dramatically improved low light performance and have a waterproof enclosure which is 20% lighter and 15% smaller than the HERO3's, according to the GoPro website. The HERO3+ camera housing is 20% smaller than the HERO3. The cameras are claimed to have improved image sharpness (close focus down to 7" vs about 3 ft on the HERO3, at the expense of distant focus which is slightly less sharp[clarification needed] with HERO3+), and better audio functionality with wind noise reduction. Battery life is claimed to be 30% longer than for the HERO3 model (both through better efficiency and a higher-capacity battery of the same dimensions).[49][52]
The Black Edition has video modes of 1440p48,[53] 1080p60, 960p100 and 720p120 as well as 4K15 and 2.7K30 and can shoot 12MP stills at up to 30 fps. Along with the increased resolution, the HERO3+ Black Edition also offers an optional function in firmware (called "SuperView") which increases the field of view. It has additional functions, including dynamic low light situation adjustment, higher-quality recording modes (higher bitrates, no white balance applied, etc.) etc. The Black Edition continues to include a Wifi Remote. It does not have the ability to record 25/30 fps in 720p and WVGA modes (it can only record at very fast frame rates in those lower resolutions). This is an intentional firmware limitation, as the manufacturer does not expect a camera with its capabilities to be used at low resolution and frame rate. The battery runtime of HERO3+ Black Edition is significantly longer than HERO3 Black Edition but 30–50% lower than the battery runtime of the older HERO2 and HERO1.
The Silver Edition has video modes of 1080p60 and 720p120 and can shoot 10MP stills at up to 10 fps.[54] In contrast to the Black Edition, the Silver Edition can record at 25/30 fps (or higher) in all supported resolutions. HERO3+ Silver Edition also has about 25%-50% longer battery runtime during recording than HERO3+ Black Edition (they both use the same batteries).[52] The difference in runtime depends on the resolution/fps combination, and whether WiFi and GoPro mobile application are used during recording. The difference in runtime increases as the fps is lowered and the additional functions are deactivated on both cameras. The battery runtime of HERO3+ Silver Edition is similar to the battery runtime of HERO2 and HERO1.
The HERO3 HD camera was awarded the 2013 Technology & Engineering Emmy Award for its contribution to television.[55]
HERO4[edit]




GoPro Hero 4 Silver Edition


In September 2014, GoPro announced the HERO4, available in Black Edition and Silver Edition,[44] which replace their respective HERO3+ generation predecessors. The HERO Session, a budget camera, was also announced.
The HERO4 Black Edition still has a 12 mp CMOS and a f/2.8 fixed maximum aperture and focus free. It adds Bluetooth connectivity, Highlight tag, Protune Available for photo and a new processor claimed by GoPro to be twice as fast as that of the HERO3+ Black Edition, doubling the frame rates in most resolutions. The HERO4 Black Edition can record 4K UHD video (3840×2160) at a frame rate of 24, 25 and 30 fps.[56] In Superview mode, 4k is only possible at 25 fps. Many other rates and resolutions are available. The HERO4 Black Edition still shoots stills at a maximum of 12MP with a maximum burst rate of 30 fps. With Wi-Fi disabled at 4k/30, GoPro claims the HERO4 Black Edition battery life to be 65 minutes, increasing to a maximum of 1h 50' at 720p/240.[57] The HERO4 Black battery is in a different form factor than its predecessors. Initial side-by-side comparisons of HERO3+ and HERO4 Black edition video results suggest that the newer model has more detail at long range and similar performance at close range.
The HERO4 Silver Edition is basically a HERO3 Black Edition with the addition of a micro speaker,[58] built-in touch screen display, Protune for photo and highlight tag the first GoPro with this, a lower clocked Cortex-A9 and missing the Black Editions integrated analog-to-digital converter which supports a wider variety of professional low-sensitivity external mics.[59] The video modes supported by the HERO4 Silver Edition are similar to those of the HERO3+ Black, due to the higher processing speed and thermal requirements of 4K video (3840×2160), but it supports Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and contains the same,[60][61] Ambarella Inc. A9[62] SoC as in the HERO4 Black.
The HERO Session, released July 6, 2015, is 50% smaller and 40% lighter comparing to other versions of the GoPro HERO4 camera.[63]
The HERO4 models maintain the H.264 video codec of previous versions and MP4 file formats. GoPro claims the mono microphone in both the Black and Silver Editions has twice the dynamic range of the HERO3+, and that the HERO4 Black and Silver Editions have improved low-light performance.

HERO+LCD[edit]
In June 2015, the company started to sell a new camera: GoPro HERO+LCD, which provides video recording at 1080p at 60 fps/and 8 megapixel photos. GoPro HERO+LCD has a touch screen to preview the shot to frame the scene perfectly and letting user easily navigate the menu.[67] New feature in the camera -Instant camera editing. GoPro HERO+LCD is waterproof, because it is built directly into a waterproof case (waterproof to 131 feet (40 m)). The device also includes a feature HiLight Tagging and built-in video editing function, which allows user to put a label on the main points while shooting video or in the process of view, which makes it possible to quickly find desired footage later. Technical specifications: video resolution 1080p 60 FPS / 720p 60 FPS, photo resolution 8 MP / 5 FPS burst, built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, user-friendly modes like QuikCapture, SuperView and Auto Low Light, waterproof to 131’ (40 m), built-in touch display.
HERO+[edit]
In October 2015, GoPro released its third entry level camera: GoPro HERO+.[44] This camera has everything similar to the previous HERO+LCD like the 1080p 60 fps / 720p 60fps Video Resolution, 8 MP / 5 FPS burst photo resolution, built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, waterproof up to 40 m and other modes like Superview, Auto Low Light, QuikCapture and Timelapse mode which automatically captures photos at set time intervals from 0.5 to 60 seconds. However, it does not have an LCD built-in touch display and it is slightly lighter than HERO+LCD. The HERO+ weighs at 123 g whereas the HERO+LCD weighs 127 g. The housing also remained the same. This camera is priced at USD $199.99.

GoPro KARMA Drone[edit]




GoPro drone Karma


Karma Drone became available October 23, 2016. GoPro launched the highly anticipated Karma Drone for $799, which includes the Drone, controller, stabilizer, Karma Grip, and case. The drone can be bundled with a HERO5 Black for $1099 and with a HERO5 Session for $999. The drone is also compatible with the HERO 4 Black and Silver. Gross margins may come in below company averages initially, but over time the firm should cut out costs with each generation as they have done with the cameras. The Drone has 20 minutes of battery life.[70] The stabilizer can be taken out and attached to a Karma stick, which can be sold separately for $299.99 and the presentation of a downhill mountain biker POV with minimal shake. The Karma stick has greater than 1-hour battery life.
On November 8, 2016, Go Pro announced the recall of the Karma Drone following reports of loss of electrical power on the drone during operation.[71]
On February 1, 2017, the company announced that the Karma Drone will return to stores with a redesigned battery latch.[72]

Early life and education[edit]
Woodman is the son of Concepcion (née Socarras) and Dean Woodman.[3][4][5][6] His father was born into a Quaker family and co-founded the investment bank Robertson Stephens;[3][7][8] and his mother is of Hispanic descent and re-married Irwin Federman, General Partner of U.S. Venture Partners in 1992.[4] Woodman grew up in Menlo Park, California[9] and Atherton, California,[10] attending the Menlo School, where he graduated in 1993.[11] He developed his interest in surfing during high school and formed the high school's first surfing club. Woodman would sell t-shirts at high school football games to raise money for the surfing club.[12] He earned a bachelor's degree in visual arts and a minor in creative writing from the University of California, San Diego in 1997.[13][10][14] After school, Woodman founded two startups, both of which never fully made it off the ground. The first was a website called EmpowerAll.com, which attempted to sell electronic goods for no more than a $2 markup, and the second was Funbug, a gaming and marketing platform that gave users the chance to win cash prizes. Woodman took the lack of success from both companies personally.[15] After failing to reach success on his own, Nick went home and received a $235,000 investment from his father,[16] an investment banker in Silicon Valley, [17] and used his parents connections to venture capital to launch his career as the head of GoPro.[18]
Career[edit]
While on hiatus in Australia and Indonesia on a surf trip, he used a 35mm camera attached to the palm of his hand by a rubber band to try to capture his surfing activities on film.[14] Seeing that amateur photographers like him – who wanted to capture quality action photos of their activities – had difficulties because either they could not get close enough to the action or were unable to purchase quality equipment at affordable prices, his trip became his inspiration to found GoPro.[14] His solution was to develop a belt that would attach the camera to the body.[14] Woodman and his future wife Jill financed the business by selling shell necklaces they bought in Bali (for $1.90) from their car along the California coast (for $60).[19] His mother loaned him $35,000 and let him borrow her sewing machine, which he used to sew camera straps while experimenting with early designs. His dad loaned him an additional $200,000, which Woodman immediately paid back out of company sales.[3] His desire for a camera system that could capture close up footage inspired the 'GoPro' name.[20][21] The original cameras he developed were point-and-shoot 35mm film cameras which mounted to the user's wrist. Woodman would go about selling his products while using his 1971 Volkwagen Bus that he named 'The Buscuit' as his mobile home.[12] The product has since evolved into a compact digital camera that supports WiFi, can be remotely controlled, has waterproof housing, records to a micro SD card, and is affordable to the average action sports enthusiast ($200–$400). Woodman would often act as the test engineer for their earlier products completing tasks such as attaching a GoPro to a car and driving at speeds of over 130 MPH. In 2004, he made his first big sale when a Japanese company ordered 100 cameras at a sports show.[14][19] Thereafter, sales doubled every year,[13] and in 2012, GoPro sold 2.3 million cameras.[14] In 2005, Woodman appeared on QVC to sell his GoPro Hero. In 2004, GoPro had about $150,000 in revenue which grew to about $350,000 in 2005. In December 2012, the Taiwanese contract manufacturer Foxconn purchased 8.88% of the company for $200 million which set the market value of the company at $2.25 billion making Woodman, who owned the majority of the stock, a billionaire.[14][19] On June 26, 2014, GoPro went public – closing the day at $31.34 a share. In 2014, Woodman was the highest paid US chief executive, paying himself $235 million.[22][23][24]
In 2015, GoPro developed a partnership with the NHL that would enable the NHL to use GoPro products to improve the viewing experience for fans.[25] Woodman has been invited to speak at various tech conferences and in October 2015, Woodman was a guest on the Late Show with Stephen Colbert and wore a GoPro camera for the entirety of the interview.[26] Woodman is set to appear as a shark investor in the sixth season of the show Shark Tank.[27] Woodman has invested $125,000 as of November 2015 on Shark Tank on two investments.[28]
At the beginning of 2016, GoPro started to make a series of job cuts. In January of 2016, Woodman's Company cut 100 jobs, or 7% of his workforce.[29] Later that year, in November 2016, GoPro cut an additional 15% of the GoPro workforce after attempting to branch out beyond its core business of action cameras, as the entertainment division failed to reach profitability.[30]
In December 2016, a class action lawsuit against GoPro was announced. The complaint alleges that GoPro made false and misleading statements to investors and/or failed to disclose flaws in the Company's drones, overstating customer demand, and GoPro's public statements were materially false and misleading. [31][32]
2016 proved to be a tough year for GoPro.[33] With the many changes at and involving GoPro, including numerous job cuts, and falling stock prices, Woodman was listed as one of the year's worst CEOs. [34]
Awards[edit]

2013 National Award Winner of the EY Entrepreneur of the Year Award.
2014 Winner of the Technology and Engineering Emmy Award in the category of Inexpensive Small Rugged HD Camcorders. Woodman brought his GoPro onstage for his acceptance speech.[23][35]

Philanthropy[edit]
After a successful IPO, the couple donated 5.8 million shares of GoPro stock to the Jill + Nicholas Woodman Foundation, a new fund they created at the Silicon Valley Community Foundation in 2014. [36] From 2014 to 2017, the value of the stock donated declined from $500 million to $50.3 million because of the dramatic decline in GoPro stock. Woodman was one of the biggest donors in the tech industry that year; however, it angered investors.[37][38][39]
In March 2014, Woodman was honored for his philanthropic work with BUILD at their 5th annual gala in San Francisco.[40]
Personal life[edit]
Woodman is married to Jill R. Scully[41] and they have three children.[13][14] They live in Woodside, California.[42] Woodman is known as the "mad billionaire" due to his unconventional behavior and eccentricities.[14] Woodman is a strong believer in following one's passions as a way to success stating, "I’m a big believer that when you’re pursuing your passions, your best ideas come to you. Your passions are a bit like your fingerprints: Everybody has them; everybody’s are different. One’s passions may just be a guidebook to one’s life.”[27] In 2015, Woodman hosted an AMA on Reddit. Woodman has often cited his fear of failure as a catalyst for his success stating, "When I got out of college, I gave myself till I was 30 to invent a product. If I couldn't do it by then, I would just get a real job. And that fear – the fear of a real job – motivated me to be an entrepreneur."[43]
In December 2015, Woodman commissioned a 180-foot yacht, estimated to cost between $35 million and $40 million. The boat, expected to be delivered in 2017, is four decks high and comes with a Jacuzzi pool, swim platform, sweeping sun decks, and dining areas. [44]

Early life and education[edit]
Woodman is the son of Concepcion (née Socarras) and Dean Woodman.[3][4][5][6] His father was born into a Quaker family and co-founded the investment bank Robertson Stephens;[3][7][8] and his mother is of Hispanic descent and re-married Irwin Federman, General Partner of U.S. Venture Partners in 1992.[4] Woodman grew up in Menlo Park, California[9] and Atherton, California,[10] attending the Menlo School, where he graduated in 1993.[11] He developed his interest in surfing during high school and formed the high school's first surfing club. Woodman would sell t-shirts at high school football games to raise money for the surfing club.[12] He earned a bachelor's degree in visual arts and a minor in creative writing from the University of California, San Diego in 1997.[13][10][14] After school, Woodman founded two startups, both of which never fully made it off the ground. The first was a website called EmpowerAll.com, which attempted to sell electronic goods for no more than a $2 markup, and the second was Funbug, a gaming and marketing platform that gave users the chance to win cash prizes. Woodman took the lack of success from both companies personally.[15] After failing to reach success on his own, Nick went home and received a $235,000 investment from his father,[16] an investment banker in Silicon Valley, [17] and used his parents connections to venture capital to launch his career as the head of GoPro.[18]
Career[edit]
While on hiatus in Australia and Indonesia on a surf trip, he used a 35mm camera attached to the palm of his hand by a rubber band to try to capture his surfing activities on film.[14] Seeing that amateur photographers like him – who wanted to capture quality action photos of their activities – had difficulties because either they could not get close enough to the action or were unable to purchase quality equipment at affordable prices, his trip became his inspiration to found GoPro.[14] His solution was to develop a belt that would attach the camera to the body.[14] Woodman and his future wife Jill financed the business by selling shell necklaces they bought in Bali (for $1.90) from their car along the California coast (for $60).[19] His mother loaned him $35,000 and let him borrow her sewing machine, which he used to sew camera straps while experimenting with early designs. His dad loaned him an additional $200,000, which Woodman immediately paid back out of company sales.[3] His desire for a camera system that could capture close up footage inspired the 'GoPro' name.[20][21] The original cameras he developed were point-and-shoot 35mm film cameras which mounted to the user's wrist. Woodman would go about selling his products while using his 1971 Volkwagen Bus that he named 'The Buscuit' as his mobile home.[12] The product has since evolved into a compact digital camera that supports WiFi, can be remotely controlled, has waterproof housing, records to a micro SD card, and is affordable to the average action sports enthusiast ($200–$400). Woodman would often act as the test engineer for their earlier products completing tasks such as attaching a GoPro to a car and driving at speeds of over 130 MPH. In 2004, he made his first big sale when a Japanese company ordered 100 cameras at a sports show.[14][19] Thereafter, sales doubled every year,[13] and in 2012, GoPro sold 2.3 million cameras.[14] In 2005, Woodman appeared on QVC to sell his GoPro Hero. In 2004, GoPro had about $150,000 in revenue which grew to about $350,000 in 2005. In December 2012, the Taiwanese contract manufacturer Foxconn purchased 8.88% of the company for $200 million which set the market value of the company at $2.25 billion making Woodman, who owned the majority of the stock, a billionaire.[14][19] On June 26, 2014, GoPro went public – closing the day at $31.34 a share. In 2014, Woodman was the highest paid US chief executive, paying himself $235 million.[22][23][24]
In 2015, GoPro developed a partnership with the NHL that would enable the NHL to use GoPro products to improve the viewing experience for fans.[25] Woodman has been invited to speak at various tech conferences and in October 2015, Woodman was a guest on the Late Show with Stephen Colbert and wore a GoPro camera for the entirety of the interview.[26] Woodman is set to appear as a shark investor in the sixth season of the show Shark Tank.[27] Woodman has invested $125,000 as of November 2015 on Shark Tank on two investments.[28]
At the beginning of 2016, GoPro started to make a series of job cuts. In January of 2016, Woodman's Company cut 100 jobs, or 7% of his workforce.[29] Later that year, in November 2016, GoPro cut an additional 15% of the GoPro workforce after attempting to branch out beyond its core business of action cameras, as the entertainment division failed to reach profitability.[30]
In December 2016, a class action lawsuit against GoPro was announced. The complaint alleges that GoPro made false and misleading statements to investors and/or failed to disclose flaws in the Company's drones, overstating customer demand, and GoPro's public statements were materially false and misleading. [31][32]
2016 proved to be a tough year for GoPro.[33] With the many changes at and involving GoPro, including numerous job cuts, and falling stock prices, Woodman was listed as one of the year's worst CEOs. [34]
Awards[edit]

2013 National Award Winner of the EY Entrepreneur of the Year Award.
2014 Winner of the Technology and Engineering Emmy Award in the category of Inexpensive Small Rugged HD Camcorders. Woodman brought his GoPro onstage for his acceptance speech.[23][35]

Philanthropy[edit]
After a successful IPO, the couple donated 5.8 million shares of GoPro stock to the Jill + Nicholas Woodman Foundation, a new fund they created at the Silicon Valley Community Foundation in 2014. [36] From 2014 to 2017, the value of the stock donated declined from $500 million to $50.3 million because of the dramatic decline in GoPro stock. Woodman was one of the biggest donors in the tech industry that year; however, it angered investors.[37][38][39]
In March 2014, Woodman was honored for his philanthropic work with BUILD at their 5th annual gala in San Francisco.[40]
Personal life[edit]
Woodman is married to Jill R. Scully[41] and they have three children.[13][14] They live in Woodside, California.[42] Woodman is known as the "mad billionaire" due to his unconventional behavior and eccentricities.[14] Woodman is a strong believer in following one's passions as a way to success stating, "I’m a big believer that when you’re pursuing your passions, your best ideas come to you. Your passions are a bit like your fingerprints: Everybody has them; everybody’s are different. One’s passions may just be a guidebook to one’s life.”[27] In 2015, Woodman hosted an AMA on Reddit. Woodman has often cited his fear of failure as a catalyst for his success stating, "When I got out of college, I gave myself till I was 30 to invent a product. If I couldn't do it by then, I would just get a real job. And that fear – the fear of a real job – motivated me to be an entrepreneur."[43]
In December 2015, Woodman commissioned a 180-foot yacht, estimated to cost between $35 million and $40 million. The boat, expected to be delivered in 2017, is four decks high and comes with a Jacuzzi pool, swim platform, sweeping sun decks, and dining areas. [44]

Nicholas (Nick) Woodman’s GoPro Prospectus for IPO Now Published Hopes to Raise More Than $100 Million





















–

–
At the beginning of February we learned that rugged-sports video/stills camera maker GoPro had filed documents with the SEC for an initial public offering. As its revenues were under US$1 billion at the time,    the company kept the details of the filing confidential.
Now the prospectus has been approved by the SEC and the IPO is underway,    and of course its details are now made public for the first time – including the fact that it already achieved revenues of just under US$986 million in its fiscal year to December 31st,    2013. This was just below the US$1 billion threshold which,    under the 2012 JOBS Act,    allowed them to claim confidentiality for the filing.

The prospectus also indicates GoPro hopes to raise a minimum of US$100 million from the offering,    which is likely to be hugely successful as it is now revealed to already be a very profitable company: in 2013 GoPro recorded net income of US$61 million.
After launching its first high definition product nearly five years ago,    in July 2009,    GoPro has sold 8.5 million of its HERO cameras,    with 45% of these being sold in the last year alone as their concept of personal,    mountable,    rugged,    take anywhere action video cameras has taken off.
GoPro products are popular in part because of the attention that has been placed on simplifying their subsequent digital work flow as well,    which can be a disincentive for other video systems,    making them more accessible to their users.
GoPro early on took the trouble to develop its own software,    GoPro Studio,    which enables its customers to quickly edit either simple or complex videos,    and even create videos from time-lapse photo sequences. As at March 31,    2014,    the prospectus indicates there had been more than 4.3 million downloads of GoPro Studio.
To get to this point GoPro has to date received substantial venture funding from top ranking VC firms such as US Venture Partners,    Riverwood Capital,    Sageview Capital,    Steamboat Ventures and Walden Partners.
Taiwan tech manufacturer Hon Hai Precision,    a.k.a. Foxconn,    also invested in the company in 2012,    at a valuation that was placed on the company then of around US$2.25 billion. This transaction reportedly made the company’s founder Nicholas Woodman a billionaire on paper for the first time,    and the prospectus reveals he and his family still own just under 49% of the company’s shares.
Out in the wild,    GoPro video gear has become just about ubiquitous these days for many amateur and major professional sporting activities and,    as well,    for parts of the action scenes in lots of motion pictures as well.
While GoPro is today clearly a hardware company it also claims to be positioning itself in the future as a media company. In the prospectus the company says,    for example,    “We are investing to scale GoPro as a media entity,   ” though presently it does not makes any money that way.
GoPro’s media initiatives include its popular YouTube channel where thousands of amateur video clips are posted,    some of which are very popular. GoPro also regularly commissions a number of professional videos made with its cameras in order to to promote the experience to its wider target audiences.
The GoPro Network now even includes a channel on Virgin America’s in-flight entertainment system. Essentially an endless loop of some of the best GoPro videos,    is popular for bored passengers to watch,    sometimes repeatedly. GoPro even gives all the content to Virgin for free at the moment.
The company has also announced its own Xbox channel,    something that could also eventually bring some monetization through advertising and the option to buy GoPro products,    and with a cut offered to Microsoft along the way. Nevertheless these initiatives all primarily exist to encourage people to buy the hardware,    just as iTunes really started simply to drive sales of Apple’s hardware as well.
Accordingly GoPro indicates “We expect to continue to derive the substantial majority of our revenue from sales of cameras and accessories for the foreseeable future.” Nevertheless one never knows,    as iTunes later itself become increasingly a substantial revenue driver for Apple.
Pricing and other details for the new initial public offering have not yet been set,    but will almost certainly see another step up from the 2012 Foxconn transaction. Even after the dilution of a new offering the Woodward family will still maintain control of the company due to a dual class of voting share structure.
The company became a strong cash producer in 2013,    generating over US$102 million from operations. Accordingly it ended up with US$111 million in cash sitting in the bank at March 31st,    2014. Total outstanding current and long term debt as of the same date was actually about the same amount,    also at US$111 million. Thus GoPro’s net debt is therefore about zero at that date. The corporate loans in its balance sheet had been raised originally to fund substantial distributions to shareholders along the way.
The new offering under the IPO is expected to be for a minimum of US$100 million. This will include providing liquidity for existing shareholders as well as new money that will go into the company’s treasury. Depending of course on the final size of the offering,    and the split between new money raised and money directed towards selling shareholders,    that portion of the proceeds from the new offering that goes to the company is stated to be intended to be used to repay term debt and for “general corporate purposes.”
JPMorgan,    Citigroup and Barclays are the lead underwriters for the proposed share offering.

Nicholas ( Nick) Woodman,    Founder and CEO of GoPro,    has been named the National EY Entrepreneur Of The Year 2013 Retail and Consumer Products Award winner ,    By Ernst & Young .

Woodman was recognized for developing a high-definition video camera for extreme sports that has evolved into one of the most engaged brands in social media today. He was honored at the Entrepreneur Of The Year Awards gala.  The Forum is the nation’s premier gathering of high-growth,    market-leading companies. Awards were given in 10 additional categories.

In addition to Woodman,    the EY Entrepreneur Of The Year Retail and Consumer Products finalists in the US were: Daniel Lubetzky,    Founder and CEO,    KIND Healthy Snacks,    based in New York; David Sokolsky,    President,    CEO,    Daisy Brand,    based in Dallas,    Texas; and  Jim Weber,    CEO,    Brooks Sports,    Inc.,    based in Bothell,    Wash.

The winners were selected by an independent panel of judges and from more than 250 regional award recipients.
“We are pleased to honor Nicholas Woodman with this esteemed award,   ” said Bryan Pearce,    EY Americas Director,    Entrepreneur Of The Year. “He was able to see early in the game just how important it is to surround yourself with the right team — people who possess the strengths that you don’t. The great minds Nicholas brought to the table under his leadership have made GoPro a huge success.”
Walking before running Ironically,    Woodman’s inspiration to develop GoPro came as he was trying to recover from the failure of his first internet business,    a marketing start-up he’d launched after graduating from college. While he raised some $4 million in venture capital and made all the right moves,    the company didn’t survive the dot-com crash.  Failure was one thing,    but the stress of losing other people’s money forced Woodman to reassess his goals and focus on building a business based on a true passion: surfing.
An avid surfer,    Woodman had long realized how frustrating it was for surfers to get great shots and footage of themselves while they were riding the waves. All that was available at the time were disposable cameras attached to their wrists. However,    the photo quality was terrible,    and the cameras often flew off,    sometimes hitting surfers in the face.
To counter that possibility,    Woodman thought of developing a wearable camera that could be secured with a wrist strap and worn during extreme sports,    like skiing and surfing. Just as important,    the camera would take high-quality photos.
That concept turned into the catalyst for Woodman to found GoPro,    which now holds a commanding share of the US video camera market — up to 55% when specialty channel shops are included.
From beads to seed In the beginning,    moving from concept to development was difficult. Woodman and his wife sold bead and shell belts from Bali to raise seed money. Woodman kept the company small,    hiring family members and close friends who shared his passion. He also put in 16-hour days,    sometimes not even sleeping as he perfected the product. When the first camera was ready,    Woodman personally drove to surf shops to demonstrate and sell the camera.
The small company grew steadily. But,    when business really began to pick up,    Woodman recognized he couldn’t do everything himself and sought help from beyond his inner circle. Bringing in outside talent helped transform the business. With a strong executive team in place,    GoPro has rapidly built out its infrastructure,    increasing headcount from 135 employees to more than 400 within the last year.
Becoming a social media icon At its start,    GoPro was primarily a wrist camera for surfers. YouTube changed the equation,    with video quality replacing photo quality as the primary driver of buyer decisions. GoPro met the shift in consumer interests and focused on building outstanding video cameras,    introducing its first high-definition video camera in 2009.
YouTube and social media have also become a powerful marketing channel,    turning GoPro into one of the most engaged brands in social media,    according to Inc.,    as measured by brand audience rate of engagement. GoPro’s passionate fan base of five million customers has racked up 235 million views on the GoPro Network on YouTube. GoPro videos,    like the one of a mountain biker in Africa colliding with a gazelle,    have gone viral to the tune of more than 12 million hits.
GoPro’s popularity on YouTube also confirms that the company is selling more than just cameras — it is also helping customers share meaningful experiences online.

Meet The World's Newest Billionaire, A 36-Year-Old 'Surfer Dude' Named Nicholas Woodman

Nick
  Woodman, CEO and founder of GoPro

GoPro





  Nick Woodman is the 36-year-old founder and CEO of GoPro, a wearable camera produced by
  Woodman Labs that can capture footage for athletes as they whiz
  down a mountain or surf 6-foot waves.

  Last week, Foxconn purchased 8.88 percent of Woodman's
  camera company for $200 million. Forbes learned that 
  Woodman is the majority owner. Even if he owns a minimum of
  51 percent of the company, that means Woodman is now a
  billionaire, worth at least $1.15 billion.

Inc
  interviewed the GoPro founder over the summer. Reporter Tom
  Foster paints a picture of a "total bro" who throws around the
  word "dude" frequently. He's a thrill-seeker and also the
  survivor of a failed dotcom startup.


  Here's his story:

  Woodman was a visual arts major from UC San Diego who started a
  marketing company called funBag in the early 2000s.

A GoPro camera


  He raised outside capital for the operation, and things were
  looking good. Then the tech bubble burst, and Woodman found
  himself failing to save his company and out of a job.

  So in 2002, when he was inspired to try a startup again, he
  decided he'd do whatever he could to bootstrap the operation and
  build something that could be instantly profitable.

  An idea struck him while surfing in Australia and Indonesia for
  five months. Woodman had been frustrated that he couldn't take
  good action shots of himself or his friends while they were
  catching waves. Surfers were using disposable cameras strapped to
  their wrists with a rubber band. It would often fly off in the
  middle of the action and hit them in the face.


  Woodman wanted to invent a strong, adjustable, elastic band that
  could secure a camera to a person's body as they participated in
  an extreme sport.


  To fund the project, Woodman and his now-wife purchased 600 belts
  made of sea shells from a Bali market. Each cost them $1.90. When
  the Woodmans returned to the states, they drove up and down
  California's coast selling the belts for as much as $60 a pop.


  With that money and a $35,000 loan from his mother, Woodman
  created the first GoPro camera straps. It took him 2 years to
  perfect the product. Jill, Woodman's wife, took the position as
  the straps' salesperson. The company's first break came in 2004,
  when a Japanese company ordered 100 items at an action sports
  tradeshow.


  Eventually, Woodman began creating his own cameras and mounts, so
  extreme athletes like racecar drivers could point the cameras
  back on themselves while racing. Enthusiasts began uploading
  videos of their GoPro experiences online, and word spread.


  Now, GoPro's cameras retail for $300 with all sorts of add-ons
  that can be purchased to capture amazing moments in real-time.
  The company has grown to 150 people and Woodman is rolling in
  cash.

Early life and education
Woodman is the son of Concepcion (née Socarras) and Dean Woodman.[4][5][6][7] His father was a Quaker Christian who co-founded the investment bank Robertson Stephens;[4][8] and his mother is of Hispanic descent who in 1992, re-married Irwin Federman, General Partner of U.S. Venture Partners.[5] Woodman grew up in Menlo Park, California[9] and Atherton, California,[10] attending the Menlo School, where he graduated in 1993.[11] He earned a B.A. degree in visual arts and a minor in creative writing from the University of California, San Diego in 1997.[2][10][12] After school he founded a marketing company called funBug but it did not succeed.

Career
While on hiatus in Australia and Indonesia, on a surf trip with more of his fathers money, he used a 35mm camera attached to the palm of his hand by a rubber band to try and capture his surfing activities on film.[12] Seeing that amateur photographers like him - who wanted to capture quality action photos of their activities - had difficulties because either they could not get close enough to the action or were unable to purchase quality equipment at affordable prices, his trip became his inspiration to found GoPro.[12] His solution was to develop a belt that would attach the camera to the body.[12] Woodman and his future wife Jill financed the business by selling shell necklaces they bought in Bali (for $1.90) from their car along the California coast (for $60) is the story they tell people, but the main part of financing for the company came once again from his parents[13] $350,000 borrowed from his mother[12][13] and $200,000  borrowed from his father and all of his fathers business connection he was able to turn . His desire for a camera system that could capture close up footage inspired the 'GoPro' name.[14][15] The original cameras he developed were point-and-shoot 35mm film cameras which mounted to the user's wrist. The product has since evolved into a compact digital camera that supports WiFi, can be remotely controlled, has waterproof housing, records to a micro SD card, and is affordable to the average action sports enthusiast ($200–$400). In 2004, he made his first big sale when a Japanese company ordered 100 cameras at a sports show.[12][13]  Thereafter, sales doubled every year[2] and in 2012, GoPro sold 2.3 million cameras.[12]  In December 2012, the Taiwanese contract manufacturer Foxconn purchased 8.88% of the company for $200 million which set the market value of the company at $2.25 billion making Woodman, who owned the majority of the stock, a billionaire.[12][13]

Awards
2013 National Award Winner of the EY Entrepreneur of the Year Award. [16]

Woodman is married to Jill R. Scully[17] and they have two children.[2][12] They live in Woodside, California.[18] Woodman is known as the "mad billionaire" due to his unconventional behavior and eccentricities.[12]
As of 2014[update], he is worth an estimated US$1.3 billion.[19]
