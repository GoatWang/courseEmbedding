Strategic Alliances
Partnerships are essential to success.


 



The strategic alliance between the Black Mountain Investment Company, Toma Partners Real Estate and the general contractor De Novo Investments forms a stable platform which helps the Black Mountain Investment Company provide investors with reliable returns.

 
 
 


Real Estate Brokerage
One of the competitive advantages of the Black Mountain Investment Company (BMIC) is a strategic alliance with Toma Partners Real Estate.  Normally investment companies must aggressively solicit real estate brokerages for assets and compete for deals.  BMIC saves time and money because Toma Partners sends quality deals exclusively to the company.
Additionally, Toma Partners’ relationships provide investment opportunities which would otherwise be missed.  The alliance between the two companies is strengthened by an ownership stake in Toma Partners, shared leadership, and shared expenses.
Visit www.tomapartners.com for more information.
 
 

General Contractor
Another competitive advantage is the company’s ownership of De Novo Investments (deNovo).  deNovo is a general contractor that specializes in both residential and commercial construction services.  This subsidiary gives BMIC quality construction and asset maintenance.  BMIC also retains all of deNovo’s profit and avoids paying an outside company.
Visit www.denovoconstruction.com for more information.
 
 

The Black Mountain Investment Company
The Black Mountain Investment Company was founded to provide investors with reliable returns.  Historically, BMIC has delivered on this commitment by investing in real property and delivering steadily increasing distributions.  Through Toma Partners and deNovo Investments, the company benefits from exclusive asset acquisition and construction services.

FAQBelow are answers to some commonly asked questions. If you need clarification, please don’t hesitate to call our office at 949-381-7600.What is your close ratio?


Phoenix has a close ratio of 100%. Our team allocates acquisition funds upon verbal approval from the seller (bank). This prefunding process is one of the many elements that ensure we always deliver.

 Where do you get your capital?


Currently all acquisitions are funded using internal capital or fund capital; however, to ensure we continue to meet all future commitments, we’ve formed strategic alliances with several third-party capital sources. These third-party relationships—comprised of high-net-worth individuals, large firms, funds, and wealth management companies—provide Phoenix with the ability to purchase qualified asset(s) of any size at any time.

 What is your acquisition process?


Please see Note Acquisition Process PDF for more detail, but simply put, we discuss the asset with our client, audit and analyze the information they provide, and quickly present an offer. Once a verbal agreement is reached, we reserve funds for a timely closing, and finish any required paperwork. All that being said, we’ve kept our process flexible and work with the seller to meet their needs.

 How fast can you close?


In 2016, we closed on assets in as short as 72 hours. However, we generally consider a “quick close” any acquisition that allows us less than 2 weeks to fund.

 How do you arrive at your offer price?


For debt purchases, we start at the unpaid principal balance and then use our proprietary systems to evaluate any risks associated with the asset, factor in likely future costs, time, etc., and arrive at the highest possible current value for the asset.

 Why are you willing to pay such a high price for a distressed asset?


Beginning his career in environmental remediation, Matt Beck has a unique ability to quantify the cost and timing associated with distressed assets. Armed with this knowledge and a time-tested environmental remediation team, Phoenix is comfortable where others aren’t. Our knowledge reduces our risk; therefore, we offer a higher price.

 How have you built trust?


We have built trust by doing what we said we would do for more than 20 years. We hold to our commitments, provide answers quickly, have open and honest conversations, and always close.

 
About Phoenix Investment FundsWe believe our investment platform makes a positive difference in the lives of individuals, families, and the communities we serve. 





 


OUR STORY
Phoenix specializes in transformation. We chose the name “Phoenix” because it symbolizes our interest in breathing new life (and increased value) into even the most challenged commercial assets. To achieve this goal, two industry leaders, Carson Faris and Matt Beck, combined their diverse skillsets and companies to create Phoenix Investment Funds. Equipped with a deep understanding of the commercial real estate market and how to efficiently remediate environmental issues, the Phoenix team continues to serve the lending community and successfully transform previously distressed assets into useful investment vehicles. Along the way, we’ve created jobs and improved communities.

 








 


OUR FUTURE
