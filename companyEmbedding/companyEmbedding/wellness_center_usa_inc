Through proper interventional and non-interventional protocols, ethical practices, and innovative treatment options, patients from all over the U.S. have seen relief from their pain.www.nationalpaincenters.comPsoria-ShieldPsoriasis, eczema, vitiligo, and alopecia areata are skin disorders that can tremendously negatively impact patients' Quality of Life.Until recently, this impact on Quality of Life was severely underestimated. In fact today, very little exists in the way of tracking the number of individuals with these diseases, both in the United States and worldwide, while far lesser diseases are actively tracked. In recent years, psoriasis awareness has experienced a sharp and welcome boost from a variety of organizations. With that increase in public awareness has come increased funding driving clinical study of various technological and pharmaceutical products. Indeed, pharmaceutical markets for drugs treating psoriasis have grown massively, and are projected to continue growing. Eczema has very recently begun to experience an increase in awareness, though funding and treatment "inertia" have yet to be on pace with that of psoriasis.Psoria-Shield promotes awareness of these diseases, of their impact on Quality of Life, and on the least toxic and most effective treatments.Psoria-Shield advocates the use of targeted UV phototherapy to address those aspects of patients' disease which reduce their Quality of Life the most, first. By addressing the major detractors from patients' Quality of Life initially, patients and healthcare providers can address the remaining regions of skin with less aggressive therapy.For thousands of years, healthcare providers have been "prescribing" sunlight for their patients. In some cases, it was the ultraviolet (UV) portion of that sunlight that was providing the real therapeutic benefit. Not only is UV phototherapy considered a mainstream dermatological treatment, it is also used in internal medicine (e.g. exposing blood to UV light to destroy certain pathogens).Exposing the skin to ultraviolet radiation, either via sunlight or by a medical device, produces several biological reactions. The "suntan" and unfortunately the "sunburn" are very well known effects of exposure to UV light. A sun tan indicates damage to the skin which the body must heal. Over time, suntans and sunburns will cause the skin to look older prematurely. This effect is known as "photo-aging". In some cases, too much exposure to UV light can cause skin cancer.Other effects of exposure to the sun include suppressing the immune system of the skin, stimulating an increase in skin pigmentation, stimulating production of vitamin D, damaging the eyes, and destroying some forms of bacteria, viruses and fungus.UV phototherapy is utilized for the treatment of diseases such as psoriasis, vitiligo, and eczema because UV light suppresses the immune system of the skin involved in disease propagation. UV light can destroy abnormally proliferating skin cells. UV light stimulates melanin production in functional melanocyctes, both in the skin and hair follicles, which increases skin pigmentation for patients with vitiligo.www.psoria-shield.com CNS-WellnessWe recognize that problems in one area of a client's life impact other areas, and so our philosophy is designed to integrate all aspects of functioning.

In fact today, very little exists in the way of tracking the number of individuals with these diseases, both in the United States and worldwide, while far lesser diseases are actively tracked. In recent years, psoriasis awareness has experienced a sharp and welcome boost from a variety of organizations. With that increase in public awareness has come increased funding driving clinical study of various technological and pharmaceutical products. Indeed, pharmaceutical markets for drugs treating psoriasis have grown massively, and are projected to continue growing. Eczema has very recently begun to experience an increase in awareness, though funding and treatment "inertia" have yet to be on pace with that of psoriasis.Psoria-Shield promotes awareness of these diseases, of their impact on Quality of Life, and on the least toxic and most effective treatments.Psoria-Shield advocates the use of targeted UV phototherapy to address those aspects of patients' disease which reduce their Quality of Life the most, first. By addressing the major detractors from patients' Quality of Life initially, patients and healthcare providers can address the remaining regions of skin with less aggressive therapy.For thousands of years, healthcare providers have been "prescribing" sunlight for their patients. In some cases, it was the ultraviolet (UV) portion of that sunlight that was providing the real therapeutic benefit. Not only is UV phototherapy considered a mainstream dermatological treatment, it is also used in internal medicine (e.g. exposing blood to UV light to destroy certain pathogens).Exposing the skin to ultraviolet radiation, either via sunlight or by a medical device, produces several biological reactions. The "suntan" and unfortunately the "sunburn" are very well known effects of exposure to UV light. A sun tan indicates damage to the skin which the body must heal. Over time, suntans and sunburns will cause the skin to look older prematurely. This effect is known as "photo-aging". In some cases, too much exposure to UV light can cause skin cancer.Other effects of exposure to the sun include suppressing the immune system of the skin, stimulating an increase in skin pigmentation, stimulating production of vitamin D, damaging the eyes, and destroying some forms of bacteria, viruses and fungus.UV phototherapy is utilized for the treatment of diseases such as psoriasis, vitiligo, and eczema because UV light suppresses the immune system of the skin involved in disease propagation. UV light can destroy abnormally proliferating skin cells. UV light stimulates melanin production in functional melanocyctes, both in the skin and hair follicles, which increases skin pigmentation for patients with vitiligo.www.psoria-shield.com CNS-WellnessWe recognize that problems in one area of a client's life impact other areas, and so our philosophy is designed to integrate all aspects of functioning.

Btw I looked into the Phillips product and it's not a true competitor to the wcui PSI product. It's a smaller low power home use product which had been available in Europe. The PSI product is high power medical device for doctors and treats many more skin issues.. so no worries here. I really hope the PSI sales continue to grow as that division was almost break even last qtr. I think.they should be profitable soon imo :)

Wellness Center USA Inc. and The Medical Alliance Inc. Create Joint Venture to Produce and Commercialize Psoria-Shield’s Patented LED Technology.
SCHAUMBURG, IL – January 15, 2015 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Wellness Center USA, Inc. (OTCQB: WCUI), today announced that it has entered into a Joint Venture (J V) with The Medical Alliance Inc. (TMA) to produce and commercialize the Psoria-Light, a leading edge medical device developed by WCUI’s wholly owned subsidiary Psoria-Shield, Inc. (PSI). Psoria-Light is the first DEEP UV LED Phototherapy device in the world capable of treating skin diseases such as Psoriasis, Eczema, Vitiligo and more.
According to the terms of the Joint Venture Agreement, the relationship between WCUI and TMA commences immediately. WCUI and TMA have formed an Illinois company, Psoria Development Corp (PDC) to manage the operational side of the business, including; product manufacturing, sales & marketing, customer support & services, and all future research and development of new features and applications. PSI remains a wholly owned subsidiary of WCUI and shall account 100% of sales revenues. WCUI and TMA, the two equal members of the JV will be compensated through sales performance and market value of PSI. 
TMA is an established multi-tiered organization that has substantial experience and expertise in developing, manufacturing, and marketing technological and IP based products. It has vast experience and knowledge with LED‘s, lasers and LED based phototherapy technologies and strong relationships with national manufactures and distributors, domestically and internationally. Consisting of three companies with over 75 years of knowledge, TMA has worked with over 160 clients to deliver integrated consulting services to manufacturers, distributors, and candidates in the medical device, supply, and information technology arenas. Having offices in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, Utica, NY, Coconut Grove, FL and Jacksonville, FL, TMA is closely affiliated with over 120 specialty medical search firms.
“We are comfortable with providing our resources to this project based on our detailed analysis of the technology, our knowledge of manufacturing processes and the market need. We have researched the market and have determined that there is a specific demand for this type of technology and product in the market,” said Mr. John A. Yorke, Managing Director of TMA. “Our collective experience in the field of marketing psoriasis products makes us believe that this product is a winner and should become the standard in the skin treatment markets”, he said.
TMA has committed to provide top-level engineering, scientific and marketing personnel as well as management and resources to this project. It has appointed its associate Mr. Dennis Sleister to supervise the regulatory and manufacturing aspects of the J V. Mr. Sleister founded Surgilase, a leading manufacturer of CO2 surgical lasers, which were based on unique technology acquired from Raytheon for military applications. Surgilase was sold to Safeguard Systems in the 90’s.  When Surgilase was sold, it was listed on INC’s business magazine as one of the fastest growing technology based companies in America.  “We are confident that we will be able to rapidly bring performance to PSI through our J V”, said Mr. Sleister. 
The joint venture projects that it can manufacture and market the Psoria-Light product to begin revenue generation in the second quarter of 2015 and achieve second year revenues of $10M+ with a return of $2M EBITA.  
“High energy outputs, portability, rugged design, reliable performance coupled with ease of use and integrated computer based treatment record keeping, positions this device as the ideal unit for use in treating skin problems. The PSI patented DEEP LED Phototherapy technology has the potential for multiple product applications beyond PSI’s initial medical product for the treatment of psoriasis.  Its unique Light Emitting Diode [LED] powered product, Psoria-Light, has many distinct advantages over other existing photo therapy treatment devices currently available for the treatment of skin diseases ”, said Mr. Yorke, who has been involved in the laser and photonic energy emitting device field since 1987.
Chris Waugh, co–founder of TMA stated, “We feel our personnel and experience are well-suited to the requirements of WCUI and we are delighted and excited to establish this relationship with such a highly respected organization. PSI’s technology has its origin in space age technology provided to the DOD. To “transfer” technology from military applications to the domestic sector requires a specific skill set – which TMA possesses.” “We are privileged to be working with such a high-caliber force in the medical technology sector and excited to begin this endeavor with the help of TMA,” added Mr. Andrew Kandalepas, CEO & Chairman of WCUI.

Wellness Center USA, Inc. Completes Acquisition of Stealth Mark Holdings, Inc.
State-of-the-Art Technology Protects Against Counterfeit Products



















April 09, 2014 07:30 ET

 | Source: Wellness Center USA, Inc.





SCHAUMBURG, Ill., April 9, 2014 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Wellness Center USA, Inc. (OTCQB:WCUI), a healthcare, medical, and security solutions provider, today announced the closing of its asset acquisition of Stealth Mark Holdings, Inc. (SMI). The assets of SMI were acquired by StealthCo, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Wellness Center USA, Inc., for 376,000 shares and 90,505 five-year warrants of WCUI common stock.

	Stealth Mark® is a global product authentication solutions provider that offers the most advanced product security technologies available today within the security and supply chain management vertical sectors. Stealth Mark® provides customers true brand protection from counterfeiting and diversion while maintaining the integrity of product authentication. With this new acquisition, WCUI will offer a complete, simple to use, easy to implement, and cost effective turnkey system that is extremely difficult to compromise. Stealth Mark's intellectual property portfolio is inclusive of numerous patents issued and pending in software, hardware, and manufacturing.

	The need for anti-counterfeit and diversion solutions has never been clearer, as an estimated 5-7% of all goods traded on the global market are counterfeit, resulting in over approximately $900 billion in lost revenues annually. More importantly, in the pharmaceutical and medical device markets, counterfeiting and diversion has led to an estimated loss of $200 billion in revenues. Stealth Mark® has demonstrated its emerging market awareness through encryption and state of the art software products that aim to put an end to counterfeiting and diversion.

	"With the acquisition of Stealth Mark® we are continuing to execute on our strategic approach by placing key components and products within our system that further expand our overall foundation and revenue base. Our acquisition of SMI's technologies allows us a conduit with a swift time to market that enhances our efforts with a state of the art security offering within our medical solutions suite of products," stated Don Swanson, Chief Operating Officer of WCUI and CEO of StealthCo, Inc.

	Stealth Mark® solutions are based upon encrypted microparticle technology, state-of-the-art printing technologies, and a reader that can be used with iPhone and other smartphones.
