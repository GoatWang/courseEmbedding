Pension Issues | Michael J. Newsome for Houston HPOPS Pension Board 
















MICHAEL J. NEWSOME 
 
For Houston Police Officers' Pension Board







Campaign Issues
So many issues face us. Michael Newsome can tackle them and make our Police Pension work for you.
Campaign Issues: Two Different Pension Plans
Pension Reform
Each day you work alongside of officers with two different pension plans.  This year you will hear the candidates for mayor talk about "Pension Reform."  Please pay attention!  Michael Newsome will stand as your pension trustee to be sure we do not have a third pension plan.
Many officers were hired and heard that "One Day" you too will have the same benefits of DROP and minimum years of service to retire.  That first academy class that changed the years of service to retire from 20 years to 25 years ("Plan 2  officers) is slowly approaching retirement.  Michael Newsome asked the pension board in January 2015 to remember the "Plan 2" officers and requested that the pension board consider increasing benefits for Plan Two members.   
Together we are stronger!!
 
                 .....Houston Police Officers' Pension System Board of Trustees Meeting January 8, 2015
 
____________________________________________________________________________________________
Active Officers NOT Voting
You are required to sign your voting ballot.  Many officers think the ballots are being monitored and someone would know who they voted for -  this is not true.  Michael Newsome witnessed the counting of last year's  ballot counting and the signed envelopes are discarded when the ballot is taken out of them.  The problem we have is that out of 8,000 active and retired officers, only around 1,800 vote for pension elections.

Retired Officers - How can you protect your COLA if you do not vote for a candidate that will fight to keep it?  Michael Newsome has been a member of HPROA for seven years, he cares about you.
Plan I Officers -  Please open your ballet and Vote!  This year is very serious.  We can lose benefits such as COLA's, Spouse Retirement at 100%, Insurance Assistance of $150 per month at retirement, $5,000 bonus at retirement, and much more.
Plan 2 Officers - You must vote for a candidate who is concerned about your benefits.  Michael Newsome is very vocal about your benefits.
The Future New Hires - If some politicians could have their way the new hires will not have a pension and have only a 401 retirement plan.  If we let this happen, all members will suffer.

Campaign Issues: State and Local Pension Wars
2015 is a Critical Year
Officers should be aware that 2015 is a critical year for police pensions.  Michael Newsome has been very active by attending our pension monthly meetings and staying abreast of our local pension issues.  This is a daily job currently for Michael Newsome by being your Family Assistance Officer.  Mike has helped hundreds of our families over the last 20 years file for their survivor pension benefits and knows how your survivors need your pension.
