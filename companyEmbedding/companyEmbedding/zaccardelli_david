Cempra Appoints Dr. David Zaccardelli as Acting Chief Executive Officer, Promotes Chief Commercial Officer David Moore to President

   —Leadership changes bolster manufacturing, regulatory and commercial expertise—
—Cempra founder, president and CEO, Dr. Prabhavathi Fernandes, announces retirement from the company and board of directors — CHAPEL HILL, N.C., Dec.  12, 2016  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cempra, Inc. (Nasdaq:CEMP), a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company focused on developing antibiotics to meet critical medical needs in the treatment of bacterial infectious diseases, today announced that the company has appointed board member David Zaccardelli, Pharm.D., 
as acting chief executive officer and has promoted David Moore to the newly created position of president and chief commercial officer, effective immediately. "With manufacturing and regulatory progress to achieve the approval of solithromycin as the company's top priority, we believe Dave Zaccardelli's operational and commercial pharmaceutical leadership experience will add tremendous value and direction to the Cempra team as we continue to work to bring urgently needed new antibiotics to patients," said Garheng Kong, M.D., Ph.D., chairman of Cempra. Dr. Zaccardelli is a seasoned industry leader with more than 25 years of experience including executive management and leadership 
across a wide range of pharmaceutical companies. From 2004 until 2016, Dr. Zaccardelli served in several senior management roles at United Therapeutics, which reported approximately $1.5 billion in revenues in 2015. His roles included chief operating officer, chief manufacturing officer and executive vice president, pharmaceutical development and operations. Prior to joining United Therapeutics, Dr. Zaccardelli founded and led a startup company focused on contract pharmaceutical development services, from 1997 through 2003. From 1988 to 1996, Dr. Zaccardelli worked at Burroughs Wellcome & Co. and Glaxo Wellcome, Inc. in a variety of clinical research positions. He also served as director of clinical and scientific affairs for Bausch & Lomb Pharmaceuticals from 1996 to 1997. "Through my work on the board, I had the 
opportunity to see first-hand the strength of the Cempra team and the value solithromycin may bring to so many patients and physicians in their fight against potentially deadly bacterial infections. I look forward to leading the team through Cempra's potential evolution from a research and development stage company into a commercial pharmaceutical company, and to working closely with David Moore, whose demonstrated leadership and commercial expertise in the antibiotic space will be critical to Cempra," Zaccardelli said. Prior to joining Cempra as chief commercial officer in 2014, Mr. Moore spent 14 years in commercial leadership roles at Johnson & Johnson's Ortho-McNeil and 
Janssen Pharmaceutical divisions, where he developed and executed launch plans for several prescription pharmaceuticals for both primary and acute care settings. He was also responsible for developing payer value platforms for several therapeutic areas including antibiotics, pain and women's health. Following his tenure at Johnson & Johnson, he was chief business officer and vice president of worldwide commercial operations of Tranzyme, Inc., where he was responsible for building the commercial organization, and for business development. Before joining Cempra, he was the chief business officer of Ocera Therapeutics where he was responsible for developing the commercial plans for an orphan-designated advanced liver disease product for both the community and acute care markets. "The potential 
market and unmet need for solithromycin remain significant and we are committed to working closely with regulators, payers and physicians to ensure that patients with community-acquired bacterial pneumonia gain access to solithromycin for a five to seven day course of therapy," Moore said. Dr. Prabha Fernandes, a co-founder of Cempra who has served as president and CEO since the company's inception in 2006, has announced her retirement as president and CEO and from the board of directors, effective immediately, and will continue to serve as a scientific consultant to the company. "We are indebted to Prabha for anticipating the need for new antibiotics in the face of looming resistance. Her dedication and vision as Cempra's CEO over the years have built the strong team 
and foundation that positions Cempra as a pioneer in antibiotic development, and we look forward to her ongoing involvement as a scientific advisor to the company," Kong said. "We founded Cempra with the goal of leading the development of new compounds that stand to address the critical unmet need for new antibiotic options, and it has been a privilege to lead and build Cempra alongside such tremendous colleagues and collaborators. Cempra is working to bring urgently needed new antibiotics, including solithromycin, to patients and physicians and I am excited about the future of the company under the leadership of David 
Zaccardelli and David Moore," Fernandes said. About Cempra, Inc.Cempra, Inc. is a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company focused on developing antibiotics to meet critical medical needs in the treatment of bacterial infectious diseases. Cempra's two lead product candidates are currently in advanced clinical development. Solithromycin has been successfully evaluated in two Phase 3 clinical trials for community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP) and applications for approval for both intravenous and oral capsule formulations have been accepted for review by the FDA and the EMA. Solithromycin is licensed to strategic commercial partner Toyama Chemical Co., Ltd., a subsidiary of FUJIFILM Holdings Corporation, for certain exclusive rights in Japan. Solithromycin is also in a Phase 3 clinical trial for uncomplicated urogenital urethritis caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae or chlamydia. Cempra is contracted with BARDA for the development of solithromycin for pediatric use and has commenced enrollment in a global Phase 2/3 trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of solithromycin versus standard of care antibiotics in children and adolescents from two months to 17 years of age. Fusidic acid is Cempra's second product candidate, which has completed enrollment of an initial Phase 3 trial comparing fusidic acid to linezolid in patients 
with acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI). Cempra also has an ongoing exploratory study of fusidic acid for chronic oral treatment of refractory infections in bones and joints. Both products seek to address the need for new treatments targeting drug-resistant bacterial infections in the hospital and in the community. Cempra has also synthesized novel macrolides for non-antibiotic uses such as the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases, endocrine diseases and gastric motility disorders.

United Therapeutics Corporation Announces Executive Promotions and CEO Compensation Change
Roger Jeffs, Ph.D. named President and Co-Chief Executive OfficerDavid Zaccardelli, Pharm.D. named Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer


SILVER SPRING, Md., Dec. 17, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- United Therapeutics Corporation (NASDAQ: UTHR) announced today two senior executive promotions as well as changes to Martine Rothblatt, Ph.D's compensation program.
Senior Executive Promotions
United Therapeutics announced the promotion of Roger Jeffs, Ph.D. to President and Co-Chief Executive Officer and David Zaccardelli, Pharm.D. to Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer.  In connection with these promotions, Dr. Rothblatt's title will change from Chairman and Chief Executive Officer to Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer.  As Chairman of the Board and Co-Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Rothblatt will continue to serve as the principal executive officer of the company.  These title changes will become effective January 1, 2015.
"Dr. Jeffs and Dr. Zaccardelli have made indispensable contributions to United Therapeutics, each demonstrating stellar leadership skills and strategic vision, most recently leading to FDA approval of Orenitram® (treprostinil) Extended-Release Tablets," said Dr. Rothblatt.  "We are pleased that our board has approved these promotions, which recognize their accomplishments and importance to the future of United Therapeutics. I look forward to continuing to work with Roger and Dave as we grow sales of our existing product franchise and bring new and innovative products to market."
"The Board of Directors is very pleased to approve this unique organizational structure proposed by Dr. Rothblatt," said Christopher Patusky, Lead Independent Director and Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors.  "Dr. Jeffs and Dr. Zaccardelli have made immense contributions to the company and are deserving of these promotions. We are also very excited that Dr. Rothblatt will continue as our visionary and strategic leader - a role at which she has been incredibly successful since the company's inception."
Dr. Jeffs joined United Therapeutics in 1998 and currently serves as the company's President and Chief Operating Officer, a position he has held since 2001.  He has also served as a member of the United Therapeutics Board of Directors since 2002, a position he will continue to hold following his promotion.  Additional details about Dr. Jeffs' experience are available in the company's proxy statement filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on April 30, 2014.
Dr. Zaccardelli currently serves as Chief Manufacturing Officer and EVP, Pharmaceutical Development, a position he has held since 2008. Dr. Zaccardelli joined United Therapeutics in 2004 as Vice President, Pharmaceutical Development.  Additional details about Dr. Zaccardelli's experience are available in the company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on December 17, 2014. 
CEO Compensation Change
United Therapeutics has reached agreement with Dr. Rothblatt to alter her compensation structure in response to the company's "Say on Pay" vote at its 2014 annual meeting of shareholders.  Effective January 1, 2015, Dr. Rothblatt has agreed to amend her employment agreement to eliminate the requirement that United Therapeutics award to her an annual grant of fully-vested stock options, capped at one million shares per year, based upon a formula tied only to the growth of the company's market capitalization.  In lieu of this contractual entitlement, which has been in place since prior to United Therapeutics' initial public offering fifteen years ago, the Compensation Committee 
has established for Dr. Rothblatt a discretionary, long-term incentive opportunity of up to 300,000 cash-settled share tracking awards for 2015, reflecting a 70% reduction in her annual long-term equity incentive opportunity.  The size of the award will be based on certain company-wide performance measures, and the award will be subject to a four-year vesting schedule.   
"The Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors takes the non-binding advisory vote from our shareholders seriously," said Christopher Causey, Chairman of the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors.  "Based on discussions with large shareholders, we believe this new structure will address their concerns.  We are most appreciative of the flexibility Dr. Rothblatt has demonstrated through this process.  It is unusual for an executive to voluntarily waive the right to a contractually bargained-for benefit, but once again, she has demonstrated exceptional leadership on this issue."  
"As Chairman of the Board of Directors, I share our owners' concerns," said Dr. Rothblatt.  "I am pleased that we have been able to so quickly agree on a new incentive compensation structure going forward." 
About United Therapeutics
United Therapeutics Corporation is a biotechnology company focused on the development and commercialization of unique products to address the unmet medical needs of patients with chronic and life-threatening conditions.  [uthr-g]

Commission, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K, which could cause actual results to differ materially from anticipated results.

About Solithromycin

                                        








Solithromycin is a highly potent next-generation macrolide, the first fluoroketolide, which has potent activity against most macrolide-resistant strains. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown potent activity against S. pneumoniae as well as an extended spectrum of activity against community-acquired methicillin resistant S. aureus (CA-MRSA), streptococci, haemophilus, enterococci, Mycobacterium avium and in animal models of malaria. It is also active against atypical bacteria, such as legionella, chlamydia, mycoplasma and ureaplasma, and against gonococci and other organisms that cause genitourinary tract infections. It is 8-16 times more potent than azithromycin against many bacteria and is active against azithromycin-resistant strains. Solithromycin's activity against resistant strains is driven by its ability to interact with three sites on the bacterial ribosome, compared to one for current macrolides. The binding to bacterial ribosomes and interaction with three ribosomal sites is expected to limit the development of bacterial resistance to solithromycin.


                                        








About Community-Acquired Bacterial Pneumonia        

 Community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP) is the number one cause of death from an infection, particularly in the very young and in the elderly. CABP is one of the most commonly diagnosed bacterial infections in the U.S. resulting in 5 to 10 million cases per year. Although many strains of the primary CABP pathogen, Streptococcus pneumoniae, are resistant to currently-approved macrolides, this class of antibiotic remains among the most commonly prescribed antibacterial drugs for CABP in both the hospital and community settings. Due to the rising threat of microbial resistance, along with concerns over antibiotic tolerability and impact on intestinal microflora, new CABP treatments are needed. Antibiotic resistance is a complex, emerging problem globally with potentially devastating consequences for public health.

Cempra, Inc. is a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company focused on developing antibiotics to meet critical medical needs in the treatment of bacterial infectious diseases. Cempra's two lead product candidates are currently in advanced clinical development. Solithera(TM) (solithromycin, CEM-101) has successfully completed two Phase 3 clinical trials for community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP) and new drug applications for both intravenous and oral capsule formulations have been accepted for review by the FDA. Additionally, a Marketing Authorization Application has been submitted to the EMA. Solithromycin is licensed to strategic commercial partner Toyama Chemical Co., Ltd., a subsidiary of FUJIFILM Holdings Corporation, for certain exclusive rights in Japan. Solithromycin is also in a Phase 3 clinical trial for uncomplicated urogenital urethritis caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae or chlamydia. Cempra is contracted with BARDA for the development of solithromycin for pediatric use. Three formulations, intravenous, oral capsules and a suspension formulation are in a Phase 1b trial in children from birth to 17 years of age. Taksta(TM) is Cempra's second product candidate, which is being developed for acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) and is also in an exploratory study for chronic oral treatment of refractory infections in bones and joints. Both products seek to address the need for new treatments targeting drug-resistant bacterial infections in the hospital and in the community. Cempra has also synthesized novel macrolides for non-antibiotic uses such as the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases, endocrine diseases and gastric motility disorders. Cempra was founded in 2006 and is headquartered in Chapel Hill, N.C. For additional information about Cempra please visit         www.cempra.com
