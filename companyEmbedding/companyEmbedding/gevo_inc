Gevo, Inc. is a renewable chemicals and advanced biofuels company headquartered in unincorporated Douglas County, Colorado in the Denver-Aurora metropolitan area. The company develops bio-based alternatives to petroleum-based products using a combination of biotechnology and classical chemistry. Gevo converts renewable raw materials into isobutanol and renewable hydrocarbons that Gevo believes can be directly integrated on a “drop in” basis into existing fuel and chemical products.[1] Gevo’s investors include Burrill & Company, Khosla Ventures, Lanxess, Osage University Partners, Total, and Virgin Green Fund, among others.

Economics of isobutanol production[edit]
Isobutanol is a four-carbon (C
4) alcohol that can be directly used as a specialty chemical or a value-added fuel blendstock.[2] It can also be converted into butenes, using simple dehydration chemistry deployed in the refining and petrochemicals industries today. Butenes are primary hydrocarbon feedstocks that are used in the production of plastics, fibers, rubber, other polymers and hydrocarbon fuels.
Isobutanol produced from renewable raw materials may be a competitively priced alternative source of C
4 hydrocarbons for the petrochemical and refining industries. Over the last decade, fermentable sugars had lower cost volatility than petroleum, which is important to industrial C
4 consumers who are seeking less volatile sources that might be used to hedge equivalent petroleum-derived materials. Isobutanol and its derivatives have potential applications in approximately 40 percent of the global petrochemicals market. Manufacturers can replace petroleum-derived raw materials with isobutanol-derived raw materials without modification to their equipment or production processes. Additionally, the final products produced from isobutanol-based raw materials are chemically equivalent to those produced from petroleum-based raw materials and may help reduce the time to market adoption.[3]
Technology, engineering and production[edit]
Gevo has developed technology to retrofit existing ethanol production plants to produce isobutanol. Gevo’s Integrated Fermentation Technology, or GIFT,[4] is an integrated technology platform for the efficient production and separation of isobutanol. GIFT consists of two components, proprietary biocatalysts that convert sugars derived from multiple renewable feedstocks into isobutanol through fermentation, and a proprietary separation unit that is designed to continuously separate isobutanol from water during the fermentation process. Gevo developed its technology platform to be compatible with the existing approximately 20 BGPY (Billion Gallons per Year) of global operating ethanol production capacity, as estimated by the Renewable Fuels Association. GIFT is designed to allow relatively low capital expenditure retrofits of existing ethanol facilities, enabling a rapid and cost-efficient route to isobutanol production from the fermentation of renewable feedstocks.[5] Gevo is also developing biocatalysts to convert sugars derived from biomass to produce cellulosic isobutanol once the conversion technology is commercially viable. Gevo plans to expand its production capacity beyond its initial commercial facility to produce and sell over 500 million gallons of isobutanol by 2014.

Demonstration facility in St. Joseph: Gevo’s production process was demonstrated in September 2009 on a commercially relevant scale with the retrofit of ICM’s 1 MGPY(Million Gallons per Year) ethanol facility in St. Joseph, Missouri.[6] This demonstration project illustrates that Gevo’s model for repurposing ethanol plants for scalable production of isobutanol can be accomplished rapidly and with a low up-front capital investment.
First commercial production facility: In September 2010, Gevo acquired ownership of a 22 MGPY ethanol production facility in Luverne, Minnesota.[7] Gevo anticipates beginning its retrofit of the Luverne facility in the fourth quarter of 2010. Commercial production of isobutanol is expected to begin at the Luverne facility in the first half of 2012.[8]

Target markets[edit]
Most of the technology necessary to convert isobutanol into plastics, fibers, rubber, other polymers and hydrocarbon fuels is known and practiced in the chemicals industry today. Gevo’s commercialization efforts are focused on the following markets:

Isobutanol — Without any modification, isobutanol has applications as a specialty chemical and a fuel blendstock. In the fuel blendstock market, isobutanol can be used to replace high-value blendstocks, such as alkylate, and can be blended in conjunction with, or as a substitute for, ethanol and other widely used fuel oxygenates.[9] In November 2010, Gevo became the first company to receive EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) certification for isobutanol as a fuel blendstock after meeting the EPA’s standards under the Clean Air Act.[10] The global gasoline oxygenate market is approximately 40 BGPY, based upon data from the International Energy Agency (IEA). While isobutanol can be used as a replacement for ethanol, its product properties are significantly differentiated from ethanol. As a gasoline blendstock, isobutanol’s low Reid Vapor Pressure (RVP), high energy content and low water solubility compared to ethanol make it a valuable product that can be sold directly to refiners and is compatible with existing engine and industry infrastructure, including pipeline assets. Isobutanol can also be sold for immediate use as a specialty solvent. This global market for butanol represents approximately 1.1 BGPY, based upon volume data from SRI.
Plastics, Fibers, Rubber and other Polymers — Isobutanol can be converted into a wide variety of hydrocarbons that form the basis for the production of many products, including rubber, lubricants, additives, methyl methacrylate, polypropylenes, polyesters, and polystyrene, representing an aggregate potential market for isobutanol of approximately 67 BGPY, based upon volume data from SRI, CMAI and Nexant.
Hydrocarbon Fuels — Alternatively, the hydrocarbons that can be produced from isobutanol can be used to manufacture jet and diesel fuel, as well as other hydrocarbon fuels. The hydrocarbon fuels that can be produced from isobutanol collectively represent a potential market for isobutanol of over 900 BGPY, based upon volume data from IEA.

Gevo, Inc. is a renewable chemicals and advanced biofuels company headquartered in unincorporated Douglas County, Colorado in the Denver-Aurora metropolitan area. The company develops bio-based alternatives to petroleum-based products using a combination of biotechnology and classical chemistry. Gevo converts renewable raw materials into isobutanol and renewable hydrocarbons that Gevo believes can be directly integrated on a “drop in” basis into existing fuel and chemical products.[1] Gevo’s investors include Burrill & Company, Khosla Ventures, Lanxess, Osage University Partners, Total, and Virgin Green Fund, among others.

Economics of isobutanol production[edit]
Isobutanol is a four-carbon (C
4) alcohol that can be directly used as a specialty chemical or a value-added fuel blendstock.[2] It can also be converted into butenes, using simple dehydration chemistry deployed in the refining and petrochemicals industries today. Butenes are primary hydrocarbon feedstocks that are used in the production of plastics, fibers, rubber, other polymers and hydrocarbon fuels.
Isobutanol produced from renewable raw materials may be a competitively priced alternative source of C
4 hydrocarbons for the petrochemical and refining industries. Over the last decade, fermentable sugars had lower cost volatility than petroleum, which is important to industrial C
4 consumers who are seeking less volatile sources that might be used to hedge equivalent petroleum-derived materials. Isobutanol and its derivatives have potential applications in approximately 40 percent of the global petrochemicals market. Manufacturers can replace petroleum-derived raw materials with isobutanol-derived raw materials without modification to their equipment or production processes. Additionally, the final products produced from isobutanol-based raw materials are chemically equivalent to those produced from petroleum-based raw materials and may help reduce the time to market adoption.[3]
Technology, engineering and production[edit]
Gevo has developed technology to retrofit existing ethanol production plants to produce isobutanol. Gevo’s Integrated Fermentation Technology, or GIFT,[4] is an integrated technology platform for the efficient production and separation of isobutanol. GIFT consists of two components, proprietary biocatalysts that convert sugars derived from multiple renewable feedstocks into isobutanol through fermentation, and a proprietary separation unit that is designed to continuously separate isobutanol from water during the fermentation process. Gevo developed its technology platform to be compatible with the existing approximately 20 BGPY (Billion Gallons per Year) of global operating ethanol production capacity, as estimated by the Renewable Fuels Association. GIFT is designed to allow relatively low capital expenditure retrofits of existing ethanol facilities, enabling a rapid and cost-efficient route to isobutanol production from the fermentation of renewable feedstocks.[5] Gevo is also developing biocatalysts to convert sugars derived from biomass to produce cellulosic isobutanol once the conversion technology is commercially viable. Gevo plans to expand its production capacity beyond its initial commercial facility to produce and sell over 500 million gallons of isobutanol by 2014.

Demonstration facility in St. Joseph: Gevo’s production process was demonstrated in September 2009 on a commercially relevant scale with the retrofit of ICM’s 1 MGPY(Million Gallons per Year) ethanol facility in St. Joseph, Missouri.[6] This demonstration project illustrates that Gevo’s model for repurposing ethanol plants for scalable production of isobutanol can be accomplished rapidly and with a low up-front capital investment.
First commercial production facility: In September 2010, Gevo acquired ownership of a 22 MGPY ethanol production facility in Luverne, Minnesota.[7] Gevo anticipates beginning its retrofit of the Luverne facility in the fourth quarter of 2010. Commercial production of isobutanol is expected to begin at the Luverne facility in the first half of 2012.[8]

Target markets[edit]
Most of the technology necessary to convert isobutanol into plastics, fibers, rubber, other polymers and hydrocarbon fuels is known and practiced in the chemicals industry today. Gevo’s commercialization efforts are focused on the following markets:

Isobutanol — Without any modification, isobutanol has applications as a specialty chemical and a fuel blendstock. In the fuel blendstock market, isobutanol can be used to replace high-value blendstocks, such as alkylate, and can be blended in conjunction with, or as a substitute for, ethanol and other widely used fuel oxygenates.[9] In November 2010, Gevo became the first company to receive EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) certification for isobutanol as a fuel blendstock after meeting the EPA’s standards under the Clean Air Act.[10] The global gasoline oxygenate market is approximately 40 BGPY, based upon data from the International Energy Agency (IEA). While isobutanol can be used as a replacement for ethanol, its product properties are significantly differentiated from ethanol. As a gasoline blendstock, isobutanol’s low Reid Vapor Pressure (RVP), high energy content and low water solubility compared to ethanol make it a valuable product that can be sold directly to refiners and is compatible with existing engine and industry infrastructure, including pipeline assets. Isobutanol can also be sold for immediate use as a specialty solvent. This global market for butanol represents approximately 1.1 BGPY, based upon volume data from SRI.
Plastics, Fibers, Rubber and other Polymers — Isobutanol can be converted into a wide variety of hydrocarbons that form the basis for the production of many products, including rubber, lubricants, additives, methyl methacrylate, polypropylenes, polyesters, and polystyrene, representing an aggregate potential market for isobutanol of approximately 67 BGPY, based upon volume data from SRI, CMAI and Nexant.
Hydrocarbon Fuels — Alternatively, the hydrocarbons that can be produced from isobutanol can be used to manufacture jet and diesel fuel, as well as other hydrocarbon fuels. The hydrocarbon fuels that can be produced from isobutanol collectively represent a potential market for isobutanol of over 900 BGPY, based upon volume data from IEA.

Gevo, Inc. is a renewable chemicals and advanced biofuels company headquartered in unincorporated Douglas County, Colorado in the Denver-Aurora metropolitan area. The company develops bio-based alternatives to petroleum-based products using a combination of biotechnology and classical chemistry. Gevo converts renewable raw materials into isobutanol and renewable hydrocarbons that Gevo believes can be directly integrated on a “drop in” basis into existing fuel and chemical products.[1] Gevo’s investors include Burrill & Company, Khosla Ventures, Lanxess, Osage University Partners, Total, and Virgin Green Fund, among others.

Economics of isobutanol production[edit]
Isobutanol is a four-carbon (C
4) alcohol that can be directly used as a specialty chemical or a value-added fuel blendstock.[2] It can also be converted into butenes, using simple dehydration chemistry deployed in the refining and petrochemicals industries today. Butenes are primary hydrocarbon feedstocks that are used in the production of plastics, fibers, rubber, other polymers and hydrocarbon fuels.
Isobutanol produced from renewable raw materials may be a competitively priced alternative source of C
4 hydrocarbons for the petrochemical and refining industries. Over the last decade, fermentable sugars had lower cost volatility than petroleum, which is important to industrial C
4 consumers who are seeking less volatile sources that might be used to hedge equivalent petroleum-derived materials. Isobutanol and its derivatives have potential applications in approximately 40 percent of the global petrochemicals market. Manufacturers can replace petroleum-derived raw materials with isobutanol-derived raw materials without modification to their equipment or production processes. Additionally, the final products produced from isobutanol-based raw materials are chemically equivalent to those produced from petroleum-based raw materials and may help reduce the time to market adoption.[3]
Technology, engineering and production[edit]
Gevo has developed technology to retrofit existing ethanol production plants to produce isobutanol. Gevo’s Integrated Fermentation Technology, or GIFT,[4] is an integrated technology platform for the efficient production and separation of isobutanol. GIFT consists of two components, proprietary biocatalysts that convert sugars derived from multiple renewable feedstocks into isobutanol through fermentation, and a proprietary separation unit that is designed to continuously separate isobutanol from water during the fermentation process. Gevo developed its technology platform to be compatible with the existing approximately 20 BGPY (Billion Gallons per Year) of global operating ethanol production capacity, as estimated by the Renewable Fuels Association. GIFT is designed to allow relatively low capital expenditure retrofits of existing ethanol facilities, enabling a rapid and cost-efficient route to isobutanol production from the fermentation of renewable feedstocks.[5] Gevo is also developing biocatalysts to convert sugars derived from biomass to produce cellulosic isobutanol once the conversion technology is commercially viable. Gevo plans to expand its production capacity beyond its initial commercial facility to produce and sell over 500 million gallons of isobutanol by 2014.

Demonstration facility in St. Joseph: Gevo’s production process was demonstrated in September 2009 on a commercially relevant scale with the retrofit of ICM’s 1 MGPY(Million Gallons per Year) ethanol facility in St. Joseph, Missouri.[6] This demonstration project illustrates that Gevo’s model for repurposing ethanol plants for scalable production of isobutanol can be accomplished rapidly and with a low up-front capital investment.
First commercial production facility: In September 2010, Gevo acquired ownership of a 22 MGPY ethanol production facility in Luverne, Minnesota.[7] Gevo anticipates beginning its retrofit of the Luverne facility in the fourth quarter of 2010. Commercial production of isobutanol is expected to begin at the Luverne facility in the first half of 2012.[8]

Target markets[edit]
Most of the technology necessary to convert isobutanol into plastics, fibers, rubber, other polymers and hydrocarbon fuels is known and practiced in the chemicals industry today. Gevo’s commercialization efforts are focused on the following markets:

Isobutanol — Without any modification, isobutanol has applications as a specialty chemical and a fuel blendstock. In the fuel blendstock market, isobutanol can be used to replace high-value blendstocks, such as alkylate, and can be blended in conjunction with, or as a substitute for, ethanol and other widely used fuel oxygenates.[9] In November 2010, Gevo became the first company to receive EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) certification for isobutanol as a fuel blendstock after meeting the EPA’s standards under the Clean Air Act.[10] The global gasoline oxygenate market is approximately 40 BGPY, based upon data from the International Energy Agency (IEA). While isobutanol can be used as a replacement for ethanol, its product properties are significantly differentiated from ethanol. As a gasoline blendstock, isobutanol’s low Reid Vapor Pressure (RVP), high energy content and low water solubility compared to ethanol make it a valuable product that can be sold directly to refiners and is compatible with existing engine and industry infrastructure, including pipeline assets. Isobutanol can also be sold for immediate use as a specialty solvent. This global market for butanol represents approximately 1.1 BGPY, based upon volume data from SRI.
Plastics, Fibers, Rubber and other Polymers — Isobutanol can be converted into a wide variety of hydrocarbons that form the basis for the production of many products, including rubber, lubricants, additives, methyl methacrylate, polypropylenes, polyesters, and polystyrene, representing an aggregate potential market for isobutanol of approximately 67 BGPY, based upon volume data from SRI, CMAI and Nexant.
Hydrocarbon Fuels — Alternatively, the hydrocarbons that can be produced from isobutanol can be used to manufacture jet and diesel fuel, as well as other hydrocarbon fuels. The hydrocarbon fuels that can be produced from isobutanol collectively represent a potential market for isobutanol of over 900 BGPY, based upon volume data from IEA.

					Full Description



Gevo, Inc. (Gevo), incorporated on June 9, 2005, is a renewable chemicals and next generation biofuels company. The Company has developed a technology that uses a combination of synthetic biology, metabolic engineering, chemistry and chemical engineering to focus primarily on the production of isobutanol, as well as related products from renewable feedstock. It has two operating segments: the Gevo, Inc. segment and the Gevo Development/Agri-Energy segment. Its Gevo, Inc. segment is responsible for research and development activities related to the future production of isobutanol, including the development of its biocatalysts, the production and sale of biojet fuel, its Retrofit process and the next generation of chemicals and biofuels that will be based on its isobutanol technology. Its Gevo, Inc. segment also develops, maintains and protects its intellectual property portfolio, develops future markets for its isobutanol and provides corporate oversight services. Its Gevo Development/Agri-Energy segment is responsible for the operation of its Agri-Energy Facility and the production of ethanol, isobutanol and related products.The Company has developed the Gevo Integrated Fermentation Technology (GIFT), an integrated technology platform for the production and separation of renewable isobutanol in order to produce and sell isobutanol made from renewable sources. GIFT consists of two components: biocatalysts that convert sugars derived from multiple renewable feed stocks into isobutanol through fermentation and a separation unit that is designed to continuously separate isobutanol during the fermentation process. GIFT is designed to permit the retrofit of existing ethanol capacity to produce isobutanol, ethanol or both products simultaneously or the addition of renewable isobutanol or ethanol production capabilities to a facility's existing ethanol production by adding additional fermentation capacity side-by-side with the facility's existing ethanol fermentation capacity (collectively referred to as Retrofit). Just like ethanol production, after fermentation, a primary product (isobutanol) and a co-product (iDGs) are recovered for sale. The main modifications of the GIFT system are replacing the ethanol producing yeast with Gevo's isobutanol producing biocatalyst, and adding low temperature distillation equipment for continuous removal and separation of isobutanol. The Company has also developed new technologies using ethanol as a feedstock for the production of hydrocarbons, renewable hydrogen, and other chemical intermediates, which it describes as its ethanol-to-olefins (ETO) technologies. The process produces tailored mixes of isobutylene, propylene, hydrogen and acetone, which are used as standalone molecules, or as feedstocks to produce other chemical products and longer chain alcohols. At this time, this technology has only been operated at a laboratory scale.The Company competes with Butamax Advanced Biofuels LLC, Cathay Industrial Biotech Ltd., METabolic EXplorer S.A., Eastman Chemicals Company, Green Biologics Ltd., Shell Oil Company, DuPont-Danisco Cellulosic Ethanol LLC, Abengoa Bioenergy, S.A., POET, LLC, ICM, Mascoma Corporation, Inbicon A/S, INEOS New Planet BioEnergy LLC, Coskata, Inc., Archer Daniels Midland Company, BlueFire Ethanol, Inc., IncZeaChem Inc., ZeaChem Inc., Iogen Corporation, Qteros, Inc., Global Bioenergies, S.A., Virent Energy Systems, Inc., Renewable Energy Group, Inc., Amyris Biotechnologies, Inc. and Valero Energy Corporation.

Gevo, Inc. is a renewable chemicals and advanced biofuels company headquartered in unincorporated Douglas County, Colorado in the Denver-Aurora metropolitan area. The company develops bio-based alternatives to petroleum-based products using a combination of biotechnology and classical chemistry. Gevo converts renewable raw materials into isobutanol and renewable hydrocarbons that Gevo believes can be directly integrated on a “drop in” basis into existing fuel and chemical products.[1] Gevo’s investors include Burrill & Company, Khosla Ventures, Lanxess, Osage University Partners, Total, and Virgin Green Fund, among others.

Economics of isobutanol production[edit]
Isobutanol is a four-carbon (C
4) alcohol that can be directly used as a specialty chemical or a value-added fuel blendstock.[2] It can also be converted into butenes, using simple dehydration chemistry deployed in the refining and petrochemicals industries today. Butenes are primary hydrocarbon feedstocks that are used in the production of plastics, fibers, rubber, other polymers and hydrocarbon fuels.
Isobutanol produced from renewable raw materials may be a competitively priced alternative source of C
4 hydrocarbons for the petrochemical and refining industries. Over the last decade, fermentable sugars had lower cost volatility than petroleum, which is important to industrial C
4 consumers who are seeking less volatile sources that might be used to hedge equivalent petroleum-derived materials. Isobutanol and its derivatives have potential applications in approximately 40 percent of the global petrochemicals market. Manufacturers can replace petroleum-derived raw materials with isobutanol-derived raw materials without modification to their equipment or production processes. Additionally, the final products produced from isobutanol-based raw materials are chemically equivalent to those produced from petroleum-based raw materials and may help reduce the time to market adoption.[3]
Technology, engineering and production[edit]
Gevo has developed technology to retrofit existing ethanol production plants to produce isobutanol. Gevo’s Integrated Fermentation Technology, or GIFT,[4] is an integrated technology platform for the efficient production and separation of isobutanol. GIFT consists of two components, proprietary biocatalysts that convert sugars derived from multiple renewable feedstocks into isobutanol through fermentation, and a proprietary separation unit that is designed to continuously separate isobutanol from water during the fermentation process. Gevo developed its technology platform to be compatible with the existing approximately 20 BGPY (Billion Gallons per Year) of global operating ethanol production capacity, as estimated by the Renewable Fuels Association. GIFT is designed to allow relatively low capital expenditure retrofits of existing ethanol facilities, enabling a rapid and cost-efficient route to isobutanol production from the fermentation of renewable feedstocks.[5] Gevo is also developing biocatalysts to convert sugars derived from biomass to produce cellulosic isobutanol once the conversion technology is commercially viable. Gevo plans to expand its production capacity beyond its initial commercial facility to produce and sell over 500 million gallons of isobutanol by 2014.

Demonstration facility in St. Joseph: Gevo’s production process was demonstrated in September 2009 on a commercially relevant scale with the retrofit of ICM’s 1 MGPY(Million Gallons per Year) ethanol facility in St. Joseph, Missouri.[6] This demonstration project illustrates that Gevo’s model for repurposing ethanol plants for scalable production of isobutanol can be accomplished rapidly and with a low up-front capital investment.
First commercial production facility: In September 2010, Gevo acquired ownership of a 22 MGPY ethanol production facility in Luverne, Minnesota.[7] Gevo anticipates beginning its retrofit of the Luverne facility in the fourth quarter of 2010. Commercial production of isobutanol is expected to begin at the Luverne facility in the first half of 2012.[8]

Target markets[edit]
Most of the technology necessary to convert isobutanol into plastics, fibers, rubber, other polymers and hydrocarbon fuels is known and practiced in the chemicals industry today. Gevo’s commercialization efforts are focused on the following markets:

Isobutanol — Without any modification, isobutanol has applications as a specialty chemical and a fuel blendstock. In the fuel blendstock market, isobutanol can be used to replace high-value blendstocks, such as alkylate, and can be blended in conjunction with, or as a substitute for, ethanol and other widely used fuel oxygenates.[9] In November 2010, Gevo became the first company to receive EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) certification for isobutanol as a fuel blendstock after meeting the EPA’s standards under the Clean Air Act.[10] The global gasoline oxygenate market is approximately 40 BGPY, based upon data from the International Energy Agency (IEA). While isobutanol can be used as a replacement for ethanol, its product properties are significantly differentiated from ethanol. As a gasoline blendstock, isobutanol’s low Reid Vapor Pressure (RVP), high energy content and low water solubility compared to ethanol make it a valuable product that can be sold directly to refiners and is compatible with existing engine and industry infrastructure, including pipeline assets. Isobutanol can also be sold for immediate use as a specialty solvent. This global market for butanol represents approximately 1.1 BGPY, based upon volume data from SRI.
Plastics, Fibers, Rubber and other Polymers — Isobutanol can be converted into a wide variety of hydrocarbons that form the basis for the production of many products, including rubber, lubricants, additives, methyl methacrylate, polypropylenes, polyesters, and polystyrene, representing an aggregate potential market for isobutanol of approximately 67 BGPY, based upon volume data from SRI, CMAI and Nexant.
Hydrocarbon Fuels — Alternatively, the hydrocarbons that can be produced from isobutanol can be used to manufacture jet and diesel fuel, as well as other hydrocarbon fuels. The hydrocarbon fuels that can be produced from isobutanol collectively represent a potential market for isobutanol of over 900 BGPY, based upon volume data from IEA.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Gevo, Inc. (NASDAQ:GEVO) Announces New Product 

 

0000Gevo, Inc. (NASDAQ:GEVO)
Gevo, Inc. (NASDAQ:GEVO) shares were off slightly (-3.4%) after the company jointly announced that Gevo’s proprietary isobutanol technology will now be available for licensing to processors of sugar cane juice and molasses. This announcement came after Praj Industries Ltd’s development work, adapting Gevo, Inc. (NASDAQ:GEVO)’s technology to sugar cane and molasses feedstocks.
Two month Daily Candle Graph $GEVO
In the first phase of development, Praj Industries worked with Gevo’s technology using sugar cane and molasses feedstocks, undertaking test-runs to create a commercialized process to juice cane and molasses-based ethanol plants, as licensees of Gevo’s isobutanol technology. Licensing is expected to be focused on Praj plants located in India, South America and South-East Asia, with initial capacity targeted to come on-line between 2019 and 2020.
Pramod Chaudhari, Executive Chairman, Praj, stated, “We are excited to offer this technology to our global customers who stand to benefit from an additional revenue stream from isobutanol. Praj has worked on 750 projects for ethanol plants across 75 countries. This isobutanol platform can be offered as ‘bolt-on’ to an existing ethanol plant or as a greenfield plant. This isobutanol technology is the latest addition to Praj’s diverse product portfolio and reinforces our organization’s leadership in the bioenergy space.”
Isobutanol has several direct applications as a gasoline blendstock or as a specialty chemical solvent, or it can be used as Gevo’s alcohol-to-jet fuel (ATJ) and isooctane. In comparison to other renewable jet fuels, Gevo’s ATJ has the potential to offer the optimal solution in terms of operating cost, capital cost, feedstock availability and scalability.

Why Shares of Gevo, Inc. (NASDAQ:GEVO) Rallied 

 

0100Gevo, Inc. (NASDAQ:GEVO)
Gevo, Inc. (NASDAQ:GEVO) shares rallied by 17.8% after the Chief Executive Officer, Pat Gruber, reaffirmed the company’s growth prospects amidst a changing government landscape and policy initiatives. The executive has also quashed concerns that recent events at the Department of Energy could have a catastrophic impact on the company and the broader BioEconomy.
Daily Candle Bar Graph for $GEVO
Luverne Plant Capacity
According to the executive, improving the production capacity of the Luverne plant is a core objective, as focus shifts to targeting the jet fuel, isooctane/renewable gasoline, and isobutanol markets. The CEO expects the efforts to help the company generate a good amount of profit even as the overall industry continues to face uncertainty.
The company is fresh from signing a binding agreement with a 140-year-old Germany company as part of an effort that seeks to strengthen operations on specialty chemicals and fuel products. Gevo, Inc. (NASDAQ:GEVO) is also working on a number of deals to meet the 50% production capacity at the Luverne Plant.
Gevo, Inc. (NASDAQ:GEVO) is a renewable chemical and biofuels company. The company’s core operations revolve around the development and commercialization of alternates to petroleum-based products as a source of energy. The company is currently engaged in the research and development of isobutanol among other biocatalysts.
Gevo, Inc. (NASDAQ:GEVO) is also capable of converting cellulosic sugars into isobutanol, jet fuel, and isooctane
Budget Cuts Impact
The DOE could see its $5 billion budget trimmed by 20% amidst reports the Trump administration is considering a string of budget cuts. The direct impact of the move on Gevo, according to the CEO, is minimal.
“To be very clear the direct impact to Gevo is minimal in those kinds of budget cuts. The potential impact could be more direct on the cellulosic programs which have more exposure to DOE programs,” said Mr. Gruber
Gevo, Inc. (NASDAQ:GEVO) is currently exploring various federal programs with a view of getting loans and grants for financing its operations. Minnesota is one of the states that the company is eyeing for subsidies given that the state has similar programs for chemical products.
In a bid to strengthen its balance sheet, Gevo, Inc. (NASDAQ:GEVO) has restructured its debt structure by exchanging most of its unsecured 2022 converts.
I have no positions in any of the stocks mentioned, and have no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours. All information, including any data, is provided without any guarantees of accuracy.

Company Overview
Gevo currently operates its first fermentation facility in Luverne, Minnesota, where it produces isobutanol, ethanol and related products like high-value, protein-rich animal feed.
Gevo’s isobutanol is then either sold directly into drop-in markets such as specialty chemicals and gasoline blendstocks, or converted into direct replacement hydrocarbon products such as jet fuel, isooctane and ingredients for polyester.
Gevo has been operating a biorefinery to convert isobutanol into these hydrocarbon products with South Hampton Resources in Silsbee, Texas, since 2011.

Gevo, Inc. is a renewable chemicals and advanced biofuels company headquartered in unincorporated Douglas County, Colorado in the Denver-Aurora metropolitan area. The company develops bio-based alternatives to petroleum-based products using a combination of biotechnology and classical chemistry. Gevo converts renewable raw materials into isobutanol and renewable hydrocarbons that Gevo believes can be directly integrated on a “drop in” basis into existing fuel and chemical products.[1] Gevo’s investors include Burrill & Company, Khosla Ventures, Lanxess, Osage University Partners, Total, and Virgin Green Fund, among others.

Economics of isobutanol production[edit]
Isobutanol is a four-carbon (C
4) alcohol that can be directly used as a specialty chemical or a value-added fuel blendstock.[2] It can also be converted into butenes, using simple dehydration chemistry deployed in the refining and petrochemicals industries today. Butenes are primary hydrocarbon feedstocks that are used in the production of plastics, fibers, rubber, other polymers and hydrocarbon fuels.
Isobutanol produced from renewable raw materials may be a competitively priced alternative source of C
4 hydrocarbons for the petrochemical and refining industries. Over the last decade, fermentable sugars had lower cost volatility than petroleum, which is important to industrial C
4 consumers who are seeking less volatile sources that might be used to hedge equivalent petroleum-derived materials. Isobutanol and its derivatives have potential applications in approximately 40 percent of the global petrochemicals market. Manufacturers can replace petroleum-derived raw materials with isobutanol-derived raw materials without modification to their equipment or production processes. Additionally, the final products produced from isobutanol-based raw materials are chemically equivalent to those produced from petroleum-based raw materials and may help reduce the time to market adoption.[3]
Technology, engineering and production[edit]
Gevo has developed technology to retrofit existing ethanol production plants to produce isobutanol. Gevo’s Integrated Fermentation Technology, or GIFT,[4] is an integrated technology platform for the efficient production and separation of isobutanol. GIFT consists of two components, proprietary biocatalysts that convert sugars derived from multiple renewable feedstocks into isobutanol through fermentation, and a proprietary separation unit that is designed to continuously separate isobutanol from water during the fermentation process. Gevo developed its technology platform to be compatible with the existing approximately 20 BGPY (Billion Gallons per Year) of global operating ethanol production capacity, as estimated by the Renewable Fuels Association. GIFT is designed to allow relatively low capital expenditure retrofits of existing ethanol facilities, enabling a rapid and cost-efficient route to isobutanol production from the fermentation of renewable feedstocks.[5] Gevo is also developing biocatalysts to convert sugars derived from biomass to produce cellulosic isobutanol once the conversion technology is commercially viable. Gevo plans to expand its production capacity beyond its initial commercial facility to produce and sell over 500 million gallons of isobutanol by 2014.

Demonstration facility in St. Joseph: Gevo’s production process was demonstrated in September 2009 on a commercially relevant scale with the retrofit of ICM’s 1 MGPY(Million Gallons per Year) ethanol facility in St. Joseph, Missouri.[6] This demonstration project illustrates that Gevo’s model for repurposing ethanol plants for scalable production of isobutanol can be accomplished rapidly and with a low up-front capital investment.
First commercial production facility: In September 2010, Gevo acquired ownership of a 22 MGPY ethanol production facility in Luverne, Minnesota.[7] Gevo anticipates beginning its retrofit of the Luverne facility in the fourth quarter of 2010. Commercial production of isobutanol is expected to begin at the Luverne facility in the first half of 2012.[8]

Target markets[edit]
Most of the technology necessary to convert isobutanol into plastics, fibers, rubber, other polymers and hydrocarbon fuels is known and practiced in the chemicals industry today. Gevo’s commercialization efforts are focused on the following markets:

Isobutanol — Without any modification, isobutanol has applications as a specialty chemical and a fuel blendstock. In the fuel blendstock market, isobutanol can be used to replace high-value blendstocks, such as alkylate, and can be blended in conjunction with, or as a substitute for, ethanol and other widely used fuel oxygenates.[9] In November 2010, Gevo became the first company to receive EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) certification for isobutanol as a fuel blendstock after meeting the EPA’s standards under the Clean Air Act.[10] The global gasoline oxygenate market is approximately 40 BGPY, based upon data from the International Energy Agency (IEA). While isobutanol can be used as a replacement for ethanol, its product properties are significantly differentiated from ethanol. As a gasoline blendstock, isobutanol’s low Reid Vapor Pressure (RVP), high energy content and low water solubility compared to ethanol make it a valuable product that can be sold directly to refiners and is compatible with existing engine and industry infrastructure, including pipeline assets. Isobutanol can also be sold for immediate use as a specialty solvent. This global market for butanol represents approximately 1.1 BGPY, based upon volume data from SRI.
Plastics, Fibers, Rubber and other Polymers — Isobutanol can be converted into a wide variety of hydrocarbons that form the basis for the production of many products, including rubber, lubricants, additives, methyl methacrylate, polypropylenes, polyesters, and polystyrene, representing an aggregate potential market for isobutanol of approximately 67 BGPY, based upon volume data from SRI, CMAI and Nexant.
Hydrocarbon Fuels — Alternatively, the hydrocarbons that can be produced from isobutanol can be used to manufacture jet and diesel fuel, as well as other hydrocarbon fuels. The hydrocarbon fuels that can be produced from isobutanol collectively represent a potential market for isobutanol of over 900 BGPY, based upon volume data from IEA.

Gevo, Inc. is a renewable chemicals and advanced biofuels company headquartered in unincorporated Douglas County, Colorado in the Denver-Aurora metropolitan area. The company develops bio-based alternatives to petroleum-based products using a combination of biotechnology and classical chemistry. Gevo converts renewable raw materials into isobutanol and renewable hydrocarbons that Gevo believes can be directly integrated on a “drop in” basis into existing fuel and chemical products.[1] Gevo’s investors include Burrill & Company, Khosla Ventures, Lanxess, Osage University Partners, Total, and Virgin Green Fund, among others.

Economics of isobutanol production[edit]
Isobutanol is a four-carbon (C
4) alcohol that can be directly used as a specialty chemical or a value-added fuel blendstock.[2] It can also be converted into butenes, using simple dehydration chemistry deployed in the refining and petrochemicals industries today. Butenes are primary hydrocarbon feedstocks that are used in the production of plastics, fibers, rubber, other polymers and hydrocarbon fuels.
Isobutanol produced from renewable raw materials may be a competitively priced alternative source of C
4 hydrocarbons for the petrochemical and refining industries. Over the last decade, fermentable sugars had lower cost volatility than petroleum, which is important to industrial C
4 consumers who are seeking less volatile sources that might be used to hedge equivalent petroleum-derived materials. Isobutanol and its derivatives have potential applications in approximately 40 percent of the global petrochemicals market. Manufacturers can replace petroleum-derived raw materials with isobutanol-derived raw materials without modification to their equipment or production processes. Additionally, the final products produced from isobutanol-based raw materials are chemically equivalent to those produced from petroleum-based raw materials and may help reduce the time to market adoption.[3]
Technology, engineering and production[edit]
Gevo has developed technology to retrofit existing ethanol production plants to produce isobutanol. Gevo’s Integrated Fermentation Technology, or GIFT,[4] is an integrated technology platform for the efficient production and separation of isobutanol. GIFT consists of two components, proprietary biocatalysts that convert sugars derived from multiple renewable feedstocks into isobutanol through fermentation, and a proprietary separation unit that is designed to continuously separate isobutanol from water during the fermentation process. Gevo developed its technology platform to be compatible with the existing approximately 20 BGPY (Billion Gallons per Year) of global operating ethanol production capacity, as estimated by the Renewable Fuels Association. GIFT is designed to allow relatively low capital expenditure retrofits of existing ethanol facilities, enabling a rapid and cost-efficient route to isobutanol production from the fermentation of renewable feedstocks.[5] Gevo is also developing biocatalysts to convert sugars derived from biomass to produce cellulosic isobutanol once the conversion technology is commercially viable. Gevo plans to expand its production capacity beyond its initial commercial facility to produce and sell over 500 million gallons of isobutanol by 2014.

Demonstration facility in St. Joseph: Gevo’s production process was demonstrated in September 2009 on a commercially relevant scale with the retrofit of ICM’s 1 MGPY(Million Gallons per Year) ethanol facility in St. Joseph, Missouri.[6] This demonstration project illustrates that Gevo’s model for repurposing ethanol plants for scalable production of isobutanol can be accomplished rapidly and with a low up-front capital investment.
First commercial production facility: In September 2010, Gevo acquired ownership of a 22 MGPY ethanol production facility in Luverne, Minnesota.[7] Gevo anticipates beginning its retrofit of the Luverne facility in the fourth quarter of 2010. Commercial production of isobutanol is expected to begin at the Luverne facility in the first half of 2012.[8]

Target markets[edit]
Most of the technology necessary to convert isobutanol into plastics, fibers, rubber, other polymers and hydrocarbon fuels is known and practiced in the chemicals industry today. Gevo’s commercialization efforts are focused on the following markets:

Isobutanol — Without any modification, isobutanol has applications as a specialty chemical and a fuel blendstock. In the fuel blendstock market, isobutanol can be used to replace high-value blendstocks, such as alkylate, and can be blended in conjunction with, or as a substitute for, ethanol and other widely used fuel oxygenates.[9] In November 2010, Gevo became the first company to receive EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) certification for isobutanol as a fuel blendstock after meeting the EPA’s standards under the Clean Air Act.[10] The global gasoline oxygenate market is approximately 40 BGPY, based upon data from the International Energy Agency (IEA). While isobutanol can be used as a replacement for ethanol, its product properties are significantly differentiated from ethanol. As a gasoline blendstock, isobutanol’s low Reid Vapor Pressure (RVP), high energy content and low water solubility compared to ethanol make it a valuable product that can be sold directly to refiners and is compatible with existing engine and industry infrastructure, including pipeline assets. Isobutanol can also be sold for immediate use as a specialty solvent. This global market for butanol represents approximately 1.1 BGPY, based upon volume data from SRI.
Plastics, Fibers, Rubber and other Polymers — Isobutanol can be converted into a wide variety of hydrocarbons that form the basis for the production of many products, including rubber, lubricants, additives, methyl methacrylate, polypropylenes, polyesters, and polystyrene, representing an aggregate potential market for isobutanol of approximately 67 BGPY, based upon volume data from SRI, CMAI and Nexant.
Hydrocarbon Fuels — Alternatively, the hydrocarbons that can be produced from isobutanol can be used to manufacture jet and diesel fuel, as well as other hydrocarbon fuels. The hydrocarbon fuels that can be produced from isobutanol collectively represent a potential market for isobutanol of over 900 BGPY, based upon volume data from IEA.

Company Overview
Gevo currently operates its first fermentation facility in Luverne, Minnesota, where it produces isobutanol, ethanol and related products like high-value, protein-rich animal feed.
Gevo’s isobutanol is then either sold directly into drop-in markets such as specialty chemicals and gasoline blendstocks, or converted into direct replacement hydrocarbon products such as jet fuel, isooctane and ingredients for polyester.
Gevo has been operating a biorefinery to convert isobutanol into these hydrocarbon products with South Hampton Resources in Silsbee, Texas, since 2011.

Gevo is a leading renewable chemicals and advanced biofuels company.  We have developed bio-based alternatives to petroleum-based products using a combination of synthetic biology and chemistry. We produce isobutanol, a versatile platform chemical for the liquid fuels and petrochemical market. Isobutanol has broad market applications as a solvent and a gasoline blendstock that can help refiners meet their renewable fuel and clean air obligations. It can also be further processed using well-known chemical processes into jet fuel and feedstocks for the production of synthetic rubber, plastics, and polyesters. Gevo's technology was designed to retrofit existing ethanol plants of all kinds. Read more...

Gevo, Inc. (NASDAQ:GEVO) Announces New Product 

 

0000Gevo, Inc. (NASDAQ:GEVO)
Gevo, Inc. (NASDAQ:GEVO) shares were off slightly (-3.4%) after the company jointly announced that Gevo’s proprietary isobutanol technology will now be available for licensing to processors of sugar cane juice and molasses. This announcement came after Praj Industries Ltd’s development work, adapting Gevo, Inc. (NASDAQ:GEVO)’s technology to sugar cane and molasses feedstocks.
Two month Daily Candle Graph $GEVO
In the first phase of development, Praj Industries worked with Gevo’s technology using sugar cane and molasses feedstocks, undertaking test-runs to create a commercialized process to juice cane and molasses-based ethanol plants, as licensees of Gevo’s isobutanol technology. Licensing is expected to be focused on Praj plants located in India, South America and South-East Asia, with initial capacity targeted to come on-line between 2019 and 2020.
Pramod Chaudhari, Executive Chairman, Praj, stated, “We are excited to offer this technology to our global customers who stand to benefit from an additional revenue stream from isobutanol. Praj has worked on 750 projects for ethanol plants across 75 countries. This isobutanol platform can be offered as ‘bolt-on’ to an existing ethanol plant or as a greenfield plant. This isobutanol technology is the latest addition to Praj’s diverse product portfolio and reinforces our organization’s leadership in the bioenergy space.”
Isobutanol has several direct applications as a gasoline blendstock or as a specialty chemical solvent, or it can be used as Gevo’s alcohol-to-jet fuel (ATJ) and isooctane.
