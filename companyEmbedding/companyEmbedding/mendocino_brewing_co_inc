CommunityAbout UsAle House



Red Tail Ale is our flagship brand. It is brewed in the traditional "old world" manner,
    using premium two-row malted barley, hops and our own special proprietary yeast strain.
    It is an amber ale with a rich complex refreshing flavor and a crisp dry finish.
    Like good wine, Red Tail Ale is a perfect complement to fine dining.





Blue Heron Pale Ale is a delightful, medium bodied smooth ale, with a distinctive
    crisp mouth-feel and a fresh hoppy finish. It is brewed using premium two-row Pale
    malted barley, generous amounts of both Cluster bittering hops and Cascade finishing
    hops and our own special proprietary yeast strain.


Peregrine Pilsner is Mendocino’s take on the classic Czech Style Pilsner. What separates
    a Czech Pilsner from its more common brethren is its use of hops. While still being
    light in color, our craft brewed Peregrine Pilsner sets itself apart from others
    by providing an enjoyable, crisp hop flavor derived from noble hops to make this
    a refreshing, drinkable, and superbly satisfying beer.

Peregrine Pilsner uses three varieties of light malts to give the beer a brilliant
    golden straw color and full bodied taste. It is lavishly hopped with Saaz hops that
    originate from the Czech Republic to give it an authentic Pilsner flavor with its
    spicy, floral hop notes and a smooth, dry finish. 

Peregrine Pilsner is carefully crafted to be exactly what a Czech Style Pilsner should
    be. - A perfectly pleasing pilsner

CommunityAbout UsAle House



Eye of the Hawk is an excellent, rich bodied ale that is brewed to perfection. "Eye"
    is coppery reddish-amber in color and its unique taste is the result of a judicious
    mix of caramel and pale malted barley, balanced with Cluster, Cascade and Saaz hops.
    This gives the Eye its luxurious flavor, substantial mouth-feel and that slightly
    dry finish. Eye of the Hawk has garnered a cult following that is enviable.


Black Hawk Stout retains the big traditional flavors of an Irish-style stout and
    yet offers a refreshing dry crispness that is rare in many dark beers. Black Hawk
    Stout is replete with a rich, roasted malt flavor that makes this not-so-heavy stout,
    creamy and ever so smooth. It has a subtlety that surprises and converts even the
    most reticent stout drinker.


White Hawk Select IPA is a traditional India Pale Ale. We’ve blended American West
    Coast Cascade Hops with a very generous dose of English Fuggle Hops. This combination
    makes for a very aromatic character, as well as a truly authentic English flavor
    which you must taste to believe. “Hopheads” will love this brew!

Mendocino Brewing Company (OTCQB: MENB) is a brewery founded in 1983 as the Hopland Brewery in the Mendocino County town of Hopland, California, USA.

Additionally, the company runs the Mendocino Brewing Ale House also located in Ukiah.

Background[edit]
The Hopland Brewery was founded in 1983 by homebrewers Michael Laybourn and Norman Franks who purchased the brewing equipment of the recently closed New Albion Brewing Company. Former New Albion brewers, Jack McAuliffe and Don Barkley, were hired to operate the brewery.[1] The flagship beer was named Red Tail Ale, named after both the beer's color and also a local hymn titled "The Redtail Hawk".[1] The theme of naming all its beer varieties after birds continues to this day.
Opened on August 14, 1983, the Hopland Brewery was the first California brewpub ‒ a brewery licensed to sell both its own beer and food at the same location ‒ as well as the second in the United States.[1][2][3]
In 2014 Northwest Labor Press listed Mendocino Brewing as the only unionized craft brewery they could find. The Ukiah facility is represented by the Teamsters.[4]
Public offering[edit]
In 1994, the company went public in a "Direct Public Offering", advertising its share offering with flyers in six-packs of its beer.[5] In 1997, Vijay Mallya, owner of the UB Group, bought a significant portion of the company,[6] and today is the beneficial owner of approximately three-quarters of the company's stock.[7]
Brews[edit]
Its brews include Red Tail Ale, Blue Heron Pale Ale, Eye of the Hawk Select Ale, and Black Hawk Stout, as well as several other regular offerings, and various short-run seasonal offerings. Their products are all named for birds of prey, excepting Blue Heron, and feature images of the birds on their labels.
As part of the acquisition by UB Group, the company owns a brewery in Saratoga Springs, New York, and produces Kingfisher brand beers for the U.S. market.
Involvement[edit]
The brewery is also the official sponsor of the Mendocino Steam Donkeys Rugby Football Club, a local men's Division III rugby union team.[8]

In 1994, the company went public in a "Direct Public Offering", advertising its share offering with flyers in six-packs of its beer.[5] In 1997, Vijay Mallya, owner of the UB Group, bought a significant portion of the company,[6] and today is the beneficial owner of approximately three-quarters of the company's stock.[7]
Brews[edit]
Its brews include Red Tail Ale, Blue Heron Pale Ale, Eye of the Hawk Select Ale, and Black Hawk Stout, as well as several other regular offerings, and various short-run seasonal offerings. Their products are all named for birds of prey, excepting Blue Heron, and feature images of the birds on their labels.
As part of the acquisition by UB Group, the company owns a brewery in Saratoga Springs, New York, and produces Kingfisher brand beers for the U.S. market.
Involvement[edit]
The brewery is also the official sponsor of the Mendocino Steam Donkeys Rugby Football Club, a local men's Division III rugby union team.[8]

Beer Recipe Kits



	Beer Recipe & Ingredient Kits

	Beer Recipe Kits available at MoreBeer! come in three options: All-Grain Recipe Kits, Malt Extract Recipe Kits and Mini-Mash Recipe Kits. When you order any ingredient kit from MoreBeer!, you can count on superb levels of freshness. Each beer kit comes with the estimated Starting Gravity, Color Range, IBU levels, and suggested fermentation temperature. Every MoreBeer! ingredient kit is designed for a post-boil volume of 5.5 gallons, meaning a full 5 gallons after fermentation! Beer yeast is not included in the beer-making recipe kits and will have to be ordered separately. Each kit does include recommended guidelines for the best yeast to go with that specific kit. Gluten-Free Beer Recipe Kits are also available.

	 




Beer Recipe Kits - Extract 

Beer Recipe Kits - Mini Mash 

Beer Recipe Kits - All Grain 




					This is what a majority of brewers are looking for. Malt Extract Kits usually include:


						Malt extract in liquid and/or dry form

						Milled flavoring grains & other specialty ingredients, as required

						Multiple additions of hops

						Whirlfloc - for clarifying

						Corn sugar - for bottling




					The Mini Mash brewing process can be thought of as mid-way between Malt Extract and All Grain brewing. These kits include:


						Malt extract in liquid and/or dry form

						Milled base and flavoring grains & other specialty ingredients, as required

						Multiple additions of hops

						Whirlfloc - for clarifying

						Corn sugar - for bottling




					All Grain Brewing is the ultimate in control, however, you will need extra equipment such as a mash tun and hot liquor tank to make it work. Your boil kettle will also need to fit a full size boil for all grain. These kits include:


						Base and specialty malts

						Multiple additions of hops

						Whirlfloc - for clarifying

						Corn sugar - for bottling

All About Goose Island

Honestly, an island full of geese doesn't sound like the ideal place to knock back a few beers. But if the beers are as good as what Goose Island makes, we won't complain. Especially if the geese are friendly. Born in 1988 after a pint-filled tour across Europe, the brewery has been one of the most successful American micro-brews since its debut. As evidenced by the Goose Island IPA, the goal is to give you something you'll love while challenging your tastes at the same time.

OUR STORY




Our Story







OUR MISSION
WHY GOOSE ISLAND EXISTS
To lead in the craft of brewing by creating award-winning beers that define classic and innovative styles to capture the hearts, imaginations, and palates of beer drinkers.






OUR VALUES
WHAT GUIDES OUR DECISION MAKING
We are guided by our respect for the history and culture of beer as well as our passion for, and innovation in, brewing. We wish to enrich the cultural landscape of Chicago and support the inspirational organizations within our communities. Furthermore, Goose Island champions sustainability in our breweries (and beyond) as well as actively celebrates and engages our employees.






OUR VISION
WHERE WE WANT TO BE
In years to come, Goose Island will solidify our leadership in the craft brewing industry. This goal will be achieved through sharing our expertise in the brewing process, involving ourselves with professional brewing and trade organizations and growing the craft beer community through consumer engagement and education.








Our History



A GOOSE GOES TO EUROPE
Our famous beer began with a trip across Europe, when Goose Island founder (and unabashed beer lover) John Hall took a tour across the continent. Pint by pint, he savored the styles and selections of brews in every region, and thought to himself, “America deserves some damn fine beer like this, too.”
Craft brewing wasn’t widely known at the time, but upon return from his European sojourn, John set out to change all that. He settled down in his hometown of Chicago—a city perfect for craft beer, with rapidly evolving tastes and the largest system of fresh water on the planet. And then he got to brewing.
First he made some stellar beer. Then he invited his consumers in to watch his process at the brewery, bringing them behind the scenes every step of the way. The result was a new fascination with craft brewing, and beer that not only catered to people’s tastes, but challenged them as well.
That was back in 1988, and we haven’t slowed down since. By 1995, John’s beer had become so popular that he decided to open a larger brewery, along with a bottling plant to keep up with demand. 1999 brought even more growth, along with an additional brewpub, and today, what was once one man’s pint-filled dream has become the Goose Island empire you know and love.




Our Brewery



OUR INNER WORKINGS
Our brewery was built in 1995 and has more than doubled in size since originally built. We bring you our tasty pints using 32 fermenters, over 15 different yeasts, state-of-the-art filters, centrifuges and a 50 barrel JV Northwest 5 vessel system that brews 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. It turns out that making awesome brews is quite the science. Luckily our brewery facilities have all the equipment necessary to deliver results.
Our packaging line alone bottles 500 cases an hour, with our keg line at a rate of 50 kegs every 60 minutes. Once the beer is complete, we store it at a crisp 38 degrees until shipping. In other words, we don’t mess around when it comes to filling the Goose Island demand. We even have separate rooms to house small batch innovation programs and yeast propagation units, and our barrel-aged beers have their own dedicated stockroom AND 143,000 square foot barrel warehouse. It’s only the very best equipment for our beer—and we invite you to learn more.




Our Barrels



AGED BEFORE EVERYONE ELSE
In 1992, Goose Island gave the beer industry a new reason to belly up to the bar: bourbon-aged beer. We pioneered the process, and it begins with first-use bourbon barrels. Our brewers only choose those that have had held sweet, sweet whiskey in their bellies for an average of 8 years, then they age our beer inside for 8-12 months. This process takes place in a non-climate controlled space, allowing exposure to the extreme heat and cold of Chicago’s ecosystem, which contracts and expands the wood, pulling the barrel’s whiskey character into our brew. Each barrel is used only once, ensuring the best quality taste in every pint.
That first barrel-aging process yielded our ever-tasty Bourbon County Stout back in 2004. Three years later, we decided it was time to expand our barrel-aging program again. But this time our brewers brought wine barrels into the picture.
They started with beer that had undergone primary fermentation in stainless steel casks, then transferred it to wine barrels, soaked with flavor. Next came fresh fruit and wild yeasts, and the beginning of a secondary fermentation inside the barrel. Aging went on for 9-18 months, creating beer with unprecedented depth of character, increased acidity and a light essence of fruit without too much sweetness. The variety of wine barrels we use now yield some of our most unique brews, including Sofie, Juliet, Lolita, Madame Rose, Gillian and Halia.




Our Hops



Tucked away in a secluded valley in Northern Idaho is Elk Mountain Farms – the place where Goose Island hops are grown and harvested. Head Farmer Ed Atkins shares the same passion and commitment to great beer as our brewers, and together they’ve worked to grow the farm from a 70-acre operation to a 1700-acre hop heaven. Here, over 50 different types of hops, including Goose Island favorites like Saaz, Amarillo and Cascade are cultivated along with numerous experimental varieties that could one day push the boundaries of beer for drinkers and brewers alike. Elk Mountain is more than just soil and plant life; it’s a laboratory, a studio, a blank canvas on which to paint the future of Goose Island beer. Watch the video above to get a taste of this magical place or click here for a chance to experience it.




Our People








John Hall
Founder
After traveling extensively in his career in the packaging industry, John Hall was always amazed at how few beer choices Americans had. "When I traveled in Europe, everywhere I went there would always be a local beer… but not in the U.S."
Then, in 1986, fate struck John Hall in the form of a thunderstorm in Dallas, Texas. His flight delayed by the inclement weather, Hall flipped through an in-flight magazine to pass the time.
There he found his future in the form of an article on boutique beers. "I must be the only person in history who made a major career decision on the basis of a Delta Sky article," Hall chuckles.
Fascinated by what he’d read, Hall began to toy with the idea of starting a brewery. "I just loved the idea," John remembers. "I mean, what could be better than making a product that I was passionate about, and nearly every American adult liked?" After two years of thinking, researching, and planning, Hall scrapped his 20-year career with Container Corporation and opened the original Goose Island Brewpub at 1800 North Clybourn Avenue, introducing the city of Chicago to distinctive craft beer.
Goose Island Beer Co. is now one of the largest craft breweries in the Midwest. The company distributes its beers to all 50 states and the United Kingdom. "I'm working with people I love, and I love what I do," says Hall. "I'm a lucky man."
John resides in Chicago with his wife, Patricia.









Ken Stout
President & General Manager 
Ken Stout is the President & General Manager of the Goose Island Beer Company in Chicago, where he leads the brewery’s operational, sales and marketing initiatives. A Chicago native and long-time beer professional, Ken previously held the Director of Consumer Experience position at Goose Island, leading experiential marketing, as well as training & development efforts.
 Prior to his joining Goose Island in 2009, he worked for SBI-Heineken USA as the business development director, managing the 19 state central region. As a certified cicerone and Master Brewers Association Beer Steward, his passion for beer is palpable. Ken holds a Bachelor of Arts degree from DePaul University and resides in Lisle with his wife and three children.









Jared Jankoski
Brewmaster
Goose Island's Brewmaster, Jared Jankoski is responsible for creative and technical development of Goose Island's award-winning portfolio of beers.
Goose Island's Head Brewer since June of 2012, Jankoski was promoted to Brewmaster in March of 2015. Goose Island's fourth Brewmaster, Jankoski is poised to continue the company's growth as it sets the stage for the future. "Being brewmaster is about a commitment to quality from raw material to packaged beer, scrutinizing every process in between to always try to improve," says Jankoski. "We are our own toughest critics in an effort to put out the best beer we can."
"Our priority remains evolving our foundation to facilitate innovation technically, create new beers that intrigue and are enjoyable, and make this a great place to work by putting people first and having fun. We do make beer after all."
Prior to Goose Island, the Wisconsin native worked at New Glarus Brewing from 2005-2012. During that time, constant expansion and upgrading gave a valuable foundation in process flow, efficiency and quality.
Jankoski realized his passion for the sciences early on, which was cemented during a high school chemistry class and he credits the teacher for bringing out everyone’s best strengths. After doing well in the AP class, Jankoski decided chemistry would make a great focus for college and started home brewing. It was always his dream to brew for life, but at the time didn’t know if it was a viable career. Jankoski pursued his interest in chemistry and graduated with a BS from University of Wisconsin - Eau Claire in 1999. Prior to becoming a brewer professionally, he completed the American Brewer’s Guild diploma course in brewing.
With a strong belief in quality and establishing a solid foundation, Jankoski's experience at Goose Island has allowed him to focus on building a strong team and improve the foundation for making great beer to better accommodate the diverse family of brews produced in Chicago.
"I love working at Goose Island because it’s a very team oriented, inclusive place to work. Giving many different people the chance to contribute is one of the things has gone into the creation of some of our best beers and adds fulfillment and meaning to people’s work here. It just makes our work more fun."









Mike Siegel
Brewery Innovations Manager
Mike's passion for great beer started in his early 20s and soon led to many years of homebrewing and traveling the U.S. and Europe in pursuit of it. After careers in sound engineering and information technology, he was urged by his wife Katie to quit beating around the bush and make the switch to brewing professionally. Mike started at Goose Island in 2011 as a brewer and cellarman, and in 2013 was promoted to Innovation Manager. In this role, he oversees all new beer development and helps facilitate the collective creative output of the numerous talented brewers that Goose Island has on its team.









Keith Gabbett
Senior Brewer
Keith discovered craft beer in college (one of his first was Redhook Double Black Stout) and was a home brewer long before before brewing professionally. The decision to become a brewer professionally came when he decided to go to Siebel Institute rather than putting a down payment on a house. Luckily, for Keith, he had a very understanding and encouraging girlfriend (now wife) who had just finished going to culinary school. Upon graduation from Siebel, Keith went on to brew for Destihl from from 2007-2008 and joined Goose Island in 2009. Favorite beer styles: all of them, but his go to beer is an IPA or a good craft Pils. He also really like bourbon and cocktails. Oh yeah, and food is awesome too. 









Patrick Reisch
Head Cellarman
Lead Cellarman at Goose Island Beer Co. in Chicago, IL, Patrick, a 6th generation brewer, is responsible for the fermentation and finishing of Goose Island beer. Patrick began as a brewer at Goose Island in 2009 following his graduation from University of Missouri with a degree in Chemical Engineering. He spent his college summers brewing at Springfield Brewing Co. in Springfield, MO and Bridgeport Brewing Co. in Portland, OR, and homebrewed on his apartment rooftop during the year. In 2011, Patrick was one of 75 Americans awarded a government sponsored fellowship, which brought him to Germany for a year to learn German brewing techniques. While living in Munich, Patrick brewed at the Paulaner and Hacker-Pschorr brewpubs, and lived and worked in the Spaten-Franziskaner brewery, gaining a deeper understanding of traditional brewing methods and furthering his love of German style hefeweizens.









Bill Savage
Lead Brewer - Barrel Program
Chicago area native, Bill is in charge of the indoor urban forest that is Goose Island's barrel program. He maintains the brewery’s spirit and funk, by handling all beers that mature in wooden vessels.
An avid home brewer in college, Bill also studied Ancient Greek and Latin languages, literature and history at Loyola University Chicago. His philosophy towards brewing beers is "old school."
Professionally, he started out working as a winemaker, and also delved into mead-making (honey wine). Following his apprenticeship and pursuits in winemaking and oak maturation, he went through brewing school at the Siebel Institute of Technology in 2012. After his brewing education, he became a brewer for Flossmoor Station Brewing Co. - learning traditional English style brewing techniques, acquainting himself with barrel aging beers, and testing out interpretations of historic brewing recipes.
 Bill has been with Goose Island since 2013, having held positions in cellar and Brewhouse, before taking over as Barrel-Lead.
