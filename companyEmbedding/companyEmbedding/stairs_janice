Hi, 

I am looking at the VITSN-01 product.  Curious what the "black strip" is referring to in the description.  

Thanks,
Ian 
Hi Ian,

Thank you for your question. The strip is for the visually impaired. It comes in rubber or non slip grit. There's a drop-down color selection for this product towards the bottom of the page on the line item that features the VITSN profile. From there you can select various nose and strip color combinations.

Thank you,

Hello, I have recently purchased an apartment building and the inside stairway is made of aggregated stone,with rounded edges.Do you have a stair tread and risers to cover them? Something that would look good in the living room  
Hi Teryll.

Thank you for your question. Your would first need to apply some kind of leveler material as our treads require a smooth surface for the adhesive to bond to. Then any of these products would be OK to install. The look is personal preference so please feel to click through the various options on this page.   http://www.kofflersales.com/stair-treads.asp

Thank you,

The Koffler Team

Hi Ben,

Thank you for your question. Yes, these profiles are on our website, listed on this page under the "Colors" tab. 

Thank you,

We bought these without having a clue what we were doing. They were easy to cut to size, easy to install. They make the stairs feel much safer and they happened to match the color perfectly.
