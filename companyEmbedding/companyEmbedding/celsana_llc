United States
Introduction
Vegan and free of animal testing, the serum and cleanser products from CelSana LLC use natural and organic ingredients to protect and enrich the skin. CelSana LLC, a product-driven company, uses the properties of Hamelia patens, a plant native to the rainforests and an essential element of folk medicine in the Caribbean as well as Central and South America. After experiencing the plant's effects firsthand, CelSana LLC founder Don Wayne Berry, MD, engaged horticulture scientists at Texas A&M University in a sponsored research agreement to investigate its properties.

After 24 months of research on behalf of CelSana LLC, the Texas A&M team developed a pedigree for the Hamelia patens. CelSana has created a series of protocols for the cultivation and harvesting of the Hamelia patens, as well as a proprietary extraction process and product formulation system to ensure maximum effectiveness of the final product. Supported as well by extensive quality control measures, CelSana LLC's night and day serums and cleansing products combine science and nature.

Nature



Nature perfected our rainforest plant Hamelia patens. Used for years in Central and South America and the Caribbean as part of the indigenous populations’ “folk medicine” for topical use on the skin, its name commemorates French botanist Henri Louis DuHamel de Monceau (1700-1782), who originally named the plant in the South American Rain Forest 300 years ago. Don Wayne Berry, M.D. ensured that precise perfection was maintained at the natural plant’s optimal efficacy by employing the Horticulture Science Department at Texas A&M University for 24 months in a Sponsored Research Agreement.








Science



Science abounds in the development of our cosmeceutical skin care products. From protocols created for optimal growing, propagating, cultivating and harvesting the plant at Texas A&M University, to the secure private greenhouses where professional horticultural management is fully implemented, all the way thru to our exclusive extraction process, product formulation and professional clinical testing, experienced persistence in science is key!  Scientific quality control measures are in place at every level.







Future Innovations



Our team of doctors, scientists and clinicians are continually working to bring you new and unique formulations for your skin. Looking forward you will be delighted with an amazing skin cleanser followed by the introduction of a truly incredible color spot formula. The final formulation of our core age defying regimen will be a full body Anti-Aging lotion! What else is coming? Well many, many more are in different developmental stages ….  But shhhh!  Do you like surprises?
