1. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES BY ADDITIONAL GUARANTORS. The
Additional Guarantors represent and warrant to the Lender that :


(a) SHA is a limited liability company duly registered,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware
is authorized to do business in the State of Arizona; has all requisite power
and authority to carry on the business and to own the properties that it now

conditions hereof. The execution and delivery of this Amendment have been
duly authorized by the members of SHA and no other company action of SHA is
requisite to the execution and delivery of this Amendment.


(b) SHLR/C is a corporation duly registered, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of California; is
authorized to do business in the State of California; has all requisite power
and authority to carry on the business and to own the properties that it now

2





execution and delivery of this Amendment have been duly authorized by the
members of SHAC and no other company action of SHAC is requisite to the
execution and delivery of this Amendment.


(e) TAX RETURNS AND PAYMENTS. All material tax returns and
reports of each Additional Guarantor required by law to be filed have been
duly filed, and all taxes, assessments, contributions, fees and other
governmental charges the liability for which could exceed $100,000 (other
than those currently payable without penalty or interest and those currently
being contested in good faith) upon any Additional Guarantor or upon any
Additional Guarantor's properties, assets or income which are due and payable
have been paid.


(f) LITIGATION. There is, to the knowledge of the
Additional Guarantors, no action, suit, proceeding or investigation pending
at law or in equity or before any Governmental Authority (as defined in the
Credit Agreement), or threatened against or affecting any Additional
Guarantor, an adverse ruling in which would or might materially impair the
ability of the Additional Guarantors to observe and perform the Additional
Guarantors' obligations under the Guaranty or have a material adverse effect
upon the legality, validity, binding effect or enforceability of the Guaranty.


(g) COMPLIANCE WITH OTHER INSTRUMENTS; NONE BURDENSOME. To
the best of their knowledge, no Additional Guarantor is in violation of or in
default with respect to any provision of any mortgage, indenture, contract,
agreement or instrument applicable to such Additional Guarantor, or by which
such Additional Guarantor is bound, and there is no provision of any
mortgage, indenture, contract, agreement or instrument applicable to any
Additional Guarantor or by which any Additional Guarantor is bound which
materially adversely affects, or in the future (so far as the Additional
Guarantors can now foresee) will materially adversely affect, the business or
prospects or condition (financial or other) of any Additional Guarantor or of
any Additional Guarantor's properties or assets.


(h) FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. Any financial statements
heretofore delivered to the Banks and the Agents by the Additional Guarantors
are true and correct in all respects, and fairly represent the respective
financial conditions of the subjects thereof as of the respective dates
thereof; and no materially adverse change has occurred in the financial
conditions reflected therein since the respective dates thereof.


(i) The Additional Guarantors hereby acknowledge that they
have received, reviewed and approved the Credit Agreement, the Guaranty, and
all of the other Loan Documents.


2. ASSUMPTION. The Additional Guarantors hereby covenant to and with
the Banks and the Agents that the Additional Guarantors will assume, observe
and perform all of the obligations of the Guarantors under the Guaranty, to
all intents and purposes as if the Guarantors and the Additional Guarantors
had executed the Guaranty, jointly and severally. The Additional Guarantors
shall indemnify the Lender against all claims, demands, damages, loss, cost,
expense and attorneys' fees which the Lender may incur as a result of any
breach of this Amendment by the Additional Guarantors.


3





3. ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF RETAINED LIABILITY. The Guarantors covenant to
and with the Banks and the Agents that notwithstanding such assumption by the
Additional Guarantors of the obligations of the Guarantors under the
Guaranty, the Guarantors shall remain fully and directly (and not merely
secondarily or contingently), jointly and severally liable for the full
observance and performance of all obligations under the Guaranty.


4. LIABILITY JOINT AND SEVERAL. The obligations of each Guarantor
and Additional Guarantor under the Guaranty shall be joint and several.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Guarantors have executed this instrument
as of December 5, 2000.

[LETTERHEAD OF GIBSON, DUNN & CRUTCHER, LLP] 
Client: 39334-00100  February 24, 2014 
D.R. Horton, Inc.  301 Commerce Street 
Suite 500  Fort Worth, Texas 76102 
 


Re:
D.R. Horton, Inc. Public Offering of $500,000,000 Principal Amount of its 3.750% Senior Notes due 2019 
Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-184065) 
Ladies and Gentlemen:  We have acted as counsel to D.R. Horton,
Inc., a Delaware corporation (the Company), and certain of its subsidiaries and affiliates listed on Annex A hereto (the Guarantors) in connection with the preparation and filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the Commission) of a Registration Statement on Form S-3, file no. 333-184065 (the Registration Statement), under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act), the
prospectus included therein, the prospectus supplement, dated February 19, 2014, filed with the Commission on February 20, 2014 pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the Securities Act (the Prospectus Supplement), and the
offering by the Company pursuant thereto of $500,000,000 principal amount of the Companys 3.750% Senior Notes due 2019 (the Notes) 
The Notes will be issued pursuant to the Indenture, dated as of May 1, 2012 (the Base Indenture), between the Company and American
Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as trustee (the Trustee), as modified in respect of the Notes by the Seventh Supplemental Indenture, to be dated as of February 24, 2014 (the Supplemental Indenture
and together with the Base Indenture, the Indenture) among the Company, the Guarantors and the Trustee, and are guaranteed pursuant to the terms of the Indenture and the notation endorsed on the Notes by the Guarantors (the
Guarantees). The Notes have been offered pursuant to an Underwriting Agreement dated as of February 19, 2014 (the Underwriting Agreement) among the Company, the Guarantors and the Underwriters named therein
(the Underwriters).  In arriving at the opinions expressed below, we have examined originals, or copies certified or otherwise
identified to our satisfaction as being true and complete copies of the originals, of the Base Indenture, the Supplemental Indenture, the Notes and the Guarantees (collectively, the Note Documents) and such other documents,
corporate records,

certificates of officers of the Company, the Guarantors and of public officials and other instruments as we have deemed necessary or advisable to enable us to render these opinions. In our
examination, we have assumed, without independent investigation, the genuineness of all signatures, the legal capacity and competency of all natural persons, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals and the conformity to
original documents of all documents submitted to us as copies. To the extent that our opinions may be dependent upon such matters, we have assumed, without independent investigation, that each of the Guarantors identified on Annex A that is not a
Specified Guarantor is validly existing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation, has all requisite corporate or other entity power to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under the Note Documents to which it is a party; that the
execution and delivery of such documents by each such party and the performance of its obligations thereunder have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate or other action and do not violate any law, regulation, order, judgment or decree
applicable to each such party; and that such documents have been duly executed and delivered by each such party. As to any facts material to these opinions, we have relied to the extent we deemed appropriate and without independent investigation
upon statements and representations of officers and other representatives of the Company, and the Guarantors and on certificates and representations obtained from public officials and others. 
Based upon the foregoing, and subject to the assumptions, exceptions, qualifications and limitations set forth herein, we are of the opinion that the Notes,
when authenticated in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture and delivered to and paid for by the Underwriters in accordance with the terms of the Underwriting Agreement, will be legal, valid and binding obligations of the Company,
enforceable against the Company in accordance with their respective terms and when the Notes with the Guarantees endorsed thereon have been duly authenticated in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture and delivered to and paid for by the
Underwriters in accordance with the terms of the Underwriting Agreement, the Guarantees of the Notes will be legal, valid and binding obligations of the Guarantors obligated thereon, enforceable against such Guarantors in accordance with their
respective terms.  The opinions expressed above are subject to the following additional exceptions, qualifications, limitations and assumptions: 
A. We render no opinion herein as to matters involving the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of New York and to the extent relevant
for our opinions herein, the laws of the States of California, Colorado and Texas and the Delaware General Corporation Law and the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act. This opinion is limited to the effect of the current state of the laws of the
States of New York, California, Colorado and Texas and the Delaware General Corporation Law and the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act and the facts as they currently exist. We assume no obligation to revise or supplement this opinion in the
event of future changes in such laws or the interpretations thereof or such facts.

B. The opinions above are each subject to (i) the effect of any bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium, arrangement or similar laws affecting the rights and remedies of creditors generally, including without limitation the effect of statutory or other laws regarding fraudulent transfers or preferential transfers,
(ii) general principles of equity, including without limitation concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing and the possible unavailability of specific performance, injunctive relief or other equitable remedies
regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law and (iii) the provisions of: (1) Article Eight of the Certificate of Incorporation of CH Investments of Texas, Inc.; (2) Article Eight of the
Certificate of Incorporation of CHTEX of Texas, Inc.; (3) Paragraph Eight of the Certificate of Incorporation of D.R. Horton, Inc.  Chicago (excluding the first three sentences thereof); and (4) Article Ten of the Certificate of
Incorporation of Western Pacific Housing, Inc.  C. We express no opinion regarding the effectiveness of (i) any waiver of stay,
extension or usury laws or of unknown future rights, (ii) provisions relating to indemnification, exculpation or contribution, to the extent such provisions may be held unenforceable as contrary to public policy or federal or state securities
laws, or (iii) any purported fraudulent transfer savings clause.  We consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to the
Registration Statement, and we further consent to the use of our name under the caption Legal Matters in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus Supplement. In giving these consents, we do not thereby admit that we are within the
category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Securities Act or the rules and regulations of the Commission promulgated thereunder. 
Very truly yours,  /s/ Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP

ARTICLE II.

MISCELLANEOUS

     2.1. This Third Supplemental Indenture constitutes a supplement to the Indenture, and the
Indenture and this Third Supplemental Indenture shall be read together and shall have the effect so
far as practicable as though all of the provisions thereof and hereof are contained in one
instrument.

2



 

     2.2 The parties may sign any number of copies of this Third Supplemental Indenture. Each
signed copy shall be an original, but all of them together represent the same agreement.

     2.3 In the event that any provision in this Third Supplemental Indenture or the Securities
shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of
the remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.

     2.4 The article headings herein are for convenience only and shall not affect the construction
hereof.

     2.5 Any capitalized term used in this Third Supplemental Indenture and not defined herein that
is defined in the Indenture shall have the meaning specified in the Indenture, unless the context
shall otherwise require.

     2.6 All covenants and agreements in this Third Supplemental Indenture by the Company, the
Existing Guarantors and the Additional Guarantors shall bind each of their successors and assigns,
whether so expressed or not. All agreements of the Trustee in this Third Supplemental Indenture
shall bind its successors and assigns.

     2.7 The laws of the State of New York, without regard to principles of conflicts of laws,
shall govern this Third Supplemental Indenture, the Securities and the Guarantees.

     2.8 Except as amended by this Third Supplemental Indenture, the terms and provisions of the
Indenture shall remain in full force and effect.

     2.9 This Third Supplemental Indenture may not be used to interpret another indenture, loan or

be used to interpret this Third Supplemental Indenture.

     2.10 NO RECOURSE AGAINST OTHERS. A director, officer, controlling person, employee or
stockholder, as such, of the Company or any Guarantor or any successor person thereof shall not
have any liability for any Obligations, covenants or agreements of the Company or any Guarantor
under the Securities or the Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of or by reason of such
obligations, covenants or agreements or their creation. Each Holder by accepting a Security waives
and releases all such liability. The waiver and releases are part of the consideration for the
issue of the Securities.

     2.11 The Trustee accepts the modifications of the trust effected by this Third Supplemental
Indenture, but only upon the terms and conditions set forth in the Indenture. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Trustee assumes no responsibility for the correctness of the
recitals herein contained which shall be taken as the statements of the Company and the Trustee
shall not be responsible or accountable in any way whatsoever for or with respect to the validity
or execution or sufficiency of this Third Supplemental Indenture and the Trustee makes no
representation with respect thereto.
