History[edit]
Founded by Manny Mashouf in 1976, who emigrated from Iran to the United States in the early 1970s, where he opened the first Bebe store in San Francisco[5] during a time when three categories dominated the women's wear market: junior, bridge and misses.[citation needed] The name 'Bebe' (pronounced as Bee-Bee) is a portmanteau derived from the soliloquy from Shakespeare's play Hamlet in which the eponymous Prince ponders:To be or not to be[6] The name is never capitalized as it is a combination of two verbs forming a metaphorical verb as whole. Founder Manny Mashouf came up with the name after a conversation that was had at a party he attended in San Francisco during the 1970s shortly before he established the brand.
Mashouf owns approximately 55% of the company.[7] It was announced in 2015 that Mashouf was to sell his 59% stake in Bebe.[8]
In 2016 a Telephone Consumer Protection Act (“TCPA”) class action lawsuit was filed against Bebe Stores, Inc. (“Bebe”) . The Plaintiff sought to certify a nationwide class consisting of all people who provided their cell phone numbers to Bebe at one of Bebe’s brick-and-mortar stores and subsequently received text messages from Bebe at any point from January 2010 through the present.[citation needed]
In March 2017, bebe announced that it will close all stores in 2017, and become an online-only retailer.[9]
Stores[edit]




Bebe stores headquarters in Brisbane






A Bebe store, at Aventura Mall in Aventura, Florida


The company operates 312 stores, of which 215 are Bebe stores, 32 are 2b Bebe stores, 64 are BebeSport stores (this includes bebe/bebeSport 2-in-1 stores) and one is a Bebe accessories store. These stores are located in the United States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and Canada. Bebe also has an international division in Lebanon, Kuwait, Egypt, Israel, Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Thailand, Turkey, and UAE.
The first store was opened in San Francisco in 1976 as Bebe. The company launched BebeSport in year 2003 to focus on active lifestyle via sportswear, tops, sweaters, outerwear, and accessories. In 2009, BebeSport stores were converted to PH8 with BebeSport product now sold in Bebe and 2b Bebe stores. The company converted BebeSport stores to PH8 stores in November 2009. PH8 offers casual weekend apparel, work-out attire and accessories such as bags, shoes and seasonal items.[citation needed] Bebe's outlet division 2b Bebe provided clearance merchandise, Bebe logo merchandise and special cuts produced under the 2b Bebe label exclusively for the outlet stores.[10] As of 2012, Bebe has launched a bridal wear line available in stores throughout United States. Additional bridal salons were under consideration, however the venture was eventually abandoned due to poor sales. The bridal wear line debuted with a collection designed by Project Runway runner up Rami Kashou.[11]
On April 21, 2017, Bebe announced it would close its remaining 168 brick-and-mortar locations. The company said it expected to incur losses with the closures, but did not disclose the estimate.[4]
Marketing[edit]
To further brand exposure, the company signs celebrities for ad campaigns. Brenda Song was the face of Bebe's 2007 ad campaign. The company signed actresses Rebecca Romijn as the face of Bebe from Spring 2007 through Spring 2008 and Eva Longoria as the face of BebeSport from spring 2007 through spring 2009.[10] Mischa Barton was the face of Bebe's 2006 ad campaign.
In 2007, Bebe selected advertising agency MD70,[12] with Creative Direction by Fredrik Peterhoff[13] to produce Bebe Holiday and Spring 2009, Bebe Sports and Bebe Accessories Spring 2009 campaign.[14] Photographed by Camilla Åkrans, styled by Julia von Boehm and shot in Beverly Hills, Los Angeles, the Bebe Spring campaign features model Anne Marie van Dijk. The spring campaign appeared in the February and March titles of Vogue, Elle, Cosmopolitan, and Glamour, as well as billboards and phone kiosks in New York, Los Angeles, and Las Vegas. A campaign video will run in stores and online at Bebe Video YouTube channel.
Events[edit]
Bebe has semi-annual collection preview events where clients are invited to preview the latest collections at bebe stores. Additionally, the company partners with national and regional magazines to host events benefiting non-profit organizations.[15]
Design and manufacturing[edit]
The company designs and develops the majority of merchandise in-house with outsourced manufacturing.
Executives[edit]
On August 9, 2010, Emilia Fabricant became president of Bebe Stores. She reported directly to CEO Manny Mashouf and her core responsibilities included oversight of design, marketing, merchandising, Internet sales, production, and retail planning. In 2012 she left to take a position at Aéropostale. Mashouf decided to take a lesser role as a non-executive chairman and hired Steve Birkhold to take the reins as CEO. Birkhold has extensive experience in retail as U.S CEO of Diesel Jeans and CEO of Lacoste.[16] Upon Birkhold's resignation in June 2014, the board of directors appointed Jim Wiggett, currently Chief Executive Officer of Jackson Hole Group, as Interim Chief Executive Officer of bebe. On December 15, 2014, bebe announced that Wiggett had been named Chief Executive Officer and appointed to the company's board of directors effective immediately.[17]

History[edit]
Founded by Manny Mashouf in 1976, who emigrated from Iran to the United States in the early 1970s, where he opened the first Bebe store in San Francisco[5] during a time when three categories dominated the women's wear market: junior, bridge and misses.[citation needed] The name 'Bebe' (pronounced as Bee-Bee) is a portmanteau derived from the soliloquy from Shakespeare's play Hamlet in which the eponymous Prince ponders:To be or not to be[6] The name is never capitalized as it is a combination of two verbs forming a metaphorical verb as whole. Founder Manny Mashouf came up with the name after a conversation that was had at a party he attended in San Francisco during the 1970s shortly before he established the brand.
Mashouf owns approximately 55% of the company.[7] It was announced in 2015 that Mashouf was to sell his 59% stake in Bebe.[8]
In 2016 a Telephone Consumer Protection Act (“TCPA”) class action lawsuit was filed against Bebe Stores, Inc. (“Bebe”) . The Plaintiff sought to certify a nationwide class consisting of all people who provided their cell phone numbers to Bebe at one of Bebe’s brick-and-mortar stores and subsequently received text messages from Bebe at any point from January 2010 through the present.[citation needed]
In March 2017, bebe announced that it will close all stores in 2017, and become an online-only retailer.[9]

The company operates 312 stores, of which 215 are Bebe stores, 32 are 2b Bebe stores, 64 are BebeSport stores (this includes bebe/bebeSport 2-in-1 stores) and one is a Bebe accessories store. These stores are located in the United States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and Canada. Bebe also has an international division in Lebanon, Kuwait, Egypt, Israel, Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Thailand, Turkey, and UAE.
The first store was opened in San Francisco in 1976 as Bebe. The company launched BebeSport in year 2003 to focus on active lifestyle via sportswear, tops, sweaters, outerwear, and accessories. In 2009, BebeSport stores were converted to PH8 with BebeSport product now sold in Bebe and 2b Bebe stores. The company converted BebeSport stores to PH8 stores in November 2009. PH8 offers casual weekend apparel, work-out attire and accessories such as bags, shoes and seasonal items.[citation needed] Bebe's outlet division 2b Bebe provided clearance merchandise, Bebe logo merchandise and special cuts produced under the 2b Bebe label exclusively for the outlet stores.[10] As of 2012, Bebe has launched a bridal wear line available in stores throughout United States. Additional bridal salons were under consideration, however the venture was eventually abandoned due to poor sales. The bridal wear line debuted with a collection designed by Project Runway runner up Rami Kashou.[11]
On April 21, 2017, Bebe announced it would close its remaining 168 brick-and-mortar locations. The company said it expected to incur losses with the closures, but did not disclose the estimate.[4]
Marketing[edit]
To further brand exposure, the company signs celebrities for ad campaigns. Brenda Song was the face of Bebe's 2007 ad campaign. The company signed actresses Rebecca Romijn as the face of Bebe from Spring 2007 through Spring 2008 and Eva Longoria as the face of BebeSport from spring 2007 through spring 2009.[10] Mischa Barton was the face of Bebe's 2006 ad campaign.
In 2007, Bebe selected advertising agency MD70,[12] with Creative Direction by Fredrik Peterhoff[13] to produce Bebe Holiday and Spring 2009, Bebe Sports and Bebe Accessories Spring 2009 campaign.[14] Photographed by Camilla Åkrans, styled by Julia von Boehm and shot in Beverly Hills, Los Angeles, the Bebe Spring campaign features model Anne Marie van Dijk. The spring campaign appeared in the February and March titles of Vogue, Elle, Cosmopolitan, and Glamour, as well as billboards and phone kiosks in New York, Los Angeles, and Las Vegas. A campaign video will run in stores and online at Bebe Video YouTube channel.
Events[edit]
Bebe has semi-annual collection preview events where clients are invited to preview the latest collections at bebe stores. Additionally, the company partners with national and regional magazines to host events benefiting non-profit organizations.[15]
Design and manufacturing[edit]
The company designs and develops the majority of merchandise in-house with outsourced manufacturing.
Executives[edit]
On August 9, 2010, Emilia Fabricant became president of Bebe Stores. She reported directly to CEO Manny Mashouf and her core responsibilities included oversight of design, marketing, merchandising, Internet sales, production, and retail planning. In 2012 she left to take a position at Aéropostale. Mashouf decided to take a lesser role as a non-executive chairman and hired Steve Birkhold to take the reins as CEO. Birkhold has extensive experience in retail as U.S CEO of Diesel Jeans and CEO of Lacoste.[16] Upon Birkhold's resignation in June 2014, the board of directors appointed Jim Wiggett, currently Chief Executive Officer of Jackson Hole Group, as Interim Chief Executive Officer of bebe. On December 15, 2014, bebe announced that Wiggett had been named Chief Executive Officer and appointed to the company's board of directors effective immediately.[17]

Consac calls for Bebe Stores Chairman Manny Mashouf and Board to sell or take retailer private

Aug 18, 2014, 09:10 ET
		  		  					
						 from   Consac, LLC 











 
















































 

 




















 


LOS ANGELES, Aug. 18, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- A shareholder who holds approximately three (3) million shares of the common stock of bebe stores, Inc. today called upon Manny Mashouf , the company's chairman and controlling shareholder, and its Board of Directors to either sell the company to a third party or take it private in a transaction sponsored by the Mashouf family.  Mr. Mashouf owns approximately 53 percent of the common stock of the company, whose performance has declined over the past several years.
Ryan Drexler, president of Consac, LLC, questioned the appropriateness of Mr. Mashouf's role as both a paid director of the company and consultant to the Board.  He also pointed to "the absence of the chairman in actively guiding the company to a successful and sustainable recovery," citing the company's lack of: 

Attention to fashion focus, innovation and design, hallmarks of the company's growth under the creative direction of Neda Mashouf, who left the company after divorcing Mr. Mashouf several years ago. 

Progress in developing a compelling e-commerce offering.

A succession plan and the difficulty of identifying candidates with the "right mix" of merchandising and financial know-how amid dramatically shifting skills for retail fashion executives.

Fast fashion retail experience of the Board and management.
"I believe the Board must consider alternatives that are in the best interest of the company's public shareholders," Mr. Drexler wrote.  "I urge you to explore the possibilities available to the Board in creating sustainable value for all investors."
In his letter, Mr. Drexler, referred to a recent analyst report that concluded that bebe's:

Current return on equity significantly trails that of the specialty retail industry and is lower than ROE from the same quarter the prior year.

Reported Q3 gross profit margin of 32.4 percent, decreased from the same quarter last year, and that the company's reported net profit margin of almost -26.0 percent is significantly below that of the industry average.

Q3 net operating cash flow has decreased almost 98 percent compared to the same quarter last year.

bebe's stock price continues to slide dramatically.
Mr. Drexler's letter to the bebe stores Board of Directors follows:
August 14, 2014
Board of Directorsbebe stores, Inc.400 Valley DriveBrisbane, CA 94005
Gentlemen:
Twice in the past month, I have made attempts to meet with Mr. Mashouf to discuss issues critical to the future of the company; namely, the inability of management and the Board to meaningfully address the company's persistently lagging operating performance and the resulting underperformance of its stock.  Twice I have been rebuffed.
As the owner of 2.7 million shares of bebe common stock, I believe that most stockholders share my concerns.  A 6/30/14 analysis of bebe's most recently reported financial performance (Q3 2014) by TheStreet concludes that:

Current return on equity is lower than ROE from the same quarter the prior year and significantly trails that of the specialty retail industry.

bebe's reported Q3 gross profit margin of 32.4 percent decreased from the same quarter last year.  In addition, the company's reported net profit margin of almost -26.0 percent is significantly below that of the industry average.

The company's Q3 net operating cash flow has decreased almost 98 percent compared to the same quarter last year.

bebe's stock price continues to slide. 
These facts lead me and others to conclude that the company needs to explore possibilities for maximizing shareholder value, including a sale of the company, whether to a third party or through a going private transaction.  Other issues leading to this conclusion include the following: 
Governance 

I believe Mr. Mashouf continues to collect directors' compensation plus fees payable to the consulting firm of which he president.  SKID Holdings LLC, headquartered in Las Vegas, is paid almost $47,000 a month, or $500,000 a year, plus costs amounting to more than 20 percent of the annual fee, to provide consulting services to the bebe Board.  As a shareholder, I find this questionable.

Moreover, other than his role as chairman of bebe and president of the company that provides its Board with consulting services, Mr. Mashouf has seemingly been absent in actively guiding the company to a successful and sustainable recovery.   I believe the inability of management and the Board to implement a workable strategy follows from this.
Product Design and Merchandising

The company has been unsuccessful in communicating a convincing strategy that addresses the core issues of declining sales, dwindling customer traffic and lack of fashion focus and imagination. bebe has lost its fashion relevance.  It has all but disappeared from "the radar."

The company's financial strategy as discussed in its most recent earnings report seems to have supplanted much-needed attention to fashion focus, innovation and design, hallmarks of the company's growth under the creative direction of Neda Mashouf. 

bebe's advertising and messaging are confused, unappealing and unmemorable.  Who is the "bebe girl?" 
E-Commerce

Progress has been slow in developing a compelling e-commerce offering that can offset the increasingly high cost of rent, store personnel and the deleveraging of store infrastructure. The announced closings of the b2 stores and the elimination of concomitant elimination of jobs do little, if anything, to demonstrate to investors positive movement in addressing the company's retail shortcomings.   
Management Experience and Stability

The issue of succession planning has, to my knowledge, not been publicly addressed.  Once the company does so, it will find that the skills for retail fashion executives have shifted dramatically and identifying candidates with the right mix of merchandising and financial know-how will be difficult.

The Board and management lack adequate fast fashion retail experience.
I have the utmost regard for what Mr. Mashouf and his associates have achieved for shareholders in the past.  At the same time, I see no evidence that such performance can be repeated under the company's current structure.  I believe the Board must consider alternatives that are in the best interest of the company's public shareholders, including a sale of the company to a third party or a going private transaction sponsored by the Mashouf family.  
I urge you to immediately explore the possibilities available to the Board in creating sustainable value for all investors.  I continue to welcome the opportunity to meet with management and the Board.
Very truly yours,
Ryan DrexlerPresident

Page Content​Manny MashoufFounder and Chairman, bebe Clothing StoresSan Francisco State UniversityManny Mashouf’s life story is a particularly American archetype—that of the immigrant and self-made man who finds great success and, in gratitude, gives back generously to the society that has afforded him such opportunity. An entrepreneur and philanthropist, he is the founder and board chairman of the highly successful bebe chain of women’s clothing stores, now almost 300 across the nation.Arriving in the U.S. from his native Iran with minimal English skills but with high aspirations, Mr. Mashouf rapidly mastered the language, then higher education. At San Francisco State University, from which he graduated in 1966, he explored many subjects beyond his political science major. In fact, the name of his corporation was inspired, he says, by Shakespeare’s “To be or not to be” soliloquy from Hamlet.With success has come Mr. Mashouf’s conviction that he has an obligation to put his wealth to work for the greater good. While his generosity has been broad-based, his major cause of choice has been education: “I believe that the most effective way to improve the quality of our lives for the future is to improve the quality of our children’s education,” he says.Mr. Mashouf has never forgotten his roots at San Francisco State University. He is an 11-year member of the College of Business Advisory Board and has made significant donations to the College to help it be competitive in recruiting and hiring outstanding faculty. Generations of faculty and students in the arts will experience his generosity when the Mashouf Creative Arts Center opens. In 2005, the university named him its Alumnus of the Year.Manny Mashouf’s philanthropy, like his intellectual interests, is broad-based. He contributes to many causes in Los Angeles and was recently honored by the Make-a-Wish Foundation of Greater Los Angeles with its Individual Wish Granter award.In recognition of his business acumen, generosity and commitment to giving back to his community, the Board of Trustees of the California State University and San Francisco State University are proud to confer on Manny Mashouf the honorary degree of Doctor of Humane Letters.​
