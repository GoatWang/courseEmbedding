	The aggregate market value of the voting
	and non-voting stock held by non-affiliates of the Registrant, as of June 29, 2016, the last business day of the Registrant’s
	most recently completed second fiscal quarter, was approximately $647,570,019, computed using the closing price on that day of
	$36.82. Solely for purposes of this disclosure, shares of common stock held by named executive officers, directors and 5% or greater
	shareholders of the Registrant as of such date have been excluded because such persons may be deemed to be affiliates. This determination
	of executive officers and directors as affiliates is not necessarily a conclusive determination for any other purposes.


	As of March 1, 2017, there were 25,470,089
	shares of Class A common stock outstanding and 10,937,592 shares of Class B common stock outstanding.

	The amounts in this column represent the aggregate grant date fair value of the performance stock

	is 112.0% of the performance stock units’ target performance goals, and computed in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718. The
	assumptions used in determining such amounts are described in Note 13 to our audited consolidated financial statements included
	in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 28, 2016. For fiscal 2016, if the highest level of performance
	conditions is achieved, then the grant date fair value of the performance stock units would be $374,693, $187,346 and $148,916
	for Mr. Garutti, Mr. Uttz and Ms. Rubenzer, respectively.

	Messrs. Garutti and Uttz is through January 30, 2018 and (ii) Ms. Rubenzer is through May 5, 2019, subject to automatic one-year

	Base Salary, Annual
	Bonus and Equity Compensation



	 


	Pursuant to their employment agreements,
	Messrs. Garutti and Uttz were entitled to base salaries in fiscal 2015 of $400,000 and $330,000, respectively, which were increased
	for fiscal 2016 to $500,000 and $350,000, respectively. Pursuant to her employment agreement, Ms. Rubenzer was entitled to a base
	salary in fiscal 2016 of $235,591.


	 


	In addition, pursuant to their employment
	agreements, Messrs. Garutti and Uttz and Ms. Rubenzer are eligible to receive annual performance-based cash bonuses upon the attainment
	of company performance goals established by our Compensation Committee. The amount of the annual performance-based cash bonus that
	may be received by Messrs. Garutti and Uttz and upon attainment of target performance for any fiscal year will be 50% of base salary,
	35% of base salary, and 30% of base salary, respectively, and the maximum amount of the annual performance-based cash bonus that
	may be received by Messrs. Garutti and Uttz and Ms. Rubenzer for any fiscal year will be 100% of base salary, 70% of base salary,
	and 40% of base salary, respectively.


	 


	Under the employment agreements, Messrs.
	Garutti and Uttz and Ms. Rubenzer also will be eligible for annual equity awards, the form and terms of which will be determined
	by our Compensation Committee in its discretion.


	 



	Severance




	 




	Mr. Garutti and
	Ms. Rubenzer



	 


	The employment agreement for Mr. Garutti
	and Ms. Rubenzer provides for severance upon a termination by us without cause or by Mr. Garutti or Ms. Rubenzer for good reason,
	in each case, subject to the execution and non-revocation of a waiver and release of claims by Mr. Garutti or Ms. Rubenzer, as
	applicable.


	 


	Upon such a termination, Mr. Garutti
	or Ms. Rubenzer, as applicable, is entitled to severance consisting of (a) continued base salary through the first anniversary
	of the termination of his or her employment, (b) a prorated annual cash bonus for the year of termination based on actual individual
	and company performance, (c) accelerated vesting of a prorated portion of the annual equity awards that would have vested at the
	end of the year of termination absent such termination, such portion to be based on the number of full fiscal months elapsed during
	such fiscal year, and (d) reimbursement of COBRA premiums such that the cost of coverage is equal to the cost for then current
	employees for a period of up to 12 months.


	 


	For purposes of the employment agreements,
	the company will have “cause” to terminate Mr. Garutti’s or Ms. Rubenzer’s employment upon (a) his or her
	willful misconduct, gross negligence or act of dishonesty with regard to the company or any of its affiliates, which in either
	case, results in or could reasonably be expected to result in material harm to the company or such affiliate, (b) his or her willful
	and continued failure to attempt to perform his or her duties with the company or any of its affiliates (other than any such failure
	resulting from disability), which failure is not remedied within 30 days after receiving written notice thereof, (c) his or her
	conviction of (or his or her plea of guilty or nolo contendere to) any felony involving moral turpitude (other than traffic related
	offenses or as a result of vicarious liability), or (d) his or her material breach of any material provision of the employment
	agreement, which breach is not remedied within 10 days after receiving written notice thereof.

	For purposes of the employment agreements,
	each of Mr. Garutti and Ms. Rubenzer will have “good reason” to terminate his or her employment after the occurrence,
	without his or her consent, of (a) any material adverse change in base salary, position, duties, responsibilities, authority, title
	or reporting obligations, or the assignment of duties that are materially inconsistent with his position, (b) a relocation of principal
	business location by more than 50 miles from its then current location, or (c) any other material breach by the company of the
	employment agreement or any other agreement with him or her. However, no termination for good reason will be effective unless (i)
	Messrs. Garutti or Uttz or Ms. Rubenzer, as applicable, provides the company with at least 30 days prior written notice of his
	or her intent to resign for good reason (which notice must be provided within 60 days following the occurrence of the event(s)
	purported to constitute good reason); (ii) the company has not remedied the alleged violation(s) within the 30-day period; and
	(iii) Messrs. Garutti or Uttz’s or Ms. Rubenzer’s resignation, as applicable, becomes effective no later than 30 days
	after the Company has either failed to cure such event or indicated that it will not cure such event.


	 



	Mr. Uttz



	 


	The transition services agreement for
	Mr. Uttz provided that Mr. Uttz will be entitled to (a) all accrued, but unused vacation pay through his effective resignation
	date, (b) 100% of his annual performance-based cash bonus for fiscal 2016, (c) accelerated vesting of one-third of the performance
	stock units granted on April 26, 2016, (d) reimbursement by the company through June 30, 2017 of a portion of any COBRA premiums
	equal to the amount the company pays for the premiums of other executive level employees, and (e) transition services payments
	equal to Mr. Uttz’s weekly rate of pay of $7,067.31 for each week (whether full or prorated) following the effective resignation
	date through June 30, 2017.


	 



	Restrictive Covenants



	 


	Pursuant to their respective employment
	agreements, Mr. Garutti and Ms. Rubenzer are subject to certain non-competition and non-solicitation restrictions during employment
	and for a 12-month period after termination of employment. During the restricted period, Mr. Garutti and Ms. Rubenzer may not compete,
	directly or indirectly, with the Company in the business of developing, managing, and/or operating of (a) “better burger”
	restaurants, (b) “quick service” or “fast food” restaurants with an emphasis on hamburgers, or (c) “fast
	casual” restaurants. No severance payments or benefits described above shall be paid following the first date that Mr. Garutti
	or Ms. Rubenzer, as applicable, violates his or her restrictive covenants; provided that, if employment is terminated by the company
	without cause or by Mr. Garutti or Ms. Rubenzer for good reason, Mr. Garutti or Ms. Rubenzer, as applicable, may compete in the
	“fast casual” restaurant business during the restricted period without violating his or her employment agreement but
	he or she will not receive any severance after the date he begins to compete in the “fast casual” restaurant business.


	 


	Pursuant to his transition services agreement,
	Mr. Uttz has waived and released the company from any and all claims, and he has agreed that, if he competes with the Company in
	the business of developing, managing, and/or operating of (a) “better burger” restaurants, (b) “quick service”
	or “fast food” restaurants with an emphasis on hamburgers, or (c) “fast casual” restaurants prior to June
	30, 2017, he will not receive any unpaid portion of the transition services payment.


	 



	Bonuses



	 


	In fiscal 2016, each of our Named Executive
	Officers was eligible to earn an annual performance-based cash bonus from the company. This 2016 bonus for each of our Named Executive
	Officers consisted of two components: 50% was based upon the achievement of company total revenue targets and 50% was based upon
	the achievement of company adjusted EBITDA. Mr. Garutti was eligible to receive a target bonus in the amount of 50% of his annual
	base salary, Mr. Uttz was eligible to receive a target bonus in the amount of 35% of his annual base salary, and Ms. Rubenzer was
	eligible to receive a target bonus in the amount of 30% of her annual base salary upon the achievement of the applicable objectives.
	In fiscal 2016, our company’s total revenue was 109.7% of the target amount of $244,662,550 and our adjusted EBITDA was 110.2%
	of the target amount of $47,431,591, resulting in a payment to Mr. Garutti of 147.5% of his target bonus, to Mr. Uttz
	of 147.5% of his target bonus and to Ms. Rubenzer of 143.4% of her target bonus. The actual amounts of the performance-based
	cash bonuses paid to each Named Executive Officer for fiscal 2016 performance are set forth above in the Summary Compensation Table
	in the column entitled “Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation.”


	 


	For purposes of the annual performance-based
	cash bonus, the company defines adjusted EBITDA as excluding equity-based compensation expense, deferred rent expense, losses on
	the disposal of property and equipment, as well as certain non-recurring items that we don't believe directly
	reflect our core operations and may not be indicative of our recurring business operations. EBITDA is defined as net income before
	net interest, income tax expense and depreciation and amortization expense.

	Equity-Based Compensation



	 


	We adopted the 2015 Incentive Award Plan
	in order to facilitate the grant of cash and equity incentives to directors, employees (including our Named Executive Officers)
	and consultants of our Company and certain of its affiliates and to enable our Company and certain of its affiliates to obtain
	and retain services of these individuals, which is essential to our long-term success.


	 


	On April 26, 2016, the Company granted
	performance stock units (“

	PSUs

	”) under the 2015 Incentive Award Plan to our Named Executive Officers. The PSUs
	are payable in restricted stock units (“

	RSUs

	”) only to the extent the Company achieves the total revenue and
	adjusted EBITDA performance goals, which are further described below, for fiscal 2016. Any RSUs that are issued will vest, subject
	to the Named Executive Officer’s continued employment with the Company, ratably over a three-year period commencing on the
	first anniversary of the date the PSUs were granted. Issued RSUs may vest sooner for a Named Executive Officer’s death or
	disability.


	 


	The PSUs have two equally-weighted performance
	goals: total revenue and adjusted EBITDA. For purposes of the PSUs, (a) total revenue means revenue, inclusive of revenue from
	Company-owned operations and licensing revenue from international and domestic licensed operations and (b) adjusted EBITDA means
	net income before (i) interest, (ii) taxes, (iii) depreciation and (iv) amortization, excluding certain non-cash and other items
	not considered in the Company’s evaluation of ongoing performance, including equity-based compensation expense, non-cash
	deferred rent charges, and certain non-recurring charges.


	 


	The amount of RSUs issued to a Named
	Executive Officer is a percentage, ranging from zero to 125%, of the Named Executive Officer’s RSU target and is based on
	the Company’s achievement of each performance goal’s target, which ranges from 95% to 110% (or greater) achievement
	for the total revenue goal and 95% to 125% (or greater) achievement for the adjusted EBITDA goal.


	 


	In March 2017, our Compensation Committee
	certified that the Company’s total revenue was 109.7% of the target amount of $244,662,550 and our adjusted EBITDA was 109.3%
	of the target amount of $45,940,835. Accordingly, Mr. Garutti, Mr. Uttz and Ms. Rubenzer received 9,113 RSUs, 1,518 RSUs and 3,621
	RSUs, respectively, subject to the vesting schedule described above.


	 



	Stock Ownership Policy




	 



	In addition, in connection with the IPO,
	we adopted an executive stock ownership policy requiring Mr. Garutti, as of January 15, 2020, to hold shares of our Class A common
	stock or LLC Interests with a value equal to two times his annual base salary. Securities that qualify in determining whether Mr.
	Garutti has satisfied the shareholding requirements include (i) issued and outstanding shares of Class A common stock held beneficially
	or of record, (ii) issued and outstanding LLC Interests held beneficially or of record, (iii) issued and outstanding shares of
	Class A common stock or LLC Interests held by a qualifying trust (i.e., a trust created for the benefit of the executive officer,
	his spouse or members of his immediate family), (iv) issued and outstanding shares of Class A common stock or LLC Interests held
	by a 401(k) or other qualified pension or profit-sharing plan for the benefit of the executive officer, and (v) shares of Class
	A common stock underlying vested Shake Shack time-based stock options and restricted stock units deliverable upon exercise or settlement
	in full, less tax withholdings and, in the case of stock options, a number of shares of Class A common stock with a value equal
	to the exercise price thereof.


	 


	The stock ownership policy also applied to Mr. Uttz prior
	to his resignation.


	 



	Retirement Plans



	 


	USHG currently sponsors a 401(k) retirement
	savings plan (the “

	401(k) plan

	”), in which the Company’s employees, including our Named Executive Officers,
	may participate, subject to satisfying eligibility requirements. The Internal Revenue Code allows eligible employees to defer a
	portion of their compensation, within prescribed limits, on a pre-tax basis through contributions to the 401(k) plan. The Company
	does not currently match contributions made under the 401(k) plan by our Named Executive Officers and other highly compensated
	employees. We believe that providing a vehicle for tax-deferred retirement savings though the 401(k) plan adds to the overall desirability of our
	executive compensation package and further incentivizes our employees, including our Named Executive Officers, in accordance with
	our compensation policies.

	Employee Benefits



	 


	All of our full-time employees, including
	our Named Executive Officers, are eligible to participate in health and welfare plans maintained by the Company, including:


	 







	·




	medical, dental and vision benefits;





	 







	·




	medical and dependent care flexible spending accounts; and





	 







	·




	short-term and long-term disability insurance.





	 


	Our Named Executive Officers participate
	in these plans on the same basis as other eligible employees. We do not maintain any supplemental health and welfare plans for
	our Named Executive Officers. We believe the benefits described above are necessary and appropriate to provide a competitive compensation
	package to our Named Executive Officers.



	 




	No Tax Gross-Ups



	 


	We do not make gross-up payments to cover
	our Named Executive Officers’ personal income taxes or excise taxes that may pertain to any of the compensation or perquisites
	paid or provided by our Company.



	 




	Special Bonus Agreements



	 


	In March 2011, Mr. Garutti entered into
	a Special Bonus Agreement (as amended, the “

	Special Bonus Agreement

	”) with USHG with respect to Mr. Garutti’s
	services to SSE Holdings. This Special Bonus Agreement provides for the payment of a special bonus in the amount of $2,450,000
	by USHG to Mr. Garutti in the event of a change in control or an initial public offering of SSE Holdings prior to March 11, 2018,
	which will be payable to him in March 2018. On October 30, 2014, USHG, Mr. Garutti and SSE Holdings entered into an Assignment
	and Assumption Agreement, pursuant to which USHG assigned this obligation to SSE Holdings. The Special Bonus Agreement contains
	restrictive covenants prohibiting Mr. Garutti from competing with us and from soliciting any of our or of USHG’s employees
	or contractors for one year following his termination of employment. The restrictive covenants also prohibit the unauthorized use
	of confidential information. As a result of the IPO, the $2,450,000 payment will be made to Mr. Garutti pursuant to the Special
	Bonus Agreement in March 2018.

	RISK
	CONSIDERATIONS IN OUR COMPENSATION PROGRAM


	.


	 


	We conducted an assessment of our compensation
	policies and practices for our employees and concluded that these policies and practices are not reasonably likely to have a material
	adverse effect on our Company. The Company’s compensation programs and policies mitigate risk by combining performance-based,
	long-term compensation elements with payouts that are highly correlated to the value delivered to stockholders. The combination
	of performance measures for annual bonuses and the equity compensation programs for executive officers, as well as the multi-year
	vesting schedules for equity awards encourage Employees to maintain both a short- and long-term view with respect to Company performance.


	 



	DIRECTOR COMPENSATION



	 


	Prior to the IPO, none of our directors
	received compensation as a director.


	 


	In connection with the IPO, we approved
	and implemented a non-employee director compensation policy that awarded each non-employee director with an option to purchase
	shares of our Class A common stock in consideration for his or her service on our Board of Directors.

	On May 19, 2016, the day immediately
	following the annual meeting of stockholders for fiscal 2016, the Board of Directors approved and implemented an amended non-employee
	director compensation policy that awarded each non-employee director with a combination of cash (50%) and certain equity-based
	compensation (50%) in consideration for his or her service on our Board of Directors as described below: (A) cash compensation
	equal to (1) $25,000 for each director affiliated with or who had any employment or service relationship with any significant stockholder
	or affiliate thereof (with a “significant stockholder” being any “person” or related “group”
	of “persons” (as used in Sections 13(d) of the Exchange Act) that, as of such date, held 10% or more of the total combined
	voting power of all classes of common stock of Shake Shack), payable in four equal installments following such non-employee director’s
	attendance at each of the Company’s quarterly Board meetings; (2) $37,500 for each non-affiliate director, payable in four
	equal installments following such non-employee director’s attendance at each of the Company’s quarterly Board meetings,
	and (3) for the chairperson of each committee of the Board of Directors, an additional $5,000, payable in four equal installments
	following such non-employee director’s attendance at each of the Company’s quarterly Board meetings; and (B) an option
	to purchase shares of our Class A common stock (1) with an aggregate grant date fair value of $25,000, if an affiliate director,
	on such day, (2) with an aggregate grant date fair value of $37,500, if a non-affiliate director, on such day, and (3) with an
	aggregate grant date fair value of $5,000, if the chairperson of a committee of the Board of Directors, on such day.


	 


	The terms of each such annual equity
	award described above is set forth in a written award agreement between the applicable non-employee director and us, which provides
	for vesting after one year of continued service as a director, subject to acceleration upon a change of control.


	 


	For fiscal 2017, the Board of Directors
	has approved and implemented a further amendment to the non-employee director compensation policy to award each non-employee director
	with a combination of cash (50%) and restricted stock units (50%), rather than options, with the same total aggregate grant date
	fair value as in fiscal 2016. Fiscal 2017 awards will be granted as of the date of the Annual Meeting.


	 


	The non-employee director compensation
	policy may be further amended, modified or terminated by our Board of Directors at any time in its sole discretion.


	 


	In addition to the non-employee director
	compensation policy, in connection with the IPO, we adopted a director stock ownership policy encouraging non-employee directors
	to hold shares of our Class A common stock and/or LLC Interests with a value equal to or in excess of the fair value of the non-qualified
	stock option or other equity award that the non-employee director received as an annual equity award on or following the most recent
	annual meeting.


	 


	The following table set forth the compensation
	for each of our non-employee directors in fiscal 2016. The awards below were made in accordance with the above compensation amounts.

	Security Ownership
	of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management




	 


	The following table shows information
	about the beneficial ownership of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock, as of the Determination Date, for:


	 







	·




	each person known by us to beneficially own more than 5% of
	our outstanding Class A common stock or Class B common stock;





	 







	·




	each of our directors and Named Executive Officers; and





	 







	·




	all of our directors and executive officers as a group.





	 


	The number of shares beneficially owned
	by each stockholder is determined under rules promulgated by the SEC under which beneficial ownership includes any shares as to
	which the individual or entity has sole or shared voting power or investment power. In computing the number of shares beneficially
	owned by an individual or entity and the percentage ownership of that person, shares of common stock subject to options, or other
	rights held by such person that are currently exercisable or will become exercisable within 60 days of the Determination Date,
	are considered outstanding, although these shares are not considered outstanding for purposes of computing the percentage ownership
	of any other person. However, in computing the number of shares of Class A common stock beneficially owned by an individual or
	entity, we do not include LLC Interests, which are exchangeable into Class A common stock, held by such individual or entity because
	the voting rights represented by the LLC Interests are reflected in the shares of Class B common stock reported for such individual
	or entity. Unless otherwise indicated, the address of all listed stockholders is c/o Shake Shack Inc., 24 Union Square East,
	5

	th

	Floor, New York, NY 10003. Each of the stockholders listed has sole voting and investment power with respect to
	the shares beneficially owned by the stockholder unless noted otherwise, subject to community property laws where applicable.

	Certain Relationships
	and Related Party Transactions





	 




	Agreements with USHG Subsidiaries



	 


	Daniel Meyer, our Chairman of the Board of Directors, serves
	as USHG’s Chief Executive Officer. We and subsidiaries of USHG are parties to a Management Services Agreement and a Master
	License Agreement, each as described below.


	 



	Management Services Agreement with USHG, LLC



	 


	On October 16, 2009, we entered into
	a Management Services Agreement with USHG, LLC, a subsidiary of USHG (the “

	Management Company

	”), pursuant to
	which the Management Company has provided management services to SSE Holdings, including executive leadership, strategic development,
	real estate, financial, legal, administrative, operations and human resources services. In exchange for such management services,
	we paid a monthly fee to the Management Company based on our sales for the relevant period. In addition, we agreed to indemnify
	the Management Company to the fullest extent permitted by law from and against all losses arising from its performance under the
	Management Services Agreement.


	 


	We entered into the Amended and Restated
	Management Services Agreement with the Management Company, effective January 2015, pursuant to which the Management Company provides
	reduced management services to SSE Holdings comprised of executive leadership from Mr. Meyer and other members of USHG’s
	senior management; menu innovation advisory services by Mr. Meyer; strategic development advisory
	services by Mr. Meyer; leadership development services; and limited human resources services. In addition, we are no longer obligated
	to pay management fees to the Management Company in connection with any services. The initial term of the Amended and Restated
	Management Services Agreement is through December 31, 2019, with renewal periods. We have also agreed to indemnify the Management
	Company to the fullest extent permitted by law from and against all losses arising from its performance under the Amended and Restated
	Management Services Agreement.

	Master License Agreement with Union Square Events



	 


	In fiscal 2011, we entered into a Master
	License Agreement (as amended, the “

	MLA

	”) with Hudson Yards Sports and Entertainment LLC (doing business as
	Union Square Events) (“

	USE

	”), a subsidiary of USHG, to operate Shake Shack branded limited menu concession stands
	in sports and entertainment venues within the United States. The agreement expires on December 31, 2027 and includes five
	consecutive five-year renewal options at USE’s option. As consideration for these rights, USE pays us a license fee based
	on a percentage of net food sales (as defined in the MLA). USE also pays us a percentage of profits on sales of branded beverages
	(as defined in the MLA). For the fiscal year ended December 28, 2016, Union Square Events paid $309,000 in license fees pursuant
	to the MLA.


	 



	Madison Square Park Conservancy



	 


	Mr. Meyer serves as a director of the
	Madison Square Park Conservancy (“

	MSP Conservancy

	”), with which we have a license agreement and pay license
	fees to operate our Madison Square Park Shack. Amounts paid to Madison Square Park Conservancy as rent amounted to $1,062,000 for
	fiscal 2016. Total amounts due to the MSP Conservancy as of December 28, 2016 were $1,000.



	 




	Share Our Strength



	 


	Mr. Meyer serves as a director of Share
	Our Strength, for which Shake Shack holds the “Great American Shake Sale” every year during the month of
	May to raise money and awareness for childhood hunger. During the Great American Shake Sale, we encourage guests to donate
	money to Share Our Strength’s No Kid Hungry campaign in exchange for a coupon for a free cake-themed shake. All of the guest
	donations we collect go directly to Share Our Strength. We raised a total of $587,000 in fiscal 2016, and the proceeds were
	remitted to Share Our Strength. We incurred costs of approximately $117,000 for fiscal 2016 representing the cost of the free shakes
	redeemed.



	 




	Mobo Systems, Inc.



	 


	Mr. Meyer serves as a director of Mobo Systems, Inc. (also
	known as “

	Olo

	”), a platform we use in connection with our mobile ordering application. No amounts
	were paid to Olo for fiscal 2016. 





	The IPO and Other Organizational Transactions



	 


	In connection with the IPO, we engaged
	in transactions with certain of our directors, executive officers and other persons and entities which are or became holders of
	more than 5% of our Class A common stock or Class B common stock upon the consummation of the IPO and other transactions completed
	in connection with the IPO (collectively, the “

	Organizational Transactions

	”), including entry into the SSE Holdings
	LLC Agreement, the Stockholders Agreement, the Tax Receivable Agreement, and the Registration Rights Agreement, each of which is
	discussed below.



	 




	SSE Holdings LLC Agreement



	 


	We operate our business through SSE Holdings
	and its subsidiaries. We and the owners of SSE Holdings at the time of the IPO entered into SSE Holdings’ third amended and
	restated limited liability company agreement (as amended, the “

	SSE Holdings LLC Agreement

	”), effective February
	4, 2015. The operations of SSE Holdings, and the rights and obligations of the holders of LLC Interests, are set forth in the SSE
	Holdings LLC Agreement.


	 


	The SSE Holdings LLC Agreement provides
	the owners of SSE Holdings following the IPO with the right to have their LLC Interests redeemed for, at our election, either newly-issued
	shares of our Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis or a cash payment equal to a volume weighted average market
	price of one share of Class A common stock for each LLC Interest redeemed (subject to customary adjustments, including for stock
	splits, stock dividends and reclassifications).

	The share settlement will be the default
	payment unless and until a majority of the members of our Board of Directors who do not hold any LLC Interests elect cash settlement.
	In the event of cash settlement, we would issue new shares of Class A common stock and use the proceeds from the sale of these
	newly-issued shares of Class A common stock to fund the cash settlement which, in effect, limits the amount of the cash payment
	to the redeeming member. If we decide to make a cash payment, an owner of SSE Holdings has the option to rescind its redemption
	request within a specified time period.


	 


	Upon the effective date of redemption,
	the redeeming member will surrender its LLC Interests to SSE Holdings for cancellation. Concurrently, we will contribute either
	cash or shares of Class A common stock to SSE Holdings, which will then distribute such cash or shares of Class A common stock
	to the redeeming owner of SSE Holdings to complete the redemption. In addition, SSE Holdings will issue to us an amount of newly-issued
	LLC Interests equal to the number of LLC Interests redeemed from the owner of SSE Holdings.


	 


	In the event of a redemption request
	by an owner of SSE Holdings, we may, alternatively and at our option, effect a direct exchange of cash or our Class A common stock
	for such LLC Interests with such owner of SSE Holdings in lieu of a redemption.


	 


	Whether by redemption or exchange, we
	are obligated to ensure that at all times the number of LLC Interests that we own equals the number of shares of Class A common
	stock issued by us (subject to certain exceptions for treasury shares and shares underlying certain convertible or exchangeable
	securities).


	 


	In fiscal 2016, redemptions were effected for the following
	directors, executive officers and beneficial owners of more than 5% of our Class A common stock or Class B common stock (and immediately
	family members of the foregoing) on the following dates, in the following amounts:

	(1)


	All redemptions effected for Mr. Garutti were done so pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 insider trading plans, adopted on December 16,
	2015 and, upon its expiration, August 23, 2016.




	 






	(2)


	Daniel Meyer may be deemed to share voting and investment power with respect to the shares of the Company’s Class A common
	stock and Class B common stock held by USHG.




	 






	(3)


	Each of the partners of LGP, including Mr. Jonathan D. Sokoloff, may be deemed to have voting and investment power with respect
	to the shares of the Company’s Class A common stock and Class B common stock held by LGP Malted Coinvest LLC and Green Equity
	Investors VI, L.P. Each of these individuals disclaims beneficial ownership of such shares. 




	 



	Stockholders Agreement



	 


	We entered into the stockholders agreement
	(as amended, the “

	Stockholders Agreement

	”) with each member of the Voting Group, effective February 4, 2015.
	USHG, of which Mr. Meyer serves as Chief Executive Officer, is a party to the Stockholders Agreement.


	 


	The Stockholders Agreement, as further
	described below, contains specific rights, obligations and agreements of these parties as owners of our Class A common stock and
	Class B common stock.


	 



	Voting Agreement

	. Under the Stockholders
	Agreement, the members of the Voting Group agree to take all necessary action, including casting all votes to which such members
	are entitled to cast at any annual or special meeting of stockholders, so as to ensure that the composition of our Board of Directors
	and its committees complies with the provisions of the Stockholders Agreement related to the composition of our Board of Directors
	and its committees.


	 


	In addition, the members of the Voting
	Group agree to vote their shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock in favor of the election of the nominees
	of certain members of the Voting Group to our Board of Directors and committees upon their nomination by the nominating and corporate
	governance committee of our Board of Directors.


	 



	Meyer Group Approvals

	. Under the
	Stockholders Agreement, the actions listed below by us or any of our subsidiaries require the approval of the Meyer Group for so
	long as the Meyer Group collectively owns at least 10% of the total shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock owned
	by it immediately following the consummation of the IPO. The actions include:


	 







	·




	change in control transactions;





	 







	·




	the sale, lease or exchange of all or a substantial amount of
	the property and assets of Shake Shack, SSE Holdings or any of SSE Holdings’ subsidiaries, taken as a whole;





	 







	·




	initiating any liquidation, dissolution, bankruptcy or other
	insolvency proceeding involving Shake Shack, SSE Holdings or any of their respective subsidiaries;





	 







	·




	terminating the employment of our Chief Executive Officer or
	hiring a new Chief Executive Officer;

	·




	any authorization or issuance of equity securities of Shake
	Shack or its subsidiaries other than (i) pursuant to any equity incentive plans or arrangements approved by our Board of Directors
	or (ii) upon an exchange of shares of Class B common stock together with SSE Holdings Units for shares of Class A common stock;





	 







	·




	increasing or decreasing the size of our Board of Directors;
	and





	 







	·




	any amendment or amendments to the organizational documents
	of Shake Shack or SSE Holdings.






	 




	Tax Receivable Agreement



	 


	We entered into the tax receivable agreement
	(the “

	TRA

	”), effective February 4, 2015, with the owners of SSE Holdings at the time of the IPO. The TRA provides
	for the payment by us to such persons of 85% of the amount of tax benefits, if any, that we actually realize, or in some circumstances
	are deemed to realize, as a result of (i) increases in our share of the tax basis in the net assets of SSE Holdings resulting from
	any redemptions or exchanges of LLC Interests, (ii) tax basis increases attributable to payments made under the TRA, and (iii)
	deductions attributable to imputed interest pursuant to the TRA (the “

	TRA Payments

	”). The TRA Payments are not
	conditioned upon any continued ownership interest in either SSE Holdings or us by any owner of SSE Holdings following the IPO.
	The rights of each owner of SSE Holdings following the IPO under the TRA are assignable to transferees of its LLC Interests (other
	than Shake Shack as transferee pursuant to subsequent redemptions (or exchanges) of the transferred LLC Interests). We expect to
	benefit from the remaining 15% of tax benefits, if any, that we may actually realize.


	 


	There were no amounts paid under the
	Tax Receivable Agreement in fiscal 2016. On February 3, 2017, $1,470,936 was paid under the Tax Receivable Agreement for amounts
	due related to the 2015 tax year to the owners of SSE Holdings through all or part of fiscal 2015, including its directors, executive
	officers and beneficial owners of more than 5% of our Class A common stock or Class B common stock (and immediately family members
	of the foregoing).



	 




	Registration Rights Agreement



	 


	We entered into the registration rights
	agreement (as amended, the “

	Registration Rights Agreement

	”), effective February 4, 2015, with the owners of
	SSE Holdings at the time of the IPO. The Registration Rights Agreement provides such owners certain registration rights whereby
	they can require us to register under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “

	Securities Act

	”), shares
	of Class A common stock issuable to them upon redemption or exchange, at our election, of their LLC Interests, and certain affiliates
	of former indirect members of SSE Holdings can require us to register under the Securities Act the shares of Class A common stock
	issued to them in connection with the Organizational Transactions. The Registration Rights Agreement also provides for piggyback
	registration rights for the owners of SSE Holdings prior to the IPO.


	 


	On October 8, 2015, we filed a registration statement on Form
	S-1 (the “

	S-1 Resale Shelf

	”) to register the sale of up to 26,160,694 shares of our Class A common stock from
	time to time by certain affiliates of former indirect members of SSE Holdings and those owners of SSE Holdings as of the date of
	the S-1 Resale Shelf, including the following directors, executive officers and beneficial owners of more than 5% of our Class
	A common stock or Class B common stock (and immediately family members of the foregoing): Randy Garutti (Chief Executive Officer),
	Jeff Uttz (then Chief Financial Officer), Daniel Meyer (and other members of the Meyer Group) (Chairman of the Board), Jeff Flug
	(and his affiliates) (director), Robert Vivian (director), Jon Sokoloff (director), LGP Malted Coinvest LLC, Green Equity Investors
	VI, L.P., Green Equity Investors Side VI, L.P., SEG Partners, L.P., SEG Partners II, L.P., and SEG Partners Offshore Master Fund
	Ltd. The S-1 Resale Shelf was declared effective by the SEC on November 12, 2015.


	 


	On March 10, 2016, we filed a post-effective amendment to
	the S-1 Resale Shelf to convert it to a registration statement on Form S-3 (the “

	S-3 Resale Shelf

	”). The S-3
	Resale Shelf was declared effective by the SEC on March 22, 2016.



	 




	Indemnification Agreements



	 


	Our bylaws provide that we will indemnify
	our directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the “

	DGCL

	”),
	subject to certain exceptions contained in our bylaws. In addition, our certificate of incorporation, provides that our directors
	will not be liable for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty.

	We entered into indemnification agreements
	with each of our executive officers and directors. The indemnification agreements provide the executive officers and directors
	with contractual rights to indemnification, and expense advancement and reimbursement, to the fullest extent permitted under the
	DGCL, subject to certain exceptions contained in those agreements. There is no pending litigation or proceeding naming any of our
	directors or officers to which indemnification is being sought, and we are not aware of any pending litigation that may result
	in claims for indemnification by any director or officer.



	 




	Policies and Procedures for Related Person Transactions



	 


	Our Board of Directors recognizes the
	fact that transactions with related persons present a heightened risk of conflicts of interests and/or improper valuation (or the
	perception thereof). Our Board of Directors adopted a written policy on transactions with related persons that is in conformity
	with the requirements for issuers listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Under the policy:


	 







	·




	any Related Person Transaction (as
	defined below), and any material amendment or modification to a Related Person Transaction, must be reviewed and approved or ratified
	by the Audit Committee, which is composed solely of independent directors who are disinterested, or by the disinterested members
	of the Board of Directors; and





	 







	·




	any employment relationship or transaction
	involving an executive officer and any related compensation must be approved by the Compensation Committee or recommended by the
	Compensation Committee to the Board of Directors for its approval.





	 


	A Related Person Transaction is a transaction,
	arrangement or relationship (or any series of similar transactions, arrangements or relationships) in which we were, are or will
	be a participant and the amount involved exceeds $120,000 in any one fiscal year, and in which any Related Person (as defined below)
	had, has or will have a direct or indirect material interest. Further, if a Related Person enters into transactions, arrangements
	or relationships in which we were, are or will be a participant and the aggregate amount involved in such transactions, arrangements
	or relationships exceeds $120,000 in any one fiscal year, and in which any Related Person had, has or will have a direct or indirect
	material interest, each of such transactions, arrangements or relationships, in conformity with SEC rules, shall be deemed to be
	a Related Person Transaction for purposes of this policy.


	 


	A Related Person is each of the following:
	(i) any person who has served as a director or executive officer since the beginning of our last completed fiscal year; (ii) any
	nominee for director at the Annual Meeting; (iii) any person who beneficially owns more than 5% of our outstanding Class A common
	stock or Class B common stock; and (iv) any immediate family member, or other person (other than a tenant or employee), sharing
	the household of any person identified in part (i), (ii) or (iii).



	 




	Identification of Related Party Transactions



	 


	Our Legal department, in consultation
	with our Accounting/Finance team, is primarily responsible for developing and implementing processes and procedures to obtain information
	regarding related persons with respect to potential Related Person Transactions and then determining, based on the facts and circumstances,
	whether the potential Related Person Transactions do, in fact, constitute a Related Person Transaction. In addition, any potential
	Related Person Transaction that is proposed to be entered into by us must be reported to our General Counsel by both the related
	person and the person at the Company responsible for such potential Related Person Transaction.



	 




	Audit Committee Pre-Approval



	 


	If the Company’s Legal department
	determines that a transaction or relationship is a Related Person Transaction, then each such transaction will be presented to
	the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. The Audit Committee will (i) review the relevant facts and circumstances of each
	Related Person Transaction, including if the transaction is on terms comparable to those that could be obtained in arm’s
	length dealings with an unrelated third party and the extent of the Related Person’s interest in the transaction, (ii) take
	into account the conflicts of interest and corporate opportunity provisions of our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, and (iii)
	either approve, ratify or disapprove the Related Person Transaction. If advance committee approval of a Related Person Transaction
	requiring the Audit Committee’s approval is not feasible, then the transaction may be preliminarily entered into by management upon prior
	approval of the transaction by the chairperson of the Audit Committee, subject to ratification of the transaction by the Audit
	Committee at the Audit Committee’s next regularly scheduled meeting.

	Management will update the Audit Committee
	as to any material changes to any approved or ratified Related Person Transaction and shall provide a status report at least annually
	at a regularly scheduled meeting of the Audit Committee of all then current Related Person Transactions.


	 


	No director may participate in approval
	of a Related Person Transaction for which he or she is a related person.



	 




	Disclosure



	 


	All Related Person Transactions are to
	be disclosed in the Company’s applicable filings as required by the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, and related rules.
	Furthermore, any Related Person Transaction must be disclosed to the full Board of Directors.



	 




	Other Agreements



	 


	Management must assure that all Related
	Person Transactions are not in violation of and are approved in accordance with any requirements of the Company’s financing
	or other material agreements.



	 




	DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE



	 


	We believe the following directors are
	independent as required by the rules of the New York Stock Exchange: Jeff Flug, Evan Guillemin, Jenna Lyons, Joshua Silverman,
	Jonathan D. Sokoloff and Robert Vivian.


	 


	Our Audit Committee consists of Robert
	Vivian, Jeff Flug, Evan Guillemin and Josh Silverman, with Mr. Vivian serving as chair. As required by Rule 10A-3 of the Exchange
	Act and the New York Stock Exchange rules, each of Messrs. Vivian, Flug, Guillemin and Silverman meet the definition of “independent
	director” for purposes of serving on an audit committee.


	 


	Our Nominating and Corporate Governance
	Committee consists of Jeff Flug, Jenna Lyons and Daniel Meyer, with Mr. Flug serving as chair. As we no longer rely on the “controlled
	company” exemption from the requirement that we do not need to have a Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee composed
	entirely of independent directors, Mr. Meyer will resign from, and Mr. Silverman will be appointed to, the Nominating and Corporate
	Governance Committee, at the Company’s next occurring quarterly meeting of the Board of Directors. Mr. Meyer’s resignation,
	and Mr. Silverman’s appointment, will occur within the allowable transition period provided by the New York Stock Exchange.


	 


	Our Compensation Committee consists of
	Evan Guillemin, Jenna Lyons, Jonathan D. Sokoloff and Robert Vivian, with Mr. Guillemin serving as chair. As required by the New
	York Stock Exchange rules, each of Messrs. Guillemin, Sokoloff and Vivian and Ms. Lyons meets the definition of “independent
	director” for purposes of serving on a Compensation Committee.

	Pre-Approval Policy



	 


	The Audit Committee’s policy is
	to pre-approve all audit and permissible non-audit services provided by EY. These services may include audit services, audit-related
	services, tax services and all other services. Proposed services may either be pre-approved without consideration of specific case-by-case
	services by the Audit Committee or require the specific pre-approval of the Audit Committee. Unless a type of service has received
	general pre-approval, it will require specific pre-approval if it is to be provided by EY. Any proposed services exceeding pre-approved
	cost levels or budgeted amounts will also require specific pre-approval.


	 


	Pre-approval fee levels or budgeted amounts
	for all services to be provided by EY are established annually by the Audit Committee. Any proposed services exceeding these levels
	or amounts require specific pre-approval by the Audit Committee. For each fiscal year, the Audit Committee may determine the appropriate
	ratio between the total amount of fees for audit, audit-related and tax services, and the total amount of fees for services classified
	as all other services.


	 


	The Audit Committee may delegate either
	type of approval authority to one or more of its members. The member to whom such authority is delegated must report, for informational
	purposes only, any pre-approval decisions to the Audit Committee at its next scheduled meeting.


	 


	The Audit Committee has designated the
	Chief Financial Officer to monitor the performance of all services provided by EY and to determine whether such services are in
	compliance with this policy. The Chief Financial Officer will report to the Audit Committee on a periodic basis the results of
	its monitoring. Both the Chief Financial Officer and management will immediately report to the chairperson of the Audit Committee
	any breach of this policy that comes to the attention of the Chief Financial Officer or any member of management.


	 


	All of the services listed in the above
	table were approved by the Audit Committee.
