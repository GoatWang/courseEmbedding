State of munis if corporate tax rates were cut
06/27/2017

If corporate tax rates were reduced to, say, 25%, do you think the municipal bond market would be OK in terms of demand?



Why did Fed rates rise and muni rates ease?
06/21/2017

After the Fed raised the benchmark lending rate by .25% last week, why are municipal bond rates off .15% across all maturities and credit ratings?



An opportunity during muni redemptions
06/12/2017

I have a laddered portfolio of California municipal bonds, many of which were purchased in 2007 at or around par. Most have coupon rates of 5.00% and are being redeemed this month. In order to reinvest in similar munis, I had to pay a 16% to 20% premium. In your article, “Summer Forecast: A Muni Redemption Flood, Supply Drought,” you said investors can often enhance their tax-free income when bonds are redeemed. With regard to these 2007 bonds, I don't see how redemptions aren't an issue or how reinvesting in similar bonds can enhance my tax-free income. In the decreasing-rate environment that has been in place for around 30 years, shouldn't investors hope that older bonds are not redeemed?



Why trust the muni bond rating agencies?
05/18/2017

Moody’s and Standard and Poor’s proved their fallibility in 2008 and before.Their ratings are useless.Why should I trust them now?



How can Puerto Rico bonds have AA rating?
05/17/2017

Regarding your article, (Bondholders After Puerto Rico’s Bankruptcy Filing), I noticed you are still selling Puerto Rico bonds with an AA listing.Is there some mysterious way these bonds are safer than the ones I own?How do they get such a great rating?



Determining the ‘quality’ of a municipal bond
04/28/2017

In your recent article (Muni Investors Succeed by Defying the Odds), you say investors should look for “quality” municipal bonds first, then yield. How should I base my determination of quality? Ratings? If so, which one do you feel has a better pulse on the muni bond market?



What to look for – and avoid – in a muni bond broker
04/28/2017

We have a “prudent-investor” broker with another firm who put over $1 million into Puerto Rico bonds. We almost "killed" him when we found out what he did. Now we have to watch him very carefully to make small investments and gain a decent return. Any advice? We have about $2 million still invested. We understand a lot depends on the actions of the current government in Puerto Rico, which is very slow to react.



Premium paid on muni bonds is a return on principal
03/14/2017

I have a question about municipal bonds selling at a premium: If I buy, for example, a 10-year face-value muni bond with a 5% coupon for $1,000 par and pay a 10% premium over par, I pay $1,100 to buy the bond. When the bond matures, I get back $1,000 and earn the stated yield-to-maturity when I purchased the bond. Assume that I can roll over a maturing $1,000 bond and use the proceeds to obtain a new bond selling at $1,100. To obtain the $100 premium, assume I go into my checking account.Isn't the upfront $100 premium simply returned to me over the life of the bond in the form of a slice of each coupon interest payment? That is, isn't repayment of the $100 premium simply a return of my investment ($100), not a return on my investment ($100)?



Medicare Part B and tax-exempt income
09/30/2016

I can sign up for Medicare soon and just learned that my rate for Part B could be double the minimum most others pay because the government will go back and refigure my taxes and add my tax-exempt interest to my income. This is very unfair. Has your company, and others that sell bonds, been contacting our representatives and trying to get this changed?



Too quick to judge merits of premium muni bonds
08/18/2016

I live in a retirement community where the chief financial officer is a volunteer and not educated in investments. We have a $2 million bond portfolio that she manages. She buys all five-year, high yield (4.00% to 5.00% in today's 1.00% market) munis with stiff premiums. A recent purchase was a $50,000 par value 4.90% California muni with a five-year maturity (we live in CA) for which she paid over $58,000. The whole portfolio is like that. Please explain why she shouldn't buy premium bonds; she won't listen to me. Or call me crazy and tell me it's OK to rack up $80,000 in premiums in this portfolio.

Disclosures

1 In U.S. dollars as of December 31, 2016. Source Ameriprise Q2 Earnings Release. Includes all assets managed by entities in the Columbia and Threadneedle group of companies. Contact us for more current data.
2Source: ICI as of December 31, 2016 for Columbia Management Investment Advisers, LLC.
3The Overall Morningstar Rating is as of December 31, 2016 and for Class Z shares. Out of 101 Z-share Columbia funds rated by Morningstar, 18 funds received a 5-star Overall Rating and 33 funds received a 4-star Overall Rating. Class Z shares are sold at net asset value and have limited eligibility. Columbia Management Investment Distributors, Inc. offers multiple share classes, not all necessarily available through all firms, and the share class ratings may vary. Contact us for details. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a retail mutual fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its 3-, 5- and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. For share classes that do not have a 3-, 5- or 10-year actual performance history, the fund’s independent Morningstar Rating metric is then compared against the retail mutual fund universe breakpoints to determine its hypothetical rating.
For each fund with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating™ used to rank the fund against other funds in the same category. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly excess performance, without any adjustments for loads (front-end, deferred, or redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star (each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages).
The Morningstar RatingTM is for Class Z shares only; other classes may have different performance characteristics and may have different ratings.

and New Jersey gross income tax. The Trust seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing primarily in municipal bonds exempt from federal income
taxes (except that the interest may subject to the federal alternative minimum tax) and New Jersey gross income taxes. Under normal market conditions,
the Trust invests at least 80% of its assets in municipal bonds that are investment grade quality at the time of investment. The Trust may invest directly in
such securities or synthetically through the use of derivatives.No assurance can be given that the Trust’s investment objective will be achieved.

The performance quoted represents past performance and does not guarantee future results. Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor’s shares, may be worth more or less than the original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. 
Returns are shown net of advisory fees paid by the fund and net of the fund’s operating fees and expenses. Investors who purchase shares of the fund through an investment adviser or other financial professional may separately pay a fee to that service provider. Past performance is not indicative of future results.

Total Distribution Current year distributions are not classified as “Income,” “Short-Term Capital Gains,” “Long-Term Capital Gains,” or “Return of Capital” until calendar year-end.











Past distributions are not indicative of future distributions.

If a Fund estimates that it has distributed more than its income and net realized capital gains in the current fiscal year; a portion of its distribution may be a return of capital. A return of capital may occur, for example, when some or all of a shareholder's investment is paid back to the shareholder. A return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect a Fund's investment performance and should not be confused with 'yield' or 'income'. When distributions exceed total return performance, the difference will reduce the Fund's net asset value per share. Although the character of income will not be determined until the end of the fund’s fiscal year, please refer to the 'Closed-End Fund Resources' section of the BlackRock website for Section 19 notices that provide estimated amounts and sources of the fund's distributions, which should not be not be relied upon for tax reporting purposes. A Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year will be sent to shareholders to illustrate how the Fund’s distributions should be reported for federal income tax purposes.

Premium/Discount
The amount the Fund is trading above or below the reported NAV expressed as a percentage of NAV. When the Fund’s closing price is greater than the Fund’s NAV, it is said to be trading at a &quot;Premium&quot; and the percentage is expressed as a positive number. When the Fund’s closing price is less than the Fund’s NAV, it is said to be trading at a &quot;Discount&quot; and the percentage is expressed as a negative number. Closing price is determined using the last traded price on the Fund’s listed exchange and NAV is calculated daily (usually 4:00pm eastern time).

Distribution Rate
The annual yield an investor would receive if the most recent fund distribution and current fund price stayed the same going forward. It is calculated by annualizing the most recent distribution and dividing by the fund&#39;s market price from the as-of-date. The distribution rate may include a return of capital. Please refer to the &quot;Closed-End Fund Resources&quot; section of the BlackRock website for Section 19 notices that provide estimated amounts and sources of the fund&#39;s distributions, which should not be relied upon for tax reporting purposes.

Tax Equiv. Yield
Tax equivalent yield (TEY) is used by investors to compare yields on taxable and tax-exempt securities after accounting for taxes. TEY represents the yield a taxable bond would have to earn in order to match, after taxes, the yield available on a tax-exempt municipal bond.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tax Equivalent Yield (TEY) = Tax Free Municipal Bond Yield/(1 - Tax Rate*)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For example, an investor in the 43.4% tax bracket would have to earn a yield of 3.53% on a taxable bond to match a 2.00% yield on a tax-exempt security.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The highest Federal individual income tax rate of 43.4% is assumed.

Yield to Maturity
Yield to Maturity (YTM) is the discount rate that equates the present value of a bond&#39;s cash flows with its market price (including accrued interest). The Fund Average YTM is the weighted average of the fund&#39;s individual bond holding YTMs based upon Net Asset Value (&#39;NAV&#39;). The measure does not include fees and expenses. For callable bonds, YTM is the yield-to-worst.

Effective Duration
Effective Duration measures the sensitivity of the price of a bond with or without embedded options to changes in interest rates, taking into account the likelihood of the bond being called, put and/or sunk prior to its final maturity date while incorporating after-tax impacts on the bond. The options-based duration model used by BlackRock employs certain assumptions and may differ from other fund complexes. Effective Duration is measured at the individual bond level, aggregated to the portfolio level, and adjusted for leverage, hedging transactions and non-bond holdings, including derivatives.&lt;br /&gt;As the method for calculating duration in municipal bond funds changed as of Sept. 26, please see the &#39;Literature&#39; section for more information on that measure.

% Notional Value
% of Notional Exposures is a breakdown designed to represent a fund’s ownership of both traditional fixed income securities and derivatives including, but not limited to, futures, options and swap contracts. For traditional fixed income securities, there is no difference between the market value and the notional exposure. For derivatives, the notional exposure represents the exposure to the underlying assets plus the value of the financing (or lending) associated with the implementation of these derivatives. The sum of all exposures (both market value and notional exposure) is equal to the fund’s net asset value (open-end) or net managed assets (closed-end). Net Derivatives represents the approximate net notional value of the longs less the short derivatives held in the fund.

The fund itself has not been rated by an independent rating agency. Credit quality ratings on underlying securities of the fund are received from S&P, Moody’s and Fitch and converted to the equivalent S&P major rating category. This breakdown is provided by BlackRock and takes the median rating of the three agencies when all three agencies rate a security the lower of the two ratings if only two agencies rate a security and one rating if that is all that is provided. Unrated securities do not necessarily indicate low quality. Below investment-grade is represented by a rating of BB and below. Ratings and portfolio credit quality may change over time.

Notional value represents a fund’s use of derivatives, including but not limited to futures, options, and swaps. This value captures the fund exposures as if the derivative was replaced with the underlying asset and the corresponding financing or lending, such that all exposures sum to the net asset value. For non-derivatives, the market value and the notional value are identical. Allocations are subject to change.

Important Information

 

Carefully consider the Funds' investment objectives, risk factors, and charges and expenses before investing. This and other information can be found in the Funds' prospectuses which may be obtained by visiting the SEC Edgar database. Read the prospectus carefully before investing.


Common shares for most of the closed-end funds identified above are only available for purchase and sale at current market price on a stock exchange. A closed-end fund’s dividend yield, market price and NAV will fluctuate with market conditions. The information for these funds is provided for informational purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation of an offer to buy or sell Fund shares.


Performance results reflect past performance and are no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted. All returns assume reinvestment of all dividends. The market value and net asset value (NAV) of a fund's shares will fluctuate with market conditions. Closed-end funds may trade at a premium to NAV but often trade at a discount.  The fund is actively managed and its characteristics will vary. Stock and bond values fluctuate in price so the value of your investment can go down depending on market conditions. International investing involves special risks including, but not limited to political risks, currency fluctuations, illiquidity and volatility. These risks may be heightened for investments in emerging markets. Fixed income risks include interest-rate and credit risk. Typically, when interest rates rise, there is a corresponding decline in bond values. Credit risk refers to the possibility that the bond issuer will not be able to make principal and interest payments. Principal of mortgage- or asset-backed securities normally may be prepaid at any time, reducing the yield and market value of those securities. Obligations of US govt. agencies are supported by varying degrees of credit but generally are not backed by the full faith and credit of the US govt. Non-investment-grade debt securities (high-yield/junk bonds) may be subject to greater market fluctuations, risk of default or loss of income and principal than higher rated securities. Investments in emerging markets may be considered speculative and are more likely to experience hyperinflation and currency devaluations, which adversely affect returns. In addition, many emerging securities markets have lower trading volumes and less liquidity. The fund may use derivatives to hedge its investments or to seek to enhance returns. Derivatives entail risks relating to liquidity, leverage and credit that may reduce returns and increase volatility. There is no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objective. The Fund is subject to numerous risks, including investment risks. Shares of closed-end funds often trade at a discount from their net asset value. The Fund is not a complete investment program and you may lose money investing in the Fund. An investment in the Fund may not be appropriate for all investors.  The amounts and sources of distributions reported in any notices are only estimates and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon the Fund's investment experience during the remainder of its fiscal year and may be subject to change based on tax regulations. The Fund will send a Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year that will tell how to report these distributions for federal income tax purposes. Yields are based on income earned for the period cited and on the Fund's NAV at the end of the end of the period.  Some investors may be subject to the alternative minimum tax (AMT).   Some BlackRock funds make distributions of ordinary income and capital gains at calendar year end. Those distributions temporarily cause extraordinarily high yields. There is no assurance that a fund will repeat that yield in the future.

If the $4.18 price target is reached, the company will be worth $65.53 million less. Studying the fundamentals may show that the stock should be performing better than it is.

Overview






Investment Approach
BlackRock New Jersey Municipal Income Trust’s (BNJ) (the 'Trust') investment objective is to provide current income exempt from regular federal income
tax and New Jersey gross income tax. The Trust seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing primarily in municipal bonds exempt from federal
income taxes (except that the interest may be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax) and New Jersey gross income taxes. The Trust invests at least
80% of its assets in municipal bonds that are investment grade quality at the time of investment. The Trust may invest directly in such securities or
synthetically through the use of derivatives.No assurance can be given that the Trust’s investment objective will be achieved.

Total Distribution Current year distributions are not classified as “Income,” “Short-Term Capital Gains,” “Long-Term Capital Gains,” or “Return of Capital” until calendar year-end.











Past distributions are not indicative of future distributions.

If a Fund estimates that it has distributed more than its income and net realized capital gains in the current fiscal year; a portion of its distribution may be a return of capital. A return of capital may occur, for example, when some or all of a shareholder's investment is paid back to the shareholder. A return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect a Fund's investment performance and should not be confused with 'yield' or 'income'. When distributions exceed total return performance, the difference will reduce the Fund's net asset value per share. Although the character of income will not be determined until the end of the fund’s fiscal year, please refer to the 'Closed-End Fund Resources' section of the BlackRock website for Section 19 notices that provide estimated amounts and sources of the fund's distributions, which should not be not be relied upon for tax reporting purposes. A Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year will be sent to shareholders to illustrate how the Fund’s distributions should be reported for federal income tax purposes.

Portfolio Characteristics 



Distribution Rate
The annual yield an investor would receive if the most recent fund distribution and current fund price stayed the same going forward. It is calculated by annualizing the most recent distribution and dividing by the fund&#39;s market price from the as-of-date. The distribution rate may include a return of capital. Please refer to the &quot;Closed-End Fund Resources&quot; section of the BlackRock website for Section 19 notices that provide estimated amounts and sources of the fund&#39;s distributions, which should not be relied upon for tax reporting purposes.

as of 21-Jul-2017



5.29%




Tax Equiv. Yield
Tax equivalent yield (TEY) is used by investors to compare yields on taxable and tax-exempt securities after accounting for taxes. TEY represents the yield a taxable bond would have to earn in order to match, after taxes, the yield available on a tax-exempt municipal bond.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tax Equivalent Yield (TEY) = Tax Free Municipal Bond Yield/(1 - Tax Rate*)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For example, an investor in the 43.4% tax bracket would have to earn a yield of 3.53% on a taxable bond to match a 2.00% yield on a tax-exempt security.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The highest Federal individual income tax rate of 43.4% is assumed.

as of 21-Jul-2017



10.25%




Yield to Maturity
Yield to Maturity (YTM) is the discount rate that equates the present value of a bond&#39;s cash flows with its market price (including accrued interest). The Fund Average YTM is the weighted average of the fund&#39;s individual bond holding YTMs based upon Net Asset Value (&#39;NAV&#39;). The measure does not include fees and expenses. For callable bonds, YTM is the yield-to-worst.

Effective Duration
Effective Duration measures the sensitivity of the price of a bond with or without embedded options to changes in interest rates, taking into account the likelihood of the bond being called, put and/or sunk prior to its final maturity date while incorporating after-tax impacts on the bond. The options-based duration model used by BlackRock employs certain assumptions and may differ from other fund complexes. Effective Duration is measured at the individual bond level, aggregated to the portfolio level, and adjusted for leverage, hedging transactions and non-bond holdings, including derivatives.&lt;br /&gt;As the method for calculating duration in municipal bond funds changed as of Sept. 26, please see the &#39;Literature&#39; section for more information on that measure.

Ratings

 Ratings



Morningstar Rating

Overall New Jersey Municipal Income Trust received a Morningstar Rating of 5 stars for the 3-year period, 5 stars for the 5-year period and 5 stars for the 10-year period, rated against 8, 8 and 7 Muni New Jersey Funds, respectively. Performance results represent past performance and are no guarantee of future results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For each U.S.-domiciled fund with at least a 3-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar RatingTM based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund&#39;s monthly performance (including the effects of sales charges, loads and redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of funds in each category receive five stars, the next 22.5% receive four stars, the next 35% receive three stars, the next 22.5% receive two stars and the bottom 10% receive one star. (Each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages.) The Overall Morningstar Rating for a fund is derived from a weighted-average of the performance figures associated with its 3-, 5- and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Morningstar Ratings are for the share classes cited only; other classes may have different ratings.

% Notional Value
% of Notional Exposures is a breakdown designed to represent a fund’s ownership of both traditional fixed income securities and derivatives including, but not limited to, futures, options and swap contracts. For traditional fixed income securities, there is no difference between the market value and the notional exposure. For derivatives, the notional exposure represents the exposure to the underlying assets plus the value of the financing (or lending) associated with the implementation of these derivatives. The sum of all exposures (both market value and notional exposure) is equal to the fund’s net asset value (open-end) or net managed assets (closed-end). Net Derivatives represents the approximate net notional value of the longs less the short derivatives held in the fund.

% Notional Value
% of Notional Exposures is a breakdown designed to represent a fund’s ownership of both traditional fixed income securities and derivatives including, but not limited to, futures, options and swap contracts. For traditional fixed income securities, there is no difference between the market value and the notional exposure. For derivatives, the notional exposure represents the exposure to the underlying assets plus the value of the financing (or lending) associated with the implementation of these derivatives. The sum of all exposures (both market value and notional exposure) is equal to the fund’s net asset value (open-end) or net managed assets (closed-end). Net Derivatives represents the approximate net notional value of the longs less the short derivatives held in the fund.

The fund itself has not been rated by an independent rating agency. Credit quality ratings on underlying securities of the fund are received from S&P, Moody’s and Fitch and converted to the equivalent S&P major rating category. This breakdown is provided by BlackRock and takes the median rating of the three agencies when all three agencies rate a security the lower of the two ratings if only two agencies rate a security and one rating if that is all that is provided. Unrated securities do not necessarily indicate low quality. Below investment-grade is represented by a rating of BB and below. Ratings and portfolio credit quality may change over time.

Notional value represents a fund’s use of derivatives, including but not limited to futures, options, and swaps. This value captures the fund exposures as if the derivative was replaced with the underlying asset and the corresponding financing or lending, such that all exposures sum to the net asset value. For non-derivatives, the market value and the notional value are identical. Allocations are subject to change.

Important Information

 

Carefully consider the Funds' investment objectives, risk factors, and charges and expenses before investing. This and other information can be found in the Funds' prospectuses which may be obtained by visiting the SEC Edgar database. Read the prospectus carefully before investing.


Common shares for most of the closed-end funds identified above are only available for purchase and sale at current market price on a stock exchange. A closed-end fund’s dividend yield, market price and NAV will fluctuate with market conditions. The information for these funds is provided for informational purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation of an offer to buy or sell Fund shares.


Performance results reflect past performance and are no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted. All returns assume reinvestment of all dividends. The market value and net asset value (NAV) of a fund's shares will fluctuate with market conditions. Closed-end funds may trade at a premium to NAV but often trade at a discount.  The fund is actively managed and its characteristics will vary. Stock and bond values fluctuate in price so the value of your investment can go down depending on market conditions. International investing involves special risks including, but not limited to political risks, currency fluctuations, illiquidity and volatility. These risks may be heightened for investments in emerging markets. Fixed income risks include interest-rate and credit risk. Typically, when interest rates rise, there is a corresponding decline in bond values. Credit risk refers to the possibility that the bond issuer will not be able to make principal and interest payments. Principal of mortgage- or asset-backed securities normally may be prepaid at any time, reducing the yield and market value of those securities. Obligations of US govt. agencies are supported by varying degrees of credit but generally are not backed by the full faith and credit of the US govt. Non-investment-grade debt securities (high-yield/junk bonds) may be subject to greater market fluctuations, risk of default or loss of income and principal than higher rated securities. Investments in emerging markets may be considered speculative and are more likely to experience hyperinflation and currency devaluations, which adversely affect returns. In addition, many emerging securities markets have lower trading volumes and less liquidity. The fund may use derivatives to hedge its investments or to seek to enhance returns. Derivatives entail risks relating to liquidity, leverage and credit that may reduce returns and increase volatility. There is no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objective. The Fund is subject to numerous risks, including investment risks. Shares of closed-end funds often trade at a discount from their net asset value. The Fund is not a complete investment program and you may lose money investing in the Fund. An investment in the Fund may not be appropriate for all investors.  The amounts and sources of distributions reported in any notices are only estimates and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon the Fund's investment experience during the remainder of its fiscal year and may be subject to change based on tax regulations. The Fund will send a Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year that will tell how to report these distributions for federal income tax purposes. Yields are based on income earned for the period cited and on the Fund's NAV at the end of the end of the period.  Some investors may be subject to the alternative minimum tax (AMT).   Some BlackRock funds make distributions of ordinary income and capital gains at calendar year end. Those distributions temporarily cause extraordinarily high yields. There is no assurance that a fund will repeat that yield in the future. Subsequent monthly distributions that do not include ordinary income or capital gains in the form of dividends will likely be lower.


The Funds are distributed by BlackRock Investments, LLC (together with its affiliates, “BlackRock”).

State of munis if corporate tax rates were cut
06/27/2017

If corporate tax rates were reduced to, say, 25%, do you think the municipal bond market would be OK in terms of demand?



Why did Fed rates rise and muni rates ease?
06/21/2017

After the Fed raised the benchmark lending rate by .25% last week, why are municipal bond rates off .15% across all maturities and credit ratings?



An opportunity during muni redemptions
06/12/2017

I have a laddered portfolio of California municipal bonds, many of which were purchased in 2007 at or around par. Most have coupon rates of 5.00% and are being redeemed this month. In order to reinvest in similar munis, I had to pay a 16% to 20% premium. In your article, “Summer Forecast: A Muni Redemption Flood, Supply Drought,” you said investors can often enhance their tax-free income when bonds are redeemed. With regard to these 2007 bonds, I don't see how redemptions aren't an issue or how reinvesting in similar bonds can enhance my tax-free income. In the decreasing-rate environment that has been in place for around 30 years, shouldn't investors hope that older bonds are not redeemed?



Why trust the muni bond rating agencies?
05/18/2017

Moody’s and Standard and Poor’s proved their fallibility in 2008 and before.Their ratings are useless.Why should I trust them now?



How can Puerto Rico bonds have AA rating?
05/17/2017

Regarding your article, (Bondholders After Puerto Rico’s Bankruptcy Filing), I noticed you are still selling Puerto Rico bonds with an AA listing.Is there some mysterious way these bonds are safer than the ones I own?How do they get such a great rating?



Determining the ‘quality’ of a municipal bond
04/28/2017

In your recent article (Muni Investors Succeed by Defying the Odds), you say investors should look for “quality” municipal bonds first, then yield. How should I base my determination of quality? Ratings? If so, which one do you feel has a better pulse on the muni bond market?



What to look for – and avoid – in a muni bond broker
04/28/2017

We have a “prudent-investor” broker with another firm who put over $1 million into Puerto Rico bonds. We almost "killed" him when we found out what he did. Now we have to watch him very carefully to make small investments and gain a decent return. Any advice? We have about $2 million still invested. We understand a lot depends on the actions of the current government in Puerto Rico, which is very slow to react.



Premium paid on muni bonds is a return on principal
03/14/2017

I have a question about municipal bonds selling at a premium: If I buy, for example, a 10-year face-value muni bond with a 5% coupon for $1,000 par and pay a 10% premium over par, I pay $1,100 to buy the bond. When the bond matures, I get back $1,000 and earn the stated yield-to-maturity when I purchased the bond. Assume that I can roll over a maturing $1,000 bond and use the proceeds to obtain a new bond selling at $1,100. To obtain the $100 premium, assume I go into my checking account.Isn't the upfront $100 premium simply returned to me over the life of the bond in the form of a slice of each coupon interest payment? That is, isn't repayment of the $100 premium simply a return of my investment ($100), not a return on my investment ($100)?



Medicare Part B and tax-exempt income
09/30/2016

I can sign up for Medicare soon and just learned that my rate for Part B could be double the minimum most others pay because the government will go back and refigure my taxes and add my tax-exempt interest to my income. This is very unfair. Has your company, and others that sell bonds, been contacting our representatives and trying to get this changed?



Too quick to judge merits of premium muni bonds
08/18/2016

I live in a retirement community where the chief financial officer is a volunteer and not educated in investments. We have a $2 million bond portfolio that she manages. She buys all five-year, high yield (4.00% to 5.00% in today's 1.00% market) munis with stiff premiums. A recent purchase was a $50,000 par value 4.90% California muni with a five-year maturity (we live in CA) for which she paid over $58,000. The whole portfolio is like that. Please explain why she shouldn't buy premium bonds; she won't listen to me. Or call me crazy and tell me it's OK to rack up $80,000 in premiums in this portfolio.

Disclosures

1 In U.S. dollars as of December 31, 2016. Source Ameriprise Q2 Earnings Release. Includes all assets managed by entities in the Columbia and Threadneedle group of companies. Contact us for more current data.
2Source: ICI as of December 31, 2016 for Columbia Management Investment Advisers, LLC.
3The Overall Morningstar Rating is as of December 31, 2016 and for Class Z shares. Out of 101 Z-share Columbia funds rated by Morningstar, 18 funds received a 5-star Overall Rating and 33 funds received a 4-star Overall Rating. Class Z shares are sold at net asset value and have limited eligibility. Columbia Management Investment Distributors, Inc. offers multiple share classes, not all necessarily available through all firms, and the share class ratings may vary. Contact us for details. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a retail mutual fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its 3-, 5- and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. For share classes that do not have a 3-, 5- or 10-year actual performance history, the fund’s independent Morningstar Rating metric is then compared against the retail mutual fund universe breakpoints to determine its hypothetical rating.
For each fund with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating™ used to rank the fund against other funds in the same category. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly excess performance, without any adjustments for loads (front-end, deferred, or redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star (each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages).
The Morningstar RatingTM is for Class Z shares only; other classes may have different performance characteristics and may have different ratings.
