O'Reilly (ORLY) to Report Q2 Earnings: What's in the Cards?


July 21, 2017, 08:38:00 AM EDT
By Zacks Equity Research, Zacks.com

O'Reilly Automotive Inc.ORLY is set to release second-quarter 2017 earnings after the markets close on Jul 26. The company delivered a positive earnings surprise in one of the trailing four quarters, with a negative average surprise of 2.3%.
 Let's see how things have shaped up for the forthcoming announcement.Factors Influencing this Quarter
 O'Reilly's stores are concentrated in certain locations in the U.S. Thus, its business is exposed to the economic and weather conditions of these regions. The company's strategy of lowering the time-to-market for its products to meet the demand in the professional installer market, places it at a logistical disadvantage against competitors.
 Additionally, much of O'Reilly's cash is locked in inventories, which can affect its short-term liquidity in periods of low sales. Further, the company expects selling, general and administrative expenses to increase in 2017 from 2016 on rising costs.
 However, for second-quarter 2017, O'Reilly projects earnings per share in the range of $3.10-$3.20, compared with $2.65, recorded in second-quarter 2016. The company expects consolidated comparable store sales to increase 3-5%. For full-year 2017, it expects earnings per share in the band of $12.05-$12.15, higher than $10.73 earned in 2016.
 O'Reilly projects a consolidated comparable store sales increase in the 3%-5% range, during the year. The company anticipates revenues in the band of $9.1-$9.3 billion, higher than $8.59 billion, recorded in 2016.Earnings Whispers
 Our proven model does not conclusively show that O'Reilly is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. O'Reilly's Earnings ESP is -0.68% because the Most Accurate estimate of $2.91 is pegged below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.93. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our Earnings ESP Filter .O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseO'Reilly Automotive, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. QuoteZacks Rank: O'Reilly currently carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). Note that we caution against Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) from going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Price Performance
 O'Reilly has lost 29.9% over the last three months, underperforming the 24% decline of the industry it belongs to.Stocks to Consider
 Here are some better-ranked companies you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:
 Cummins Inc. CMI has an Earnings ESP of +3.1% and a Zacks Rank #2. The company is expected to report second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 1. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here .
 CNH Industrial N.V. CNHI has an Earnings ESP of +12.5% and a Zacks Rank #2. The company's second-quarter 2017 financial results are expected to release on Jul 26.
 BorgWarner Inc. BWA has an Earnings ESP of +1.12% and a Zacks Rank #3. The company's second-quarter 2017 financial results are scheduled to release on Jul 27.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?
 Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.
 With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.

Are O'Reilly Automotive Inc. Shares Your Ticket To Growth? - O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:ORLY) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Are O'Reilly Automotive Inc. Shares Your Ticket To Growth?Jul. 6.17 | About: O'Reilly Automotive, (ORLY) Canadian Dividend Growth Investor Long only, value, dividend growth investingMarketplaceDGI Across North AmericaSummaryThe company has a track record of revenue, earnings, and comparable store sales growth.Expanding margins and high return on assets and return on equity have propelled shares higher in the long run.O'Reilly shares' pullback of nearly 35% in the last 12 months may be a good entry point.

O'Reilly Automotive Inc. (NASDAQ:ORLY) falls under the Automotive Parts & Accessories Retailers industry in the Consumer Discretionary sector. It has a long history of profitability and has outperformed the market (using SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEARCA:SPY) as a proxy) in the long run. 

Source: Google Finance - 10-year price chart comparison between ORLY The shares had a huge drop of nearly 19% on Wednesday after the company revealed that its Q2 comparable store sales growth was 1.7% (lower than its guidance of 3% to 5%) ahead of its earnings release on July 26th. So, it may be a good time to take another look at O'Reilly Automotive. 

Source: Google Finance - 1-year price chart comparison between ORLY and SPY In O'Reilly Automotive's 2016 annual report, it stated,    A key driver to current and future demand in our industry is total miles driven in the U.S., which continues to exceed three trillion miles each year, supported by relatively low gas prices and improvements in U.S. employment levels. Ongoing healthy levels of new car sales and stable, low scrappage rates result in a growing vehicle fleet, and sustained improvements in engineering and manufacturing have produced higher quality vehicles, which can be reliably driven at higher mileages, and result in an aging vehicle fleet that now averages 11.6 years old. We believe the growing, aging vehicle fleet will continue to benefit our industry, as these higher mileage vehicles are driven trillions of miles each year, resulting in ongoing wear and tear and experiencing more routine maintenance cycles, which, in turn, supports stable, long-term demand for our products. 
 

O'Reilly Automotive's Business Overview O'Reilly Automotive sells automotive aftermarket parts in North America and serves both do-it-yourself ("DIY") customers and professional service providers. O'Reilly Automotive was founded in 1957 by the O'Reilly family. As of the end of March, the company operated 4,888 stores in 47 states. The company has had 24 consecutive years of positive comparable store sales growth since it became a public company in April 1993. O'Reilly Automotive's Profitability Indeed, O'Reilly has a track record of sales growth and positive comparable stores sales growth. The acquisition of CSK Auto Corporation in 2008 (for about $1 billion, made a big contribution to the big jump in sales in 2008 and 2009, which also translated to strong earnings growth in 2009 and 2010. 

Source of data: O'Reilly Automotive 2016 annual report (pdf) - p23 The long-term EPS growth has been stellar, as illustrated with the orange line in the FAST Graph below. 

More recently, O'Reilly Automotive's five-year revenue and EPS growth rates were 8.2% and 23%, respectively. Since 2011, the company also saw nice operating margin expansion from 14.97% to 19.46%.
 As well, O'Reilly Automotive's return on assets and return on equity ("ROE") have also improved. Notably, higher financial leverage and a more aggressive buyback program have contributed to an abnormally high ROE in the last few years. 

Source of data: Morningstar.com Since 2011, the company has reduced its share count by 30.6%. However, from Q4 2014 to Q1 2017, the shares were trading at above its normal multiple. In my opinion, the company would have been better off paying out a special dividend or waiting for shares to be reasonably priced before buying back shares, such as right now. 

Management Greg Henslee has been in various roles at O'Reilly Automotive for 33 years and has been the CEO since 2013. David O'Reilly, who is the chairman of the board, has been with the company full time since 1972. He formerly served as CEO from 1993 to 2005. He has also been in other important roles over the years. Most other senior management team members have been with the company for at least 12 years. Valuation and Returns Potential At the recent quotation of about $179 per share, O'Reilly Automotive trades at a multiple of about 15.6. 

In the next three to five years, the analyst consensus believes O'Reilly Automotive can grow its EPS at a compound annual growth rate of 14-14.8% per year. That said, analysts will likely lower their forecasts of the company.
 Using a more conservative multiple of 18 and an EPS growth rate of 11%, an investment in O'Reilly Automotive can deliver annualized returns of about 15.8% in three years. Investor Takeaway There will be a continued demand for O'Reilly Automotive's products and services as long as people continue to drive. The stock has done exceptionally well over the long run despite the underperformance of the shares in the last 1.5 years. Before the huge drop, an investment since the end of 2007 would have delivered annualized returns of 22.3%, which greatly outperformed the same investment in S&P 500, which would have delivered annualized returns of 6.7% in the same period. (And, after the drop, the shares have still delivered annualized returns of about 19.6%.) 

With an experienced management team, which has been with the company or in the industry for a long time and has a track record of execution, investors buying the undervalued shares today will likely be rewarded with double-digit growth in the long run. However, cautious investors should wait until the shares stabilize or move higher, supported by volume before buying.

O'Reilly: The Next Leader Of The Auto Parts Industry? - O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:ORLY) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»O'Reilly: The Next Leader Of The Auto Parts Industry?Dec.29.16 | About: O'Reilly Automotive, (ORLY) Raffi Balyozyan Contrarian, medium-term horizon, Growth, long onlyGenthod Global Wealth Management S.A.SummaryIn this article we explore the auto parts industry's characteristics and reasons for recent performance.We compare O'Reilly's financial performance against competitors.Does it make sense to invest after it recently reached all time highs? The auto parts and accessories industry is known for being counter-cyclical. When the economy is in trouble, people stop buying new cars as they would rather drive their ageing cars even if they have more chances to break-down, hence buying spare parts. While the US economy was robust since 2011, with GDP growing at +3.7% CAGR and unemployment rates reaching levels below 5%, auto parts suppliers still managed to outperform the S&P500. Then, what could explain the sector performance? First and foremost, the average age of vehicles on US roads reached 11.4 years which is a positive trend for the auto parts industry. In fact, annual new car sales slumped from 17 million light vehicles to 11 million during the 2008 financial crisis. Auto parts distributors are currently benefiting from the 2008 effects, however new car sales just reached pre-crisis levels so the growth of the average age of vehicles on US roads could slow down. Secondly, the emergence of online sales and the new trend of consumers practicing the "Do It Yourself" method to decrease their car expenses. Indeed, selling auto parts online made the product category more reachable and understandable for the large audience. Online tutorials helped DIY develop faster as customers started learning how to repair cars or change auto parts on their own. We believe DIY will be develop further in the coming years. Thirdly, the industry is re-shaping to support the customers new habits. Indeed, to avoid customers bypassing auto mechanics, customers can now purchase their spare parts online, have it repaired by their mechanics and still benefit from a lower price than previously. Auto parts distributors are facilitating the new trend by allowing customers to return their purchase within 1 year, thus giving flexibility to customers who are not familiar with the sector to encourage them to purchase directly from auto parts dealers. Hence, we think this is a positive growth catalyst for the sector. Within this growing industry, the 3 biggest US players are "Autozone (NYSE:AZO)", "Advanced Auto Parts (NYSE:AAP)" and "O'Reilly (NASDAQ:ORLY)". The latter has expanded the most in the last decade (particularly through acquisitions), earnings grew at a CAGR of +23% from 2006 to 2015. Eventhough O'Reilly is currently the third largest chain in the US after AZO and AAP, its market capitalization is the largest. In fact, ORLY shares have skyrocketed compared to peers in the last 5 years. We will discuss whether it's still worth buying the rally. 

 ORLY data by YCharts A quick look at where the company is coming from. Founded in 1957 in Missouri by the O'Reilly family, the business quickly grew within the state into a $7 million business with 9 stores until 1975. The public offering of ORLY was pivotal as it helped the company finance its external growth to acquire various auto parts distributors that were well-established in extended states such as Texas, California, Georgia, Ohio and Illinois. These states now represent as much as 40% of total store count among the 4700 existing stores. Moreover, the company has excelled in key financial metrics. 

 Inventory rationalization. Among its peers ORLY is the only company who saw its sales grow faster than inventories. Indeed, inventory on hand is the lowest at 246 days compared with 294 days for AAP. Inventories are costly, if they grow faster than sales it increases the risk to have a store overloaded with old products, preventing the company to order new products that customers are searching for. Longer inventory days on hand can lead companies to increase product discounts which deteriorates operating margins. Inventory optimization is crucial in this strong footprint retail business. In parallel receivables were well managed, growing at +10% since 2006, the slowest pace among its competitors and also representing the lowest percentage to assets confirming the ability of the company to cash in from customers in relative short periods. Higher profitability ratios. ORLY has managed to grow EBIT margins by 600bps from 13% to 19% in the last 5 years, reaching AZO levels which were the highest in the industry at 19% (only +90bps in 5 years). ORLY management has proved to have well executed acquisitions as they were accretive to the company. Indeed, profitability ratios improved by double digit in the last decade. Looking at the return on the capital the company has employed (ROCE) and the return on the invested capital (NASDAQ:ROIC), management has developed a track record to efficiently expand the company without compromising profitability. Strong cash & low debt. Cash conversion rate is the highest in the industry at 85%. Even if EBITDA margins have improved considerably, the level of free cash flow has grown even faster, free cash flow to EBITDA is still the highest compared to peers. While net debt has risen most due to intense M&A activity, when you compare it to the EBITDA the company has a very reasonable ratio at 0.7x. Management has excellently executed its external growth plan to a degree where investors are demanding and expect history to repeat. Growth. Investors are now demanding and have high expectations. In the next 3 years, according to Bloomberg estimates, sales are expected to grow at a CAGR of +7% with an EBITDA improving from 21% to 23%. Looking at the forecasted P/E ratio for the upcoming years, the highest growth in the industry will come from ORLY as earnings are expected to grow at +25% in the next 2 years. The price you are paying for the earnings growth is still descent as it's lower than 2 times, however if you look back this is the highest level since 2010. Everything is not rosy, we noticed some flows such as the price to sales which has reached 3.5 times while AZO is only valued 2.2 times and AAP 1.3 times. Also, price to book value is the highest among peers at more than 23 times, which is very expensive. 

 ORLY PEG Ratio (NYSE:TTM) data by YCharts In conclusion, O'Reilly is clearly the fastest-growing and healthier auto parts and accessories supplier within the industry. Taking into account that in our opinion the industry growth is sustainable, O'Reilly is the best positioned to capture it. Price to earnings ratios are not at the highest levels, currently lower than AAP, giving the share price room for a future increase. Management is capable to drive the company as the next market leader in the auto parts industry which justifies paying today's price even if that's close to company's all time highs.

History[edit]




An O'Reilly Auto Parts store in Ypsilanti, Michigan






O'Reilly Auto Parts in Houston, Texas


O’Reilly Automotive, Inc. officially started in the auto parts business with one store in Springfield, Missouri, in December 1957. However, its historical background in the automotive business, as well as the family’s quest for opportunity and advancement, may be traced back to a much earlier time.[3]
Michael Byrne O’Reilly immigrated to America in 1849, escaping from the hard times of the potato famine, which struck Ireland in 1845-46. Settling in St. Louis, he worked his way through school to earn a law degree, and then pursued a career as a title examiner.[4]
His son, Charles Francis O’Reilly, attended college in St. Louis and went to work in 1914 as a traveling salesman for Fred Campbell Auto Supply in St. Louis. By 1924, Charles had become familiar with the Springfield area, having traveled by train to sell auto parts throughout the territory. He recognized the region as an area of growth and opportunity and asked to be transferred there. By 1932, he had become manager of Link Motor Supply in Springfield, and one of his sons, Charles H. (Chub) O’Reilly, joined the company. Together they provided the leadership and management that made Link the predominant auto parts store in the area.[5]
In 1957, Link planned a reorganization, which would have included the retirement of 72-year-old Charles F. O’Reilly, and the transfer of Chub O’Reilly to Kansas City. Since neither agreed with these plans, they made the decision to form their own company, O’Reilly Automotive, Inc. They opened for business on December 2, 1957, with one store and 13 employees at 403 Sherman in Springfield. Their sales totaled $700,000 in 1958, their first full year of business. Due to the hard work and ability of the original employees, several of whom were stockholders in the company, the business grew and prospered from its very first year. By 1961, the company’s volume had reached $1.3 million — the combined volume of O’Reilly Automotive and Ozark Automotive Distributors, a division formed to serve independent automotive jobbers in the area. In March 1975, annual sales volume rose to $7 million and a 52,000 square-foot facility at 233 S. Patterson was built for the O’Reilly/Ozark warehouse operation. By that time, the company had nine stores, all located in southwest Missouri. [6]
Expansion[edit]
On April 23, 1993, the company completed an initial public offering, and it now trades on the NASDAQ market under the symbol ORLY. The company also has a stock purchase plan to enable as many team members as possible to own stock in the company.
On January 30, 1998, O’Reilly merged with Hi/LO Auto Supply, adding 182 auto parts stores in Texas and Louisiana, as well as a distribution center in Houston, Texas. The Hi/LO acquisition made O’Reilly one of the top 10 auto parts chains in the country. On April 25, 2000, the firm announced the purchase of KarPro Auto Parts, which included a 66,000 square foot distribution center in Little Rock, Arkansas, and 14 KarPro stores.
On October 1, 2001, O’Reilly purchased Mid-State Automotive Distributors, Inc., adding 82 additional auto parts stores in seven states, as well as two distribution centers. The acquisition made the firm one of the top five auto parts chains in the country. It added its eleventh distribution center in Atlanta, Georgia, in March 2005.
On May 31, 2005, O’Reilly purchased Midwest Automotive Distributors, Inc., adding 72 retail locations in Minnesota, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Wisconsin, and Wyoming, as well as two distribution centers located in Minnesota and Montana.
On July 11, 2008, the company completed the largest acquisition in its history with the purchase of CSK Auto, adding 1,273 stores in 12 states.[7] This, combined with past acquisitions, made O’Reilly the third largest auto parts chain in the country after Advance Auto Parts and AutoZone.
In December 2012, O’Reilly announced it was purchasing the auto parts business of VIP Parts, Tires and Service, a Lewiston, Maine-based chain of 56 auto parts stores and service centers with locations in Maine, New Hampshire, and Massachusetts, and one distribution center in Maine. The purchase marked the firm’s expansion into New England.[8]
On October 26, 2016, O'Reilly announced that it was acquiring Bond Auto Parts, a 51 store chain headquartered in Vermont with locations in New Hampshire, Massachusetts, and New York as well. [9]
O’Reilly Automotive, Inc. currently operates more than 4,800 stores in 47 states, including Alaska and Hawaii. The company continues to plan for growth and expansion, projecting the addition of 195 new locations in 2017.
Executive Management[edit]
Executive officers of the company include David O’Reilly, Chairman of the Board; Greg Henslee, Chief Executive Officer; Jeff Shaw, Co-President; Greg Johnson, Co-President; and Tom McFall, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.

History[edit]




An O'Reilly Auto Parts store in Ypsilanti, Michigan






O'Reilly Auto Parts in Houston, Texas


O’Reilly Automotive, Inc. officially started in the auto parts business with one store in Springfield, Missouri, in December 1957. However, its historical background in the automotive business, as well as the family’s quest for opportunity and advancement, may be traced back to a much earlier time.[3]
Michael Byrne O’Reilly immigrated to America in 1849, escaping from the hard times of the potato famine, which struck Ireland in 1845-46. Settling in St. Louis, he worked his way through school to earn a law degree, and then pursued a career as a title examiner.[4]
His son, Charles Francis O’Reilly, attended college in St. Louis and went to work in 1914 as a traveling salesman for Fred Campbell Auto Supply in St. Louis. By 1924, Charles had become familiar with the Springfield area, having traveled by train to sell auto parts throughout the territory. He recognized the region as an area of growth and opportunity and asked to be transferred there. By 1932, he had become manager of Link Motor Supply in Springfield, and one of his sons, Charles H. (Chub) O’Reilly, joined the company. Together they provided the leadership and management that made Link the predominant auto parts store in the area.[5]
In 1957, Link planned a reorganization, which would have included the retirement of 72-year-old Charles F. O’Reilly, and the transfer of Chub O’Reilly to Kansas City. Since neither agreed with these plans, they made the decision to form their own company, O’Reilly Automotive, Inc. They opened for business on December 2, 1957, with one store and 13 employees at 403 Sherman in Springfield. Their sales totaled $700,000 in 1958, their first full year of business. Due to the hard work and ability of the original employees, several of whom were stockholders in the company, the business grew and prospered from its very first year. By 1961, the company’s volume had reached $1.3 million — the combined volume of O’Reilly Automotive and Ozark Automotive Distributors, a division formed to serve independent automotive jobbers in the area. In March 1975, annual sales volume rose to $7 million and a 52,000 square-foot facility at 233 S. Patterson was built for the O’Reilly/Ozark warehouse operation. By that time, the company had nine stores, all located in southwest Missouri. [6]
Expansion[edit]
On April 23, 1993, the company completed an initial public offering, and it now trades on the NASDAQ market under the symbol ORLY. The company also has a stock purchase plan to enable as many team members as possible to own stock in the company.
On January 30, 1998, O’Reilly merged with Hi/LO Auto Supply, adding 182 auto parts stores in Texas and Louisiana, as well as a distribution center in Houston, Texas. The Hi/LO acquisition made O’Reilly one of the top 10 auto parts chains in the country. On April 25, 2000, the firm announced the purchase of KarPro Auto Parts, which included a 66,000 square foot distribution center in Little Rock, Arkansas, and 14 KarPro stores.
On October 1, 2001, O’Reilly purchased Mid-State Automotive Distributors, Inc., adding 82 additional auto parts stores in seven states, as well as two distribution centers. The acquisition made the firm one of the top five auto parts chains in the country. It added its eleventh distribution center in Atlanta, Georgia, in March 2005.
On May 31, 2005, O’Reilly purchased Midwest Automotive Distributors, Inc., adding 72 retail locations in Minnesota, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Wisconsin, and Wyoming, as well as two distribution centers located in Minnesota and Montana.
On July 11, 2008, the company completed the largest acquisition in its history with the purchase of CSK Auto, adding 1,273 stores in 12 states.[7] This, combined with past acquisitions, made O’Reilly the third largest auto parts chain in the country after Advance Auto Parts and AutoZone.
In December 2012, O’Reilly announced it was purchasing the auto parts business of VIP Parts, Tires and Service, a Lewiston, Maine-based chain of 56 auto parts stores and service centers with locations in Maine, New Hampshire, and Massachusetts, and one distribution center in Maine. The purchase marked the firm’s expansion into New England.[8]
On October 26, 2016, O'Reilly announced that it was acquiring Bond Auto Parts, a 51 store chain headquartered in Vermont with locations in New Hampshire, Massachusetts, and New York as well. [9]
O’Reilly Automotive, Inc. currently operates more than 4,800 stores in 47 states, including Alaska and Hawaii. The company continues to plan for growth and expansion, projecting the addition of 195 new locations in 2017.
Executive Management[edit]
Executive officers of the company include David O’Reilly, Chairman of the Board; Greg Henslee, Chief Executive Officer; Jeff Shaw, Co-President; Greg Johnson, Co-President; and Tom McFall, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.

Auto parts retailer stocks fall toward multiyear lows after O'Reilly's disappointing sales report
Shares of auto parts retailers were headed for sharp losses Wednesday, after rival O'Reilly Automotive Inc.  reported disappointing second-quarter sales, with particular weakness during the last two months. O'Reilly's stock tumbled 8.4% ahead of the open, toward a near 2 1/2-year low. Among the company's rivals, shares of Advance Auto Parts Inc.  dropped 7.1%, on track to open at a near 3 1/2-year low. AutoZone Inc.'s stock  shed 3.8% premarket toward the lowest open since October 2014, while Genuine Parts Co. shares  slipped 1.8%.

Corrected            
O'Reilly Automotive's stock rocked by same-store sales miss
Shares of O'Reilly Automotive Inc.  tumbled 8.2% in premarket trade Wednesday, after the auto parts retailer reported second-quarter same-store sales that were well below expectations. The company said same-store sales rose 1.7% from a year ago, below its previously-provided guidance of 3% to 5% growth, and below the FactSet consensus of a 3.9% increase. Chief Executive Greg Henslee said that after an upbeat April, the sales environment was "more challenging" the rest of the quarter, due to what the company believes were "continued headwinds from a second consecutive mild winter and overall weak consumer demand." He said the shortfall will have a "consequent impact on our operating profitability," which will be reported on July 26. The stock, which is on track to open at the lowest level seen during regular session hours since Feb. 4, 2015, has plunged 21% year to date through Monday, while the SPDR S&P Retail ETF  has lost 6.9% and the S&P 500  has gained 8.5%.

AutoZone shares up after an analyst upgrade and a downgrade
AutoZone Inc.  shares are up 0.8% in Monday premarket trading after the company's stock was both upgraded and downgraded by analysts. Wedbush issued the downgrade to neutral from outperform based on slowing same-store sales in the do-it-yourself auto sector. Analysts also downgraded O'Reilly Automotive Inc.  to neutral from outperform. Wedbush believes the pressure from newer cars that drive more miles per year than older ones, coupled with issues like weather and tax refund delays are to blame. "Indeed, the new normal industry comp may no longer be 3% to 4% but instead be closer to 2%," the Tuesday note said. Wedbush also thinks the online threat from retailers like Amazon.com Inc.  "can't be ignored." Goldman Sachs upgraded AutoZone to buy from neutral because analysts believe the "auto parts retail rout has run its course," with some of the same factors coming into play - weather and tax refund delays. "While another warm first quarter does not bode well for demand, compares reflect a tough year-ago; the impact of delayed tax refunds has abated - with firms talking to recovery in sales trends; and gas price increases have moderated," Goldman analysts wrote. Goldman sees opportunity for valuation to bounce back after a sell off following a fiscal third-quarter earnings miss. AutoZone shares are down more than 22% for the year so far while the S&P 500 index  is up 8% for the period.

AutoZone’s stock suffers record price plunge after profit and sales miss

Auto parts retailer stocks tumble in wake of AutoZone's disappointing results
Shares of car-parts retailers are tumbling in premarket trade Tuesday, after AutoZone Inc.  reported fiscal third-quarter results that were "significantly" below expectations. Shares of Advance Auto Parts Inc. , which reports first-quarter results on Wednesday, sank 6.0% to put them on track to open at a 6 1/2-month low. O'Reilly Automotive Inc.'s stock  dropped 5% toward a 15-month low ahead of the open, while Genuine Auto Parts Co. shares  shed 3.7%. AutoZone's stock plunged 8%, to put it on course to open at the lowest level seen during regular trading hours since February 2015, after the company reported profit, revenue and same-store sales that missed expectations. The stock declines are bucking the trend in the broader stock market, as futures for the S&P 500  are rising 0.2% ahead of the open.

Auto parts retailer stocks fall toward multiyear lows after O'Reilly's disappointing sales report
Shares of auto parts retailers were headed for sharp losses Wednesday, after rival O'Reilly Automotive Inc.  reported disappointing second-quarter sales, with particular weakness during the last two months. O'Reilly's stock tumbled 8.4% ahead of the open, toward a near 2 1/2-year low. Among the company's rivals, shares of Advance Auto Parts Inc.  dropped 7.1%, on track to open at a near 3 1/2-year low. AutoZone Inc.'s stock  shed 3.8% premarket toward the lowest open since October 2014, while Genuine Parts Co. shares  slipped 1.8%.

Corrected            
O'Reilly Automotive's stock rocked by same-store sales miss
Shares of O'Reilly Automotive Inc.  tumbled 8.2% in premarket trade Wednesday, after the auto parts retailer reported second-quarter same-store sales that were well below expectations. The company said same-store sales rose 1.7% from a year ago, below its previously-provided guidance of 3% to 5% growth, and below the FactSet consensus of a 3.9% increase. Chief Executive Greg Henslee said that after an upbeat April, the sales environment was "more challenging" the rest of the quarter, due to what the company believes were "continued headwinds from a second consecutive mild winter and overall weak consumer demand." He said the shortfall will have a "consequent impact on our operating profitability," which will be reported on July 26. The stock, which is on track to open at the lowest level seen during regular session hours since Feb. 4, 2015, has plunged 21% year to date through Monday, while the SPDR S&P Retail ETF  has lost 6.9% and the S&P 500  has gained 8.5%.

AutoZone shares up after an analyst upgrade and a downgrade
AutoZone Inc.  shares are up 0.8% in Monday premarket trading after the company's stock was both upgraded and downgraded by analysts. Wedbush issued the downgrade to neutral from outperform based on slowing same-store sales in the do-it-yourself auto sector. Analysts also downgraded O'Reilly Automotive Inc.  to neutral from outperform. Wedbush believes the pressure from newer cars that drive more miles per year than older ones, coupled with issues like weather and tax refund delays are to blame. "Indeed, the new normal industry comp may no longer be 3% to 4% but instead be closer to 2%," the Tuesday note said. Wedbush also thinks the online threat from retailers like Amazon.com Inc.  "can't be ignored." Goldman Sachs upgraded AutoZone to buy from neutral because analysts believe the "auto parts retail rout has run its course," with some of the same factors coming into play - weather and tax refund delays. "While another warm first quarter does not bode well for demand, compares reflect a tough year-ago; the impact of delayed tax refunds has abated - with firms talking to recovery in sales trends; and gas price increases have moderated," Goldman analysts wrote. Goldman sees opportunity for valuation to bounce back after a sell off following a fiscal third-quarter earnings miss. AutoZone shares are down more than 22% for the year so far while the S&P 500 index  is up 8% for the period.

AutoZone’s stock suffers record price plunge after profit and sales miss

Auto parts retailer stocks tumble in wake of AutoZone's disappointing results
Shares of car-parts retailers are tumbling in premarket trade Tuesday, after AutoZone Inc.  reported fiscal third-quarter results that were "significantly" below expectations. Shares of Advance Auto Parts Inc. , which reports first-quarter results on Wednesday, sank 6.0% to put them on track to open at a 6 1/2-month low. O'Reilly Automotive Inc.'s stock  dropped 5% toward a 15-month low ahead of the open, while Genuine Auto Parts Co. shares  shed 3.7%. AutoZone's stock plunged 8%, to put it on course to open at the lowest level seen during regular trading hours since February 2015, after the company reported profit, revenue and same-store sales that missed expectations. The stock declines are bucking the trend in the broader stock market, as futures for the S&P 500  are rising 0.2% ahead of the open.

So, it may be a good time to take another look at O'Reilly Automotive. 

Source: Google Finance - 1-year price chart comparison between ORLY and SPY In O'Reilly Automotive's 2016 annual report, it stated,    A key driver to current and future demand in our industry is total miles driven in the U.S., which continues to exceed three trillion miles each year, supported by relatively low gas prices and improvements in U.S. employment levels. Ongoing healthy levels of new car sales and stable, low scrappage rates result in a growing vehicle fleet, and sustained improvements in engineering and manufacturing have produced higher quality vehicles, which can be reliably driven at higher mileages, and result in an aging vehicle fleet that now averages 11.6 years old. We believe the growing, aging vehicle fleet will continue to benefit our industry, as these higher mileage vehicles are driven trillions of miles each year, resulting in ongoing wear and tear and experiencing more routine maintenance cycles, which, in turn, supports stable, long-term demand for our products. 
 

O'Reilly Automotive's Business Overview O'Reilly Automotive sells automotive aftermarket parts in North America and serves both do-it-yourself ("DIY") customers and professional service providers. O'Reilly Automotive was founded in 1957 by the O'Reilly family. As of the end of March, the company operated 4,888 stores in 47 states. The company has had 24 consecutive years of positive comparable store sales growth since it became a public company in April 1993. O'Reilly Automotive's Profitability Indeed, O'Reilly has a track record of sales growth and positive comparable stores sales growth. The acquisition of CSK Auto Corporation in 2008 (for about $1 billion, made a big contribution to the big jump in sales in 2008 and 2009, which also translated to strong earnings growth in 2009 and 2010. 

Source of data: O'Reilly Automotive 2016 annual report (pdf) - p23 The long-term EPS growth has been stellar, as illustrated with the orange line in the FAST Graph below. 

More recently, O'Reilly Automotive's five-year revenue and EPS growth rates were 8.2% and 23%, respectively. Since 2011, the company also saw nice operating margin expansion from 14.97% to 19.46%.
 As well, O'Reilly Automotive's return on assets and return on equity ("ROE") have also improved. Notably, higher financial leverage and a more aggressive buyback program have contributed to an abnormally high ROE in the last few years. 

Source of data: Morningstar.com Since 2011, the company has reduced its share count by 30.6%. However, from Q4 2014 to Q1 2017, the shares were trading at above its normal multiple. In my opinion, the company would have been better off paying out a special dividend or waiting for shares to be reasonably priced before buying back shares, such as right now. 

Management Greg Henslee has been in various roles at O'Reilly Automotive for 33 years and has been the CEO since 2013. David O'Reilly, who is the chairman of the board, has been with the company full time since 1972. He formerly served as CEO from 1993 to 2005. He has also been in other important roles over the years. Most other senior management team members have been with the company for at least 12 years. Valuation and Returns Potential At the recent quotation of about $179 per share, O'Reilly Automotive trades at a multiple of about 15.6. 

In the next three to five years, the analyst consensus believes O'Reilly Automotive can grow its EPS at a compound annual growth rate of 14-14.8% per year. That said, analysts will likely lower their forecasts of the company.
 Using a more conservative multiple of 18 and an EPS growth rate of 11%, an investment in O'Reilly Automotive can deliver annualized returns of about 15.8% in three years. Investor Takeaway There will be a continued demand for O'Reilly Automotive's products and services as long as people continue to drive. The stock has done exceptionally well over the long run despite the underperformance of the shares in the last 1.5 years. Before the huge drop, an investment since the end of 2007 would have delivered annualized returns of 22.3%, which greatly outperformed the same investment in S&P 500, which would have delivered annualized returns of 6.7% in the same period. (And, after the drop, the shares have still delivered annualized returns of about 19.6%.) 

With an experienced management team, which has been with the company or in the industry for a long time and has a track record of execution, investors buying the undervalued shares today will likely be rewarded with double-digit growth in the long run. However, cautious investors should wait until the shares stabilize or move higher, supported by volume before buying.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
