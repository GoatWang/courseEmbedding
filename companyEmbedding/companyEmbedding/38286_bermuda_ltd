Beaches


 
 










Coves & Crescents of Pink Sand
Bermuda’s dramatic coastline holds hidden coves and wide crescents of beach, all blanketed by that iconic pale-pink sand and brushed by gentle surf. Some beaches are popular and prized, like Horseshoe Bay Beach, which USA Today named one of the Caribbean’s top 10 beaches (even though Bermuda isn’t technically in the Caribbean). Other beaches feel like secluded island hideaways. You’ll find great beaches across the island, but the famous South Shore is a perfect starting point.
 




 






Key Points of Interest
From from sweeping crescents of pink sand to secluded rocky coves, some of Bermuda’s top beaches are plotted below. To browse a full list of Bermuda’s beaches, scroll down the page. 









Beaches Highlights
Whether you’re into active beaches or relaxing on quiet stretches of shore, you’ll find Bermuda beaches that fit your style – great places to swim, explore, watch wildlife, catch sunset and celebrate.

Beaches


 
 










Coves & Crescents of Pink Sand
Bermuda’s dramatic coastline holds hidden coves and wide crescents of beach, all blanketed by that iconic pale-pink sand and brushed by gentle surf. Some beaches are popular and prized, like Horseshoe Bay Beach, which USA Today named one of the Caribbean’s top 10 beaches (even though Bermuda isn’t technically in the Caribbean). Other beaches feel like secluded island hideaways. You’ll find great beaches across the island, but the famous South Shore is a perfect starting point.
 




 






Key Points of Interest
From from sweeping crescents of pink sand to secluded rocky coves, some of Bermuda’s top beaches are plotted below. To browse a full list of Bermuda’s beaches, scroll down the page. 









Beaches Highlights
Whether you’re into active beaches or relaxing on quiet stretches of shore, you’ll find Bermuda beaches that fit your style – great places to swim, explore, watch wildlife, catch sunset and celebrate.

On the Water


 
 










The Lure of Bermuda's Water Wonderland 
Cerulean, turquoise, azure – there are many colours to describe Bermuda’s brilliant blue water, and even more ways to enjoy it. Set sail on the Atlantic Ocean, paddle around coastal cliffs, ride to hidden coves on a jet ski or take a sunset cruise in the Great Sound. Interested in what lies beneath? Go scuba diving to explore colourful coral reefs and ghostly shipwrecks. Take a whale watching tour in the spring, or fish for wahoo, tuna, rockfish and spiny lobster during season. Or go parasailing for an unforgettable view from above.
