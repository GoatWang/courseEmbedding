He also previously served as Chief Medical Officer for Myriad Genetic Laboratories, Inc. “We are extremely pleased to welcome Rick to the team during this exciting time at Oxford Immunotec,” said CEO, Dr. Peter Wrighton-Smith. “Rick’s extensive leadership experience and the depth and breadth of his clinical, scientific, and commercial expertise will be immensely valuable as we continue to grow our core tuberculosis franchise and launch products into the new markets of tick-borne diseases, blood screening and transplantation.” Prior to joining Myriad Genetics, Dr. Wenstrup served as a tenured Professor of Pediatrics (Human Genetics) at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center and as a tenured Professor of Biomedical Engineering at the University of Cincinnati.

He also served as a standing member of NIH review committees and on the scientific advisory boards of several disease-related foundations. Dr. Wenstrup was the founding director of the Molecular Diagnostics Laboratory at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital and co-founder of Assurex Health, Inc., now a subsidiary of Myriad Genetics, Inc.
