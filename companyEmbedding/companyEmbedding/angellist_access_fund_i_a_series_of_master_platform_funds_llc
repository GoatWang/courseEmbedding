Today’s biggest returns are going to early investors in private companies, especially high-growth technology companies that are changing nearly every aspect of life. Rather than wait for a company to go public, often at a high price, OurCrowd’s equity crowdfunding platform allows investors exclusive opportunities to buy stakes in private startup companies for as little as $10,000.

	The graph below shows how the days of seeing 600% returns in public technology companies are largely over, with such opportunities confined to private investments.

OurCrowd: Sparking the Next Wave of InnovationOurCrowd is the leading global equity crowdfunding platform for accredited investors. Managed by a team of seasoned investment professionals, OurCrowd vets and selects opportunities, invests its own capital, and brings companies to its accredited membership of global investors. OurCrowd provides post-investment support to its portfolio companies, assigns industry experts as mentors, and takes board seats. The OurCrowd community of almost 20,000 investors from over 112 countries has invested over $440M into 120 portfolio companies and funds.OurCrowd's role as a startup investing platform About Startup InvestingWhy invest in startups?By investing in startups, you are investing in an asset class that has the potential to provide substantial ROI, to access investment opportunities that were previously unavailable to the masses, to empower companies doing something meaningful to you, and to drive positive change in the world.What is equity crowdfunding?Crowdfunding uses the collective cooperation of the “crowd” to pool resources together in support of a specific project. Equity-based crowdfunding is where individual investors contribute funds to a business or project in exchange for equity.Why invest with equity crowdfunding?Equity crowdfunding allows you to tap into the investment opportunities once reserved for big players like venture capital firms. On equity crowdfunding platforms like OurCrowd, you can find exclusive opportunities to buy stakes in private startup companies, putting your money to work alongside experienced investors, and join the growing trend of getting in on the ground floor rather than waiting for a company to go public.Using OurCrowdHow do I join OurCrowd?It is simple to sign up: Register as an accredited investor; once your account is set up, you’ll have full access to information about the OurCrowd companies available for investment. Please note that there may be additional accreditation requirements that you must fulfill before making investments.Why is accreditation a requirement?Early stage, privately-held companies are high-risk investments, and many countries require individuals to meet certain financial criteria before being allowed to participate in these investments. Accreditation criteria vary country-by-country, but all address the following:Minimum level of income and/or net worth of investors.The investors must provide documents that proves that they meet these criteria.For example, the United States government requires that investors have an annual income of $200,000 ($300,000 if filing joint) for the last two years or a net worth, not including primary residence, of $1,000,000 in order to invest in early stage companies.*Accreditation criteria varies from country to country, for more information contact us.How do I make an investment?View the deals available to accredited investors in the “browse companies” section of the website. You will be provided with material about the company, including videos, presentation, analysis, deal terms, team backgrounds and more. You will also be able to participate in a webinar, call or meeting with company management as per request. Once you have decided to make an investment, you will indicate your amount on the Commit button. We will make allocations based on a process which combines both a first-come first-served and pro-rata calculation. We will send you deal documentation for signing and then transfer instructions.The deal documentation includes your signed certification that you meet your country’s income, asset, and/or experience criteria. In the US, you must have a licensed professional (broker, lawyer, accountant, investment adviser) sign a letter that certifies that you qualify. More details on our accreditation page.For further information browse the site, sign up, or contact us.Who is behind OurCrowd?Jon Medved, the co-founder and CEO of OurCrowd, is a leading Israeli venture capitalist and serial entrepreneur. He is the founder of Israel Seed, which has raised and managed $262M over four funds. He has made 100 investments (including both his angel and VC investment) in Israeli startup companies, 12 of which have reached an excess of $100M in value. Most recently, Jon founded and was the CEO of Vringo, publicly traded on NYSE MKT (VRNG).Steven Blumgart, the co-founder and Chairman of OurCrowd, is a leading investor and philanthropist. Steven was part of the senior management team at Glencore International (GLEN.LE) where he headed their aluminum business.Read more about Our Team

The Largest Investment Crowdfunding Platforms in the World
 Tweet7 Share39 Share73 +12 Reddit Pin EmailShares 121

January 2, 2017 @ 10:39 am By JD Alois 




Investment crowdfunding has quickly become a viable path for early to mid stage companies to raise needed growth capital.  A truly global phenomenon, many funding platforms now operate in multiple countries sourcing both deals and investors aided by the power of the internet.
While larger is not always better, and investors will always measure a platform by the success of the issuers and returns generated, it is interesting to review of snapshot of progress. As of this writing, platforms do not adhere to a shared standard of reporting and totals change by the minute so biggest today does not necessarily mean largest tomorrow. The list below focuses solely on business funding platforms and does not include real estate nor other verticals. Some information has been sourced from Crowdsurfer, a UK based data aggregator.

SyndicateRoom (UK) – £62.4 million ($76.7M)
Cambridge-based SyndicateRoom has chosen an interesting path of pairing a professional Angel investor with crowd investors. As we understand it, deal terms have consistently been the same thus allowing unique access to an asset class that has been highly vetted.
Some notable facts:

Launched Fund Twenty8 that will invest in a minimum of 28 investments across various industries thus achieving solid diversification
Allows access to AIM listed companies with the SyndicateRoom Watch List
SyndicateRoom offers access to IPOs and share placements

Crowdfunder (US) – $160 Million
Crowdfunder and its VC Index Fund provide the opportunity for direct online investment into single ventures, as well as diversification into a broad VC-led portfolio (Index Fund) of early-stage startups.
Some notable facts:

Crowdfunder has over 36,000 companies with profiles on its platform and a network of 130,000 entrepreneurs and investors.
Average deal size of $1.8 million

Seedrs (UK) – £160 million ($196M)
Seedrs was the second crowdfunding platform to launch in the UK. Today the company has 63 team members in five different offices.  At some point in the future, Seedrs expects to launch a US platform using Title II (Reg D – 506c) of the JOBS Act to raise capital from accredited investors. Over 400 deals have been funded on the platform
Some notable facts:

Largest raise to date was Perkbox at £4.35 million
Seedrs announced a platform-wide IRR of 14.4% this past November
Beauhurst ranked Seedrs 1st in UK Funded Deals for H1 2016

Crowdcube (UK) – £216 million ($265M)
The first platform to launch in the UK , the early start gave Crowdcube an early lead in funding totals that has since tightened up as other platforms have evolved.  The average raise stands at just under £500,000 as the deals have gotten larger pushing from early stage into more mature companies.
Some notable facts:

Recent self-crowdfunding round raised over £7 million
BrewDog recently raised £10 million in a mini-bond offer making if the largest funding round ever on Crowdcube
Over 430 businesses have now raised money on the crowdfunding platform

CircleUp (US) – $300 million
Launched in 2012, CircleUp is on a mission to fill the funding gap for early stage consumer and retail companies.  CircleUp calls itself “marketplace investing” and is a hybrid platform with about half of the funding coming from institutional investors and the other portion from accredited investors.
Some notable facts:

Average raise stands at $1 million with an average investment of $100,000
Claims to be the “World’s largest network of consumer & retail investors”
Launched the CircleUp Marketplace Index Fund in 2015 providing immediate diversification with 25 different companies

OurCrowd (Israel) – $320 + Million
Leading proponent of the Startup Nation and global investment crowdfunding platform may be best positioned to challenge AngelList at the top of the investment crowdfunding list. A truly global platform that sources deal from around the world, OurCrowd boasts 9 exits to date. OurCrowd invests in every single deal listed on its platform thus aligning their interest with investors.
Some notable facts:

OurCrowd funded the first crowdfunded company to list on a public exchange – ReWalk
The company hosts the largest investment crowdfunding conference in the world with its annual summit in Jerusalem
OurCrowd has started offering sector funds to easily facilitate diversification

AngelList – $425+  Million
AngelList is perhaps the best-known funding platform with its Silicon Valley roots and high profile investors. AngelList describes itself as a platform where tech companies raise money and recruit. Over 1,000 companies have raised money with their assistance. AngelList uses a syndicate strategy that allows smaller (accredited) investors to participate in VC like funds led by sophisticated investors. In November, AngelList acquired Product Hunt adding another twist to its expanding social / funding platform.
Some notable facts:

AngelList reported an estimated IRR of 46% since 2013
Earlier this year, Dollar Shave Club, a company that raised money on AngelList, sold for $1 billion
AngelList has launched the “Access Fund” for immediate diversification
VC firm CSC Upshot raised a $400 million fund to invest in startups on AngelList

Today’s biggest returns are going to early investors in private companies, especially high-growth technology companies that are changing nearly every aspect of life. Rather than wait for a company to go public, often at a high price, OurCrowd’s equity crowdfunding platform allows investors exclusive opportunities to buy stakes in private startup companies for as little as $10,000.

	The graph below shows how the days of seeing 600% returns in public technology companies are largely over, with such opportunities confined to private investments.

OurCrowd: Sparking the Next Wave of InnovationOurCrowd is the leading global equity crowdfunding platform for accredited investors. Managed by a team of seasoned investment professionals, OurCrowd vets and selects opportunities, invests its own capital, and brings companies to its accredited membership of global investors. OurCrowd provides post-investment support to its portfolio companies, assigns industry experts as mentors, and takes board seats. The OurCrowd community of almost 20,000 investors from over 112 countries has invested over $440M into 120 portfolio companies and funds.OurCrowd's role as a startup investing platform About Startup InvestingWhy invest in startups?By investing in startups, you are investing in an asset class that has the potential to provide substantial ROI, to access investment opportunities that were previously unavailable to the masses, to empower companies doing something meaningful to you, and to drive positive change in the world.What is equity crowdfunding?Crowdfunding uses the collective cooperation of the “crowd” to pool resources together in support of a specific project. Equity-based crowdfunding is where individual investors contribute funds to a business or project in exchange for equity.Why invest with equity crowdfunding?Equity crowdfunding allows you to tap into the investment opportunities once reserved for big players like venture capital firms. On equity crowdfunding platforms like OurCrowd, you can find exclusive opportunities to buy stakes in private startup companies, putting your money to work alongside experienced investors, and join the growing trend of getting in on the ground floor rather than waiting for a company to go public.Using OurCrowdHow do I join OurCrowd?It is simple to sign up: Register as an accredited investor; once your account is set up, you’ll have full access to information about the OurCrowd companies available for investment. Please note that there may be additional accreditation requirements that you must fulfill before making investments.Why is accreditation a requirement?Early stage, privately-held companies are high-risk investments, and many countries require individuals to meet certain financial criteria before being allowed to participate in these investments. Accreditation criteria vary country-by-country, but all address the following:Minimum level of income and/or net worth of investors.The investors must provide documents that proves that they meet these criteria.For example, the United States government requires that investors have an annual income of $200,000 ($300,000 if filing joint) for the last two years or a net worth, not including primary residence, of $1,000,000 in order to invest in early stage companies.*Accreditation criteria varies from country to country, for more information contact us.How do I make an investment?View the deals available to accredited investors in the “browse companies” section of the website. You will be provided with material about the company, including videos, presentation, analysis, deal terms, team backgrounds and more. You will also be able to participate in a webinar, call or meeting with company management as per request. Once you have decided to make an investment, you will indicate your amount on the Commit button. We will make allocations based on a process which combines both a first-come first-served and pro-rata calculation. We will send you deal documentation for signing and then transfer instructions.The deal documentation includes your signed certification that you meet your country’s income, asset, and/or experience criteria. In the US, you must have a licensed professional (broker, lawyer, accountant, investment adviser) sign a letter that certifies that you qualify. More details on our accreditation page.For further information browse the site, sign up, or contact us.Who is behind OurCrowd?Jon Medved, the co-founder and CEO of OurCrowd, is a leading Israeli venture capitalist and serial entrepreneur. He is the founder of Israel Seed, which has raised and managed $262M over four funds. He has made 100 investments (including both his angel and VC investment) in Israeli startup companies, 12 of which have reached an excess of $100M in value. Most recently, Jon founded and was the CEO of Vringo, publicly traded on NYSE MKT (VRNG).Steven Blumgart, the co-founder and Chairman of OurCrowd, is a leading investor and philanthropist. Steven was part of the senior management team at Glencore International (GLEN.LE) where he headed their aluminum business.Read more about Our Team

It may be a good idea to read a few PitchBook reviews first as certain software can excel just in a really narrow set of applications or be designed with a very specific type of industry in mind. Others might function with a goal of being easy and intuitive and consequently lack complex features welcomed by more experienced users. You can also find software that cater to a large group of customers and provide a powerful feature toolbox, however this frequently comes at a higher price of such a service. Ensure you're aware of your requirements so that you get a solution that offers all the features you look for. How Much Does PitchBook Cost?PitchBook Pricing Plans: Contact PitchBook for enterprise pricing information and other product details. You can also submit a request for a free trial to see if the software is a perfect fit for your business. User SatisfactionWe realize that when you make a decision to buy Business Intelligence Software it’s important not only to see how experts evaluate it in their reviews, but also to find out if the real people and companies that buy it are actually satisfied with the product. That’s why we’ve created our behavior-based Customer Satisfaction Algorithm™ that gathers customer reviews, comments and PitchBook reviews across a wide range of social media sites. The data is then presented in an easy to digest form showing how many people had positive and negative experience with PitchBook. With that information at hand you should be equipped to make an informed buying decision that you won’t regret.POSITIVE SOCIAL MENTIONS 59 NEGATIVE SOCIAL MENTIONS 2 Video Technical details Devices SupportedWindowsMacWeb-based Language SupportUSAUKCanadaInternational Pricing ModelQuote-based Customer TypesSmall BusinessLarge EnterprisesMedium Business DeploymentCloud Hosted What Support Does This Vendor Offer?

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
