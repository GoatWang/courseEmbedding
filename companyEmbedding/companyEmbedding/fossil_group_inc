Watches That Make You Tick
Watches. We rely on them to get us where we need to be—on time. And with proper care, they’ll do just that. It’s an uncomplicated relationship. But is that all you expect in a watch? Not a chance. And is that all our watch designs strive toward? Well, you know the answer. Your wrist watch just might be the most defining accessory you could choose. Whether your taste runs the gamut of designer watches to expensive watches—even sport multifunction watches—we know that what you put on your wrist takes thought and maybe even a little time (how ironic) to settle on. It’s because you know that at a glance, your watch says something about you. And for the curious, it gives just enough insight as to who you are.
We’ve Got Your Wrist Watches Covered
Our Fossil watch collections for men and women are inspired by a relentless commitment to timeless design, yet their modern functionality showcases undeniable Swiss craftsmanship. From colorful to deconstructed leathers, shiny multi-color metals to fascinating watch cases for the tech savvy, you’re sure to find the watch that fits your personal style. With that said, we’re pretty sure you’ll find several watches to fit your lifestyle perfectly. Looking for a gift, maybe specifically Valentines Day gifts, anniversary gifts or graduation gifts? You know exactly who your someone is, show them you’ve been paying attention. We have the styles, looks and designs men and women will both love—and love you for. So take a look around—there’s no limit to curiosity around here.

Nasdaq opens flat; Dow, S&P 500 slide
The Nasdaq Composite Index opened flat Wednesday, even as the other two main benchmarks saw modest declines, following President Donald Trump's abrupt firing late Tuesday of FBI Director James Comey. The S&P 500 index  slid 2 points, or 0.1%, to 2,394, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average  shed 54 points, or 0.1%, to 20,926. The Nasdaq  was off 2 points points, or less than 0.1%, at 6,118. Trump fired Comey late Tuesday on the advice of Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Sessions' deputy, Rod Rosenstein. Among individual stocks, shares of Abercrombie & Fitch Co.  soared after Reuters reported that the retailer was fielding buyout interest. Fossil Group Inc.  skidded following a disappointing earnings report.

Company history[edit]
Fossil was founded in 1984 as Overseas Products International by Tom Kartsotis, a former Texas A&M University student living in Dallas from a suggestion by his older brother, Kosta Kartsotis, a merchandising executive at Sanger-Harris. Kosta told his younger brother about the potential large profits that could be made in importing retail goods made in the Far East, specifically in importing moderately-priced fashion watches.[1] Their main product was fashion watches with a retro look. In 1990, they introduced leather goods under the Fossil brand, and the Relic line of watches.
Fossil had its initial public offering in 1993.[1][7]
Zodiac Watches was a Swiss brand that had been operating since 1882 when Fossil acquired it from Genender International in 2001 for $4.7 million.[8] Fossil's desire to establish a Swiss presence led to the purchase of the Zodiac Watch brand and a complete retooling of that line to reflect a retro modern 1970s style in a higher end watch. The 2004 purchase of Michele Watch completed the cycle by offering a high-end Swiss watch with a designer flair.
In September 2007, Fossil was accused of infringing a patent owned by Financial Innovations Systems, LLC, in a lawsuit filed in the Northern District of Texas. The case was settled for an undisclosed amount and dismissed shortly thereafter.[9]
The Watch Station International chain was purchased from Luxottica/Sunglass Hut in December 2007.[10]
Fossil has design studios in Biel, Switzerland close to Rolex as well as manufacturing facilities in China and distribution centers in Dallas, Germany, and Asia.[11]
In 2012 Fossil, Inc. agreed to purchase Skagen Designs, Ltd. and some of its partners for approximately $225 million in cash and 150,000 Fossil shares. The total value paid by Fossil would be approximately $236.8 million.[12][13]
In early 2013, Fossil introduced their upscale and more expensive "Fossil Swiss" line of watches which are made in Switzerland.[14][15]
In November 2015, Fossil acquired Misfit for $260 million, with plans to incorporate Misfit's technology into traditional-looking watches.[16]
License business[edit]




Previous logo for the Fossil Group.


Fossil has financial success with its own brands and this success has led a number of deals for licensed watch lines. In 2001, Fossil collaborated with designer Philippe Starck to create the Starck with Fossil watch collection. The collection features ultra-modern designs and unique movement. Other licensed watch lines that Fossil designs, manufactures, and distributes include Burberry, DKNY, Emporio Armani, Armani Exchange, Columbia Sportswear, Diesel, Frank Gehry, Karl Lagerfeld, Tory Burch, Kate Spade, Michael Kors, Callaway Golf, Davis Cup, Marc by Marc Jacobs, Skagen Designs, Michele, and Adidas. When referencing Fossil's watch lines, they are generally regarded as a "manufacturer"; Fossil also designs and manufacture their own movements under the Fossil Twist Line.[17]
Special products[edit]




The Fossil Wrist PDA released in 2003, which runs Palm OS


In addition, the company produces collectibles, some of which are based on popular films or pop culture characters. Previous designs include: Superman; Batman; Wonder Woman; Elvis Presley; Pirates of the Caribbean; Flash; Green Lantern; Snoopy, Pokémon; Star Wars; Chronicles of Narnia; Cars; and The Matrix.
In 2003, the company released the "Fossil Wrist PDA" wristwatch computer which is a tiny Palm OS-based PDA worn like a watch. In 2006, Fossil released a Caller ID watch.[18]
In 2006, Fossil teamed up with the National Football League in the United States to make the official watch collection for each team.[19] Fossil also caters to special markets that seek to customize products.[20]
Awards[edit]
Fossil won awards for "Most Effective Use of Online Creative" and "Best of Show" awards for the 6th Annual DFWIMA Excellence in Interactive Marketing (in 2006).[21] Fossil has also been voted one of the Top 100 Best Companies to work for in the U.K in 2013 and 2015.[22][23]
In 2016, Fossil won Fashion Tech Collection of the Year for their connected designer smartwatches and jewelry. Their analog smartwatches and connected jewelry span across their licensing brands such as Diesel, Armani, Michael Kors, and Kate Spade.[24]

Nasdaq opens flat; Dow, S&P 500 slide
The Nasdaq Composite Index opened flat Wednesday, even as the other two main benchmarks saw modest declines, following President Donald Trump's abrupt firing late Tuesday of FBI Director James Comey. The S&P 500 index  slid 2 points, or 0.1%, to 2,394, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average  shed 54 points, or 0.1%, to 20,926. The Nasdaq  was off 2 points points, or less than 0.1%, at 6,118. Trump fired Comey late Tuesday on the advice of Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Sessions' deputy, Rod Rosenstein. Among individual stocks, shares of Abercrombie & Fitch Co.  soared after Reuters reported that the retailer was fielding buyout interest. Fossil Group Inc.  skidded following a disappointing earnings report.

Company history[edit]
Fossil was founded in 1984 as Overseas Products International by Tom Kartsotis, a former Texas A&M University student living in Dallas from a suggestion by his older brother, Kosta Kartsotis, a merchandising executive at Sanger-Harris. Kosta told his younger brother about the potential large profits that could be made in importing retail goods made in the Far East, specifically in importing moderately-priced fashion watches.[1] Their main product was fashion watches with a retro look. In 1990, they introduced leather goods under the Fossil brand, and the Relic line of watches.
Fossil had its initial public offering in 1993.[1][7]
Zodiac Watches was a Swiss brand that had been operating since 1882 when Fossil acquired it from Genender International in 2001 for $4.7 million.[8] Fossil's desire to establish a Swiss presence led to the purchase of the Zodiac Watch brand and a complete retooling of that line to reflect a retro modern 1970s style in a higher end watch. The 2004 purchase of Michele Watch completed the cycle by offering a high-end Swiss watch with a designer flair.
In September 2007, Fossil was accused of infringing a patent owned by Financial Innovations Systems, LLC, in a lawsuit filed in the Northern District of Texas. The case was settled for an undisclosed amount and dismissed shortly thereafter.[9]
The Watch Station International chain was purchased from Luxottica/Sunglass Hut in December 2007.[10]
Fossil has design studios in Biel, Switzerland close to Rolex as well as manufacturing facilities in China and distribution centers in Dallas, Germany, and Asia.[11]
In 2012 Fossil, Inc. agreed to purchase Skagen Designs, Ltd. and some of its partners for approximately $225 million in cash and 150,000 Fossil shares. The total value paid by Fossil would be approximately $236.8 million.[12][13]
In early 2013, Fossil introduced their upscale and more expensive "Fossil Swiss" line of watches which are made in Switzerland.[14][15]
In November 2015, Fossil acquired Misfit for $260 million, with plans to incorporate Misfit's technology into traditional-looking watches.[16]
License business[edit]




Previous logo for the Fossil Group.


Fossil has financial success with its own brands and this success has led a number of deals for licensed watch lines. In 2001, Fossil collaborated with designer Philippe Starck to create the Starck with Fossil watch collection. The collection features ultra-modern designs and unique movement. Other licensed watch lines that Fossil designs, manufactures, and distributes include Burberry, DKNY, Emporio Armani, Armani Exchange, Columbia Sportswear, Diesel, Frank Gehry, Karl Lagerfeld, Tory Burch, Kate Spade, Michael Kors, Callaway Golf, Davis Cup, Marc by Marc Jacobs, Skagen Designs, Michele, and Adidas. When referencing Fossil's watch lines, they are generally regarded as a "manufacturer"; Fossil also designs and manufacture their own movements under the Fossil Twist Line.[17]
Special products[edit]




The Fossil Wrist PDA released in 2003, which runs Palm OS


In addition, the company produces collectibles, some of which are based on popular films or pop culture characters. Previous designs include: Superman; Batman; Wonder Woman; Elvis Presley; Pirates of the Caribbean; Flash; Green Lantern; Snoopy, Pokémon; Star Wars; Chronicles of Narnia; Cars; and The Matrix.
In 2003, the company released the "Fossil Wrist PDA" wristwatch computer which is a tiny Palm OS-based PDA worn like a watch. In 2006, Fossil released a Caller ID watch.[18]
In 2006, Fossil teamed up with the National Football League in the United States to make the official watch collection for each team.[19] Fossil also caters to special markets that seek to customize products.[20]
Awards[edit]
Fossil won awards for "Most Effective Use of Online Creative" and "Best of Show" awards for the 6th Annual DFWIMA Excellence in Interactive Marketing (in 2006).[21] Fossil has also been voted one of the Top 100 Best Companies to work for in the U.K in 2013 and 2015.[22][23]
In 2016, Fossil won Fashion Tech Collection of the Year for their connected designer smartwatches and jewelry. Their analog smartwatches and connected jewelry span across their licensing brands such as Diesel, Armani, Michael Kors, and Kate Spade.[24]

Company history[edit]
Fossil was founded in 1984 as Overseas Products International by Tom Kartsotis, a former Texas A&M University student living in Dallas from a suggestion by his older brother, Kosta Kartsotis, a merchandising executive at Sanger-Harris. Kosta told his younger brother about the potential large profits that could be made in importing retail goods made in the Far East, specifically in importing moderately-priced fashion watches.[1] Their main product was fashion watches with a retro look. In 1990, they introduced leather goods under the Fossil brand, and the Relic line of watches.
Fossil had its initial public offering in 1993.[1][7]
Zodiac Watches was a Swiss brand that had been operating since 1882 when Fossil acquired it from Genender International in 2001 for $4.7 million.[8] Fossil's desire to establish a Swiss presence led to the purchase of the Zodiac Watch brand and a complete retooling of that line to reflect a retro modern 1970s style in a higher end watch. The 2004 purchase of Michele Watch completed the cycle by offering a high-end Swiss watch with a designer flair.
In September 2007, Fossil was accused of infringing a patent owned by Financial Innovations Systems, LLC, in a lawsuit filed in the Northern District of Texas. The case was settled for an undisclosed amount and dismissed shortly thereafter.[9]
The Watch Station International chain was purchased from Luxottica/Sunglass Hut in December 2007.[10]
Fossil has design studios in Biel, Switzerland close to Rolex as well as manufacturing facilities in China and distribution centers in Dallas, Germany, and Asia.[11]
In 2012 Fossil, Inc. agreed to purchase Skagen Designs, Ltd. and some of its partners for approximately $225 million in cash and 150,000 Fossil shares. The total value paid by Fossil would be approximately $236.8 million.[12][13]
In early 2013, Fossil introduced their upscale and more expensive "Fossil Swiss" line of watches which are made in Switzerland.[14][15]
In November 2015, Fossil acquired Misfit for $260 million, with plans to incorporate Misfit's technology into traditional-looking watches.[16]
License business[edit]




Previous logo for the Fossil Group.


Fossil has financial success with its own brands and this success has led a number of deals for licensed watch lines. In 2001, Fossil collaborated with designer Philippe Starck to create the Starck with Fossil watch collection. The collection features ultra-modern designs and unique movement. Other licensed watch lines that Fossil designs, manufactures, and distributes include Burberry, DKNY, Emporio Armani, Armani Exchange, Columbia Sportswear, Diesel, Frank Gehry, Karl Lagerfeld, Tory Burch, Kate Spade, Michael Kors, Callaway Golf, Davis Cup, Marc by Marc Jacobs, Skagen Designs, Michele, and Adidas. When referencing Fossil's watch lines, they are generally regarded as a "manufacturer"; Fossil also designs and manufacture their own movements under the Fossil Twist Line.[17]
Special products[edit]




The Fossil Wrist PDA released in 2003, which runs Palm OS


In addition, the company produces collectibles, some of which are based on popular films or pop culture characters. Previous designs include: Superman; Batman; Wonder Woman; Elvis Presley; Pirates of the Caribbean; Flash; Green Lantern; Snoopy, Pokémon; Star Wars; Chronicles of Narnia; Cars; and The Matrix.
In 2003, the company released the "Fossil Wrist PDA" wristwatch computer which is a tiny Palm OS-based PDA worn like a watch. In 2006, Fossil released a Caller ID watch.[18]
In 2006, Fossil teamed up with the National Football League in the United States to make the official watch collection for each team.[19] Fossil also caters to special markets that seek to customize products.[20]
Awards[edit]
Fossil won awards for "Most Effective Use of Online Creative" and "Best of Show" awards for the 6th Annual DFWIMA Excellence in Interactive Marketing (in 2006).[21] Fossil has also been voted one of the Top 100 Best Companies to work for in the U.K in 2013 and 2015.[22][23]
In 2016, Fossil won Fashion Tech Collection of the Year for their connected designer smartwatches and jewelry. Their analog smartwatches and connected jewelry span across their licensing brands such as Diesel, Armani, Michael Kors, and Kate Spade.[24]

Making an Impact: Dale Mize



We’re proud of our employees who relentlessly work to help our world thrive. This special series highlights how our people work to do good, in their job and for the world.
At the end of the day, whether he’s leading our operations management team or tackling challenges big and small in our distribution center, Dale Mize is a solutions guy. So when he noticed a large amount of materials that was going to go to waste, he refused to let it happen. 
We talked with Dale about how he’s always on the lookout for opportunities to do sustainable good.
Describe the opportunity you discovered to do more sustainable good:
We needed to dispose of some old fixtures and packaging, and typically they would have been sent to a landfill. This didn’t seem right, so I started asking questions. I knew there had to be a better solution and became determined to find a new home for these items. After reaching out to several organizations, we found a place that would put all of it to use in a helpful way.
In this gallery: Dwell With Dignity domestic and corporate locations outfitted with wire baskets, chairs and other fixtures donated by Fossil Group
How did Fossil Group support you in improving your business practices?
Fossil Group pointed me in the right direction for a solution, providing contact information for people and companies that may be able to help. They believed in what I believed in, and it was definitely a group effort.
We are working hard to make progress, and it’s exciting that we still have so many opportunities to be more sustainable in what we do, whether it’s in product or packaging. Everyone is on the same page and working together to make things happen.
We have a great team here at Fossil, and I know we’ll continue to make the world better together.
Can you share any of the impact your efforts have had?
As we looked for ways to repurpose leather, we discovered organizations that would help us upcycle the product in a game-changing way.
We’ve also made sizable donations to organizations like Dwell With Dignity and Habitat For Humanity—everything from wire baskets, vintage trucks, wooden stools, tables, you name it. So far, we’ve recycled 507,698 units of fixtures, packaging, displays and promotional items and this is only the beginning.
0Total number of items Dale facilitated recycling in the last year Fossil Group is on a mission to make an impact—to put in more than we take out. Thanks to people like Dale, we are helping our world thrive. Click here to learn more about what our employees are doing to create positive change.











Making an Impact: Melody Leung



We’re proud of our employees who relentlessly work to help our world thrive. This special series highlights how our people work to do good, in their job and for the world.
As Fossil East Group Manager for display fixture development, Melody Leung isn’t just sourcing vendors, planning orders and managing production. She’s also looking out for the world (and our bottom line). Melody saw room for improvement in our fixture packaging and took action.
Here, she speaks with us about her efforts (and the sustainable mindset that drives her).
Describe the opportunity you discovered to be more sustainable:
I noticed some opportunities to improve how we package our fixtures and reduce our environmental waste. I explored eco-friendly materials and researched ways we could be better. There were many: Eliminating additional stuffing and materials like styrofoam and sponge. Getting rid of unnecessary sealing tape and poly bags (this saves time when stores unpack as well). Making packaging less bulky in general to reduce carton sizes and save money. 
Main finding: The little things can add up to a lot.
How did you tackle this opportunity?
Collaboration with key team members was important as we examined our packaging from every angle. We also worked with our key suppliers to review the packing materials, redesign packing methods and perform packing drop tests.
Fossil Group stops at nothing to improve the way we do things. I love how everything is designed with the future in mind and am inspired by our global effort to leave the world better than we found it.MelodyCan you share any metrics of impact that you have had?
By reducing and redesigning our packaging, we have seen substantial savings in both our freight size and our shipping and operational costs. We have also received positive feedback from our suppliers about our new approaches. It’s been great to see our China suppliers adopt and support this change. They are realizing that, by taking a sustainable viewpoint, they can influence change in a positive way.
What causes are you passionate about outside of work?
I am passionate about tropical rainforests, which are in danger around the world. Problems like deforestation, agriculture and mining are causing them to be ultimately unsustainable. One day I would like to be a part of the solution.
What do you love about working at Fossil Group?
Fossil Group stops at nothing to improve the way we do things. I love how everything is designed with the future in mind and am inspired by our global effort to leave the world better than we found it.

One Big Pick-Me-Up: An Entire Region Recycles Together



Here at Fossil Group, when one of our employees feels passionate about a way to make our world better, we’re all in. Helping the world thrive means helping our people thrive, too. That’s how a whole region of stores came together to make a difference—all supporting one driven leader with a simple idea.
Ready, Set, Collect!Over the last few months, Fossil and Watch Station outlet stores throughout our Central region worked together to better our world. They simply recognized the obvious: that collecting an item a great deal of people touch daily (and doing so across the country) had the potential to really make a difference.
In an effort to reduce the earth’s carbon footprint and repurpose what would have been trash, teams set out to gather as many plastic water bottles as they could. 
With a team captain leading the way in each district, they got strategic and got going, finding unique ways to make maximum impact. Stores put up posters, sent emails, involved schools and other organizations in the community and really just, went for it.
About REPREVE®
Our outlet teams had a special insight on just what a recycled water bottle can do, making the mission that much more meaningful. As part of a pilot program, each store carries outlet-exclusive product from a special organization called REPREVE®.
REPREVE® turns recycled plastic bottles into durable fiber to create useful, everyday products. We partnered with them to create an eco-friendly tote in our favorite seasonal prints—offering customers a product they can be proud of for even more than its great design. Having that product as motivation, the stores felt the impact of every bottle.
What HappenedFrom Chicago through Texas and Florida, all 55 stores in our Central region participated. And it paid off. 
In just a few short months, around 80,000 bottles were collected (for perspective, that would be enough to create close to 9,000 REPREVE® bags). One store alone—our Watch Station Outlet at Orlando Premium—collected almost half of the total amount.
Brian Sloan, Regional Outlet Manager (and bottles-on-his-car-floor guy), says, “Ideas are embraced and encouraged among divisions, departments and individuals to make an impact for Fossil (and the world).” Really though, is there any other way?
Thanks, outlet teams, for helping our world thrive. See the Sustainability section on our site to learn more about our sustainability journey. To discover how Fossil Group supports our employees taking action in their own communities, visit our Community Impact page.

Spring Fest



Blue skies and sunshine were the backdrop for Fossil Group’s 2017 Spring Fest, one of the company’s many annual events.
The annual event allowed employees at Fossil’s global headquarters to take a break from the day-to-day and enjoy food trucks, frozen treats, outdoor activities and music played by a live DJ. Before the event even began, there was a line of employees anxious to kick things off.
For competitive employees, the human foosball game, life-size Jenga and obstacle course stole the show. Meanwhile, those looking to simply relax and take a break from the workday enjoyed wine pops, craft beer, ice cream and snacks from Cafe54—the incredible cafeteria at global headquarters. The afternoon created a great escape from the workweek and a reminder how unique Fossil’s culture really is.

Spooktoberfest 2016



Halloween is serious business around here. In true Fossil Group fashion, we raise our costume bar higher each year—making every Halloween our best one yet. Our people put just as much passion and creativity into their theme as they do everything else, so the day is both extra entertaining and competitive as teams vie for best costume and spookiest space. 
It’s one of our favorite events of the year, because along with the Stranger Things and Ghostbuster characters, our culture comes out to play in a wickedly fun way.

Creative Class: Meet Jin-Ya



We are proud of our strong company culture rooted in collaboration and innovation. This special series highlights the creativity of our employees on and off the clock.
Jin-Ya Huang. Packaging Manager, Fossil-owned Brands. Mixed Media Artist.
Jin-Ya is a creative dynamo. As a Packaging Manager for Fossil-owned brands, including Skagen, Michele and Zodiac, she works alongside creatives all day to ensure their designs come to fruition. As a mixed media artist, she leverages her zeal for the arts to engage and educate communities, using art to make a positive difference in the lives of others.
We asked Jin-Ya a few questions to get to know her and her Creative Class persona on a more intimate level.
What is your Creative Class hobby or business?
I am a mixed media artist. My work aims to make a social difference through education, mentorship and public art.
—
What do you do at Fossil and what makes your job unique?
I am a packaging manager for Fossil leathers, Skagen, Relic and Watch Station. I get to work with the creatives on sourcing materials that best make their design dreams come true. My art background helps me keep a keen eye on standards. I grew up speaking Chinese, and my bilingual skills help out tremendously when we work with the Fossil East offices.
—
How does your Creative Class skill set align with what you do for your day job?
I’m very involved with the artist community, but working with talented people in our city does not stop with art. Being asked to conduct workshops, teach camps, and mentor art/marketing classes with kids is no different than project managing a job and collaborating with various teams in a global corporation.

—
How did you get started and what was your original inspiration?
When I came to the States at age 13, I only knew my ABCs. I found art to be a universal language. Moving to the US reaffirmed my passion for art, which I’ve had since the age of three. My inspirations have been the diaspora experience, translating the immigrant plight, my many teachers/mentors and, mostly, my mom. Her volunteerism and selflessness have been a true inspiration for me all my life.
—
What are some successes you’ve had with your Creative Class business?
I am grateful to have had the chance to show my art in Dallas, Miami and New York. I was fortunate to have taught workshops for adults at SMU, continuing education at the Rachofsky House, and mentored kids at the Fort Worth Modern, Oil & Cotton, TeCo Bishop Arts Theater, 29 Pieces, Booker T., Vickery Meadow Trans.lation and most recently, Big Thought and All Stars Project.
I’ve been involved as a speaker for the Cultural City in the Dallas City of Ideas Festival and collaborated on a show with two amazing non-profits. First is Make Art with Purpose, an organization and virtual resource center for creative projects that are shaping and transforming our world in positive ways. Second, is Human Rights Initiative, a nonprofit that offers 100 percent free legal service to immigrants in the DFW area seeking political asylum or shelter from abuse. My mother and I were featured in the December holiday issue of Southern Living as Tastemakers by the Editor-at-large, Jenna Bush Hager. All of these experiences have been wonderful and beyond my hopes and imagination. If I’m able to positively affect one person in his/her perspective on art/life, then I know I’ve been successful.
—
What are some of your tips/techniques?
My mom always told me, “If you do what you love, the rest will come.” It’s been excellent advice, not only in my creative endeavors but in my corporate practice as well. I tell the kids this all the time. The act of making art has to come from the heart and flow freely.
—
How do you balance your Creative Class persona and your main career?
I don’t really have to balance them. They are one and the same! It’s important for an artist to find aspirations in life, and it’s our job to help humanity see the beauty in every detail. Whether that’s helping a child whose school cannot afford art programs, working with them so they can earn their college scholarship fund, or assisting my fellow team member to find the best materials that can best execute their designs in the most cost efficient manner—it’s all about giving your best.
—
What is your dream of where this could lead?
My dream is to be able to practice social awareness art on a broader level, in our own backyard, to help reach more people than I’m able to now. I am a mom to a bright 8-year-old boy named Lang. I would love for him to grow up knowing we can change the world for the better by practicing kindness every day, one act at a time.

The people that I get to work with (as well as our customers) make my job special and unique.
—
How does your Creative Class skill set align with what you do for your day job?
I have always had a passion for watches and jewels, so being able to work at Fossil during the day and then design distinctive pieces after hours aligns perfectly with my creative skill set. The same creative thinking approach that I use in my hobby is also what helps me to succeed in my day job.
My hope is that if I can share my passion with others,
I can inspire at least one person to live out their dream.How do you balance your Creative Class persona and your main career?
I find that designing and creating jewelry helps me to clear my headspace and relaxes me so that I can manage my stores effectively.

Creative Class: Meet Bridgette



We are proud of our strong company culture rooted in collaboration and innovation. This special series highlights the creativity of our employees on and off the clock.
Bridgette Burke. Product Coordinator. Patternmaker and Grader.Bridgette brings big ideas to life, both in her work at Fossil and as a budding entrepreneur. We asked Bridgette more about her Creative Class persona, and here’s what she had to say:
What is your Creative Class Hobby or Business?
My Creative Class business is called The Crazy Grader, a small business-to-business operation dedicated to helping upstart fashion houses, manufacturing companies, and private individuals meet their patternmaking and grading goals. The Crazy Grader was derived from a mind that is equal parts creative and technical. I guess I get that from my parents; my dad is a drummer and my mom, a hairstylist, both of which require creative and technical expertise in their fields.
—
What do you do at Fossil and what makes your job unique?
I work on the Ladies Jewelry Product Development team. Along with my amazing teammates Crystal and Phaedra, I manage the seasonal production lifecycle for the ladies jewelry business. I have the opportunity to see the designs created by our talented designers and then my team has those designs sampled and produced through our factories, all the while negotiating to make the best product at the best cost. We see the styles through the entire production lifecycle from concept to market. Pretty exciting!

How does your Creative Class skill set align with what you do for your day job?
Attention to detail is of high importance in both roles. In patternmaking and grading, attention to detail is required to deliver patterns that are perfectly balanced and trued, which will create a quality fit. In the jewelry making business, the same level of attention to detail is required throughout the production lifecycle in order to deliver a quality product to Fossil’s stores and its wholesalers.
—
How did you get started and what was your original inspiration?
While finishing up college for Fashion Design, my classmates would often see me grading my professor’s original first patterns to various sizes and would ask if I could also grade their patterns. Fashion designers love the design aspect, but most do not enjoy the pattern making and grading piece of it. All of that technical stuff is “just not sexy” to them. So, that’s where I come in.
Prior to graduation, I entered a Little Black Dress Designer competition, and grabbed second place out of over 100 student designers. This large cash award, along with another cash award earned from The Fashionista’s Fashion Fund, went straight into a business account and grew from there. I set up the business, purchased the computer software, sewing and printing equipment and supplies needed to upstart my business and got to it.
Growing up, my dream has always been to design clothing. I would draw clothing for my paper dolls and figure out the perfect fit on the girls.What are some successes you’ve had with your Creative Class business?
One of my most recent successes occurred just this past holiday season when I developed an outsourcing partnership with a local manufacturing company to grade their client’s patterns on an ongoing basis. I had previously introduced my business to this company over a year ago. They recently lost their pattern grader and remembered me!
—
Q: What is your dream of where this could lead?
I am definitely a dreamer! Growing up, my dream has always been to design clothing. I would draw clothing for my paper dolls and figure out the perfect fit on the girls. I remember making an outfit at 12-years-old and my sassy auntie put on her heels and statement jewelry and wore it out dancing and looked amazing in it!
Though I am not necessarily living the designer’s life that I dreamed of as a young girl, I have found my niche in the business of fashion and plan to grow from there. What’s next? Pretapatterns.com, a business-to-consumer independent fashion pattern line for the intermediate to advanced level home sewer who loves designer clothing sold ready-to-wear (pret-a-porter). Also, an iOS app (to be released at a later date) is under design that will operate in support the pattern line. Pretapatterns.com will be live March 15.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score
A


Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Additionally, some Internet browsers have a ‘do not track’ feature that lets you tell websites that you do not want to have your online activities tracked. These features are not yet uniform, so we are currently not set up to respond to such signals.
 
TYPES OF COOKIES
We use session Cookies that expire at the end of a browser session (from when a user opens the browser window to when they exit the browser) and persistent Cookies which remain on your hard drive until you erase them or they expire. How long a persistent Cookie remains on your browser depends on how long the visited website has programmed the Cookie to last or they can be stored for longer.
We use Cookies for different purposes, which can be categorized as follows:

Functional Cookies: These Cookies are required for the website to function and for you to use our services. They include, for example, Cookies that enable you to log in, use a wish list or store products in a shopping cart.

In these instances, we will need to share your Personal Information with these companies. Further examples of other services are online surveys, credit checks and supporting and maintaining our IT infrastructure.

Where we engage service providers that use Personal Information on behalf of us we will use reasonable measures to contractually ensure that Personal Information is only used for the purposes defined by us and (provided that your Personal Information is subject to the Privacy Shield) we will remain liable for the requirement that processing of Personal Information by a service provider is consistent with our instructions unless we are not responsible for such inconsistent processing.

Unless you have opted out of such marketing use as set forth herein, occasionally we may also share your Personal Information with select third parties so that they can send you promotional materials about goods and services offered by them. We may also occasionally share your Personal Information with organizations that combine the Personal Information with publicly available information and information we receive from or cross-reference with our marketing partners and other third parties. We use that combined information to enhance your shopping experience with us, to communicate with you about our products, to inform you of events that may be of interest to you, and for other promotional purposes.



We may transfer your Personal Information to a third party in the event of a transfer of all or some of our assets to a third party, provided that the third party agrees to adhere to terms similar to those of this Privacy Policy. If your information is subject to Privacy Shield we will provide you with an opportunity to reject the transfer of your Personal Information in such cases.

On some pages we allow you to share Personal Information with third parties, such as social networks like Facebook. In these instances you are agreeing to the data being shared and the shared data is subject to the privacy policies of the third parties. We do not control and do not assume any responsibility for the use of Personal Information by such third parties. For more information about the third party’s purpose and scope of their use of Personal Information in connection with sharing features, please visit the privacy policies of such third parties.
