The investment return and principal value will fluctuate, and shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than the original cost. This chart represents historical performance and does not assume the effects of sales charges. If shown with sales charges, performance would have been lower.

Source: Morningstar. The Morningstar Rating may not be calculated based on its share class adjusted historical returns. If so, this investment's independent Morningstar Rating metric uses the fund's oldest share class to determine its hypothetical rating for certain time periods. The Morningstar Rating for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods. 2017 Morningstar, Inc.

The Fund may not be appropriate for all investors. The Fund may invest in certain sectors, increasing its vulnerability to any single economic, political, or regulatory developments; high yield ("junk") bonds, which are subject to greater credit and market risks; small-and mid-cap stocks, which may be subject to more erratic market movement then large-cap stocks; foreign securities, which are subject to currency fluctuation and political uncertainty; short sales, which involve costs and the risk of potentially unlimited losses; leveraging techniques, which may magnify losses; and derivative securities, which may carry market, credit, and liquidity risks. Fixed income investments are subject to interest rate risk, and their value will decline as interest rates rise. Diversification does not assure a profit or loss in declining markets. These risks may increase the Fund's share price volatility. There is no guarantee the Fund's objective will be achieved.


Average weighted market capitalization is the average market capitalization of stocks in a fund, each weighted by its proportion of assets. The P/E ratio (Source: Morningstar, Inc.) relates the price of a stock to the per-share earnings of the company. P/E is calculated using a harmonic weighted average, which excludes outliers that can easily skew results. Standard deviation depicts how widely returns vary around its average and is used to understand the range of returns most likely for a given fund. A higher standard deviation generally implies greater volatility. Turnover Ratio is the rate of trading in a portfolio, higher values imply more frequent trading. Average Maturity is the average time to maturity for a bond. Duration measures investment risk that takes into account both a bond's interest payments and its value to maturity. Holdings - Investment Grade (AAA to BBB range). Holdings - Non Investment Grade (BB and below range).  Credit quality is calculated using the highest rating assigned by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization (NRSRO) such as Moody’s, S&P, or Fitch. The Not Rated category consists of securities that have not been rated by an NRSRO. Due to data availability, statistics may not be as of the current reporting period.

Performance by share class may vary. Other share classes, which contain either a sales load or a contingent deferred sales charge, are also available. These expenses could lower total fund return. Please see the prospectus for additional information about fees, expenses and investor eligibility requirements.

Source: Morningstar. The Morningstar Rating may not be calculated based on its share class adjusted historical returns. If so, this investment's independent Morningstar Rating metric uses the fund's oldest share class to determine its hypothetical rating for certain time periods. The Morningstar Rating for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods. 2017 Morningstar, Inc.

Principal risks include: investing primarily in senior loans that are rated below investment grade; risk of investment in loans, where the Fund's ability to receive payments in connection with loans depends on the financial condition of the borrower (failure to receive such payments may reduce the value of the Fund's assets); fixed income instruments, which are subject to credit, market, and interest rate risk; interest rate risk, where the value will decline as interest rates rise; call and redemption risk, where the issuer may call a bond held by the Fund for redemption before it matures and the Fund may lose income; derivative securities, which may carry market, credit, and liquidity risks; high yield ("junk") bonds, which are subject to greater credit and market risks; foreign or non-U.S. securities, which are subject to the risks of currency fluctuation and political uncertainty; liquidity risk, which exists when particular investments are difficult to sell. The risks associated with the Fund are more fully explained in the prospectus and summary prospectus. Diversification does not assure a profit or protect against loss in declining markets. These risks may increase the Fund's share price volatility. There is no guarantee the Fund's objective will be achieved.


Average Maturity is the average time to maturity for a bond. Credit quality is calculated using the highest rating assigned by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization (NRSRO) such as Moody’s, S&P, or Fitch. The Not Rated category consists of securities that have not been rated by an NRSRO. Duration measures investment risk that takes into account both a bond's interest payments and its value to maturity. Standard deviation depicts how widely returns vary around its average and is used to understand the range of returns most likely for a given fund. A higher standard deviation generally implies greater volatility. Due to data availability, statistics may not be as of the current reporting period.

				The Power of Tax Deferral
			 
		






When you invest in a tax-deferred account such as a variable annuity, you delay paying income tax until you begin taking withdrawals, presumably after you retire.
So, instead of paying taxes on any investment growth each year, you keep that money compounding to help grow your retirement savings.

 Assumptions: 7% annual growth for all hypothetical accounts. The taxable investments assume taxes are withdrawn at 25% and 39.6% at the end of every year.
Tax-deferred accounts are subject to ordinary income tax at the time of withdrawals.
The hypothetical example does not reflect a specific annuity, an actual account value or the performance of any investment. It does not include fees or portfolio expenses which would lower performance.

Rebalancing your portfolio, portfolio turnover, and frequent trading can all have a signiﬁcant impact on investment return.  Premier Investment’s tax-free transfers let you move money within your investments without the tax implications.
























Tell your financial advisor if you've experienced the following:
These clues may indicate inefficiencies in how your money is being managed:

You received a 1099 form even though you didn't buy or sell an investment
You are receiving income that you are not spending
You receive dividends to support your income

This shows how the pro-growth fee structure works compared to a traditional fee structure.
It's important to note that your account value will fluctuate throughout the life of your contract, and if it falls below your premiums then your fee would be higher than the traditional annuity fee.

Footnote

What is a variable annuity?

A variable annuity is a contract with an insurance company. It's a long-term investment designed for retirement purposes. You invest money in professionally managed investment portfolios, where it accumulates tax-deferred. Investment returns and the principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor’s units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than the original investment. When you retire, your investment can be used to generate a stream of regular income payments that are guaranteed for as long as you live. In addition, variable annuities may provide a guaranteed death benefit for your beneficiaries. It is important to remember that annuity contracts contain exclusions, limitations, reductions of benefits and terms for keeping them in force.

Why does the company behind the annuity matter?

When the time comes for you to use the benefits that are offered by a variable annuity it is important to remember that all guarantees including the optional benefits are backed by the claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company and do not apply to the underlying investment options.

Who can help me determine if an annuity is right for me?

Your financial professional can help you determine if a variable annuity is suitable for you. Prudential Annuities and its distributors and representatives do not provide tax, accounting, or legal advice. Please consult your own attorney or accountant when making important investment decisions.
	Prudential Annuities does not provide investment advice. The selections you choose together with your financial professional are all dependent on your investment goals and your risk tolerance.

What happens if I need access to my money?

There are limitations and restrictions when making withdrawals. Withdrawals or surrenders may be subject to contingent deferred sales charges. Withdrawals and distributions of taxable amounts are subject to ordinary income tax and, if made prior to age 59½, may be subject to an additional 10% federal income tax penalty, sometimes referred to as an additional income tax. Withdrawals reduce the account value and the living and death benefits proportionately.

What is the Protected Withdrawal Value?

The Protected Withdrawal Value is only used to calculate the initial guaranteed lifetime income and the charge for the benefit. It is separate from the account value and is not available as a lump sum withdrawal. The account value is not guaranteed, can fluctuate, and may lose value.

What are the costs associated with purchasing this product?

The Prudential Premier Investment Variable Annuities are available at an annual insurance cost comprised of a .55% account value-based charge and a .55% premium-based charge for the B Series, and .68% account value- based charge and a .67% premium-based charge for the C Series with additional fees related to the professionally managed investment portfolios. The Return of Purchase Payments Death Benefit is available for an additional annual insurance cost comprised of a .18% account value-based charge and a .17% premium-based charge. Additional fees, such as withdrawal fees, transfer fees and administrative fees, also apply. See the prospectus for more information about how these charges are calculated.

What are some of the other things I need to consider when investing in this product?

If you invest in this product through a tax-advantaged retirement plan, such as an IRA, SEP-IRA, Roth IRA, 401(a) plan, or non-ERISA 403(b) plan, you will get no additional tax advantage through the annuity itself. Because there is no additional tax advantage when a variable annuity is purchased through one of these plans, the reasons for purchasing the annuity inside a qualified plan are limited to the ability to elect the Return of Purchase Payments Death Benefit, the opportunity to annuitize the contract, and the various investment options, which might make the annuity an appropriate investment for you. You should consult your tax and financial advisors regarding such features and benefits prior to purchasing this annuity for use with a tax-qualified plan.

What are some of the other considerations that I need to think about when investing in various asset allocation portfolios offered by a variable annuity?

It is important to remember that asset allocation does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss. Investment returns and the principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor's units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than the original investment. The value or price of a particular stock or other equity or equity-related security owned by a portfolio could go down and you could lose money. Additionally, fixed income investments are subject to risk, including credit and interest rate risk. Because of these risks, a subaccount's share value may fluctuate. If interest rates rise, bond prices usually decline. If interest rates decline, bond prices usually increase. Certain asset allocation portfolios may use leverage, short sales, and derivatives or engage in other speculative practices within their alternative investments. These practices include a high degree of risk and may increase the risk, size, and velocity of investment losses. Although certain alternative strategies seek to reduce risk by attempting to reduce correlation with equity and bond markets, no guarantee can be given that such efforts will be successful. The fees and expenses associated with alternative investments are generally higher than those for traditional investments. Lastly, diversification does not assure against loss in a declining market.

What do I need to understand about some of the asset allocation portfolios (subaccounts) that are offered with this product?

Premier Investment offers certain subaccounts that invest in underlying portfolios or invest in other portfolios which are also available in other variable annuity contracts we offer. Those other variable annuity contracts offer certain optional living benefits that utilize a predetermined mathematical formula (the "formula") to manage the guarantees offered in connection with those optional benefits. You should be aware that the operation of the formula in those other variable annuity contracts may result in large-scale asset flows into and out of the underlying portfolios through a series of transfers. In addition to increasing the portfolios' expenses, the asset flows may adversely affect performance by

requiring the portfolios to purchase or sell securities at inopportune times;
otherwise limiting the sub-adviser's ability to fully implement the portfolios' investment strategies; or
requiring the portfolios to hold a larger portion of their assets in highly liquid securities than they otherwise would hold.

	Before you allocate to these subaccounts, you should consider the impact the formula will have on each portfolio's risk profile, expenses and performance. Please see the prospectus for more information and work with your financial professional to determine which portfolios are appropriate for you.

	 

What else do I need to consider with the pro-growth fee structure?

Premier Investment was built with an innovative pro-growth fee structure. While most traditional variable annuities (VAs) assess insurance charges daily based on account value, the insurance charge for the Premier Investment is assessed partially on account value and partially on cumulative purchase payments (adjusted for withdrawals). When we refer to the “pro-growth” charge structure, we are illustrating that when compared to most traditional VAs, any growth in your account value will result in an overall insurance charge that represents a smaller percentage of account value (a lower “effective charge”). This is because the portion of the charge based on cumulative purchase payments remains constant. Conversely, if your account value were to decline below cumulative purchase payments (adjusted for withdrawals), this would result in a higher effective charge.

What is a Variable Annuity? 
A variable annuity is a contract with an insurance company. It's a long-term investment designed for retirement purposes. You place money in professionally managed investment portfolios, where it accumulates tax-deferred. When you retire, your savings can be used to generate a stream of regular income payments that are guaranteed for as long as you live. In addition, variable annuities provide a guaranteed death benefit for your beneficiaries. A financial professional can help you determine if a variable annuity is suitable for you.

Why the company behind the annuity matters. 
All references to income certainty and guarantees, including the benefit payment obligations arising under the annuity contract guarantees, rider guarantees, benefits, or annuity payout rates are backed by the claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company. Those payments and the responsibility to make them are not the obligations of the third party broker/dealer from which this annuity is purchased or any of its affiliates. They are also not obligations of any affiliates of the issuing insurance company. All guarantees, including benefits, do not apply to the underlying investment options.

What are the limitations and restrictions I need to consider? 
Annuity contracts contain exclusions, limitations, reductions of benefits and terms for keeping them in force. The optional benefits have certain investment, holding period, liquidity, and withdrawal limitations and restrictions. Optional living and death benefits may not be available in every state and may not be elected in conjunction with certain optional benefits. Please see the prospectus or ask your advisor for more information.

Asset allocation does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss. Investment returns and the principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor's units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than the original investment. Diversification does not assure against loss in a declining market. Prudential Annuities is not providing investment advice. Selections are dependent on the risk tolerance and investment goals of the customer. 

For the Prudential Premier Investment Variable Annuity, the optional Return of Purchase Payments Death Benefit may not be available in every state and has certain investment restrictions. Fees charged for the death benefit are in addition to fees and charges associated with the basic annuity. Please see the prospectus for more information. 
Issued on Riders: P-RID-ROP(5/14), P-RID-ROP(5/14)-NY et al. or any state variation thereof.

Prudential Annuities and its distributors and representatives do not provide tax, accounting, or legal advice. Please consult your own attorney or accountant. 

What are the withdrawal consequences? 
Since the annuity is designed to provide a guaranteed income stream for retirement, there are limitations and restrictions when making withdrawals that are not intended for retirement income purposes. For the Highest Daily Lifetime Income benefit and the Prudential Defined Income VA, withdrawals in excess of the income amount impact the value of a product or benefit. An excess withdrawal occurs when your cumulative Lifetime Withdrawals exceed the income amount in any annuity year. If an excess withdrawal is taken, only the portion of the Lifetime Withdrawal that exceeds the remaining income amount for that year will proportionally and permanently reduce future guaranteed amounts. If a withdrawal reduces the account value to zero, no further amount would be payable and the contract terminates. Withdrawals or surrenders may be subject to contingent deferred sales charges. Withdrawals and distributions of taxable amounts are subject to ordinary income tax and, if made prior to age 59½, may be subject to an additional 10% federal income tax penalty, sometimes referred to as an additional income tax. Withdrawals, other than from IRAs or employer retirement plans, are deemed to be gains out first for tax purposes. Withdrawals reduce the account value, death benefits, and the annual amount of living and/or death benefits available.

What are the costs associated with the Highest Daily Lifetime Income benefit and the Variable Annuity? 
Variable annuities offered by Prudential companies have an annual cost of 0.55% to 1.95% for mortality expense and administration fees, with an additional fee related to the professional investment options. The fees will vary depending on the underlying annuity and investment options selected. The optional benefit, HD Lifetime Income, has an additional annual fee of 1.00% based on the greater of two amounts, the Account Value or Protected Withdrawal Value.
The Protected Withdrawal Value is only used to calculate the guaranteed lifetime income and the charge for the benefit. It is separate from the account value, and not available as a lump sum withdrawal. Account value is not guaranteed, is subject to market fluctuations, and may lose value.

What happens to my Account Value during volatile market situations? 
The Highest Daily Lifetime Income v3.0 suite of benefits uses a predetermined mathematical formula to help us mitigate some of the financial risks we incur in providing the guarantees under this benefit through all market cycles. Each business day, the formula determines if any portion of your account value in the permitted subaccounts (asset allocation portfolios), including any Dollar Cost Averaging Market Value Adjusted options needs to be automatically transferred into or out of the AST Investment Grade Bond Portfolio (the "Bond Portfolio"). Amounts transferred by the formula depend on a number of factors unique to your individual annuity and include:      


The difference between the account value and the Protected Withdrawal Value;     
How long you have owned the benefit;     
The amount invested in, and the performance of, the permitted subaccounts, the Bond Portfolio, and the Secure Value Account (SVA); and     
The impact of additional purchase payments made to and withdrawals taken from the annuity.


The formula will not transfer amounts to or from the Secure Value Account (SVA). On any given day, no more than 30% of the account value in the permitted subaccounts (plus any DCA MVA options) may be transferred to the Bond Portfolio pursuant to the formula. Therefore, at any given time, some, most, or none of the account value may be allocated to the Bond Portfolio. Transfers to and from the Bond Portfolio do not impact any income guarantees that have already been locked in. You may not allocate purchase payments or transfer account value into or out of the Bond Portfolio.

The formula could mean that you miss opportunities for investment gains in the permitted subaccounts while amounts are allocated to the Bond Portfolio. The formula's allocation of amounts to the Bond Portfolio, however, could also protect your account value from losses that may occur in the permitted subaccounts. Please note: We are not providing investment advice through the formula. See the prospectus for complete details.

We will automatically allocate 10% of each purchase payment to the SVA. You cannot make transfers into or out of the SVA. The SVA will earn interest daily at a crediting rate declared annually.

What do I need to consider when investing in a VA with the Highest Daily Lifetime Income benefit? 
Asset allocation does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss. Investment returns and the principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor’s units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than the original investment. The value or price of a particular stock or other equity or equity-related security owned by a portfolio could go down and you could lose money. Fixed income investments are subject to risk, including credit and interest rate risk. Because of these risks, a subaccount’s share value may fluctuate. If interest rates rise, bond prices usually decline. If interest rates decline, bond prices usually increase. Diversification does not assure against loss in a declining market.

Certain portfolios may use leverage, short sales, and derivatives or engage in other speculative practices within their alternative investments. These practices include a high degree of risk and may increase the risk, size, and velocity of investment losses. Although certain alternative strategies seek to reduce risk by attempting to reduce correlation with equity and bond markets, no guarantee can be given that such efforts will be successful. The fees and expenses associated with alternative investments are generally higher than those for traditional investments.

Issued on Riders: P-RID-HD(2/14), P-RID-HD-HDB (2/14), et al. or state variation thereof.



What are the costs associated with the Prudential Defined Income Variable Annuity?
The annual fee for the Prudential Defined Income VA is 1.10%, plus an additional benefit fee of 0.80% for a total annual product charge of 1.90%. We reserve the right to increase the benefit fee up to a maximum of 1.50% at any time on or after the 7th annuity anniversary on existing contracts. This would increase the total annual product charge to a maximum of 2.60%. Note: There is also an additional fee for the AST Multi-Sector Fixed Income Portfolio. Please see the prospectus for additional information.
What do I need to consider when investing in the Prudential Defined Income VA?
Fixed income investments are subject to risk, including credit and interest rate risk. Because of these risks, a subaccount's share value may fluctuate. If interest rates rise, bond prices usually decline. If interest rates decline, bond prices usually increase.
An investment in an exchange-traded fund involves risks similar to those of investing in a broadly based portfolio of equity or debt securities traded on exchange in the relevant securities market. The investment return and principal value of ETF investments will fluctuate over time. ETFs that offer leverage or that are designed to perform inversely to the index or benchmark they track (or both) are highly complex financial instruments that are typically designed to achieve their objectives on a daily basis. Due to the effects of compounding, their performance over longer periods of time can differ significantly from the performance (or inverse of the performance) of the underlying index or benchmark.
Issued on Contracts: P-BBND(2/13), P-RID-LI-DB (3/13) et al. or state variation thereof.
What do I need to understand about the Prudential Premier Investment asset allocation portfolios?
The Prudential Premier® Investment Variable Annuity offers certain subaccounts that invest in underlying Portfolios which are also available in other variable annuity contracts we offer. Those other variable annuity contracts offer certain optional living benefits that utilize a predetermined mathematical formula (the “formula”) to manage the guarantees offered in connection with those optional benefits. You should be aware that the operation of the formula in those other variable annuity contracts may result in large-scale asset flows into and out of the underlying Portfolios through a series of transfers. In addition to increasing the Portfolios' expenses, the asset flows may adversely affect performance by (i) requiring the Portfolios to purchase or sell securities at inopportune times; (ii) otherwise limiting the sub-adviser's ability to fully implement the Portfolios' investment strategies; or (iii) requiring the Portfolios to hold a larger portion of their assets in highly liquid securities that they otherwise would hold.
Before you allocate to these subaccounts, you should consider the impact the formula will have on each Portfolio's risk profile, expenses and performance. Please see the Prospectus for more information and work with your financial professional to determine which Portfolios are appropriate for you.
What are the costs associated with the Prudential Premier Investment Variable Annuity?
Variable annuities offered by Prudential Financial companies are available at a total annual insurance cost of 0.55% to 1.95%, with additional fees related to the professionally managed investment options. Note: All products may not be available through all third party broker/dealers. Return of Purchase Payments Death Benefit is available for an additional annual fee of 0.30%. Please see the prospectus for additional information.
Both the Total Insurance Charge and the Optional Death Benefit Charge are comprised of an account value-based charge and a premium-based charge. Account value-based charges are assessed daily based on an annualized rate charged against the assets allocated to the subaccounts. Premium-based charges are assessed quarterly against the Charge Basis (please see the section of the prospectus called "Fees, Charges and Deductions" for information on the Charge Basis) and are taken pro-rata from the subaccounts.
While most traditional VAs assess insurance charges daily based on account value, the insurance charge for the Premier Investment VA is assessed partially on account value and partially on cumulative purchase payments (adjusted for withdrawals). When we refer to the “pro-growth” charge structure, we are illustrating that when compared to most traditional VAs, any growth in your client’s account value will result in an overall insurance charge that represents a smaller percentage of account value (a lower “effective charge”). This is because the portion of the charge based on cumulative purchase payments remains constant. Conversely, if your client’s account value were to decline below cumulative purchase payments (adjusted for withdrawals), this would result in a higher effective charge.
What do I need to consider when investing in the Prudential Premier Investment VA?
If you purchase the Prudential Premier® Investment Variable Annuity within a tax-advantaged retirement plan, such as an IRA, SEP-IRA, Roth IRA, 401(a) plan, or non-ERISA 403(b) plan, you will get no additional tax advantage through the Annuity itself. Because there is no additional tax advantage when a variable annuity is purchased through one of these plans, the reasons for purchasing the Annuity inside a qualified plan are limited to the ability to elect the Return of Purchase Payments Death Benefit, the opportunity to annuitize the contract, and the various investment options, which might make the Annuity an appropriate investment for you. You should consult your tax and financial advisors regarding such features and benefits prior to purchasing this Annuity for use with a tax-qualified plan.
Issued on Contracts: P-OB/IND(5/14), P-OC/IND(5/14) et al. or state variation thereof.
