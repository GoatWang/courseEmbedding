A rigged IPO market: Ocean Rig Partners LP files for a $305 million IPO


October 14, 2014, 08:09:36 PM EDT
By Renaissance Capital, Renaissance Capital

Ocean Rig Partners LP, an MLP formed by Ocean Rig to own three
deepwater rigs near Angola, filed on Tuesday with the SEC to raise
up to $305 million in an initial public offering. Ocean Rig
Partners will use IPO proceeds to purchase its vessels from Ocean
Rig (
ORIG

), a subsidiary of DryShips (
DRYS

).



The year's other offshore drilling IPO, Transocean Partners LLC (
RIGP

), closed below its IPO price for the first time since its July
offering on Monday, but recovered into positive territory on
Tuesday.



The Nicosia, Cyprus-based company, which was founded in 2014 and
booked $224 million in sales for the 12 months ended June 30, 2014,
plans to list on the NASDAQ under the symbol ORLP. Ocean Rig
Partners LP initially filed confidentially on April 18, 2014.
Barclays, BofA Merrill Lynch, Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank are
the joint bookrunners on the deal. No pricing terms were
disclosed.

IPO Analysis: Ocean Rig Partners LP (NSDQ: ORLP)			

By 
          		  Elliott H. Gue on  Nov. 18, 2014


FREE PREVIEW
Subscribe to Read the Full Article


Offshore contract driller Ocean Rig UDW (NSDQ: ORIG) has followed SeaDrill (NYSE: SDRL) and Transocean’s (NYSE: RIG) lead and filed an initial registration statement for an MLP that will own rigs that operate under longer-term contracts.
This strategy gives the parent company the option of monetizing some of its assets at higher valuations while maintaining control over their management.
Accordingly, much of Ocean Rig Partners LP’s (NSDQ: ORLP) future upside depends on drop-down transactions from its sponsor and when its fleet’s existing contracts expire.
The prospective publicly traded partnership’s initial asset base comprises three seventh-generation drillships housed in an operating company in which Ocean Rig Partners will own an as of yet unspecified interest.
(Click table to enlarge.)
Note that the maximum average day-rate earned by the Ocean Rig Skyros will tumble to $200,000 from the fourth quarter of 2014 to the third quarter of 2015.
In Ocean Rig UDW’s third-quarter earnings call, management indicated that the timing of the MLP’s IPO “will depend on prevailing market conditions.”
We would expect this transaction to occur once the Ocean Rig Skyros has switched to its bareboat charter with its sponsor to limit the diminution of cash flow when its day-rate falls by more than half.

We expect to receive net proceeds of approximately $     million from the sale
of common units in this offering, assuming an initial public offering price of
$     per unit (which is the midpoint of the range set forth on the cover of
this prospectus) and after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and
commissions and paying estimated offering expenses. Of this amount,
$     million will be paid on behalf of DOV II to DOV I as partial consideration
for OPCO’s Initial Fleet.

Our Sponsor, through MLP Holdings, will receive $     million in net proceeds
from the sale of            common units offered by this prospectus to the
public if the underwriters’ exercise their over-allotment option in full. We
will not receive any proceeds from the sale of these common units.

A $1.00 increase or decrease in the assumed initial public offering price of
$     per common unit would cause the net proceeds from this offering, after
deducting the estimated underwriting discount and commissions and offering
expenses payable by us, to increase or decrease, respectively, by approximately
$     million. In addition, we may also increase or decrease the number of
common units we are offering. Each increase of 1.0 million common units offered
by us, together with a concomitant $1.00 increase in the assumed public offering
price to $     per common unit, would increase net proceeds to us from this
offering by approximately $     million. Similarly, each decrease of 1.0 million
common units offered by us, together with a concomitant $1.00 decrease in the
assumed initial offering price to $     per common unit, would decrease the net
proceeds to us from this offering by approximately $     million.


The offshore drilling industry is highly competitive, with market participants
ranging from large multinational companies to smaller companies, like us, with
fewer than five drilling units.

The demand for offshore drilling services is driven by oil and natural gas
companies’ exploration and development drilling programs. These drilling
programs are affected by oil and natural gas companies’ expectations regarding
oil and natural gas prices, anticipated production levels, worldwide demand for
oil and natural gas products and many other factors. The availability of quality
drilling prospects, exploration success, availability of qualified rigs and
operating personnel, relative production costs, availability and lead time
requirements for drilling and production equipment, the stage of reservoir
development and political and regulatory environments also affect our customers’
drilling programs. Oil and natural gas prices are volatile, which has
historically led to significant fluctuations in expenditures by customers for
drilling services. Variations in market conditions impact us in different ways,
depending primarily on the length of drilling contracts in different markets.
Short-term changes in these markets may have a minimal short-term impact on
revenues and cash flows, unless the timing of contract renewals coincides with
short-term movements in the market.

Offshore drilling contracts are generally awarded on a competitive bid basis or
through privately negotiated transactions. In determining which qualified
drilling contractor is awarded a contract, the key factors are pricing,
drillship availability, drillship location, condition and integrity of
equipment, their record of operating efficiency, including high operating
uptime, technical specifications, safety performance record, crew experience,
reputation, industry standing and customer relations.

Competition for drillships is generally on a global basis, as rigs are highly
mobile. However, the cost associated with mobilizing drillships between regions
is sometimes substantial, as entering a new region could necessitate
modifications of the drillship and its equipment to specific regional
requirements.

We believe that the market for drilling contracts will continue to be highly
competitive for the foreseeable future. We believe that OPCO’s Initial Fleet of
recently constructed technologically advanced drillships provides it with a
competitive advantage over competitors with older fleets, as OPCO’s drillships
are generally better suited to meet the requirements of customers for drilling
in deepwater. However, certain competitors have greater financial resources than
we do, which may enable them to better withstand periods of low utilization, and
compete more effectively on the basis of price.


Company Description
We are a growth-oriented limited partnership recently formed by Ocean Rig to
own, operate and acquire offshore drilling units, including through our
ownership interest in OPCO. OPCO’s Initial Fleet consists of three
ultra-deepwater drillships: the Ocean Rig Mylos, the Ocean Rig Skyros and the
Ocean


 Rig Athena, all of which are currently in operation. The drillships that
comprise OPCO’s Initial Fleet are employed under multi-year contracts with
affiliates of major oil companies, including Repsol, Total and ConocoPhillips,
with an average remaining term of approximately 3.7 years as of August 31, 2014.
We intend to grow our per unit distributions and our exposure to the 
offshore drilling market initially by acquiring additional interests in OPCO
and at a later stage by acquiring ownership interests in other drilling 
units of our Sponsor and third parties, subject to certain limitations in 
our and our Sponsor’s debt agreements. We believe our Sponsor will be 
motivated to facilitate our growth because of its significant ownership 
interest in us. OPCO intends to leverage the relationships, operating 
expertise and reputation of our Sponsor to operate OPCO’s Initial Fleet in 
an efficient manner, to re-contract OPCO’s Initial Fleet under multi-year 
contracts and to identify opportunities to expand upon OPCO’s Initial Fleet
through other acquisitions.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
