What Our Customers Say
"We totally love every square foot of our home. The building experience was a pure joy, from start to finish! We
            would use Whiteley and Whiteley Design Group again, if we were to build a second home. David and Diane are honest
            and extremely talented builders to work with and the contractors were also very professional. The quality is
            outstanding."
-Abe and Mary Varghese

"Dan and I can't do anything but praise all of the time, hard work and patience (especially patience) that David,
            Diane and Jessica have afforded us this past year. There were no outrageous promises made and no requests that
            weren't accommodated. This team of people have done everything possible to keep this project on time in spite
            of illness, our changing our minds and a hurricane that put a tree into the new dining room. And their crews
            have been the best and the site is always clean. Thanks guys!"
-Dan & Robbie Love

"David and Diane designed and built our home...always just a phone call away...they build a quality home. We became
            friends during this process and are still friends after the build...need we say more!"
-Chip & Paula Stivers

Client Testimonials

Robinson Residence
Thank you Whiteley & Whiteley, Dave and Dianne. We have had two projects with your firm on Twain in Walden. The first was the reason we chose you for the second. Your team's knowledge if structure, design and of how to get things done was and is impressive. And you are just fun to work along-side.

The second project, to us, was massive but with close consideration to our needs, desires and input we have a beautiful home in the community we have chosen to live. We had anticipated some structural damage but what you found and documented for me was considerable. Fixed! We are beyond pleased. Ecstatic comes to mind.

Looking forward to our next adventure.

-Jim and Sandy Robinson


Shearer Residence
Diane and David were awesome to work with on remodeling our master bath. They transformed it from a 1984 bathroom to a beautiful and updated room that we just love. Diane went out of her way to make certain we were happy with all stages of the remodel.

The entire room was demolished which included removing the bathtub; moving the vanity from one side of the room to the other; replacing all the tile from the floor and shower; removing linen closet and cabinets. We now have the most gorgeous bathroom with a shower that we love, custom made wardrobe, linen closet and vanity with beautiful granite countertops, new lighting, gorgeous tile and a remodel of the closet. We love our new bathroom and can't say enough good things about Whiteley and Whiteley! We would highly recommend Diane and David for your new remodeling project.

-Shearer Residence


Dunlap Residence
I chose Whiteley and Whiteley for the remodel of the "Escondido" home for two main reasons. First, their reputation
            precedes them. It was obvious from the first meeting they would be my contractor. They listened intently to my
            requirements and immediately had suggestions to better the end result.

Secondly, you occasionally get a premonition (some say a gut feeling) that this team belongs here. That premonition
            turned out to be absolutely founded.

The planning stage was smooth and understandable to the lay person, with thoughtfulness and professionalism not
            often seen. The Whiteleys were clear and concise with drawings, cost, and work schedules.

I found the "Whiteley Way" to fit my needs perfectly. From demo to finish, scheduling was flawless and each and
            every subordinate contractor was a true artisan. If minor issues arose, they were handled quickly and efficiently.
            It was amazing to watch this team carry out the plan with an an almost uncanny ability to "think on their feet".
            While cudos go to the craftsmen, the highest accolades must go to Diane and David for assembling the best of
            the best, and leading this project to fruition.

I'll leave the "Before and After" photos to speak for themselves, but the true result of this project is so much
            more than that. I got a beautiful remodel, peace of mind as to its structural integrity and longevity, but most
            importantly a bevy of new friends, never to be forgotten.

-Dunlap Residence


Brookhaven Residence
We asked Whiteley and Whiteley to come back and convert our attic to the ultimate leisure space, because they did
            such a quality custom job building our home. Their experience, knowledge and wonderful relationship with their
            subcontractors made the experience positive and engaging. Their design and vision for the space resulted in a
            Billiard room and separate movie theater that went beyond our expectations and imagination. We couldn't have
            worked with a better team. David and Diane Whiteley have been a wonderful experience.
          

-Brookhaven Residence

Berkley Residence
We first started our work relationship with Whiteley & Whiteley during the fall of 2012. We had just moved to the
            area and needed some guidance picking colors and furniture for our new home. Diane would listen to my ideas and
            find a way to implement them while adding a designer touch. In the end, the finished product was perfection.
            So naturally, two years later, when we decided to add an addition to our home, we knew exactly who to call. As
            before, Dianne and David listened to our ideas, and soon a plan was in place to transform our backyard. They
            custom built our outdoor living space, picking colors, material, patterns, lights, and so much more. In the end,
            we were absolutely overly pleased. This company is loyal to their word, always professional, and a joy to work
            with. They will go above and beyond, so that in the end you are overwhelmingly pleased.
          

-Berkley Residence


Chippers Crossing Remodel
Whiteley & Whiteley designed and remodeled our kitchen, as well as designing and constructing our ramps. The project
            was completed in a little over a week with minimal inconvenience. This project was professionally done and the
            end result was a complete transformation from modern to and Asian design. We would heartily recommend Whiteley
            & Whiteley from conversion studies to a complete house design and construction.
          

-Jack & Bobbie Marshall


Twain Kitchen Remodel
Jeanne and I absolutely love our new kitchen!! Whiteley & Whiteley certainly did a magnificent job putting all
            of the pieces together,-everything from selecting the perfect floor tile to match the existing tile, to the awesome
            backsplash, granite, paint colors, and pendant lamps (you were right on and I love them!). Through efficient
            management of the project and subcontractors, you managed to improve our kitchen from its dull and dated appearance
            to a beautiful, modern, and warm space. A big thank you for your always prompt communication throughout the project.
            You made the remodeling process as painless as possible for us and for that we thank you.
          

Thank you for transforming our kitchen Diane!!! We love it, we love it, we love it!! It was our pleasure to work
            with you once again.
          

-Woodra Boyd


Kingford Remodel
We were nervous to remodel our daughter’s bathroom to accommodate her new wheelchair but it had to be done. We
            chose to work with Whiteley and Whiteley because of their genuine interest in improving not just a bathroom,
            but our lives. From David’s thoughtful design to Diane’s attention to detail, nothing was overlooked. We were
            updated daily on progress and what to expect next. Above all, their interest was how to best serve our family’s
            needs. We now have a fully functional and beautiful bathroom for our daughter.
          

-Julie Brackett


Twain Master Bath Remodel
David and Diane recently remodeled our master bath. They ensured that we went from “old and outdated” to a beautiful
            and warm environment. We are so pleased we hired the Whiteley Design Group to handle our remodeling job. They
            were spot on in all aspects of the job. Diane’s interior design experience was simply invaluable beginning with
            our shopping trip to pick out the many different tiles used, vanity, paint colors and fixtures. The end result
            is fabulous and the walk in shower is simply beautiful!! It is clear they’ve chosen their subcontractors carefully
            as they all do fantastic work. From beginning to end, and all points in between, the project was efficiently
            and professionally managed. Moreover, David and Diane were always available to address any questions about the
            job. In addition, they were conscientious about managing costs as they not only kept us within our budget, but
            the entire job was done under budget. It was our pleasure to work with David and Diane and we look forward to
            our next remodeling experience with them.

The Treasure Island House
David Whiteley: Creative, Thoughtful, Detailed, Experienced
            
 It is our pleasure to recommend Whiteley & Whiteley Design as David is truly creative, thoughtful, detailed
            and experienced. David designed our dream home in 2008 and today we remain 100% satisfied - there is nothing
            we would add, change, or delete if we could do it all over again. Our waterfront home was never a simple design
            and included over 4000 square feet with numerous unique features. The design included a totally self contained
            "apartment suite" for my elderly mother and it is the ultimate mother-in-law suite - very private, yet right
            here with us. It is approximately 900 square feet and offers everything any luxury home would offer - a spacious
            layout, numerous built-ins, recessed and rope lighting, full kitchen, laundry, sitting area, huge "master" closet,
            linen closet, two coat closets, and walk-in shower. David also had the foresight to recommend we build for the
            future by ensuring my mother's suite would fully accommodate any potential future needs. We heeded his advice
            and David designed it to accommodate my mother in the event a wheel chair or walker were ever to become necessary.
            That was a blessing as she recently needed that capability. The rest of our home was also perfectly and uniquely
            designed. Family and guests have repeatedly applauded the open and spacious unique design, often noting there
            is zero wasted space.
            
 My wife and I are detail-oriented perfectionists (probably to a fault) and David worked diligently with us to
            create our dream home. We know we were blessed to have found David and are confident he has the necessary skills,
            determination, patience and experience to also make your unique dreams come true!
            
 Sincerely,
          

-Jeff & Sandy Rosenthal


The Parkside Blvd. House
Charlie and I started with a clean sheet of paper and a lot filled with hardwoods. In the end, we had a Country
            French dream home that is nestled among the trees, with a custom pool thoughtfully placed in the back yard next
            to an opulent outdoor kitchen and a casita with all the luxuries of home for our guests. We also have multiple
            outdoor seating areas where we can either relax after a long day or entertain friends. The design has met all
            of our wants and needs, exceeding our expectations. Diane and David were a pleasure to work with through all
            aspects of the design and construction process. We were friends with David and Diane before the project began
            and have an even closer relationship today.

-Pat & Charlie Atchison


The Bluebell Lane House
Entering into a remodel (or building a home) can be a scary experience. Based on my recent remodel experience,
            I will always employ Whiteley & Whiteley Design Group for future remodeling or to build a new home. Fear of the
            unknown was replaced by gentle education. Fear of workmanship was supplanted by getting to know, like and trust
            craftsmen of integrity and quality. Whiteley & Whiteley brought value to every phase of my remodel experience.
            They gave me personal attention, quality workmanship and great value for my money. That's what makes them better.
            That's what makes them different.

-Steve Scott


The St. Annes Court House
Diane & David, you are dream makers! You certainly helped Don & my dreams come true by building us a wonderful
            home. We’ve appreciated working with you, but especially getting to know you over the past year.

-Jane & Don Nunes


The Rabon Chapel House
David and Diane designed and built our home...always just a phone call away...they build a quality home. We became
            friends during this process and are still friends after the build...need we say more!

-Chip & Paula Stivers


The Longwood House
Dan and I can't do anything but praise all of the time, hard work and patience (especially patience) that David,
            Diane and Jessica have afforded us this past year. There were no outrageous promises made and no requests that
            weren't accommodated. This team of people have done everything possible to keep this project on time in spite
            of illness, our changing our minds and a hurricane that put a tree into the new dining room. And their crews
            have been the best and the site is always clean. Thanks guys!

-Dan & Robbie Love


The Shoreline House
We totally love every square foot of our home. The building experience was a pure joy, from start to finish! We
            would use Whiteley and Whiteley Design Group again, if we were to build a second home. David and Diane are honest
            and extremely talented builders to work with and the contractors were also very professional. The quality is
            outstanding.

-Abe and Mary Varghese


The Sunset Ranch House
We had built homes before and this time we were looking for someone who could not only build our home, but work
            with us from design concept through completion. A friend recommended Whiteley & Whiteley because they are a design/build
            firm. David turned our ideas into a cohesive design, encompassing all the details we requested. During construction,
            Diane worked closely with us to ensure that our vision for the home was realized by carefully coordinating materials,
            colors, etc. The products were carefully researched and my husband and I were allowed to make our decisions based
            on standards as well as cost. We were kept informed of our costs and budget throughout the process and are very
            satisfied with the financial accountability of the Whiteley team. More importantly, during the construction process,
            the Whiteleys became more than our builders; they became our friends.

-Ruben and Francine Hope


The Crescent Court House
We so enjoyed living in a Whiteley and Whiteley built home we did it twice!!! First in Walden, one of their well
            designed spec homes on the golf course which is a beauty… Solid design and thoughtful amenities, it sold in four
            days!!! Knowing the pride and integrity they build into their construction projects we did not hesitate to have
            them design and build our home on Lake Conroe in Grand Harbor. The design process was great! They included every
            aspect we could think of in a lake home, from the landscaped river beds that work with the fountain court yard
            in front through to the flagstone walled patio at the dock, nothing was left undone! The very best part of the
            process was the friendly way they worked with us. The authentic Tuscan design was meticulous down to every detail
            including a stoned arched wine nook and leaded glass decorative windows. They insured our satisfaction at every
            stage even the warranty items after move in, every issue has been addressed promptly and professionally. David
            and Diane build every home as if it were theirs. Their homes reflect excellence in design and execution. They
            are extremely proud of their work and they should be!

-Mary and Roger Rivet

But before you start sending out dozens of emails and making phone calls, sit down and think about your project. What's your budget? What is the scope of your project? Will you need more than one type of professional to complete your home improvement project? Can you afford to complete the full project now, or should you tackle it bit by bit?Once you've settled on your project’s priorities, budget and scope, it's time to start researching home design professionals. Don't sell yourself short and settle on the first professional you set your sights on. Make sure that you're working with someone local, who can get to the jobsite easily and efficiently. Look into the person’s reviews, ask to speak with former clients and to see previous jobs in person. Take a good look at their portfolio photos: How similar are these projects to your own? Be honest — that mansion might look beautiful, but it might not have a lot in common with your little bungalow.Reach out to multiple professionals — especially for larger projects — and don't settle for the first bid you hear. Comparing multiple Montgomery, TX professionals' bids and experiences can help you find the one that’s best for you. Ask a lot of questions now, so you won't have unexpected answers later.Find a home design professional on Houzz. Narrow down your search by type of professional and location. Browse Montgomery, TX portfolio photos, read client reviews and contact each Montgomery, TX professional for more information. Check out the information in the specialized professional sections too for tips on how to hire the right professional for your project.  Professional Categories in Montgomery

What is a design-build firm?Design-build firms take on the responsibilities of architects, contractors and construction companies, all under one roof. These full-service firms focus on a streamlined design-build process — from the initial design to the estimating phase to physical construction — in the hope of creating an efficient experience for both the client and the company. Because the entire project is happening within one company, Montgomery design-build firms are able to overlap the design and construction phases of the project, which often speeds up the project significantly. In addition, these firms work to minimize risks for the project owner through single-point responsibility contracts. However, depending on the firm, you may still want to contact an interior designer or architect to help create the exact look you want. Here are some related professionals and vendors to complement the work of design-build firms: Interior Designers & Decorators, Landscape Architects & Landscape Designers, Architects & Building Designers, Photographers.Before deciding on a residential design-and-build company in Montgomery, TX, think about what you want from your new home. Do you want a large kitchen for entertaining? Do you need several bedrooms for children and guests? Do you want a finished basement for extra space or storage? Look for Montgomery design-builders that specialize in the areas you're looking for. Budget is obviously a determining factor in the outcome of your project. To make sure you stay within your means, consider making a must-have list and a wish list. Gauge where the estimates are falling to determine which design-build contract can realistically strike the balance between the two.Questions to ask a prospective Montgomery design-builder: How long have you been in the design-build construction business? How many projects like mine have you completed? Who will be working on the project? Are the workers employees or subcontractors? Can you provide me with references? Who is your designer, and what are his or her qualifications? Are your employees licensed and insured? How do you charge, and what does that include? Can you give me a written estimate? What do your services include? When can this job get done? What happens when cost exceeds the budget? What about changes to materials or labor pricing? What will I need to provide? Are there any important considerations or concerns you foresee with this project?Find a Montgomery design-build company on Houzz. Narrow your search in the Professionals section of the website to design-build firms in Montgomery, TX. You may also look through Montgomery, TX photos to find a pool you like, then contact the design-build firm that created it. You can find more design-build firms in Conroe, Spring, Willis, Panorama Village and Shenandoah. Professional Categories in Montgomery

1 review for Breathing Assessments, David Whitley






P J Wilson, DC – 09/04/2015:
	
Now more than ever it seems like someone or something is trying to control us, whether it’s your boss or your kids. David shows us how to regain control of the most basic thing we have, our breath. This lecture succinctly yet thoroughly teaches us how to control our breath in order to reduce stress, get stronger and move better.
