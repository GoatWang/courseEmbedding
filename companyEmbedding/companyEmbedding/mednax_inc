Warning About Recruiting Scams

Thank you for your interest in MEDNAX. We encourage you to explore job opportunities at MEDNAX and to review openings that are listed on our website. We would like to assure you that all official MEDNAX websites and resources are completely safe and secure. We have always, and will continue to, make every effort to ensure the privacy and security of information provided to us from potential candidates.
However, please be aware of fraudulent scams and communications that do not originate from MEDNAX and its affiliated entities. This may consist of internet, email, and/or telephone scams in which fraudsters may try to take advantage of job seekers by pretending to represent prominent companies, including MEDNAX. Intended victims may be invited to participate in bogus interviews, asked to fill out fabricated employment applications and, on occasion, have even been issued fake offer letters, all with the ultimate goal of trying to entice victims to pay money or divulge sensitive personal information. Do NOT fall victim to these scams.
During the initial recruiting process, MEDNAX and its affiliated entities never seek fees from either prospective employees or contractors and will not ask any candidate for banking information, credit card numbers, financial information, or any other information to facilitate the transfer of funds.
Here are additional things to watch for:

Communications that are unsolicited or unexpected, or are from an individual or website with which you are unfamiliar or whose domain name is inconsistent with that used by the actual business;
Correspondence from free e-mail accounts, like Yahoo, Hotmail or Gmail. A MEDNAX employee will not solicit candidates through a non-MEDNAX email address or phone number. In addition, MEDNAX does not currently utilize video chat rooms (e.g., Google Hangouts) to conduct interviews;
Communications at the application phase requesting your social security number, national insurance number, date of birth, or other sensitive personal information.

Please do not hesitate to contact us at the email below if you think that a communication or career opportunity that you have received from MEDNAX may not be legitimate. Please be prepared to email all documentation you received including original emails as attachments.
MEDNAX Security Department: security_abuse@mednax.com
 
 
Attention Third Party Search Firms/Staffing Agencies:

We do not accept unsolicited resumes from Search Firms for non-clinical positions.  For non-clinical positions, we have a partnership with Scout for all of our direct hire search firm activity and as such, all inquiries and resumes must be submitted through Scout.  Scout is an easy to use recruitment marketplace integrated within Bullhorn, PCRecruiter or accessible via Scout Connect.  Accordingly, we respectfully ask agencies not to solicit our business managers or Talent Acquisition team directly and to reach out to Scout at www.goscoutgo.com/searchfirmreferral.

Why MEDNAX

We’re the solutions partner

Gain control of your data
For more than 20 years we have invested in health information technology to support high quality care. BabySteps, our proprietary neonatal electronic medical record, and Clinical Data Warehouse, recognized as one of the world’s most valuable and robust neonatal outcomes database, serve as the foundation of our neonatal quality improvement efforts at the local, regional and national practice levels. Similarly, Quantum Clinical Navigation System (Quantum), a quality and outcomes data tool, supports our quality improvement efforts for our anesthesia practices. Quantum is certified by The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) as a Qualified Clinical Data Registry for reporting physician quality reposting system (PQRS) metrics directly to CMS.

Stay ahead of the game
The current health care environment makes it increasingly difficult for doctors and hospitals to effectively manage patient care, remain current on the latest procedures and efficiently administer non-clinical activities. The pressures facing the traditional physician group practice are growing. The legal/regulatory environment poses increasing challenges and the administrative costs associated with running a practice are on the rise. The opportunity to off set those costs with increased efficiency are limited. Hospitals and third-party payors face similar challenges – rising costs and increased competition – while hospitals must also deal with limited resources and staffing issues. Paramount to these challenges are the needs of the patient: affordable, high-quality, evidence-based care.
 
 
 


 
 


Keep the patient first
Our business model emphasizes a patient-focused clinical approach. We address the needs of our various partners, including hospitals, third-party payors, referring physicians, affiliated physicians and, most importantly, our patients, through a collaborative effort of health care and business professionals.
Our affiliated physicians, who are dedicated to delivering high quality clinical care, work in tandem with business professionals who continuously demonstrate their effectiveness in managing the business aspects of our national group practice. Because our business professionals handle the administrative functions and any operational challenges, our physicians are able to focus exclusively on clinical duties.
 
 



 
 


 
 




 

Achieve clinical excellence
Our clinical model allows physicians to do what they do best: take great care of the patient, every day and in every way™. Our clinical infrastructure allows physicians to pursue clinical research, education and quality initiatives on a national scale to enhance patient outcomes, ensuring the appropriate length of hospital stays and reducing long-term health system costs.
Foster education and improvement
As an accredited provider of continuing medical and nursing education, MEDNAX hosts live conferences and develops online education to support clinicians in a wide variety of subspecialty areas. We also partner with other education providers to deliver exceptional learning experiences aimed at improving clinical knowledge and enhancing patient care.

Plug-in to our national network
MEDNAX is a compelling solution for both our physicians and hospital partners. When faced with the choices of building a business infrastructure on their own or identifying outsourced vendors to provide these services, physician groups are recognizing the benefits of joining a national group practice. We relieve physicians of administrative burdens by providing practice administration such as recruiting, risk management, legal, compliance, managed care contracting, marketing, billing, collections and credentialing. We are certified by the National Committee for Quality Assurance Standards for Credentialing Certification, which demonstrates our compliance with the strictest quality standards in the industry.
Our hospital partners benefit from our practice administration expertise as well, as we manage variable admission rates, operating costs, complex reimbursement systems and other administrative burdens.
 
 



 
 


 
 




 

Partner with industry leaders
MEDNAX is helping forge new ground in medicine through ongoing education, not just for our clinicians, but for all of our peers in the medical community. As an accredited provider of continuing medical and nursing education, MEDNAX hosts live conferences and develops online education to support clinicians in a wide variety of subspecialty areas. The number of clinicians nationally and internationally who participate in these activities is evidence of the depth and breadth of our clinical expertise and position as an industry leader. We also partner with other education providers to deliver exceptional learning experiences aimed at improving clinical knowledge and enhancing patient care.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
