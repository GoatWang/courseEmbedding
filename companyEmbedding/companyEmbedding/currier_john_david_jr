ST. LOUIS • A man who lavished online strippers with everything from chocolates to flowers to shoes — even paying college tuition for one woman — charged nearly a half-million dollars of it to his St. Louis-area employer, federal prosecutors say.John David Berrett, an Internet technology architect for World Wide Technology Inc., was indicted Thursday on five counts of wire fraud, according to prosecutors. Berrett, 40, of Gilbert, Ariz., could not be reached for comment, and no attorney was listed in court records.Berrett, whose job for the Maryland Heights-based company was to meet clients in the United States and abroad to provide information technology training and support, is accused of falsifying invoices totaling $476,000 for various payments and gifts to strippers on a website between September 2013 and last October.
The indictment says Berrett bought online “tokens” to tip the website’s strippers more than 2,200 times, spending more than $100,000.Berrett used his company credit card to buy strippers various gifts including chocolates, flowers, electronics, wine, a television, a handbag, a laptop, an iPod and shoes, the indictment says. Berrett also used his card to send $26,800 to one online stripper to pay for her college tuition, replace tires on her car and cover her family’s utility bill.Berrett also used his company credit card to spend $131.08 with Interactive Life Forms, parent company of sex-toy maker Fleshlight, and listed the purchase as exam test prep questions, the indictment says. Berrett paid $226.50 for a wine shipment from the Gold Medal Wine Club, listing the purchase as a “Bribe for the UNIX guys.”
A World Wide Technology spokesman said the company was cooperating with investigators. He declined further comment.World Wide Technology, an information technology systems firm, employs 3,000 people, including about 1,500 to 1,700 in the St. Louis region. The company took in an estimated $6.7 billion in revenue last year.
The lure of strippers has ensnared at least two St. Louis-area businessmen within the past decade.In 2006, then-Savvis Inc. Chief Executive Robert McCormick earned the nickname “lap dunce” from the New York Daily News after being accused of charging a $241,000 topless-club bill to his corporate credit card. American Express sued McCormick, Savvis and the Manhattan strip club Scores over the unpaid bill and ultimately reached a settlement. McCormick, who lived in Clayton, resigned during the investigation.Also in 2006, Thomas B. Kurzenberger Jr., a former vice president of Title Insurer’s Agency Inc., was sentenced to six years in prison and ordered to pay nearly $6 million in customers’ money he embezzled from his family’s Clayton company. He spent $162,588 at a Sauget topless club and spent an unspecified amount of the embezzled money on cocaine, an investigation revealed.

(2) A lack of ability to understand one's actions when making a will or other legal document. (3) The inability of an injured worker to perform his or her job. This may qualify the worker for disability benefits or workers' compensation.

BEQUESTThe legal term for personal property (anything but real estate) left in a will.

(more...)At trial, the initial questioning of a party or witness by the side that called him or her to testify. The major purpose of direct examination is to explain your version of events to the judge or jury and to undercut your adversary's version. Good direct examination seeks to prove all facts necessary to satisfy the plaintiff's legal claims or causes of action -- for example, that the defendant breached a valid contract and, as a result, the plaintiff suffered a loss.

(more...)A right to use another person's real estate for a specific purpose. The most common type of easement is the right to travel over another person's land, known as a right of way. In addition, property owners commonly grant easements for the placement of utility poles, utility trenches, water lines or sewer lines. The owner of property that is subject to an easement is said to be 'burdened' with the easement, because he or she is not allowed to interfere with its use. For example, if the deed to John's property permits Sue to travel across John's main road to reach her own home, John cannot do anything to block the road. On the other hand, Sue cannot do anything that exceeds the scope of her easement, such as widening the roadway.

(more...)The historical term for what is now called the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection ('BCBP'), a branch of the Department of Homeland Security. The primary functions of the BCBP/border patrol are to guard the borders from illegal entrants and to meet and question immigrants and visitors arriving at airports and other border stops.

JOINT TENANCYA way for two or more people to share ownership of real estate or other property. When two or more people own property as joint tenants and one owner dies, the ... (more...)A way for two or more people to share ownership of real estate or other property. When two or more people own property as joint tenants and one owner dies, the other owners automatically own the deceased owner's share. For example, if a parent and child own a house as joint tenants and the parent dies, the child automatically becomes full owner. Because of this right of survivorship, no will is required to transfer the property; it goes directly to the surviving joint tenants without the delay and costs of probate.

NONDISCLOSURE AGREEMENTA legally binding contract in which a person or business promises to treat specific information as a trade secret and not disclose it to others without proper a... (more...)A legally binding contract in which a person or business promises to treat specific information as a trade secret and not disclose it to others without proper authorization. Nondisclosure agreements are often used when a business discloses a trade secret to another person or business for such purposes as development, marketing, evaluation or securing financial backing. Although nondisclosure agreements are usually in the form of written contracts, they may also be implied if the context of a business relationship suggests that the parties intended to make an agreement. For example, a business that conducts patent searches for inventors is expected to keep information about the invention secret, even if no written agreement is signed, because the nature of the business is to deal in confidential information.

FORECLOSUREThe forced sale of real estate to pay off a loan on which the owner of the property has defaulted.

(more...)Laws that limit the amount of rent landlords may charge, and that state when and by how much the rent can be raised. Most rent control laws also require a landlord to provide a good reason, such as repeatedly late rent, for evicting a tenant. Rent control exists in some cities and counties in California, Maryland, New Jersey, New York and Washington, D.C.
