LiveOps Names Ann Ruckstuhl Chief Marketing Officer




Marketing Brand and Operational Authority to Drive Global Awareness 
      and Customer Engagement Worldwide Brings Extensive Cloud 
      Computing, Contact Center and Mobile Experience








January 09, 2012 12:40 PM Eastern Standard Time



SANTA CLARA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--LiveOps announced today that Ann Sung Ruckstuhl will join the executive 
      team as Senior Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer on January 16. 
      Reporting to the CEO, Ruckstuhl will be responsible for driving all 
      facets of LiveOps’ global marketing strategy and operations.
    


      Ruckstuhl has more than 15 years of deep executive management experience 
      launching global brand awareness campaigns and building successful 
      software and service businesses at start-ups and Fortune 500 
      companies including Symantec, Sybase (an SAP company), Billpoint 
      (acquired by eBay), and Hewlett-Packard. Most recently, Ruckstuhl served 
      as a marketing executive at Symantec where she worked closely with a 
      number of BPO partners to market services in 15 languages, provisioned 
      by 14 contact centers with local access numbers in 25 countries. She is 
      a frequent speaker at industry conferences on consumerization of IT, 
      cloud computing and marketing automation.
    

      “Ann’s passion and dedication for understanding and marketing new 
      technologies coupled with her broad marketing leadership expertise makes 
      her the ideal choice for this important role,” said Marty Beard, 
      President and CEO, LiveOps. “She brings with her experience in cloud 
      computing, social and mobile, and contact center. Her proven abilities 
      to globally launch a brand and sustain ongoing brand recognition are 
      unsurpassed. She is highly regarded by her peers for her functional 
      competence, drive and team building capabilities. I look forward to 
      welcoming her to LiveOps.”
    

      As the marketing leader she will be responsible for all of LiveOps’ 
      global marketing activities including product, field and partner 
      marketing, social media, public relations and industry analyst 
      relations. Generating brand awareness for LiveOps in the global contact 
      center industry and driving sales lead generation worldwide will be the 
      core focus areas for her team.
    

      “I’m very excited about joining LiveOps. Having spent the past two plus 
      years working with enterprise contact centers I’m familiar with LiveOps 
      and its innovative portfolio. I’ve witnessed first-hand how the social 
      and mobile revolution is impacting enterprises worldwide. If any company 
      is well-positioned to take full advantage of this global revolution it’s 
      LiveOps,” commented Ruckstuhl.
    

      As a member of the core executive teams at Billpoint/eBay and Sybase, 
      Ruckstuhl helped pioneer person-to-person online payment technology and 
      helped transform Sybase from a database software company to a global 
      leader in enterprise mobility. As an executive at both Symantec and HP, 
      she drove steep revenue and profit growth in consumer technical support 
      and network support services.
    

      Ruckstuhl received her master’s degree in business administration as 
      well as her bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering from the 
      University of Florida.
