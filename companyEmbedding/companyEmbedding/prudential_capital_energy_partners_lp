CIT Structured Finance and Prudential Capital Group Complete a 
      Financing for ArcLight Energy Partners Fund






January 29, 2004 07:00 AM Eastern Standard Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--CIT Structured Finance, a unit of CIT Group Inc. (NYSE: CIT), and a 
      leading advisor and arranger of project finance transactions, and 
      Prudential Capital Group, an institutional investment management 
      business of Prudential Financial, Inc. (NYSE: PRU) today announced the 
      successful completion of a private placement project financing with a 
      portfolio company of ArcLight Energy Partners Fund I.
    


      Prudential Capital Group completed the structuring and documentation, 
      and provided 30% of the financing. CIT acted as syndication agent, 
      providing 17% of the financing and placed the remaining amount with a 
      group of five institutional investors. The proceeds were used for a 
      recapitalization and to refinance existing debt and equipment leases.
    

      Prudential Capital worked with ArcLight over the past 30 months to 
      develop and structure the financing for this transaction. Ric Abel, 
      senior vice president, Prudential Capital Group's Dallas Office said, "I 
      enjoyed working with the company and the other investors in structuring 
      this complex transaction, and the successful funding of this deal is a 
      major achievement for Prudential Capital, for CIT and will hopefully 
      lead to further opportunities in the energy sector with ArcLight."
    

      "We believe that this is an excellent investment opportunity for CIT 
      Project Finance," commented Marcia Bates, Senior Director of CIT Project 
      Finance. "ArcLight has shown remarkable financial results in many of 
      their portfolio companies and we are delighted to complete a financing 
      for them."

      in 2001 to capitalize on attractive investment opportunities in the 
      rapidly evolving power, utility and energy industry. The Fund is managed

Atlanta
"The numerous in-town neighborhoods and southern charm of Atlanta give it a small city feel, but world-class museums, sporting events, restaurants and night-life provide the advantages of a large cosmopolitan city. The weather is ideal for much of the year, yet still offers four seasons. Living and working in Atlanta truly offers the best of both worlds, but when you want to get away, the busiest airport in the world is close by." – Ashley Dexter
 
We are an Equal Opportunity/Affirmative Action Employer and are committed to diversity in our workplace.

Chicago
"Chicago boasts a beautiful skyline, beaches, world-class museums, restaurants, and some of the country’s most lovable sports teams - all just a short walk or train ride away. It is one of the few places able to seamlessly create the dichotomy of a warm, welcoming neighborhood and a vibrant city. This combination truly makes Chicago a big city that’s easy to call home." – Tom Molzahn
 
We are an Equal Opportunity/Affirmative Action Employer and are committed to diversity in our workplace.
