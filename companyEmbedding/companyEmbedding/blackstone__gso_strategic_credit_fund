				This website is not intended to offer or to promote the offer or sale of the securities of Blackstone / GSO Loan Financing Limited (the "Company") in the United States or to US persons ("US Persons") as defined in Regulation S under the US Securities Act of 1933 (the "Securities Act").
			

				Access to the information contained in this website is restricted under applicable securities laws of the United States.  The Company has not been and will not be registered under the US Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "Investment Company Act") and, as such, holders of the securities of the Company mentioned in this website (the "Securities") will not be entitled to the benefits of the Investment Company Act.  No offer, sale, resale, pledge, delivery, distribution or transfer of the Securities may be made except under circumstances that will not result in the Company being required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act.  The Securities have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act, or with any securities regulatory authority of any state or other jurisdiction of the United States, and may not be offered, sold, resold, pledged, taken up, exercised, renounced, delivered, distributed or transferred, directly or indirectly, into or within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, US persons, except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and in compliance with any applicable securities laws of any state or other jurisdiction of the United States and in a manner which would not require the Company to register under the Investment Company Act.  No public offering of the Securities is being made in the United States.  The information contained in this website, therefore, is generally not available to persons in the United States or who are US Persons.
			

				With regard to persons in the United States or who are US Persons, access to this website is restricted solely to those who (a) are "Qualified Institutional Buyers" as defined in Rule 144A under the Securities Act and "Qualified Purchasers" as defined in Section 2(a)(51) and related rules of the Investment Company Act, or (b) own shares of the Company.
			

Please tick each box below as applicable to indicate your confirmation before clicking on the "Confirm" button below to proceed.


				I hereby certify and warrant that:
			


               (a)






						I am a "Qualified Institutional Buyer" as defined in Rule 144A under the Securities Act; and
					




						I am a "Qualified Purchaser" as defined in Section 2(a)(51) and related rules of the Investment Company Act.




				You are a "Qualified Purchaser" if you are:
			

				(i)         a natural person (including any person who holds a joint, community property, or other similar shared ownership interest in an issuer that is excepted under Section 3(c)(7) of the US Investment Company Act with that person's Qualified Purchaser spouse) who owns not less than $5,000,000 in investments, as defined by the US Securities and Exchange Commission;
			

				(ii)        a company, partnership or trust that owns not less than $5,000,000 in investments and that is owned directly or indirectly by or for two or more natural persons who are related as siblings or spouse (including former spouses), or direct lineal descendants by birth or adoption, spouses of such persons, the estates of such persons, or foundations, charitable organisations, or trusts established by or for the benefit of such persons;
			

				(iii)        a trust that is not covered by clause (ii) above and that was not formed for the specific purpose of acquiring the securities of the Company, as to which the trustee or other person authorised to make decisions with respect to the trust, and each settlor or other person who has contributed assets to the trust, is a person described in clause (i), (ii) or (iv) hereto; or
			

				(iv)       a person, acting for your own account or the accounts of other Qualified Purchasers, who in the aggregate owns and invests on a discretionary basis, not less than $25,000,000 in investments.
			

				You are not a "Qualified Purchaser" if you are a company that, but for the exceptions provided for in paragraph (1) or (7) of Section 3(c) of the Investment Company Act, would be an investment company (hereafter in this paragraph referred to as an "excepted investment company"), unless all beneficial owners of your outstanding securities (other than short-term paper), determined in accordance with Section 3(c)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act, that acquired such securities on or before April 30, 1996 (hereafter in this paragraph referred to as "pre-amendment beneficial owners"), and all pre-amendment beneficial owners of the outstanding securities (other than short-term paper) of any excepted investment company that, directly or indirectly, owns any of your outstanding securities, have consented to your treatment as a Qualified Purchaser. Unanimous consent of all trustees, directors, or general partners of a company or trust referred to in clause (ii) or (iii) above shall constitute consent for purposes of this paragraph.

				By using this website you confirm that you have read, understood, and accepted these conditions. The Company may change these conditions. The changes will be posted on the website. Your access to this website is governed by the version of these conditions then in force.
			

1.           Terms and Conditions
			

1.1         The terms and conditions set out below apply to your use of the Company's website. Please read them.
			

1.2         "The Company" means Blackstone / GSO Loan Financing Limited and any of its subsidiaries and related companies and references to "the Company's website" are to any of the Company's websites and also include, but are not limited to, the text, images, links, sounds, graphics, and video sequences displayed on those websites (the "Materials").
			

1.3         By clicking "I Understand and Agree" you agree that you have read and accept these terms and conditions. If you do not agree, do not click "I Understand and Agree".  The information in the Company's website is only for the attention of the residents of jurisdictions where it can be lawfully disseminated. It is your responsibility to be aware of and to observe all applicable laws and regulations for your country of residence.
			

1.4         No information contained in these pages should be taken as a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold the shares of any entity. Nothing on the Company's website or in the Materials constitutes or is intended to constitute financial or other advice and you should not act upon any information contained on the Company's website or in the Materials without first consulting a financial or other professional adviser.
			

1.5         The Company's website is not intended to offer or to promote the offer or sale of the shares in the Company (the "Shares") in the United States or to US Persons.
			

1.6         The Company requires that all US Persons who acquire its securities be "qualified purchasers" as defined in Section 2(a)(51) and related rules of the Investment Company Act ("QPs") regardless of how they acquire the securities. Accordingly, each acquirer of the securities will be deemed to represent that (i) it is either (a) a QP and is acting for its own account or the account of another QP, or (b) not a US Person and is acquiring the securities outside the United States in an "offshore transaction" meeting the requirements of Regulation S under the Securities Act; (ii) it understands that the Company may receive a list of all participants holding positions in its securities from one or more book-entry depositaries; and (iii) it will provide notice of applicable transfer restrictions to any subsequent transferees.
			

1.7         The Shares may not be acquired or held by, or transferred to, (i) an "employee benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(3) of the US Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"), that is subject to Title I of ERISA; (ii) a "plan" as defined in Section 4975 of the US Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "US Tax Code"), including an individual retirement account or other arrangement that is subject to Section 4975 of the US Tax Code; (iii) an entity which is deemed to hold the assets of any of the foregoing types of plans, accounts or arrangements that are subject to Title I of ERISA or Section 4975 of the US Tax Code; or (iv) a governmental, church, non-US or other employee benefit plan that is subject to any federal, state, local or non-US law that is substantially similar to the provisions of Title I of ERISA or Section 4975 of the US Tax Code, and whose purchase, holding, or disposition of the Shares would constitute or result in a non-exempt violation of any such substantially similar law.
			

1.8         The Company delivers to its shareholders annual audited financial statements an unaudited interim report, and such other shareholder notices as the Company deems appropriate. Unless a shareholder indicates otherwise by written notice to the Company, the shareholder hereby consents to receive the Company's financial statements, shareholder newsletters, and other shareholder notices and materials via email to the shareholder's email address in the Company's records or via the Company's website.  Although the Company does not impose any additional charges for electronic delivery, the shareholder may, of course, incur costs associated with the shareholderâ€™s electronic access, such as usage charges from the shareholder's Internet access providers. The shareholder may revoke its election to receive such documents via electronic delivery at any time by written notice to the Company requesting that the Company send such documents via facsimile or in hard copy via the postal service to the address notified to the Company by the shareholder from time to time.
			

2.           Privacy policy - The Company respects the privacy of individuals who visit the Company's website and is careful to ensure that information disclosed to the Company in confidence is treated confidentially. Please see the Company's full privacy policy.

Those accessing the website should consult their financial advisers regarding the suitability of any of the products referred to on this website. The value of investments and the income from them may go down as well as up and an investor may receive back less than the original investment; past performance is not necessarily a guide to future performance.

Please note: Closed end funds are subject to the risk of their underlying assets and investment strategy. Unlike open end funds, closed end funds trade on an exchange at a price which is often a discount to their net asset value (NAV). The market price may experience periods of increased volatility due to the use of leverage as well as market and fund illiquidity. Important information you should know about investing in closed-end funds.

What does it mean?

							A fund's Morningstar Rating is a quantitative assessment of a fund's past performance that accounts for both risk and return, with funds earning between 1 and 5 stars. As always, this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process. A high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision.

More about Portfolio Composition








*The Overall Morningstar RatingTM for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and ten-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. For each fund with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a funds monthly performance (including the effects of sales charges, loads and redemption fees, if applicable), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. (Each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages.)The performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted. Distributions are not guaranteed and the amount of distributions will vary depending on a number of factors. Market prices and investment return will vary, therefore you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares. Click on the "Performance & Risk" link to view quarter-end performance. All performance data is for the common shares of the fund. Total distribution rate (at market or NAV) may include unknown combinations of income, capital gains and return of capital.Cumulative total returns are reported as of the period indicated. Life of fund figures are reported as of the commencement date to the period indicated. ^Premium/Discount to NAV represents the percentage by which the funds market price exceeds or is less than net asset value (NAV). Shares of closed-end funds frequently trade at a market price that is a discount to their NAV.Top holdings are as of the date indicated and may not be representative of the funds current or future investments.

Wealth Structuring
Preservation and Transfer
Your wealth plan is designed to provide you and your family with thoughtful and innovative solutions customized to the financial and personal complexities of your life.  We bring you knowledge, experience and expertise across the broad range of wealth structuring disciplines.






Wealth Planning
Integrating your personal and financial affairs
By thinking holistically about all aspects of your wealth, we develop customized strategies to help pursue your unique goals. Wealth structuring can help you address issues including:

The cash flow required to help meet your lifestyle
The investments needed to help meet long-range objectives 
The most effective way to pursue estate planning goals 
The tax implications of the many aspects of managing and transferring your wealth

Trusts and Estates
Shaping your legacy and transferring your wealth
For more than two centuries, U.S. Trust has been helping many of America's wealthiest families build estate plans and implement wealth transfer strategies. Your team can work with you to build a sound estate plan that may help you:

Control the transfer of wealth to those you care about
Fulfill important philanthropic commitments
Reduce estate taxes
Maintain your privacy
Protect assets from creditors and other third parties

We can help you and your attorney establish trusts to provide financial security for your spouse or partner, pass assets to future generations and charities and reduce estate taxes, as well as provide for financial and investment management during your lifetime. We bring our extensive knowledge and experience to bear in helping clients manage their trusts whether we are serving as agent for trustee or corporate trustee.
Philanthropy
Making your charitable giving more fulfilling and effective
We offer you personal support and an array of tools to help you and your family assess your charitable goals, values and interests. Your philanthropic specialist can then help you understand a range of important considerations, including how to:

Implement your plan
Identify the best-qualified grant recipients
Monitor the impact of your efforts

We can help you design and implement a philanthropic strategy that helps you fulfill your values-based commitments in a way that is consistent with your lifestyle.
Learn more about Philanthropy at U.S. Trust
Custody Services
Benefiting from the experience of dedicated custody specialists
U.S. Trust is the custodian of choice for many sophisticated investors with extensive and complex holdings. Whether you manage your own portfolio or work with multiple brokers and investment managers, we can structure a personalized custody program that simplifies portfolio and trade monitoring and helps meet your specific safekeeping, service and information needs.

Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax or estate planning strategy.
