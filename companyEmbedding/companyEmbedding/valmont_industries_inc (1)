Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Revenues increased 11% to $712.7 million, with gains in every segment except Energy & Mining 
Operating income increased largely due to the higher sales. On a segment basis, the Irrigation and Utility Support Structures Segments had the largest improvement over last year 
Diluted earnings per share increased 9% to $2.01 
Reaffirming annual guidance for earnings to be slightly above $7.00 per diluted share

"Substantial increases in Utility Support Structures and Irrigation Segment sales drove second quarter performance," said Mogens C. Bay, Valmont's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "Engineered Support Structures and Coatings Segment sales also improved, while Energy and Mining sales declined due to weaker end market demand. Overall, a less favorable sales mix and some lagging recoveries of increased raw material costs resulted in slightly lower operating income as a percent of sales."
Second Quarter Segment Review
Infrastructure-related
Engineered Support Structures (29% of Sales) Poles, towers and components for the global lighting, traffic and wireless communication markets, and highway safety products.
Sales of $217.6 million were 7% higher than last year, mainly due to increased intersegment sales to the Utility Support Structures Segment and improved wireless communication product sales in North America. 
Lighting sales decreased slightly in North America and Europe, partly offset by higher sales in the Asia-Pacific region.
Operating income was $20.2 million or 9.3% of sales compared to $20.8 million, or 10.2% of sales in 2016. The effect of higher steel costs and higher intersegment sales resulted in margin compression.
Utility Support Structures (25% of Sales)Steel and concrete structures for the global electric utility industry.
Sales of $184.6 million increased 22% over last year, driven by a combination of volume increases and some pricing tied to higher steel costs. Sales growth remains supported by the ongoing expansion of the North American grid to improve its reliability and capacity. New investments in renewable energy generation also contribute to the need for transmission structures.
Operating income increased to $20.2 million or 10.9% of sales, compared to $17.6 million or 11.6% in 2016. The increase in operating income was due to higher sales. Operating income as a percent of sales declined due to a less favorable product line mix.
Coatings Segment (11% of Sales)Global galvanizing, painting and anodizing services.
Sales of $79.8 million were 6% higher than last year, mostly due to increased activity in the Asia-Pacific region. North American sales improved, benefitting from the new facility in Texas and increased internal volumes to other segments, which partially offset lower external demand. 
Operating income was $12.1 million, or 15.2% of sales, compared to $14.0 million, or 18.6% of sales in 2016. The decrease in operating income resulted from the effect of lower external volumes, and zinc cost increases not fully recovered in sales by pricing, this was partly offset by improved profitability in the Asia-Pacific region. 
Energy and Mining Segment (10% of Sales) Offshore structures, engineered access systems and grinding media.
Sales of $77.2 million were 4% lower than last year mostly due to lower sales of access systems. Expansion into markets outside of mining and energy helped mitigate the impact of reduced demand from markets exposed to oil and gas, which weakened during the quarter. 
Operating income at $3.9 million was 18% higher at 5.1% of sales, compared to $3.3 million or 4.1% of sales last year. 
Agriculture-related
Irrigation Segment (25% of Sales)Agricultural irrigation equipment, parts, services and tubular products.
Sales of $188.3 million rose 24% above last year, with significant increases in both North America and International regions. North American sales increased due to improved demand from markets outside the traditional corn-belt. Additionally, higher equipment operating times drove increased service parts sales. The broad increase in International sales was led by project demand and continued favorable market conditions in Brazil.
Operating income was higher at $34.7 million, or 18.4% of sales compared to $31.0 million, or 20.4% of sales in 2016. The decline in operating income as a percent of sales was due to higher raw material costs only partly offset by leverage of volume, and selling, general and administrative expenses.
Outlook:
"We are reaffirming our annual guidance for earnings to be slightly above $7.00 per diluted share," said Mr. Bay.
"The Utility market has developed stronger than our earlier expectations and we anticipate good demand for the rest of the year. In Engineered Support Structures, we believe moderating steel costs along with price recovery reinforces expectations for second half improvement. In Coatings, we expect stable demand supported by internal and industrial demand. Our Energy and Mining Segment is challenged by difficult end-market demand, and we expect lower second half comparisons. In Irrigation, our international presence developed over many years will be an important contributor to second-half Irrigation results. For North America, we expect the normal third quarter seasonality, with the fourth quarter dependent on crop prices and farmer sentiment upon completion of the growing season."

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
