George Marcus Biography :


George is the senior member of the firm. As shown in the picture, he spends a lot of time dropping in on other members of the firm. This is not because he does not have enough to do. George works with each lawyer in the firm to make sure that its clients' needs are timely met, and that clients are served with the hallmark traits of the firm: expertise, common sense, and economy. George is well known throughout the northeast, and is widely recognized as the "go to" lawyer in Maine for difficult corporate and commercial situations. George has handled such diverse matters as representing a publicly held, Maine based, debtor in Chapter 11 proceedings in the District of Maine, representing Chapter 11 debtors who were integrated, state of the art, pulp and paper manufacturers, reorganizing and restructuring the ownership interests in a nuclear power facility, structuring the out-of-court liquidation of one of Maine's largest real estate companies, and, recently, representing Maine Yankee Atomic Power Company in the Delaware based Chapter 11 proceedings of Stone & Webster, Inc., regarding a $250,000,000 decommissioning contract between Maine Yankee and Stone & Webster. In the mid-1990's, George served as counsel to the Creditors' Committee in one of the then-largest Chapter 11 cases in the country, Cajun Electric Power Cooperative, Inc., in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. This year, the Maine Bankruptcy Court awarded George and the firm an accomplishment bonus for their work as counsel for the Creditors’ Committee in the Jackson Brook Institute Chapter 11 case. The Court recognized the firm’s extraordinary role in achieving a 100% dividend for creditors in a highly troubled case. Today, George is involved on behalf of diverse interests in a number of substantial bankruptcy cases pending in Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, New York, the District of Delaware and elsewhere, and serves as national bankruptcy counsel for a publicly held company headquartered in Maine. George is a 1976 graduate of the University of Chicago Law School, a fellow of the American College of Bankruptcy, is rated "AV" by Martindale Hubbell, and has been listed in every edition of Best Lawyers in America. In February of 2005, Chambers and Partners, a prestigious London firm that publishes global legal guides, announced that it would include George as a Leader in [His] Field in their new Bankruptcy Guide

Our Founders



Marcus & Millichap revolutionized the real estate brokerage industry. The firm was designed to go far beyond simply facilitating real estate transactions. It was developed as an entire system dedicated to maximizing value for real estate investors.

In 1971, our founders, George M. Marcus and William A. Millichap, launched a new real estate investment business model based on a unique method of matching each property with the largest pool of pre-qualified investors. This simple premise—coupled with an unfailing drive to measure success by client satisfaction—enabled us to emerge as the industry’s pre-eminent real estate investment services firm.

Our founders’ vision has been realized by a commitment to specialization, our willingness to foster a culture of information sharing and the foresight to pioneer real estate technology. Today, Marcus & Millichap is the industry’s leading firm specializing in real estate investment sales and financing, as well as a leading source of research and advisory services.

Our senior management team, including our founders, remains dedicated to a tradition of reinventing the ultimate platform for marketing real estate.

ULI San Francisco Blog


Icon George Marcus Talks Process and Strategy

Posted on April 11, 2013 by Dana Van Galder ShareShareTweetEmail 

The new Icon series continues to be a popular ULI draw with a second sold out event.  On March 28, members were treated to a rare interview with George Marcus, Co-Founder and Chairman of Marcus & Millichap Company, parent company of a diversified group of real estate service, investment and development firms.  The evening was led by his friend Mike Covarrubias, Chairman and CEO of TMG.  Not only did ULI members hear the start of the largest commercial investment real estate brokerage firm in the nation, and were entertained by Covarrubias’ slideshow of Marcus through the years and rubbing elbows with prominent politicians and world leaders, but were also privy to the genesis of a popular San Francisco restaurant.
Tell about a day in your life, a deal-junkie.  From the beginning, Marcus explained his interest was in improving the industry and forming organizations that really were businesses. “The notion that I do deals is really a misnomer; I organize companies that strategize to think of better way to be involved in multiple deals. No matter that business you are in, you have to have a defined strategy. Whether building one building, or in my case, hundreds of buildings.”
A great joy.  One of Marcus’ principles is creating companies that sustain beyond him.  He is most proud of Essex Property Trust, with Forbes ranking Essex the third most trusted company in America, and Morgan Stanley rating it as the public company with the greatest prospects over the next five years.  “It’s trust.  And its those kind of things that make a difference.”
On Marcus & Millichap, and moving out of the way.  “When Bill Millichap came into my office in 1971 that was the luckiest day in my life,” Marcus told the room; “While it took a long time to get the brokerage firm going, Bill was excellent at it.”  Marcus realized if he remained CEO, he could lose Bill.  Exercising a fundamental premise in his career, Marcus then “moved out of the way” and started Essex.  He again later moved out of the way at Essex for Keith Guericke to take the helm.  He shared, “I’m more of a strategist and a personnel person.  When I realized I had talent at the door, I wanted to give them all the responsibility they could take; and I wanted them to grow.”
Essex has since produced over 20% a year to shareholders annually.  Warren Buffet isn’t close.  Marcus explained that while he’s been involved in starting 12 to 14 businesses, his career is not about a deal, but about the process and a strategy.
Talking about 2008.  No one was ready for a capital meltdown, and Marcus finds it hard to believe that we did not understand this was possible.  Despite Marcus & Millichap companies being in homebuilding and never having any marginal credit people buying, they got hurt.  As for advice to the members, “If you can, act first!  If you see prices going down, go down faster and make the deal because it’s going to continue to go down.”
Covarrubias credited the “behind the curtain” financial position and strong portfolio of Marcus’ companies for weathering the unpredictable black swan.  Marcus stressed the importance of diverse companies and the ability for the businesses to operate differently.  “Service businesses don’t line up with development companies; and investment businesses are completely different.  Diversity matters.”
The value of ULI.  “It is the people,” Marcus explained about ULI; “Friends in the same industry sharing information, without telling the secret sauce, but most of it.”  He compared it to being at a university, where people have a lot in common.
Advice to one starting in this industry.  The business is unsophisticated and has no training programs unless one works for a bank or real estate division.  He emphasized a hard fact of finding mentors and somehow managing to work for them.  In some business situations like theirs, young MBAs had year rotations for homebuilding, investments, and development.  However the REITs have changed that; and there lie opportunities as the ranks need to be filled with the first round of executives getting older.
San Francisco is an island, but is it a bubble?  Marcus simply stated that no one really knows. We have a very robust economy, but every product and business is a little different.  While admitting it sounded corny, he emphasized one has to have a plan, and one has to work it.  “Generally neighborhood retail is bulletproof once you have the anchor tenant.  The extreme is spec-ing high rise downtown office buildings; I never understood that,” our speaker confessed.
Making the restaurant business work.  There was no one properly representing Greek food, and no one goes to a Greek restaurant.  Marcus and his restaurant partner noted, “If Italians can do it, we can do it.”  Their own research revealed that people liked Greece’s hospitality, but not really the food.  With Evvia, they disguised it as a Mediterranean restaurant, hired a French chef, taught him the Greek recipes, and smothered patrons with service.  The next success was Kokkari.  Covarrubias drew similarities of the venture to Marcus’ real estate successes: with the aspects of research, client focus, position, service, and not doing what everyone else did.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
