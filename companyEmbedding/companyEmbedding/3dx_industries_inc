About


3DX Industries > About








3DX Industries Inc. is a Precision Manufacturing company capable of producing a wide range of products using additive and subtractive manufacturing processes. Using our state of the art 3D Metal Printing System, Composite Printing equipment and numerous CNC Precision Machining Centers, 3DX Industries will exceed your expectations for prototype, production and assembly services.
3DX Industries uses Binder Jet technology to 3D print complex parts. Binder Jet is a powder bed process, where a binding agent is used to selectively ‘print’ the desired part shape by adhesively joining the metal particles. After the jetting process, the green part is sintered in a furnace to burn off the binder. An infiltrant, typically bronze, is then melted and drawn into the part to fill in the spaces of the sintered metal powder skeleton to create a fully dense component.
The three-dimensional printing process produces fully functional metal parts directly from CAD files. The benefits of the Binder Jet  process include enhanced part design flexibility, complex internal geometries, undercuts, angled passages, and the opportunity to create component features that cannot be duplicated with traditional machining methods. The 3D printing process generates single-piece and multi-piece designs with shortened lead times at significantly lower costs.
NOT JUST 3D PRINTING
In addition to our 3D Metal Printing capabilities, 3DX has a full array of CNC precision machining centers capable of high speed precision milling up to large capacity vertical machining to meet the most demanding specifications our clients require. We also have an in-house 3D Composite printer for smaller component, prototype and production runs. Using our composite printing system, we can offer our clients a low cost quick turnaround option on prototype parts and components for designer review and engineer evaluation prior to final production runs.
3DX Industries, Inc. is a public company, trading on the OTCQB exchange under the symbol DDDX.

FAQs


3DX Industries > FAQs











Below are the Frequently Asked Questions.
If you do not see an answer to your question please contact us.

 




What is Additive Manufacturing?




Additive manufacturing is exploding on the manufacturing scene as leading companies are transitioning from “analog” to “digital” manufacturing. Additive manufacturing uses three dimensional printing to transform engineering design files into fully functional and durable objects created from sand, metal and glass. The technology creates products layer by layer – after a layer’s particles are bound by heat or chemicals the next layer is added and the binding process is repeated. It enables geometries not previously possible to be manufactured. Full-form parts are made directly from computer-aided design (CAD) data for a variety of industrial, commercial and art applications.

 



Why did 3DX decide to transition into the additive manufacturing arena?




Companies that use additive manufacturing reduce costs, lower the risk of trial and error, and create opportunities for design innovation. A serious limitation of subtractive manufacturing is that part designs are often severely comprised to accommodate the constraints of the subtractive process. Additive manufacturing enables both the design and the materialization of objects by eliminating traditional manufacturing constraints.

 



What are some of the advantages of Additive Manufacturing?




Cost and Time Savings – Additive manufacturing swiftly creates product prototypes – an increasingly critical function that significantly reduces the traditional trial-and-error process – so new products can enter the market more quickly. Likewise, it can promptly create unique or specialized metal products that can replace worn or broken industrial parts. That means companies can avoid costly shut downs and drastically compress the time it takes to machine a replacement part. With additive manufacturing, once a CAD drawing is created the replacement part can be printed. Storage of bulky patterns and tooling is virtually eliminated.
Environmental Impact – Additive Manufacturing produces less waste – Since the process involves adding layers of material to create a part or product vrs subtracting material there is much less waste to be recycled using additive manufacturing processes.

 



Are there Environmental Benefits to using the Additive Manufacturing Process?




YES! In traditional manufacturing, objects are created in a subtractive manner as metals are trimmed and shaped to fit together properly. This process creates substantial waste that can be harmful to the environment. Additive manufacturing is a very energy efficient and environmentally friendly manufacturing option.

 



What are the benefits of having additive manufacturing and subtractive manufacturing under the same roof?




There are many components, parts and proto-types that can be made using the additive manufacturing process, however there are certain situations that are best served using traditional manufacturing methods, including “touch-up’s” or “tweek’s”of printed parts that can only be done using traditional precision machining process’s. This is generally found within the corporate arena such as high tech components, aeronautics, military, automotive or any other situation that would require more of a high precision “fit”. This is not generally required when dealing with more cosmetic components such as jewelry, art, knick-knacks, or other such objects/items that are more cosmetic than functional. 3DX Industries can handle either situation which is a great benefit to our customers as we are truly a one-stop-shop for their manufacturing needs.

 



Can you outline the process for printing a 3D Metal part using your M-Flex System?





The process begins with a CAD file provided by you or created by us.
The M-Flex’s built-in software slices the CAD file into very thin layers (0.004 – 0.006 inch) (0.1 –0.15 mm).
The machine spreads a layer of powdered metal in the build box.
A printhead moves across the layer, depositing liquid binder according to the design for that layer.
The layer dries and the build box is lowered slightly.
A new layer of powdered material is spread, repeating this process until all layers have been completed.
The build box now contains a fully printed and bound part, surrounded by loose powder (which acts as a support). The part is considered in a “green state” at this point and very fragile.
The printed part is depowdered and goes into a furnace for sintering, which burns out the binder and fuses the metal molecules making a hardened part, approximately 60% dense.
Metal parts are now strong and can be handled but still contain tiny internal gaps. Therefore, infiltration (a second thermal process) is required to bring parts up to full density. The M-Flex Materialization Systems typically utilize a bronze infiltrant.

Thermally-processed metal parts are near 100% density and can be used functionally – not only as prototypes. A variety of finishing options are available, including protective coats and plating.

 



What type of material are you able to print in?




Our M-Flex 3D Metal Printing System is able to print in stainless steel, bronze, tungsten and glass at this time. New materials are being studied and tested to create even more versatility. Keep an eye on our website for updates.
Our Z-Corp 3D Composite printer prints with high performance composites allowing us to create a variety of products and prototypes out of plastics. Please call us for specifics on the materials we can use for printing.

 



What type of things can you manufacture?




There is an interesting question. 3DX has over 30 years’ in house management experience building precision machine components for numerous companies worldwide. We specialize in quality and customer service. Our management team has been involved in the additive manufacturing process for the past 8 years through plastic printing and have spent a considerable amount of time over the past 3 years learning and understanding the 3D Metal Printing process. With our experience in these areas there is not to many things we can’t handle. Our expertise lies in smaller components made out of metal mainly due to the restrictions of our equipment. We can accommodate a variety of smaller plastic components as well. If you have something you would like built, proto-type or production runs, please contact us. If we can’t help you we can sure point you in the right direction.

 



Can you make jewellery and non industrial components?




Absolutely! In fact with our M-Flex 3D Metal printing system we can create almost anything you can think of that will fit in your hand out of metal or plastic. The ability to generate intricate designs for jewellery, knick-knacks, ornaments etc. is a speciality of our 3D Metal printer. It is versatile enough to print a beautiful pendant or meet the high structural demands of a high speed turbine to be used in an energy generation project. From high end industrial uses to beautiful works of art, we are excited to tackle your project.

 



What types of equipment do you have at your facility?




For additive manufacturing we have a state of the art M-Flex 3D Metal Printing System, from The ExOne Company, along with a Z-Corp Composite Printer both of which are housed within our environmentally controlled printing room. Our printing room also includes a furnace and curing oven as well as numerous pieces of auxiliary equipment to support the M-Flex and Z-Corp printers.
Our precision machining department includes high speed machining centers from Fanuc’s ROBODRILL line all the way up to Cincinnati Milacron’s large capacity Vertical milling center with an envelope size of 80x30x32. In total we have 13 CNC Machines, several with 4th support pieces to aid in the production process.
3DX is a complete 3D Metal Printing, Composite Printing and Precision Component Manufacturer. If you need something built, please contact us to see if we can help you out.

 



What are your goals moving forward?




3DX will continue to provide high quality – high precision parts to its customers, using the additive and traditional methods of manufacturing. We are excited to be able to offer our client base the option of 3D Metal printing, to not only reduce costs but reduce our impact on the environment by moving towards more additive manufacturing processes. It is our goal to add more 3D Metal printers to our production line, and phase out some of the subtractive manufacturing equipment currently in use. We do feel there will continue to be a requirement for both processes, but any steps we can make towards reducing our carbon footprint is a step in the right direction.

 



Do you do factory tours?




We do not offer tours to the public at this time. If you are with an educational institution and would like to have a tour of our facility please contact us to discuss.

 



Are you hiring?




We are always on the lookout for qualified personnel who are interested in making a difference. We encourage anyone interested in the 3D design and manufacturing process or those who are qualified and experienced in CNC machine operations to send us their resume. 3DX is always looking for experienced CAD designers to work with our internal product development team.

In the early part of his career, his management of an exploration program in Nevada resulted in the acquisition of three gold ore bodies that were subsequently mined profitably.
In addition to having been a key employee with several large and small mining companies and a consultant to the mining industry, Dr. Abbott has been an officer and director of several junior mining companies.
Dr. Abbott is active in his profession, having been a member and served as an executive of professional mining associations. As a result, he has an extensive network of technical as well as leadership contacts. He is a Certified Professional Geologist (C.P.G.) by the American Institute of Professional Geologists (AIPG) as well as being the past President of the Nevada Chapter. He is also a member and past president of the Geological Society of Nevada (GSN), a member and past President of the Nevada Petroleum & geothermal Society (NPSGS), a member and past President of the Denver Region Exploration Geologists Society (DREGS), a member of the Society of Economic Geologists (SEG), a member of the Society for Mining, Metallurgy, and Exploration (SME), a member of the Geological Society of America (GSA), a member of the Northwest Mining Association (NWMA), a member of the Association for Mineral Exploration British Columbia (AMEBC), and a member of the Prospectors and Developers Association of Canada (PDAC). Dr. Abbott is a Qualified Person under the rules of National Instrument 43-101.

3DX Industries, Inc.
3DX Industries Inc. is a Precision Manufacturing company capable of producing a wide range of products using additive and subtractive manufacturing processes.
3DX Industries uses Binder Jet technology to 3D print complex parts. Binder Jet is a powder bed process, where a binding agent is used to selectively ‘print’ the desired part shape by adhesively joining the metal particles. After the jetting process, the green part is sintered in a furnace to burn off the binder. An infiltrant, typically bronze, is then melted and drawn into the part to fill in the spaces of the sintered metal powder skeleton to create a fully dense component.

(  OTC :  DDDX ) 3DX Industries Inc., (the "Company" or "3DX") is pleased to announce it has completed the development and design of a new and innovative product used for recovering excess heat from high energy grow lights. The product captures excess heat energy at the individual, grow light source; before it can raise the overall grow room temperature. The captured heat energy can then either be exhausted outside of the facility or routed to areas within the facility or nearby that require heat. Initial engineering studies are indicating a reduction in overall air conditioning electrical load by up to 30%. 3DX Industries research and development team has been working on the design and beta testing of the product for the past year and is now ready to begin prototype production of the component. The part was designed specifically for the legalized cannabis markets including medical marijuana using the company's 3D Metal printing -- Binder Additive manufacturing process and is expected to be installed in select licensed facilities for real world testing in the coming months.North American marijuana sales grew by an unprecedented 30% in 2016 to $6.7 billion as the legal market expands in the U.S. and Canada, according to a new report by Arcview Market Research.North American sales are projected to top $20.2 billion by 2021 assuming a compound annual growth rate of 25%. The report includes Canada for the first time as it moves towards implementing legal adult use marijuana.Mr. Janssen, President and CEO of 3DX Industries, comments: "We have invested considerable time and effort to identify and develop a product that we expect will benefit the growing of medical marijuana by designing and manufacturing a component intended to significantly reduce the costs of facility operations. By directly reducing costs to the manufacturer, the benefits of a more affordable end product can also be realized by the end user. Not to mention our product has a direct effect on reducing energy consumption which is a benefit to the environment as well."The product can be easily fitted to existing and new facilities with minimal effort. 3DX Industries has the design and manufacturing rights to the components and is in the process of filing patent and trademarks on its proprietary new product.Updates forthcoming. About the Company: 3DX Industries, Inc. is focused on the additive metal manufacturing segment within the manufacturing industry. 3DX has the capability of manufacturing a wide variety of products using its 3D metal printing system, 3D composite printing as well as more traditional methods of precision manufacturing. 3DX offers additive and subtractive manufacturing options as well as product design, engineering and assembly services to its customers.About Binder Jet: Binder Jetting is a powder bed process, where a binder is used to selectively 'print' the desired part shape by adhesively joining the metal particles. After the jetting process, the green part is sintered in a furnace to burn off the binder and then an infiltrant, typically bronze, is melted and drawn into the part to fill in the remaining spaces within the sintered metal powder skeleton to create a dense component. The resulting parts combine properties from both the metal powder and the infiltrant.Safe Harbor 3DX encourages those interested in our Company to rely only on information included in our filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission which can be found at www.sec.gov. Statements released by3DX Industries, Inc. that are not purely historical are forward-looking within the meaning of the "Safe Harbor" provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements regarding the company's expectations, hopes, intentions, and strategies for the future. Investors are cautioned that forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainties that may affect the company's business prospects and performance. The company's actual results could differ materially from those in such forward-looking statements. Risk factors include but are not limited to general economic, competitive, governmental, and technological factors as discussed in the company's filings with the SEC on Forms 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Make a Qualified Choice







Is the professional brand-name product line that you are currently promoting and selling in your salon, now easily available to your customers on the Internet, or in a Beauty Supply Store near you (possibly at a better price than you can offer).. 







Are you and your customers satisfied with the quality and efficacy of the professional products and supplies being used and sold in your Salon or Spa..? ... have you asked for our free samples Program and compared our Famous European Quality..?







Are the prices that you are now paying for professional skin care products and supplies attractive and profitable to you..? ...have you done your homework and compared them with our impressive prices ..?







4. Are you aware that some manufacturers and distributors of the well known exclusive in the past salon and spa products (to lower their costs) transferred the formulations, know how, and processing to developing countries ...?







You will find the answers to these questions and solutions to many other professional concerns when you progress through our Web Site







... Skin Care Professional: Stay Secure in Era of political and economic uncertainties ... 







Important and helpful to know :







The Internet and Globalization have created mass access to products that were designed to be exclusively sold at professional Salons and Spa. This new trend is forcing salons and Spas around the world to find alternative paths to compete and prosper







Traditionally, Salons and Spas were using professional (domestic and foreign) popular brand-name skin care products. Up to recent past, these brands were truly exclusive. Only professionals were able to purchase these products wholesale, and only through distribution channels designated by manufacturers. This process of distribution granted you a professional advantage and exclusiveness over products available in department and beauty-supply stores







Current global marketing developments such as the implementation of sales through the Internet have virtually eliminated this exclusivity. Inevitably, the Internet has made it possible for your loyal customers to access the brand-name product that you sell in your salon, in a much faster, more convenient, and more affordable way. The distributors that you rely on for your "exclusivity" are no longer able to control the spread of countless websites that offer consumers the identical brand-name products found previously only at professional Salons and Spas like yours







Now literally anyone can purchase retail in a Beauty Supply store or Online almost any salon brand-name product,







 







They are widely available on countless Internet sites 






 






This Trend Is Already Affecting Your Business:







Diminished the professional image of your Salon; 







Diminished your role as a provider of an exclusive product line; 







Inevitably caused the significant decline of your product sales and customer loyalty.







You have worked hard to establish your practice. You have struggled to maintain your clientele. You have invested monetarily as well as emotionally. Now is the time to safeguard and protect your investment.








 





MAKE A SMART MOVE TOWARD YOUR PRIVATE LABEL





Compare RAYA® quality and prices with products you are using now












Recognize, that only promoting your own name on private label (see Options of Private Labeling) skin care and cosmetic products will protect you from having your business and profits undercut by new marketing trends.






Now, as never before, it has become necessary for Salons, Spas, Estheticians, and Dermatologists to promote their name click here on their retail and back-bar products so that they can be protected from declining customer sales and loyalty.






By establishing your name on the label, you are promoting yourself, not other existing brand-named companies, and you are securing your own business. 







By buying directly from the cosmetic manufacturing company, you bypass the middle-man distribution chain and substantially cut your costs. Compare RAYA®'s prices.







In addition, by incorporating our in-salon custom blending click here techniques, you are able to customize treatments to your clients' individual needs. As a result, you are better equipped to compete in the ever-expanding and diverse skin care market.







Discover RAYA® Superior Quality and attractive prices. Compare with Brand Name Products you are using now














With Your Name on the product and our time proven European quality you are progressively securing a place for yourself in the rapidly changing market.

300 Vitamin-B Cream





This highly effective, yet very light, day cream is recommended for normal to oily, blemished and problem skin. A complex of natural botanical extracts, vitamins, and amino acids help to moisturize and balance the skin, while natural Vitamin B Complex (Yeast Extract) helps to regulate oil gland secretion to reduce the possibility of clogged pores, inflammations, and breakouts associated with an oily skin condition and the use of make-up products. After cleansing and toning, use once or twice daily.





Contains:





Aloe Vera Gel, Stearic Acid, Dimethicone, Glycerin, Decyl Oleate, Cetyl Alcohol, Sodium Alginate, Aquas Extracts of Chamomile, and Cucumber, Blackcurrant Extract, Tamarind Extract, Apple Extract, Yeast Extract (Vitamin B), Carbomer, Ginseng Extract, Allantoin, d-Penthanol, Retinyl Palmitate, Glucose, Fructose, Sucrose, Dextrin, Glutamic Acid, Phenoxyethanol, Guar Gum, Sodium PCA, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Retinyl Palmitate (Vitamin A), Ascorbyl Palmitate, Triethanolamine, Sodium Hyaluronate, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Citric Acid.





Caution:





Avoid contact with eyes and mucous membranes. Keep out of reach of children. Use only as directed.





Professional in salon use: 





This non-greasy, water based oil control formula can be used as a final step in oily and blemished skin facial by applying over moist skin. Designed to be compatible with Camphor Soufflé, Mint Soufflé and Active Cleansing Gel cleansers, and Camphor, Eucalyptus or Blemish control astringents. For a more aggressive treatment Glycolic gel GX50 or Blemish control gel can be used prior to cream application. This cream does not leave residue.





Key ingredient functions and product benefits:





It is important to maintain a regular moisturizing routine to keep the skin from becoming too irritated or dry. Dehydrated oily skin can result in breakouts as the skin overcompensates by producing more oil. An oil control moisturizer may be desired in order to reduce shine and maintain skin’s moisture balance, therefore reducing the need for make up powders (which can contain pore clogging ingredients). The primary cause of dryness in oily skin is excessive water evaporation from the skin surface. Rich in humectants (the substances that can trap and hold water) this product helps to keep the skin hydrated while controlling oil overproduction. Amino acid complex, Dimethicone, Glycerin, Sodium PCA, and Sodium Hyaluronate provide moisture binding activity. Fruit extracts of Blackcurrant, Tamarind, and Apple help to balance the skin’s pH and control bacteria. Yeast Extract (Vitamin B) controls oil. Allantoin and Aloe Vera help to soothe problem skin. Absorbs rapidly providing immediate hydration.

Caution:





Avoid contact with eyes and mucous membranes. Keep out of reach of children. Use only as directed.





Professional in salon use:





This is a  moisture rich, creamy, whipped soufflé consistency nourishing mask with  a light berry scent. The yellow color comes from Carrot Oil and Sea  Buckthorn Oil. It is a non-setting type of phytotherapy mask (does not  dry on the skin). Use of masks following serums and creams improves  treatment properties and absorption of these products. Mask’s  properties could be customized to clients needs by blending appropriate  serums (Vital Silk, Vitanol A, Line Preventing Serum) and creams  (Vitaplex C, Revitalizing Cream, Bio Effective Night Cream), directly  into the mask prior to skin application. A flash “moisture boost”  effect helps to seal in the active ingredients contained in this  treatment.





In-Salon application:





Analyze your  client’s skin to determine the correct treatment mask to use. Remove  enough mask for one application with a disposable spatula from the bulk  container and place in a smaller container for skin application or  custom blending. Use on cleansed skin. Before proceeding protect the  client’s eyes with cotton pads dampened in warm water. Apply a thick  layer with a brush, spatula or fingertips (a nickel-sized amount or  more) over the entire face starting with the neck line, then jaws,  cheeks, chin, nose and forehead. Avoid applying mask to lips, mouth,  hairline, eyebrows and the area around the eyes. Ask the client if they  are comfortable. Leave on for 5 to 15 minutes. The mask should be  removed with tepid to warm water and cotton. Tone and refresh with  appropriate toner (Aloe Cucumber or Ginseng Toners) and follow with a  moisturizer or specialty product. Remove cotton pads from the client’s  eyes. For combination skin types, two masks can be used at the same  time. Mild masks formulated for oily skin (Volcanic Mud Mask, Mint  Mask) can be used on oily areas, and masks formulated for dry skin  (Skin Recovery Mask, Collagen Cream Mask, Placenta Nourishing Mask) on  the dry areas. For non-sensitive, dryer skin types can be used as a  final emollient, calming, moisturizing and skin protective mask  following in-salon procedures (Micro-Dermabrasion, Glycolic, Enzymes,  LED).





Key ingredient functions and product benefits: 





Helps to  reduce visible signs of aging, Supplies vital nutrients to the skin.  Promotes skin balance and comfort. Sesame Oil, Safflower Oil, Squalane,  Mango Butter, Glycerin and Carrot Oil protect from moisture loss and  provide nourishment to the skin. Retinyl Palmitate, Tocophyrol and  Ascorbyl Palmitate show skin renewal properties, help to calm  inflammation and refine pores. Ginseng Extract, Sea Buckthorn Oil and  Aloe Vera Gel provide soothing and healing properties. Collagen, a  soluble protein, effectively helps to diminish wrinkles and age lines  while restoring elasticity to skin. Contains Pentapeptides for improved  Collagen and Elastin production to further reduce and slow the  formation of new lines and wrinkles.
