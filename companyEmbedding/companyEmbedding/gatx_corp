GATX Corporation (NYSE: GATX) is an equipment finance company based in Chicago, Illinois. Founded in 1898, GATX's primary activities consist of railcar operating leasing in North America and Europe. In addition, GATX leases locomotives in North America, and also has significant investments in industrial equipment and marine assets, including ownership of the American Steamship Company, which operates on the Great Lakes. The CEO/Chairman is Brian A. Kenney.
GATX Corporation is divided into four business segments: Rail North America, Rail International, American Steamship Company (ASC), and Portfolio Management. Portfolio Management consists largely of the corporation's non-rail and non-Great Lakes assets.[2]
GATX is one of several major North American rail operating lessors, and measured by fleet size, ranks as number two in this market behind GE Rail Services. Other major North American rail operating lessors include CIT, First Union, Union Tank Car Company, Trinity Industries Leasing, ARL, and Helm Financial.
GATX derives its name from its primary reporting mark for its North American railcars, "GATX". The mark itself was derived from GATX's prior corporate name, "General American Transportation". Since all non-railroad owners of railcars must append an "X" to the end of their mark, GAT became GATX. GATX mainly applies the GATX mark to tank cars, although the mark has been used in other examples such as with hoppers; GATX's primary freightcar marks are GACX (for general-service freight cars), GGPX (for coal cars), GIMX (for intermodal cars), GPLX (for plastic pellet cars), GMTX and LLPX (for locomotives), and GPFX (for pressure-differential cars). GATX also owns a number of other marks, including GABX, GAEX, GFSX, GOHX, GSCX, IPSX, and TRIX. Many GATX cars carry a large "GATX" logo in the upper right-hand corner of the car regardless of the reporting mark they carry; this logo is applied for marketing reasons and does not have any operational significance.
The General American Transportation Corporation became GATX Rail Corporation, a unit of the GATX Corporation, on January 1, 2000.[3][4]
GATX engages in both full-service and net leasing of railcars. In a full-service lease, a GATX-owned mark is applied to the car, and GATX maintains the railcar and pays for any required property insurance and property taxes. In a net lease, the lessee applies its mark to the car, and the lessee pays for any required property insurance and property taxes. Often, on a net-leased car, there is no evidence of GATX ownership, although some net lease cars carry a GATX logo.
The most common type of car in the GATX North American fleet is the tank car; other major car types include covered hoppers, open-top hoppers, and gondolas. GATX invests in nearly every type of railcar operated in North America. In Europe, tank cars also make up GATX's largest fleet, but unlike in North America, GATX's European fleet includes substantial quantities of intermodal cars which are owned in a GATX joint venture called AAE Cargo. In contrast, GATX's North American intermodal car fleet is relatively small. This is true of most North American operating lessors; historically the bulk of the industry's intermodal investment has been made by TTX Corporation, which is jointly owned by North America's Class I railroads.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

                    Staten Island Property Puts a Nascar Failure Behind It                
The former oil tank farm in Bloomfield that stirred opposition when a racetrack was proposed for the site will become a marine port and logistics center.
By JULIE SATOW














                    Staten Island, Start Your Engines: Nascar May Be On Its Way                
For years, Nascar has sought to penetrate the New York metropolitan area, trying to build speedways in places like the Catskills and the New Jersey Meadowlands. Now, it has set its sights on New York City itself and is negotiating to transform a Staten Island industrial park into a major speedway on 440 acres of waterfront land near the Goethals Bridge. Nascar speedways are phenomenally popular in the South and the Midwest, and the circuit has gradually moved to the Northeast in recent years. But establishing a beachhead right in New York City, where pedestrians and mass transit rule, would be a major coup as Nascar seeks to broaden its appeal.










COMPANY NEWS

                    CIT TO BUY LEASING UNIT FROM GATX FOR ABOUT $200 MILLION                
The CIT Group, which finances purchases of items like aircraft and trains, agreed to buy the GATX Corporation's technology-leasing unit for about $200 million in cash and undisclosed debt to lease more computer equipment. GATX valued the unit's assets at about $520 million. It had $200 million in sales last year, a GATX spokesman, Robert Lyons, said. CIT, based in Livingston, N.J., expects to complete the purchase before July 31. The purchase gives CIT, which was sold to the public by Tyco International Inc. in 2002, the ability to finance more computer- network services for companies, a spokesman, Doug Donsky, said.










COMPANY NEWS

                    KINDER MORGAN AGREES TO BUY TWO PIPELINES FROM GATX                
Kinder Morgan Energy Partners agreed yesterday to buy two oil products pipelines and 12 storage terminals from the GATX Corporation for $1.15 billion in cash and assumed debt. The transaction includes the 550-mile Calnev pipeline operation, which transported an average of 112,000 barrels of refined products a day last year; and the 195-mile central Florida pipeline, which moved a daily average of 85,000 barrels of refined products. The 12 storage terminals have a capacity of 35.6 million barrels, holding both petroleum products and chemicals.











                    GATX to Take 4th-Quarter Charges                
The GATX Corporation said today that it would take fourth-quarter charges of $150 million to pay for job cuts, write-downs and asset sales at two units, in moves prompted in part by reduced use of its petroleum terminals. GATX, based in Chicago, said it would dismiss 300, or 20 percent, of the workers at GATX Terminals. The unit, which stores petroleum and chemicals, has also closed sales offices, installed new computers and centralized operations, a spokesman, George Lowman, said.











                    Stares of Lawyerly Disbelief at a Huge Civil Award                
Big civil-damages awards have become an increasingly common feature of the American legal landscape, but Monday's nearly $3.5 billion punitive-damages assessment in a 1987 Louisiana railway fire is being seen as a case unto itself. The accident that spawned the huge award was little noticed outside Louisiana and did not cause widespread injury or death. Questions were raised about the long-term health effects of the chemical fire, but no definitive studies have established lasting medical damage.










COMPANY NEWS

                    GATX WILL BUY SOME PITNEY BOWES ASSETS                
Pitney Bowes Inc. will sell some of the assets it leases to other companies to the GATX Corporation of Chicago for $460 million in cash as part of the company's plan to raise $1 billion to buy back shares. The companies will also create a joint venture that will get from Pitney Bowes about $800 million in expensive assets like aircraft that are rented to other companies. Pitney Bowes plans to borrow about $600 million against the joint venture's assets. Pitney Bowes, based in Stamford, Conn., also said its board had increased a share-buyback program by 3.2 million shares, to 12.4 million shares. Its shares rose $1.50, to $78.50, while GATX fell 18.75 cents, to $61.125.











                    COMPANY BRIEFS                
OGLEBAY NORTON INC., Cleveland, said it had bought two vessels from GATX Corp's GATX Capital Corp. unit, for an undisclosed amount. REPUBLIC INDUSTRIES, Fort Lauderdale, Fla., said it was considering a spinoff of its waste-management and security businesses into a separate public company as early as next year. ZENECA GROUP P.L.C., London, a drug and chemical company, agreed to acquire Imperial Chemical Industries P.L.C.'s Australian pharmaceuticals business, for an undisclosed price.










NEW JERSEY DAILY BRIEFING

                    Charges Possible in Spill                
The tankerman who is being blamed for a spill that sent 40,000 gallons of diesel fuel into the Arthur Kill was dismissed yesterday and may face criminal charges, officials said. The tankerman, Donald D. Lamb, had alcohol on his breath when he was questioned after the incident at the GATX Marine Terminal in Carteret, a state police official said. He will be questioned by a state grand jury on Monday, said Sgt. Daniel Cosgrove, a state police spokesman.










COMPANY NEWS

                    GATX AND PARTNERS ORDER 11 BOEING JETLINERS                
The GATX Capital Corporation said yesterday that two partnerships affiliated with the company had ordered 11 Boeing jetliners for a total of as much as $1.2 billion. GATX Capital, a financing business owned by the GATX Corporation, a railroad and freight shipping company, said it had formed GATX 737-800 Partners with Heller Financial Inc., which is a subsidiary of Fuji Bank Ltd., and the Kanematsu Corporation, both of Japan. Ten 737-800 jetliners were ordered from the Boeing Company of Seattle, with options for another 10. GATX 757 Partners also ordered a new Boeing 757-200.














COMPANY NEWS

                    HAWKER SIDDELEY AGREES TO SELL STAKE IN CGTX                
Hawker Siddeley Canada Inc. agreed yesterday to sell its 55 percent interest in CGTX Inc., a rail-car-leasing business, to the GATX Corporation for about $83.6 million, in accord with a judgment issued by an Ontario court. GATX, Hawker Siddeley's partner in the concern, offered to buy the stake late last year. But Hawker, based in Mississauga, Ontario, rejected the bid and agreed to sell the stake to Procor Ltd., a company owned by Chicago-based Marmon Group Inc. GATX sued to stop the transaction, saying it had a right of first refusal on the CGTX interest. The Canadian court ruled in GATX's favor. GATX is a Chicago-based leasing, transportation, financial-services and bulk-storage concern.










COMPANY NEWS

                    GATX UNIT OFFERS TO BUY CONTROL OF RAIL-CAR OPERATOR                
The GATX Corporation's General American Transport unit said yesterday that it had offered $93 million (Canadian), or $67.4 million (United States), for Hawker Siddeley Canada Inc.'s controlling stake in CGTX Inc., a Canadian operator of a fleet of railroad cars. The move would strengthen the position of GATX, which is based in Chicago, as the lessor of the largest fleet of railroad tank cars in North America. CGTX has 8,400 railroad cars, of which 4,300 are tank cars. Hawker is based in Mississauga, Ontario.

                    Bright Chicago Students Lured to Teaching                
LEAD: Fifteen of Chicago's best and brightest high school seniors are being enticed into the teaching profession in a scholarship program under corporate sponsorship.











                    GATX Chief's Retirement Set                
LEAD: The GATX Corporation said Friday that its president and chief operating officer, J. Warren Samborn, would take early retirement, effective March 1. Mr. Samborn, 56 years old, joined GATX in 1969 in its capital leasing subsidiary, where he held several mangement positions before being named president of the division.











                    Leucadia National Sells GATX Stake                
The Leucadia National Corporation said it had sold its entire 8.9 percent stake of the GATX Corporation's shares outstanding. The sale represents the end of Leucadia's attempted takeover of GATX, which was halted in late March after Leucadia refused to sign a definitive agreement on its offer of $40 a share in cash and securities, valued at $544.8 million, because of what it termed ''new information that was significant from a financial point of view.''











                    GATX Will Buy Up to 30% of Stock                
The GATX Corporation, one of the nation's largest rail car and aircraft leasing companies, said that to maximize shareholder value it would repurchase up to 30 percent of its common stock outstanding, increase its dividend and adopt a shareholder rights plan designed to thwart takeover attempts. GATX, the object of a failed takeover bid that involved three suitors earlier this year, said it would pay $38 each in cash and notes for up to four million shares of common stock outstanding.











                    Leucadia Delays On GATX                
The Leucadia National Corporation, after reaching an agreement to acquire the GATX Corporation last weekend, said today that it was not prepared to enter into a definitive agreement because of what it termed ''new information that was significant from a financial point of view.'' But Stephen Jacobs, a lawyer for Leucadia said: ''The deal is not dead from our point of view. It just became apparent yesterday that we would need additional financing.'' Mr. Jacobs said Leucadia had requested a one-week extension to raise an unspecified amount of money.











                    GATX ACCEPTS BID MADE BY LEUCADIA                
The GATX Corporation has accepted a $40-a-share cash offer from the Leucadia National Corporation to buy the 91.1 percent stake it does not already own in GATX for a total of $495.8 million. GATX, one of the nation's largest rail car and aircraft leasing companies, said today that the offer was conditioned upon final negotiation and execution of a definitive agreement, approval by GATX's shareholders and Leucadia's ability to provide adequate financing. The decision made by GATX's board late Saturday afternoon ends a monthlong bidding war started last month by Leucadia, an insurance and consumer finance company.











                    Battle Grows In GATX Bid                
The bidding war for the GATX Corporation intensified as one suitor said it had finished its due diligence review of the company and had offered $40 a share, while another said it was in the process of obtaining financing. Gabelli & Company, the New York-based investment firm, which had previously offered $571 million, or $42 a share in cash and notes, said today that it had asked Bear, Stearns & Company to help finance its acquisition.

                    A STOCK PICKER MOVES TO LEVERAGED BUYOUTS                
Mario J. Gabelli has won a following as one of Wall Street's savviest stock pickers since he left Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in 1979 to form his own firm. But no one associated his name with leveraged buyouts. That quickly changed in the last few days. First, Mr. Gabelli, in conjunction with a group of associates, placed bids to acquire the GATX Corporation and then the Diamond Crystal Salt Company.

Mr. Samborn, 56 years old, joined GATX in 1969 in its capital leasing subsidiary, where he held several mangement positions before being named president of the division.











                    Leucadia National Sells GATX Stake                
The Leucadia National Corporation said it had sold its entire 8.9 percent stake of the GATX Corporation's shares outstanding. The sale represents the end of Leucadia's attempted takeover of GATX, which was halted in late March after Leucadia refused to sign a definitive agreement on its offer of $40 a share in cash and securities, valued at $544.8 million, because of what it termed ''new information that was significant from a financial point of view.''











                    GATX Will Buy Up to 30% of Stock                
The GATX Corporation, one of the nation's largest rail car and aircraft leasing companies, said that to maximize shareholder value it would repurchase up to 30 percent of its common stock outstanding, increase its dividend and adopt a shareholder rights plan designed to thwart takeover attempts. GATX, the object of a failed takeover bid that involved three suitors earlier this year, said it would pay $38 each in cash and notes for up to four million shares of common stock outstanding.











                    Leucadia Delays On GATX                
The Leucadia National Corporation, after reaching an agreement to acquire the GATX Corporation last weekend, said today that it was not prepared to enter into a definitive agreement because of what it termed ''new information that was significant from a financial point of view.'' But Stephen Jacobs, a lawyer for Leucadia said: ''The deal is not dead from our point of view. It just became apparent yesterday that we would need additional financing.'' Mr. Jacobs said Leucadia had requested a one-week extension to raise an unspecified amount of money.











                    GATX ACCEPTS BID MADE BY LEUCADIA                
The GATX Corporation has accepted a $40-a-share cash offer from the Leucadia National Corporation to buy the 91.1 percent stake it does not already own in GATX for a total of $495.8 million. GATX, one of the nation's largest rail car and aircraft leasing companies, said today that the offer was conditioned upon final negotiation and execution of a definitive agreement, approval by GATX's shareholders and Leucadia's ability to provide adequate financing. The decision made by GATX's board late Saturday afternoon ends a monthlong bidding war started last month by Leucadia, an insurance and consumer finance company.











                    Battle Grows In GATX Bid                
The bidding war for the GATX Corporation intensified as one suitor said it had finished its due diligence review of the company and had offered $40 a share, while another said it was in the process of obtaining financing. Gabelli & Company, the New York-based investment firm, which had previously offered $571 million, or $42 a share in cash and notes, said today that it had asked Bear, Stearns & Company to help finance its acquisition.










BUSINESS PEOPLE

                    A STOCK PICKER MOVES TO LEVERAGED BUYOUTS                
Mario J. Gabelli has won a following as one of Wall Street's savviest stock pickers since he left Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in 1979 to form his own firm. But no one associated his name with leveraged buyouts. That quickly changed in the last few days. First, Mr. Gabelli, in conjunction with a group of associates, placed bids to acquire the GATX Corporation and then the Diamond Crystal Salt Company.
