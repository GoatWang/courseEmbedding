The company veterans begin their new roles on Feb. 1. The two have also been elected to Parker's board of directors, effective immediately.
Donald E. Washkewicz, 64, chief executive since 2001, chairman of the board since 2004, and president since 2006, will remain chairman of Parker's board during the transition of his responsibilities, the company said.
"Over the past decade, both Tom and Lee have been exposed to the entire global organization, including broad executive leadership preparation and strategy development," Washkewicz said in a statement.
"They each bring significant experience with all of Parker's operating groups and have led the growth and development of Parker's position in emerging markets. They are supported by a strong management team, all with the common goal of driving outstanding results across Parker's businesses."
Williams, 55, an operating officer of the company since 2006, has had leadership responsibility for the aerospace, filtration, engineered materials, instrumentation, climate and industrial controls, hydraulics, fluid connectors and automation product groups, as well as the Asia Pacific and Latin America regional groups, Parker said in a written announcement. He also oversees Parker's strategic pricing initiatives.

Williams, who holds a bachelor's of science in mechanical engineering from Bucknell University and a master's of business administration from Xavier University, is on the board of directors for Chart Industries, an independent global manufacturer of highly engineered equipment. 
"I am honored and excited to accept this new role as Chief Executive Officer of Parker and will focus on continuing to build on its strong foundation, momentum, customer focus and innovative mindset," he said. "Our goal will be to continue driving significant operational improvements, profitable growth and product and service innovations for our customers."
"Parker has been at the forefront of technological advances for nearly a century, and it is our vision to stay on the front line of innovation for the next 100 years," he added.

Banks, 51, an operational officer at Parker since 2006, has had leadership roles in the filtration, engineered materials, instrumentation, climate and industrial controls, hydraulics, fluid connectors and automation product groups, and the Europe, Middle East and Afria, and Latin America regional groups. 
He joined Parker in 1981 and was previously president of Parker's Hydraulics and Instrumentation product groups and vice president of operations in the Climate and Industrial Controls group.
Banks serves on the board of Nordson Corp., a precision dispensing equipment company for industrial coatings. He holds a bachelor of arts in economics from DePauw University and a master of business administration from the Keller Graduate School of Management in Chicago.
"I look forward to leading Parker's global operations and to representing shareholders on the board," he said.
Robert J. Kohlhepp, lead director, said in a written announcement that Parker's board has spent years focused on leadership succession. "This robust process has given us the benefit of evaluating the performance, qualifications and cultural fit of Tom and Lee for some time now, comparing and benchmarking them against a number of alternatives. We are confident that both Tom and Lee are the right leaders to continue the legacy of strong performance improvement at Parker."

This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 
Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.
What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.
