Outlook & Commentary



 Mid-Year Outlook: Be More Selective in the Second Half 


After a strong first half to 2017 for equities, the message for the remainder of the year is to look for returns more carefully in the second half. The “country factor” will be key: Investors can no longer rely on a rising tide of cyclical data to lift all boats.

Although some view robo-advice as a passing trend, it has the potential to help investors and advisors alike, according to two new Grassroots Research surveys. Some advisors are even using the technology to manage smaller accounts more efficiently, which could bring more investors into the advice realm.

In a clear signal from voters who feel left behind by globalization, populist political parties have been gaining ground around the world. This could create serious long-term headwinds for economies and markets, including lower growth and higher inflation.

5 Reasons to Expect Higher Oil Prices

Despite a recent bout with plunging prices, we believe the oil market should grind higher thanks to solid global demand, renewed supply constraints and still-significant underinvestment. This builds a clear case for investing in the energy sector, both for income and for capital return.
