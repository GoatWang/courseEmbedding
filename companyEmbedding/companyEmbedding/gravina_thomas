Clients We Work With























 






Company Profile


Association Resource Group is an award-winning technology consulting and brokerage firm with over 25 years as an industry-leader. 



Testimonial

We have been Evolve DaaS clients for just about 2 years. What execs really need to know is how much productivity DaaS brings to an organization. We have estimated that each employee saves 10 minutes a day in startup and shutdown time. Probably another 5 minutes a day in work from home productivity - i.e. more likely to log in from their home PC than if they had to carry a laptop home every night and no clunky VPN or Citrix session to dissuade them from getting on.
So, 15 minutes a day, that is 3% of their day back. 3% of an $80,000 a year employee is $2,500. 
DaaS has a 300% return, with no capital at risk. That is what I would tell your execs. Feel free to ask questions.
Best!
Steve Murphey, Vice President

Clients We Work With























 






Company Profile


Association Resource Group is an award-winning technology consulting and brokerage firm with over 25 years as an industry-leader. 



Testimonial

We have been Evolve DaaS clients for just about 2 years. What execs really need to know is how much productivity DaaS brings to an organization. We have estimated that each employee saves 10 minutes a day in startup and shutdown time. Probably another 5 minutes a day in work from home productivity - i.e. more likely to log in from their home PC than if they had to carry a laptop home every night and no clunky VPN or Citrix session to dissuade them from getting on.
So, 15 minutes a day, that is 3% of their day back. 3% of an $80,000 a year employee is $2,500. 
DaaS has a 300% return, with no capital at risk. That is what I would tell your execs. Feel free to ask questions.
Best!
Steve Murphey, Vice President

He handled my divorce quickly, my deed transfer solely into my name, Child Support hearing, PFA against my ex bf, PFA my children's father put against me between me and our children, and most importantly Eric was there for me to help our family get justice for my deceased son. I was very touched how Eric did so much for me, and cared about my circumstances. He did many extra things to help me that I cannot place a monetary value on.     When I needed an attorney I was very lucky to be introduced to Eric Jackson Lurie Esq. by my friend (who also had an excellent experience with Eric winning his case for him in court).  I recently retained Eric for a PFA that was put against me by my ex; between me & my children (who I've had custody of for 3 yrs. & still do). It was false allegations, but Eric took the time to explain to me the process of what could happen and I knew he could help me.         I felt like Eric genuinely cared about me, and he went above and beyond helping me. He thoroughly explained his agreement of his duties, and the details when I retained him before I signed the contract and paid. He asked me if I had any questions about everything he spoke with me about, and he made me feel welcomed to call him if I had any other questions that I thought of after I left his office.        I had heard how well he was in court, but that did not prepare me enough for what an excellent job he actually did in court ! When it was court day I felt confident in Eric that he was going to do a good job, and I was able to be at ease. Eric did talk to me prior to court day to explain the different possibilities of the outcomes, and I valued his honesty. I was amazed at how well he cross examined opposing counsel ! We won in court! With the allegations that were against me I knew if I didn't have Eric I may not have had the same outcome. Eric met with me on a Saturday (even though it was the weekend before Christmas Eve) to give me a copy of the order to dismiss so I could get my kids back in time to enjoy the holidays with them.      I would highly recommend Eric Jackson Lurie Esq. to anyone in need of an attorney, and have already recommended him to people. Eric helped me with many things, and I value his knowledge in criminal law.Lisa Marie Vari & Assoc PCtaraj36 ratedI retained Jill's services for a child custody matter, and had consulted with her twice before that date. I must say that I am extremely pleased with her services! Even though I am certain that she is very busy, she has always made me feel like my case was a priority for her. She has always taken the time to explain every step in the process and has shown an exemplary ability to formulate a plan and execute it. When she tells me that she is going to do something, I do not wonder if it will get done. Jill does what she says she will do, when she says she will do it. This type of reliability is hard to find these days. Jill takes copious notes and has a fantastic memory; her attention to detail is second to none! American Wills & EstatesCindy C. ratedI made an appointment to have a Will drawn up for my personal and business assets. I was quoted a price on the phone and he didn't try to add extra charges onto my bill . Lloyd set an appointment with me and worked on the Will. He made many suggestions and corrections that helped me prepare my Will. He also prepared my Power of Attorney and my Living will. I was in and out of his office within 2 hours and I had my Will in hand. I am always skeptical about Lawyers trying to talk me into something that I do not need to have. Lloyd was up front and honest. I will continue to use his practice.Cindy CohenLisa Marie Vari & Assoc PCanthony43211 ratedWithin 5 minutes of meeting Jill Rosenthal I felt a sense of calm in very turbulent times.  For the record, I have gone through 3 other family law firms and did not feel comfortable with them and Jill made the decision easy.  You see, my children are my life.  Jill has been incredibly responsive, genuinely caring, very knowledgeable and I have grown to trust her experience and guidance.  She is one of the good people out there and I do not say that lightly. She is excellent at what she does. And as an Italian (me) who needs to communicate, she has been more than responsive to my needs.  Flaherty Fardo, LLCFrancisco C. ratedI felt in very good hands from the start when I had to appeal my property tax reassessment by the school district. The service I received was impecable from start to finish in terms of knowledge, responsibility, timeliness and communication. The cost for their service was quite reasonable. And in the end a reasonable agreement was reached with the school district. I would certainly go back to them if I ever need legal help in the future. I am convinced the best option is always to go with professionals of their caliber. Thank you to Nicole Hauptman and the entire Team.Flaherty Fardo, LLCMicha P. ratedAfter my auto accident, I did not feel the hassle of dealing with the legal system would be worth it. I felt it would be too much work for too little results. After meeting with Attorney Fardo, he walked me through the steps. Attorney Fardo simplified the process and his team owned the steps.   Throughout the lawsuit, his team kept me informed and showed me great compassion.  It took very little effort on my part. The settlement was more than I had anticipated.  I would highly recommend Flaherty & Fardo. They maximized outcome while simplifying the process. Eric Jackson Lurie Esquirechoby.siau rated Eric Jackson Lurie has been my personal attorney for over 3 years. I have nothing but good to say of him. He was recommended to me for my case from a family friend (who is also in law). Never regretted going through him. He is very knowledgeable and is in good standing with the court and with law enforcement. He won a very difficult case that I committed 11yrs ago, and I thought I would live with it the rest of my life. But after battling in the court with him as my representative we won! Definitely recommendable, and would go through him again!Lisa Marie Vari & Assoc PCmike199577 ratedLisa Vari is one of the most tenacious lawyers I have ever met.  I am a dad with shared custody of my two children.  I went six years thru family division fighting desperately to have the ability to create a normal life for my children.  Lisa took my case and showed them what I was doing for my children and how my ex did nothing.  She got my oblilgation reduced to less than 200 a month allowing me to keep our home so my children wouldn't be raised in two apartments and have a real home.  Lisa fought for us as though we were her own family.Flaherty Fardo, LLCcharles.w.appel ratedThe folks at Flaherty Fardo, L...The folks at Flaherty Fardo, LLC, are very responsive to clients...I was extremely pleased with their communication skills keeping me informed in the progress of my property tax assessment appeal. They obviously knew this area of law extremely well because they told me at the beginning what to expect which pleased me a lot; then by the end of the process, I got what they had predicted.In addition, they are very cooperative and care a great deal about the work they do and their clients.I'd hire them again in an instant.Flaherty Fardo, LLCpitt717 ratedExceptionally Thorough"I used Flaherty Fardo, LLC for my personal injury case, and I couldn't have been happier with the effort they put into my case. Mr. Fardo and the rest of the firm were very easy to work with and exceptionally thorough. They were diligent in following up with me on all matters and keeping me informed. Not only were they professional, but they were especially considerate for my personal well-being as well. I felt they had my best interests at heart. I would absolutely recommend Flaherty Fardo, LLC to anyone.”Did You Know?Types of AttorneysThe legal profession is vast, with each attorney having his or her specialties. Here are some of the most common attorneys individuals seek out when they require legal aid:Criminal Lawyer
A criminal defense lawyer is probably the attorney the average person imagines. Criminal attorneys are the men and women who defend individuals accused of a crime. The lawyer may work pro bono - for the public good - so the accused is certain to have representation, even if he or she cannot afford an attorney.Criminal lawyers are experts in the criminal justice system. They help their clients decide how to plead when first charged by the police and guide them through trial procedures. Defense lawyers must use every bit of their knowledge and resources to get their clients the fairest results from criminal proceedings.Business Lawyer
If you are a small business owner or the head of a larger corporation, you may come into contact with a business lawyer. Many big companies keep a legal staff on payroll to deal with the daily operations of running and maintaining a large enterprise. Business lawyers may have more specific specialties like copyright law, product liability and mergers and acquisitions.Business attorneys may focus their practices on certain industries. There are entertainment lawyers to guide artists through royalties and media contracts, while hospitals employ malpractice attorneys to protect doctors from aggressive litigation.Employment Lawyer
When you work for a company, you may find yourself in need of an employment lawyer - especially if the relationship between you and your employer sours. An employment attorney prevents people from losing their jobs due to unfair reasons. Workers' compensation lawyers help maintain safe employment conditions and ensure workers receive fair compensation after workplace injury or discrimination.Finance Lawyer
A personal finance attorney can protect and manage your investments and securities. You may use a finance lawyer to help you prepare your taxes, but you might be better off working with an accountant. A tax attorney is more commonly contacted after a business or individual runs into trouble with the IRS or state regulators.Real Estate Lawyer
Your family may keep a lawyer on retainer to guide you through the major expenses that come up in life. When buying a home, you could work with a real estate lawyer to make sure you get the best deal and won't get taken advantage of by tricky mortgage agreements or unfair landlords. An estate attorney can help you plan for the worst by creating a will and preparing your finances for after your death.Bankruptcy Lawyer
A bankruptcy lawyer is essential to help you resolve your financial difficulties when they start to spin out of control. Certain attorneys help create strategies to bring you out of debt and speak to your creditors. A lawyer can advise you on which type of bankruptcy you should file for.Civil Lawyer
If you are suing someone or being sued, you need a civil lawyer. Civil attorneys - and criminal lawyers - are the legal representatives who argue on your behalf in a courtroom setting. Civil lawyers may represent you on matters of business, finance or a wide variety of other specialized needs.One of the most common types of civil attorneys is a personal injury lawyer. When you're hurt by an outside party and you would like to hold them legally responsible, a personal injury attorney conducts litigation and negotiates settlements to compensate for your pain and suffering. Sometimes many wronged people will join together with a single civil lawyer or law office to form a class action lawsuit.Family/Divorce Lawyer
Most people will turn to a lawyer during a divorce to navigate the emotionally charged legal proceedings. A divorce attorney can assist in determining grounds for separation, division of property and custody of children.Family attorneys deal with much more personal matters. If you're getting married, a family lawyer can help you prepare a prenuptial agreement or other family planning paperwork such as adoption or inheritance documents.Questions One Should Ask a Lawyer Before Hiring ThemTo ensure you find a competent attorney who won't abuse your trust or drain your finances, you have to make the proper inquiries. There are several questions you should ask, but the majority will fall under three general topics:Training and Experience Questions
One of the best ways to determine quality is to examine an attorney's history. When you first step into a lawyer's office, you should check for the appropriate certifications and diplomas. You have to ask how long he or she has practiced law and request information that demonstrates the practice's success. Look for precise details such as percentage of cases settled out of court.Once you inquire about the broad details of their legal career, you should ask questions about their experience that pertains to your specific issue. You should ask how many similar cases they have handled and if they have special skills or training that applies specifically to your needs. Lawyers can't mention clients by name, but you should ask for basic details about identical past cases.Financial Questions
You need to ask about every possible fee that will come up when working with an attorney. You should request a list of all costs in advance so you won't be surprised by additional expenses like overhead. Also determine exactly when you will start being billed. You want to inspect paperwork carefully. If the attorney charges you for his or her experience, you need to make sure he or she will perform tasks personally and not hand it off to an assistant.Find out if the attorney has a flat fee or charges by the hour. Many civil lawyers work on contingency. Whatever the payment plan, make inquiries about how the lawyer plans to provide service for your money and what you can do if you start to feel unsatisfied with his or her performance.Lawyer/Client Relationship Questions
When you hire a lawyer, you're agreeing to work with someone over a certain period of time. You need to ask questions about how the attorney will communicate with you and what responsibilities you hold in the relationship. The attorney should let you know the best channel for quick communication and you need to inform him or her when you want updates.You should also ask questions to get to know the attorney as an individual in order to ensure this is a person you can trust. Ask about their legal philosophy and how he or she views the lawyer/client relationship. Great questions to start off with are ones that will make your life easier, such as how to keep fees down or what daily disruptions you should expect from a long legal battle. The more forthcoming the lawyer appears to be with individual needs, the better.Top Reasons to Hire a LawyerYou may keep a lawyer on retainer or you could turn to an attorney during specific situations. Here are some common reasons people begin seeking legal representation or advice:You Know Your Limitations
If you sign documents and you come across a word you don't recognize, you need assistance. You may need a third party to help you navigate important employment or real estate paperwork. It's essential you fully understand the terms of any legally binding documentation or activity you become a part of. If you are not an expert in a given field, you'll want to hire an attorney who is.A lawyer may find legal implications or opportunities you might miss. If you find yourself in a civil or criminal matter, a proper attorney ensures you don't receive a harsh punishment for a small mistake.You're Facing an Important Event/Decision
When making decisions critical to your financial stability or personal life, you may want a lawyer with expertise in your situation to make sure you do everything you can to arrive at the proper resolution. This is especially true when you become involved in a criminal case and your freedom is on the line.It's not just a matter of legal knowledge; lawyer's have access to numerous resources you do not. They have staff ready to work around the clock and experts in a variety of fields to give your important issues the attention they deserve.You Can't Be Impartial
During times when personal matters intersect with legal proceedings, you may need to have an advocate to prevent your emotions from getting in the way of level-headed thinking. For example, divorce lawyers can mediate a heated argument and help both partners get on with their lives.Emotional investment could be subtle. You may want to have a lawyer look over an investment opportunity that looks too good to be true or investigate the merits of a possible civil suit when you feel wronged.You're Out of Options
Many people turn to lawyers when they are in trouble. If you've been accused of a crime or are in a terrible financial situation, you can find an attorney who will work with what you have available to assist you as you deal with your problems.Personal injury lawyers find solutions for people who can no longer work under their own power and bankruptcy attorneys prevent people from giving in to debt. If you find yourself in a situation where you can't find a solution, a lawyer may be able to offer the counsel you need.How to Choose a LawyerWhen it comes time to choose a lawyer, you should start by searching close to home. While you probably don't want the conflict of interest that comes from being represented by a family member, friends and loved ones can recommend lawyers who served them well in the past. If you do have attorneys you are familiar with, ask who they believe would be best for you.After going through personal references - especially from individuals who had similar needs - you should broaden your search through public information resources. You can call your area's attorney referral service or check legal organizations like Martindale-Hubbell. There are other resources available online. You should check websites for client reviews and other third-party forms of approval.When you build a list of possible candidates, perform a background check on each one. See if you can find information on their history and success record. Once you find a possible lawyer, you should call to arrange a consultation so you can ask your important questions in person.By performing the necessary research and taking every available precaution, you can narrow your search to the attorney most suited to your needs.
