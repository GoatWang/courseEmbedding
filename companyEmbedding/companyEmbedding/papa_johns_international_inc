Unsolicited Ideas
Thank you for your interest to share an idea for a product or service that you believe would be beneficial to Papa John's. Please know, however, that it is Papa John's company policy not to consider unsolicited ideas from anyone other than our
            corporate employees, franchise owners/employees, and our supply partners.
It's not that great ideas cannot come from our valued customers. Each year, however, Papa John's receives thousands of unsolicited ideas for products and services. Due to the mass volume of these unsolicited ideas and the business challenge
            of determining what is truly a "new" idea versus a concept that we already have in development, being tested, or previously considered, we must adhere to our strict policy not to accept or review any unsolicited ideas that come from outside
            our system.
To speak to our Customer Care Team, call us at 877-547-PAPA (877-547-7272).

					Full Description



Papa John's International, Inc. (Papa John's), incorporated on July 25, 1991, operates and franchises pizza delivery and carryout restaurants and, in certain international markets, dine-in and delivery restaurants under the trademark Papa John's. The Company operates through five segments: domestic Company-owned restaurants, North America commissaries, North America franchising, international operations and all other business units. North America is defined as the United States and Canada. Domestic is defined as the contiguous United States. International franchisees are defined as all franchise operations outside of the United States and Canada.As of December 25, 2016, there were 5,097 Papa John's restaurants in operation, consisting of 744 Company-owned and 4,353 franchised restaurants operating domestically in all 50 states and in 45 countries and territories. As of December 25, 2016, the Company-owned restaurants included 222 restaurants operated under five joint venture arrangements, and 42 units in Beijing and North China. The Company offers pizza along with side items, including breadsticks, cheesesticks, chicken poppers and wings, dessert items and canned or bottled beverages. Papa John's traditional crust pizza is prepared using dough (never frozen). Papa John's pizzas are made from a blend of wheat flour, cheese made from mozzarella, pizza sauce made from vine-ripened tomatoes (not from concentrate) and a mix of savory spices, and a choice of meat and vegetable toppings. Its traditional crust pizza is delivered with a container of its special garlic sauce and a pepperoncini pepper.The domestic Company-owned restaurant segment consists of the operations of all domestic Company-owned restaurants, and includes retail sales of pizza and side items. The North America commissary segment consists of the operations of its regional dough production and product distribution centers, and includes sale and distribution of food and paper products to domestic Company-owned and franchised restaurants in the United States and Canada. The North America franchising segment consists of its franchise sales and support activities, and is engaged in sales of franchise and development rights, and collection of royalties from its franchisees located in the United States and Canada. The international operations segment principally consists of its Company-owned restaurants in China and distribution sales to franchised Papa John's restaurants located in the United Kingdom, Mexico and China, and its franchise sales and support activities, including sales of franchise and development rights and the collection of royalties from its international franchisees.As of December 25, 2016, the Company's North American QC Center system comprised 10 full-service regional production and distribution centers in the United States, which supply pizza sauce and dough, food products, paper products, smallwares and cleaning supplies twice weekly to each traditional restaurant it serves. It has a QC Center in Canada, which produces and distributes dough. It owns international QC Centers in Milton Keynes, the United Kingdom, Mexico City, Mexico, and Beijing, China. Its other international QC Centers are licensed to franchisees or non-franchisee third parties and are generally located in the markets where the Company's franchisees have restaurants.Within its North American QC Center system, products are primarily distributed to restaurants by leased refrigerated trucks operated by the Company. The Company's local restaurant-level marketing programs target consumers within the delivery area of each restaurant. The Company provides both Company-owned and franchised restaurants with pre-approved marketing materials and catalogs for the purchase of promotional items. It also provides direct marketing services to Company-owned and franchised restaurants using customer information gathered by its point-of-sale technology. In addition, the Company provides database tools, templates and training for operators to facilitate local e-mail marketing and text messaging through its approved tools. The Company's digital ordering platform allows customers to order online. The Company's domestic restaurants offer customers the opportunity to purchase a reloadable gift card, sold as either a plastic gift card purchased in its restaurants, or an online digital card. It sells Papa Cards to consumers on its Website and through third-party retailers. The Company also sells cards in bulk to business entities and organizations.

BBB Reason for Ratings

BBB Reports On









Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration. Better Business Bureau encourages you to check with the appropriate agency to be certain any requirements are currently being met.
                    





Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.
                    





Government Actions









                        BBB reports on known significant government actions involving the business's marketplace conduct.
                    





Out of Business









                        BBB reports on a company that is out of business for three years from the date the company closes its doors or ceases to do business.
                    





Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.
                    





Bankruptcy









                        BBB reports on a business’s bankruptcy as long as the business remains in bankruptcy.
                    





Mail Returned









                        BBB reports when mail sent to the business was returned by the Postal Service.

                        Papa John's International, Inc. has received 3.8 out of 5 stars based on 11 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of A+.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

How We Make Better Pizza | Papa John's Pizza






















Skip to main content











Our Pizza
Better Ingredients. Better Pizza.













Watch the story behind our better ingredients




Better Ingredients. Always Had Them. Always Will.

In 1984, Papa John's opened its doors with one goal in mind: Better Pizza. We knew that with better ingredients we would create better pizzas. That goal and the promise of "Better ingredients. Better pizza." remain true to this day.
Our fundamental belief is simple: take care of your people and give them the best to work with and you will make superior quality pizza. This is what drives us and it's why we invest more than many others in the industry in our effort to consistently deliver superior pizza and superior service.
The more you know about our ingredients, the more informed your pizza choices will be. If you have any ingredients questions, watch our video and check out our detailed ingredients statement to get the answers.
Click the icons below to learn more about our Better Ingredients.





More

Fresh-Cut Veggies
We go the extra mile to ensure our vegetables are always ripe and fresh so they're full of flavor. Our green peppers and onions are sliced fresh in our restaurants, making them crisp and flavorful. Our Italian-variety Crimini mushrooms are golden brown and known all over the world for their distinctive flavor and hearty texture.
Close



More

Garlic Sauce
Our special recipe garlic dipping sauce is a signature blend of oil and spices that perfectly complements your favorite Papa John's Pizza or breadsticks.
Close



More

Our Signature Sauce
Our vine-ripened tomatoes are carefully grown on farms in the rich, fertile central valley of California and are freshly packed from vine to can in about six hours. The recipe is a simple blend of tomatoes, extra virgin olive oil, sunflower oil, salt, sugar, and a proprietary blend of spices.
Close



More

Real Meat
We use only authentic, superior-quality meats on our pizzas. Our pepperoni, sausage, and Italian sausage are all made from real beef, pork, have no fillers and are blended with spices for distinctive flavor.
Close



More

Fresh Made Dough
Dough lays the groundwork for our pizza, and our vision. So we make sure our dough is the best foundation for our better ingredients. Our hand-tossed original dough is made at our Quality Control Centers and delivered fresh, never frozen, to our restaurants. Our recipe features a unique blend of seven simple ingredients: unbleached and enriched high-protein flour, purified water, sugar, soybean oil, salt, yeast and extra virgin olive oil.
