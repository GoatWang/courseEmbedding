History[edit]
1981 to 2000[edit]
The Company was founded by David Goldman, Paul Muller and Graham Wylie in 1981 in Newcastle, to develop estimating and accounting software for small businesses.[5]
A student at Newcastle University, Graham Wylie, took a summer job with an accountancy firm funded by a government small business grant to write software to help their record keeping. This became the basis for Sage Line 50. Next, hired by David Goldman to write some estimating software for his printing company, Campbell Graphics, Graham used the same accounting software to produce the first version of Sage Accounts. David was so impressed that he hired Graham and academic Paul Muller to form Sage, selling their software first to printing companies, and then to a wider market through a network of resellers.[6]
In 1984 the Company launched Sage software, a product for the Amstrad PCW word processor,[5] which used the CP/M operating system. Sage software sales escalated in that year from 30 copies a month to over 300.[5] The Company was first listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1989.[5]
In 1994 Paul Walker was appointed Chief Executive. In 1998 Sage's Professional Accountants Division was established. In 1999 Sage entered FTSE 100[5] and launched a dedicated Irish division, based in Dublin as well as its e-business strategy. In that same year the UK acquisition of Tetra saw Sage enter the mid-range business software market.[7][8]
2000 to 2010[edit]




The Sage Gateshead music venue, located on the banks of the River Tyne, is named after the company.


In 2000 Sage shares were named 'best performing share of the 90s' in the UK business press.[9] In 2001 Sage acquired Interact Commerce Inc.[10] and entered the CRM/contact management market and in 2002 Sage won 'Business of The Year' in National Business Awards.[11] Also that year Sage sponsored the new Music Centre in Gateshead for £6m - now known as The Sage Gateshead - the largest ever UK arts/business sponsorship.[12] Sage are one of two technology stocks listed on the FTSE 100 Index.[13] In 2003 at age 43 Graham Wylie retired with 108.5 million shares in Sage worth £146m. He was rated Britain's 109th richest person in the 2002 Sunday Times' rich list.[6]
Tony Hobson joined the Sage board of directors in June 2004 and became chairman in May 2007.[14]
2010 to present[edit]
On 19 April 2010, Sage announced that its CEO, Paul Walker, had indicated an interest in stepping down from his position, which he had held for 16 years.[15] The Financial Times reported that his departure would lead to speculation over Sage's mergers and acquisitions, which have been a key component to the group's growth in the past 20 years. In an interview with The Times, the CEO of Sage's UK business stated that: "Acquisitions are part of our DNA".[16]
Walker was one of the longest serving CEOs of a FTSE100 company, only exceeded by Sir Martin Sorrell at WPP and Tullow Oil's Aidan Heavey.[17] According to the Daily Mail, Walker is likely to have left Sage with as much as £21 million given his shares, bonus plan and salary.[18] Walker left the company on 1 December 2010.[19]
On 1 October 2010 Guy Berruyer became CEO of Sage Group; Berruyer had previously been CEO of Sage's Mainland Europe & Asia operations.[19]
On 15 February 2013, Sage announced that Accel-KKR intended to buy Sage Nonprofit Solutions, the division of Sage that produces software designed for nonprofit organisations and governmental agencies.[20]
In August 2014, Sage announced that Guy Berruyer was to retire; Stephen Kelly, the UK government’s former chief operating officer, became Group CEO in November 2014.[21]
In July 2017, Sage announced that it would purchase Intacct for $850M.[22]
Operations[edit]
Founded and headquartered in Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom, the company initially grew organically, but more recently has grown primarily through acquisitions. In 2004 the company's new headquarters was completed in the Great Park area of Newcastle upon Tyne; the company was previously located at Benton Park House. It now operates worldwide.

History[edit]
1981 to 2000[edit]
The Company was founded by David Goldman, Paul Muller and Graham Wylie in 1981 in Newcastle, to develop estimating and accounting software for small businesses.[5]
A student at Newcastle University, Graham Wylie, took a summer job with an accountancy firm funded by a government small business grant to write software to help their record keeping. This became the basis for Sage Line 50. Next, hired by David Goldman to write some estimating software for his printing company, Campbell Graphics, Graham used the same accounting software to produce the first version of Sage Accounts. David was so impressed that he hired Graham and academic Paul Muller to form Sage, selling their software first to printing companies, and then to a wider market through a network of resellers.[6]
In 1984 the Company launched Sage software, a product for the Amstrad PCW word processor,[5] which used the CP/M operating system. Sage software sales escalated in that year from 30 copies a month to over 300.[5] The Company was first listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1989.[5]
In 1994 Paul Walker was appointed Chief Executive. In 1998 Sage's Professional Accountants Division was established. In 1999 Sage entered FTSE 100[5] and launched a dedicated Irish division, based in Dublin as well as its e-business strategy. In that same year the UK acquisition of Tetra saw Sage enter the mid-range business software market.[7][8]
2000 to 2010[edit]




The Sage Gateshead music venue, located on the banks of the River Tyne, is named after the company.


In 2000 Sage shares were named 'best performing share of the 90s' in the UK business press.[9] In 2001 Sage acquired Interact Commerce Inc.[10] and entered the CRM/contact management market and in 2002 Sage won 'Business of The Year' in National Business Awards.[11] Also that year Sage sponsored the new Music Centre in Gateshead for £6m - now known as The Sage Gateshead - the largest ever UK arts/business sponsorship.[12] Sage are one of two technology stocks listed on the FTSE 100 Index.[13] In 2003 at age 43 Graham Wylie retired with 108.5 million shares in Sage worth £146m. He was rated Britain's 109th richest person in the 2002 Sunday Times' rich list.[6]
Tony Hobson joined the Sage board of directors in June 2004 and became chairman in May 2007.[14]
2010 to present[edit]
On 19 April 2010, Sage announced that its CEO, Paul Walker, had indicated an interest in stepping down from his position, which he had held for 16 years.[15] The Financial Times reported that his departure would lead to speculation over Sage's mergers and acquisitions, which have been a key component to the group's growth in the past 20 years. In an interview with The Times, the CEO of Sage's UK business stated that: "Acquisitions are part of our DNA".[16]
Walker was one of the longest serving CEOs of a FTSE100 company, only exceeded by Sir Martin Sorrell at WPP and Tullow Oil's Aidan Heavey.[17] According to the Daily Mail, Walker is likely to have left Sage with as much as £21 million given his shares, bonus plan and salary.[18] Walker left the company on 1 December 2010.[19]
On 1 October 2010 Guy Berruyer became CEO of Sage Group; Berruyer had previously been CEO of Sage's Mainland Europe & Asia operations.[19]
On 15 February 2013, Sage announced that Accel-KKR intended to buy Sage Nonprofit Solutions, the division of Sage that produces software designed for nonprofit organisations and governmental agencies.[20]
In August 2014, Sage announced that Guy Berruyer was to retire; Stephen Kelly, the UK government’s former chief operating officer, became Group CEO in November 2014.[21]
In July 2017, Sage announced that it would purchase Intacct for $850M.[22]
Operations[edit]
Founded and headquartered in Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom, the company initially grew organically, but more recently has grown primarily through acquisitions. In 2004 the company's new headquarters was completed in the Great Park area of Newcastle upon Tyne; the company was previously located at Benton Park House. It now operates worldwide. The company's US headquarters are in Atlanta, Georgia, the Canadian headquarters are in Richmond, British Columbia, the Africa, Middle East & Australia headquarters are in Johannesburg, South Africa and the French and Continental European headquarters are in Paris, France. Sage has 6.1 million customers and 13,400 employees across the world. Key industry focus includes: Healthcare; HR & Payroll; Construction/ Real-Estate; Transport/ Distribution; Payment Processing; Accountancy; Not-for-Profit; Manufacturing; Retail; Automotive Distribution.[23]

 60-day risk-free guarantee

There's no risk with Sage 50c. If for any reason you're not satisfied within 60 days, we'll refund your money.1
Buy Now









If within 60 days of purchase, you are not 100% convinced that Sage 50 is the best accounting program for your business, we will refund your money (less any rebate you have received from the purchase). For first-time customers only.
Minimum one-year commitment required. Valid credit card and Internet access required to activate and maintain support and services.  To ensure continuous service, your Sage Business Care plan is an automatically renewing plan, and you will be charged up to a week prior to your renewal date. The subscription plan is an annual subscription with a lease to the software license; therefore, you can only use the software while you are on the plan. You may terminate your plan with at least ten days’ notice prior to your renewal date and not be charged for the renewal; however, if you terminate your subscription plan or if your subscription payment is not received, you will have read-only access to your data, and full program functionality will not be restored until you have brought your account current. The subscription plan requires that you be on the most current version of the software to continue your subscription.
Sage Drive is only available to customers on the latest release of Sage 50c Accounting and requires a computer with Internet Explorer 10, Firefox, or Chrome and a high-speed Internet connection. Sage 50 data may be accessed from more than one device at a time by one individual each, however only one has full access while the others have read only access, and there are limits as to the amount of data that can be accessed. Data access is subject to Internet provider network availability and occasional downtime due to system and server maintenance.

History[edit]
1981 to 2000[edit]
The Company was founded by David Goldman, Paul Muller and Graham Wylie in 1981 in Newcastle, to develop estimating and accounting software for small businesses.[5]
A student at Newcastle University, Graham Wylie, took a summer job with an accountancy firm funded by a government small business grant to write software to help their record keeping. This became the basis for Sage Line 50. Next, hired by David Goldman to write some estimating software for his printing company, Campbell Graphics, Graham used the same accounting software to produce the first version of Sage Accounts. David was so impressed that he hired Graham and academic Paul Muller to form Sage, selling their software first to printing companies, and then to a wider market through a network of resellers.[6]
In 1984 the Company launched Sage software, a product for the Amstrad PCW word processor,[5] which used the CP/M operating system. Sage software sales escalated in that year from 30 copies a month to over 300.[5] The Company was first listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1989.[5]
In 1994 Paul Walker was appointed Chief Executive. In 1998 Sage's Professional Accountants Division was established. In 1999 Sage entered FTSE 100[5] and launched a dedicated Irish division, based in Dublin as well as its e-business strategy. In that same year the UK acquisition of Tetra saw Sage enter the mid-range business software market.[7][8]
2000 to 2010[edit]




The Sage Gateshead music venue, located on the banks of the River Tyne, is named after the company.


In 2000 Sage shares were named 'best performing share of the 90s' in the UK business press.[9] In 2001 Sage acquired Interact Commerce Inc.[10] and entered the CRM/contact management market and in 2002 Sage won 'Business of The Year' in National Business Awards.[11] Also that year Sage sponsored the new Music Centre in Gateshead for £6m - now known as The Sage Gateshead - the largest ever UK arts/business sponsorship.[12] Sage are one of two technology stocks listed on the FTSE 100 Index.[13] In 2003 at age 43 Graham Wylie retired with 108.5 million shares in Sage worth £146m. He was rated Britain's 109th richest person in the 2002 Sunday Times' rich list.[6]
Tony Hobson joined the Sage board of directors in June 2004 and became chairman in May 2007.[14]
2010 to present[edit]
On 19 April 2010, Sage announced that its CEO, Paul Walker, had indicated an interest in stepping down from his position, which he had held for 16 years.[15] The Financial Times reported that his departure would lead to speculation over Sage's mergers and acquisitions, which have been a key component to the group's growth in the past 20 years. In an interview with The Times, the CEO of Sage's UK business stated that: "Acquisitions are part of our DNA".[16]
Walker was one of the longest serving CEOs of a FTSE100 company, only exceeded by Sir Martin Sorrell at WPP and Tullow Oil's Aidan Heavey.[17] According to the Daily Mail, Walker is likely to have left Sage with as much as £21 million given his shares, bonus plan and salary.[18] Walker left the company on 1 December 2010.[19]
On 1 October 2010 Guy Berruyer became CEO of Sage Group; Berruyer had previously been CEO of Sage's Mainland Europe & Asia operations.[19]
On 15 February 2013, Sage announced that Accel-KKR intended to buy Sage Nonprofit Solutions, the division of Sage that produces software designed for nonprofit organisations and governmental agencies.[20]
In August 2014, Sage announced that Guy Berruyer was to retire; Stephen Kelly, the UK government’s former chief operating officer, became Group CEO in November 2014.[21]
In July 2017, Sage announced that it would purchase Intacct for $850M.[22]
Operations[edit]
Founded and headquartered in Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom, the company initially grew organically, but more recently has grown primarily through acquisitions. In 2004 the company's new headquarters was completed in the Great Park area of Newcastle upon Tyne; the company was previously located at Benton Park House. It now operates worldwide. The company's US headquarters are in Atlanta, Georgia, the Canadian headquarters are in Richmond, British Columbia, the Africa, Middle East & Australia headquarters are in Johannesburg, South Africa and the French and Continental European headquarters are in Paris, France. Sage has 6.1 million customers and 13,400 employees across the world.

History[edit]
1981 to 2000[edit]
The Company was founded by David Goldman, Paul Muller and Graham Wylie in 1981 in Newcastle, to develop estimating and accounting software for small businesses.[5]
A student at Newcastle University, Graham Wylie, took a summer job with an accountancy firm funded by a government small business grant to write software to help their record keeping. This became the basis for Sage Line 50. Next, hired by David Goldman to write some estimating software for his printing company, Campbell Graphics, Graham used the same accounting software to produce the first version of Sage Accounts. David was so impressed that he hired Graham and academic Paul Muller to form Sage, selling their software first to printing companies, and then to a wider market through a network of resellers.[6]
In 1984 the Company launched Sage software, a product for the Amstrad PCW word processor,[5] which used the CP/M operating system. Sage software sales escalated in that year from 30 copies a month to over 300.[5] The Company was first listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1989.[5]
In 1994 Paul Walker was appointed Chief Executive. In 1998 Sage's Professional Accountants Division was established. In 1999 Sage entered FTSE 100[5] and launched a dedicated Irish division, based in Dublin as well as its e-business strategy. In that same year the UK acquisition of Tetra saw Sage enter the mid-range business software market.[7][8]
2000 to 2010[edit]




The Sage Gateshead music venue, located on the banks of the River Tyne, is named after the company.


In 2000 Sage shares were named 'best performing share of the 90s' in the UK business press.[9] In 2001 Sage acquired Interact Commerce Inc.[10] and entered the CRM/contact management market and in 2002 Sage won 'Business of The Year' in National Business Awards.[11] Also that year Sage sponsored the new Music Centre in Gateshead for £6m - now known as The Sage Gateshead - the largest ever UK arts/business sponsorship.[12] Sage are one of two technology stocks listed on the FTSE 100 Index.[13] In 2003 at age 43 Graham Wylie retired with 108.5 million shares in Sage worth £146m. He was rated Britain's 109th richest person in the 2002 Sunday Times' rich list.[6]
Tony Hobson joined the Sage board of directors in June 2004 and became chairman in May 2007.[14]
2010 to present[edit]
On 19 April 2010, Sage announced that its CEO, Paul Walker, had indicated an interest in stepping down from his position, which he had held for 16 years.[15] The Financial Times reported that his departure would lead to speculation over Sage's mergers and acquisitions, which have been a key component to the group's growth in the past 20 years. In an interview with The Times, the CEO of Sage's UK business stated that: "Acquisitions are part of our DNA".[16]
Walker was one of the longest serving CEOs of a FTSE100 company, only exceeded by Sir Martin Sorrell at WPP and Tullow Oil's Aidan Heavey.[17] According to the Daily Mail, Walker is likely to have left Sage with as much as £21 million given his shares, bonus plan and salary.[18] Walker left the company on 1 December 2010.[19]
On 1 October 2010 Guy Berruyer became CEO of Sage Group; Berruyer had previously been CEO of Sage's Mainland Europe & Asia operations.[19]
On 15 February 2013, Sage announced that Accel-KKR intended to buy Sage Nonprofit Solutions, the division of Sage that produces software designed for nonprofit organisations and governmental agencies.[20]
In August 2014, Sage announced that Guy Berruyer was to retire; Stephen Kelly, the UK government’s former chief operating officer, became Group CEO in November 2014.[21]
In July 2017, Sage announced that it would purchase Intacct for $850M.[22]

How Integrated ERP and CRM Can Benefit Your Business





Does your company have an effective enterprise resource planning (ERP) solution to keep up with constantly changing business trends, but it lags in responding quickly to customer needs? Or are you using a customer relationship management (CRM) application that addresses your customer needs quickly and efficiently, but your back-end office is still functioning on a dated solution?
If you answered “yes” to either of these questions, yours is like many companies that are reluctant to change, either because you want to keep costs low or you are comfortable using your current ERP or CRM solution. Watch this webcast to learn how by integrating modern ERP and CRM solutions you can gain real measurable results in a shorter timeframe.

Sage 300 ERP Customer Ratings and Reviews




 (5 out of 5 stars) 3/12/2015

New user to 300 ERP
We just switched January 1st from Sage 50 to Sage 300 ERP. The transition went smoothly with the size of our company and the number of key strokes. I look forward as we work with our partner, Information Innovators as we expand the usability of the product. We made the transition and were current in 60 days.
—Don G.











 (5 out of 5 stars) 3/12/2015

99% awesome - 1% to improve
We converted to Sage last January 2014 from an IBM based product!  Although any software conversion is work, this one went as smoothly as humanly possible and our business partners - Keystone Business Solutions were awesome! We love the flexibility to view things before printing, paperless office to save trees, ease of working between various modules due to the similarities between modules.
One small thing in payroll that has to be an oversight is related to benefit deductions. There is no way to put a beginning or ending date in a benefit. This makes it difficult at open enrollment for insurance as we are a weekly pay company, so I have one week to remove or add or make any changes to benefits for 350 people.
—CPAsinger











 (5 out of 5 stars) 3/10/2015
Great Experience

Sage has helped our team be more productive and give my company the reports, tools to gain more business.
—Elizabeth

We really like sage 300. It really helps during our analysis to be able to change what is visible on the G/L.
—Hadley

Sage 300

This is my first experience with Sage. I was on SAP before. I have found that it is very user friendly. It was easy to learn to use.
—Diana











 (4 out of 5 stars) 3/10/2015
Sage is working great for our needs, I just need to learn how to use more of it!
We really need to focus on learning how to use Sage to better fit our needs. I know we haven't even scraped the surface of what it can do for us. The support at Sage has been really helpful and I can't wait to learn more.
—Dana W.











 (4 out of 5 stars) 3/10/2015
Senior accountant
Sage 300 is good for documents controlling, vendors information and G/L reports. Need more implementation on job costing and reports by jobs.
—Ana L.











 (5 out of 5 stars) 2/6/2015
love it and my orchid
Thanks to Sage 300 ERP and our orchid software my team is more efficient and effective in our weekly processes and our periodic reporting. We have a fabulous macro that brings our weekly production and payment data seamlessly from our IBM Cognos system painlessly to Sage. We love the ao offset functionality. It again allows us to quickly and efficiently do our a/r and a/p offset process.  And finally the orchid add-on makes our EFT payment processing process absolutely painless.
Anne-Marie B.











 (4 out of 5 stars) 2/5/2015
Segment codes are invaluable
As a charity operating essentially 300 distinct departments, Sage 300 gives us the flexibility to provide the data our employees need.
Ken











 (4 out of 5 stars) 2/5/2015
I am learning it very easily
Sage is great for beginners. It has been around so long so it is very trustworthy. It is always keeping up with its competition.
Arielle B.











 (4 out of 5 stars) 2/5/2015
Works Great for most of our business needs
We are a distributor with light manufacturing and retail.  Sage 300 fits most of our needs out of the box.

				98% client retention. 100% committed to exceeding expectations.			
In 1989 David, Alan, and Stephen Cohn broke with convention and founded Sage Financial Group as an independent registered investment adviser.1
Their goal was to provide individual investors with advice they could trust. Unlike large banks and brokerage firms, Sage does not receive any commissions, and our recommendations are not mandated by a parent company. Our advice is fee only, focused on what is in each client’s best interest, and enhanced by comprehensive financial planning.
In 1994, the Cohns took a similarly bold step and founded Sage Online. Leveraging the new powers of the internet, they democratized investing when they created the largest online forum devoted to mutual funds and became the anchor tenant of AOL’s finance channel.
Today, Sage is aiming higher than before.
Our vision is to bring the advantages of a multi-family office to the individual high-net-worth investor without additional cost.
So we are building out a suite of integrated wealth management services focused on what our clients consider the most important areas of their financial lives: investment strategy, financial planning, trusts and estates, tax services, cash flow, surviving spouse support, and insurance planning.
Our clients gain:

Time
Efficiency
Simplification
Coordination
Cost Savings
Peace of mind

Our advice remains fee only based on assets under management.






				It’s personal.			
The approach we take for each client is highly personal, because no two clients have the same goals or circumstances.
It is also rigorous and thorough.

Our team of experienced professionals can advise clients in exactly the way each one needs to be advised.
We are able to finish the work in house, saving our clients time and money.
Our focused expertise and regular communications provide our clients with original insight that keeps them well-informed and prepared to succeed.
