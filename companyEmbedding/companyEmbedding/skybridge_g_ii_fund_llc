 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
The Board of Directors and Shareholders 
SkyBridge G II Fund, LLC  We have audited the
accompanying statement of assets and liabilities (in organization) of SkyBridge G II Fund, LLC (the Company) as of March 31, 2013, and the related statements of operations (in organization) and cash flows (in organization) for the year then
ended, and the statements of changes in net assets (in organization) for the year then ended and the period from September 28, 2011 to March 31, 2012. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.  We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements and financial highlights are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.  In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of SkyBridge G II Fund, LLC as of March 31, 2013, the results of its
operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, and the changes in its net assets for the year then ended and the period from September 28, 2011 to March 31, 2012, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

SkyBridge G II Fund, LLC 
Notes to Financial Statements  (In Organization)  March 31, 2013 
   


1.
Organization  SkyBridge G
II Fund, LLC (the Company) was organized as a Delaware Limited Liability Company on May 9, 2011. The Company is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the 1940 Act) as amended, as a closed-end,
non-diversified management investment company. The Company is also registered under the Securities Act of 1933 (the 1933 Act).  The investment objective of the Company will be to achieve capital appreciation principally through investing in investment funds (Investment Funds) managed by third-party investment managers
(Investment Managers) that employ a variety of alternative investment strategies. These investment strategies allow Investment Managers the flexibility to use leverage or short-side positions to take advantage of perceived inefficiencies
across the global markets, often referred to as alternative strategies. Because Investment Funds following alternative investment strategies are often described as hedge funds, the investment program of the Company can be described as a
fund of hedge funds.  Shares of the Company (Shares) will be sold to eligible investors (referred to as
Shareholders). The minimum initial investment in the Company from each Shareholder will be $25,000; the minimum additional investment will be $10,000. The Company is authorized to issue an unlimited number of Shares, all at $0.00001 par
value per Share.  SkyBridge Capital II, LLC (the Adviser), a Delaware limited liability company, serves as the
Companys investment adviser. The Adviser is registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, and, among other things, is responsible for the allocation of the Companys assets to various
Investment Funds. Under the Companys governing documents, the Company will delegate substantially all authority to oversee the management of the operations and assets of the Company to the Board of Directors. The Adviser owns all issued and
outstanding Shares of the Company.  The Company had no investment operations for the period from April 1, 2012 through
March 31, 2013, but has engaged in various activities relating to the public offering of the Shares.   


2.
Significant Accounting Policies  The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) and are expressed in United States dollars. The
following is a summary of significant accounting and reporting policies used in preparing the financial statements.

SkyBridge G II Fund, LLC 
Notes to Financial Statements (continued)  (In Organization)  March 31, 2013 
   
a. Cash and Cash Equivalents 
Cash represents cash on deposit in interest bearing accounts. Cash held at financial institutions may exceed the amount insured by the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts and does not believe it is exposed to any significant credit risk on such bank deposits. 
b. Income Taxes  The Company is a limited liability company and did not elect to be taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal, state, and local tax purposes. As a limited liability company, the Company will not incur
entity-level U.S. federal, state, and local income taxes and is not required to file its own tax return. Accordingly, no provision for federal, state, and local income taxes has been made in the accompanying financial statements, as its owner member
is liable for income taxes, if any, on the Companys income, loss, and other items, and there is no tax sharing arrangement between the Company and its owner member. Since the Company is not required to separately file its own returns, the
following is the major tax jurisdiction for the Adviser, in its capacity as the Companys parent, and the earliest tax year subject to examination: United States  2011. The Company ultimately intends to elect to be taxable as a
corporation for U.S. federal, state, and local tax purposes, and qualify as a regulated investment company under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. If so qualified, the Company will not be subject to Federal,
state, and local income tax to the extent it distributes substantially all of its net investment income and net capital gains to its shareholders.  The Company has analyzed tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing the Companys tax return for all open tax years and has concluded, as of March 31, 2013, no
provision for income tax would be required in the Companys financial statements. The Companys federal and state income and federal excise tax returns for tax years for which the applicable statutes of limitations have not expired are
subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service and state departments of revenue. The Company recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense in the Statement of Operations. During the
year ended March 31, 2013, the Company did not incur any interest or penalties.  c. Use of Estimates and
Reclassifications  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management of the Company to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets, and any other parameters used in determining these estimates could cause
actual results to differ materially.

3.
Management Fee, Related Party Transactions and Other  The Company has entered into an Investment Advisory Agreement (the Advisory Agreement) with the Adviser. The Adviser provides certain management and administrative services to the Company. The
Adviser will act primarily to evaluate and select Investment Managers, to allocate assets, to establish and apply risk management procedures, and to monitor overall investment performance. In addition, the Adviser also provides office space and
other support services. In consideration for such services, the Company will pay the Adviser a monthly management fee of 0.071% (0.85% annually) based on end of month Shareholders capital. 
In order to limit the ordinary expenses of the Company, the Adviser has agreed to waive part or all of the Management Fee (net of any
compensation paid by the Adviser or its affiliates to the Placement Agents in connection with the placement of Shares or servicing of investors), or reimburse the Company in a corresponding amount, to the extent necessary to prevent the
Companys ordinary expenses from exceeding 1.50% per annum of its average monthly net assets, excluding expenses in the underlying Investment Funds. In addition, the Company subsequently would repay the fee waiver/expense reimbursement to
the Adviser so long as the repaid amount does not cause the Company, during a year in which repayment is made, to exceed that intended maximum of 1.50% per annum ratio. There will be no repayment unless it can be made during the three years
following the fiscal year during which the Company waived the applicable fees or reimbursed the applicable expenses.  The
Adviser agreed to pay certain costs and expenses incurred in connection with organizing the Company and the initial offering shares of the Company. As of March 31, 2013, approximately $275,000 of such costs and expenses have been incurred by
the Adviser. Deferred offering costs as of March 31, 2013 include $120,000 representing underwriting fees charged to the Company by Hastings (as defined below). These deferred costs will be amortized over a period of 12 months upon commencement
of operations.  Placement agents may be retained by the Company to assist in the placement of the Companys Shares. A
placement agent will generally be entitled to receive a fee from each investor in the Company whos Shares the agent places. The specific amount of the placement fee paid with respect to a Shareholder is generally dependent on the size of the
investment in the Company.  Hastings Capital Group, LLC (Hastings), an affiliate of the Adviser, serves as the
Companys Principal Underwriter with authority to sell Shares directly and to appoint Placement agents to assist the Principal Underwriter in selling Shares.

Certain Directors of the Company are also directors and/or officers of other investment
companies that are advised by the Adviser, including SkyBridge Multi-Adviser Hedge Fund Portfolios LLC.  Each Director who is
not an interested person of the Company, as defined by the 1940 Act, receives, for his service as Director of the Company and SkyBridge Multi-Adviser Hedge Fund Portfolios LLC, an annual retainer of $40,000, a fee per telephonic meeting
of the Board of Directors of $500 and a fee per in person meeting of the Board of Directors of $1,000 plus reasonable out of pocket expenses. The Chair of the Audit Committee will receive a $3,000 per year supplemental retainer. Directors will be
reimbursed by the Company for their travel expenses related to Board meetings. A portion of such fees and costs will be allocated to each fund according to its relative net assets and a portion will be split equally between each fund. 
Total amounts expensed related to Directors by the Company for the year ended March 31, 2013 were $22,500. 
 


4.
Contributions and Redemptions  Once the Company commences operations, initial and additional subscriptions for Shares may be accepted as of the first day of each month. The Adviser has been authorized by the Board of Directors of the
Company to accept or reject any initial and additional subscriptions for Shares in the Company. It is not anticipated that Shares will be listed on any securities exchange or traded in other markets, and Shares will be subject to substantial
restrictions on transfer. The Board of Directors from time to time and in its complete and exclusive discretion, may determine to cause the Company to repurchase Shares from Shareholders pursuant to written tenders by Shareholders on such terms and
conditions as it may determine. The Adviser expects that it typically will recommend to the Board of Directors that the Company offer to repurchase Shares from Shareholders quarterly, on each March 31, June 30, September 30
and December 31 (or, if any such date is not a business day, on the immediately preceding business day).   


5.
Subsequent Events 
Management has evaluated the impact of all subsequent events on the Company through the date the financial statements were issued, and has
determined that there were no subsequent events requiring recognition or disclosure in the financial statements, except as disclosed below.  On May 28, 2013 the Adviser made an additional capital contribution of $100,000 to the Company.

The Proxy Voting Policies are attached herewith.  SKYBRIDGE G II FUND, LLC  Proxy Voting Procedures 
SkyBridge G II Fund, LLC (the Fund), and investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended
(the 1940 Act), has adopted these proxy voting procedures (the Procedures) in accordance with, and for the purpose of complying with, rules related to proxy voting promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission

 Potential Conflicts of Interests 
As shown in the table above, Mr. Nolte and Mr. Gayeski are responsible for managing other accounts (Other Accounts)
in addition to the Fund. In certain instances, conflicts may arise in his management of the Fund and such other Accounts.  One
situation where a conflict may arise between the Fund and an Other Account is in the allocation of investment opportunities among the Fund and the Other Account. For example, the Adviser may determine that there is an opportunity that is suitable
for the Fund as well as for Other Accounts of the Adviser, which have a similar investment objective. As a related matter, a particular Investment Fund interest or other security may be bought for one or more clients when one or more other clients
are selling that same security, which may adversely affect the Fund. The Company and the Adviser have adopted policies and procedures regarding the allocation of investment opportunities, which generally require that investment opportunities be
allocated among the Fund and Other Accounts in a manner that is fair, equitable and consistent with their fiduciary obligations to each.  Mr. Noltes and Mr. Gayeskis management of the Fund and Other Accounts may result in his devoting a disproportionate amount of time and attention to the management of a particular
account as against another. This particularly may be the case when accounts have different objectives, benchmarks, time horizons, asset levels and fees. 


The management of personal accounts by Mr. Nolte and Mr. Gayeski may give rise to
potential conflicts of interest. While the Advisers code of ethics will impose limits on the ability of Mr. Nolte and Mr. Gayeski to trade for his personal account, there is no assurance that the Advisers code of ethics will
eliminate such conflicts.  Other than the conflicts described above, the Company is not aware of any material conflicts that
may arise in connection with the Advisers management of the Funds investments and such Other Accounts.   


(a)(3)
 Compensation Structure of Portfolio Manager(s) or Management Team Members  As of March 31, 2013 
Mr. Nolte has a minority equity stake in the Adviser and is also compensated by salary. The value of Mr. Noltes equity
stake is affected by the financial results and profitability of SkyBridge as a whole, for which Mr. Nolte serves as a member of management.  Mr. Gayeskis compensation is a combination of salary and discretionary bonus, including deferred compensation. The value of the discretionary bonus is affected by the financial results and
profitability of SkyBridge as a whole. The discretionary bonus is not linked to the performance of any specific benchmark or that of any SkyBridge investment fund or account; nor are specific asset size targets considered. 
 


(a)(4)
 Disclosure of Securities Ownership  As of March 31, 2013 
For the most recently completed fiscal year please provide beneficial ownership of shares of the registrant by each Portfolio
Manager or Management Team Member. Please note that this information will only be provided in a dollar range of each individuals holdings in each investment portfolio ($1-$10,000; $10,001-$50,000; $50,001-$100,000; $100,001 to $500,000;
$500,001 to $1,000,000; or over $1,000,000).  Beneficial ownership should be determined in accordance with rule
16a-1(a)(2) under the Exchange Act (17 CFR 240.16a-1(a)(2)).
