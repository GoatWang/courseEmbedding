The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Provectus Biopharmaceuticals To Be Removed From NYSE MKT
Apr 27 17
On April 21, 2017, the NYSE MKT LLC filed a Form 25 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), notifying the SEC of the NYSE MKT’s intention to remove the shares of common stock of Provectus Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. and the Company’s class of warrants with an exercise price of $0.85 per share expiring June 19, 2020 from listing and registration on the NYSE MKT effective May 1, 2017, pursuant to the provisions of Rule 12d2-2(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The NYSE MKT’s filing of the Form 25 followed the NYSE MKT Committee for Review’s determination on April 5, 2017 to affirm the January 31, 2017 decision of the NYSE MKT Listing Qualifications Panel to initiate delisting proceedings due to (i) the “abnormally low” trading price of the shares of the Common Stock and (ii) the Company’s noncompliance with Section 1003(a)(iii) of the NYSE MKT Company Guide (requiring stockholders’ equity of $6.0 million or more if the Company has reported losses from continuing operations and/or net losses in its five most recent fiscal years). The Common Stock and Listed Warrants will continue to trade on the OTCQB following the delisting from the NYSE MKT under the trading symbols “PVCT” and “PVCTWS,” respectively. The Company can provide no assurance that the Common Stock and Listed Warrants will continue to trade on the OTCQB in the future.

About Provectus Biopharmaceuticals, Inc.


      Provectus Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. is investigating new therapies for 
      the treatment of skin cancer, liver cancer and breast cancer. Provectus' 
      investigational oncology drug, PV-10, is an ablative immunotherapy under 
      investigation in solid tumor cancers. The Company has received orphan 
      drug designations from the FDA for its melanoma and hepatocellular 
      carcinoma indications. PH-10, its topical investigational drug for 
      dermatology, is undergoing clinical testing for psoriasis and atopic 
      dermatitis. Provectus has completed phase 2 trials of PV-10 as a therapy 
      for metastatic melanoma, and of PH-10 as a topical treatment for atopic 
      dermatitis and psoriasis. Information about these and the Company's 
      other clinical trials can be found at the NIH registry, www.clinicaltrials.gov. 
      For additional information about Provectus, please visit the Company's 
      website at www.provectusbio.com 
      or contact Porter, LeVay & Rose, Inc.
    

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS: This release contains "forward-looking 
      statements" as defined under U.S. federal securities laws, including but 
      not limited to the expected use of the net proceeds from the offering. 
      These statements reflect management's current knowledge, assumptions, 
      beliefs, estimates, and expectations and express management's current 
      views of future performance, results, and trends and may be identified 
      by their use of terms such as "anticipate," "believe," "could," 
      "estimate," "expect," "intend," "may," "plan," "predict," "project," 
      "will," and other similar terms. Forward-looking statements are subject 
      to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual 
      results to materially differ from those described in the forward-looking 
      statements. Readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking 
      statements. Such statements are made as of the date hereof, and we 
      undertake no obligation to update such statements after this date.


Risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to 
      materially differ from those described in forward-looking statements 
      include those discussed in our filings with the Securities and Exchange 
      Commission (including those described in Item 1A of our Annual Report on 
      Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015) and the following:


        our determination, based on guidance from the FDA, whether to proceed 
        with or without a partner with the fully enrolled phase 3 trial of 
        PV-10 to treat locally advanced cutaneous melanoma and the costs 
        associated with such a trial if it is necessary to complete (versus 
        interim data alone);
      

        our determination whether to license PV-10, our investigational drug 
        product for melanoma and other solid tumors such as cancers of the 
        liver, if such licensure is appropriate considering the timing and 
        structure of such a license, or to commercialize PV-10 on our own to 
        treat melanoma and other solid tumors such as cancers of the liver;
      

        our ability to license PH-10, our investigational drug product for 
        dermatology, on the basis of our phase 2 atopic dermatitis and 
        psoriasis results, which are in the process of being further developed 
        in conjunction with mechanism of action studies; and
      

        our ability to raise additional capital if we determine to 
        commercialize PV-10 and/or PH-10 on our own, although our expectation 
        is to be acquired by a prospective pharmaceutical or biotech concern 
        prior to commercialization.

Provectus Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. Securities Litigation
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURTEASTERN DISTRICT OF TENNESSEEKNOXVILLE DIVISIONCase No.:3:14-cv-00338-PLR-HBG

IMPORTANT UPDATE TO:
All Persons or Entities who purchased or otherwise acquired the common stock of Provectus Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Provectus”) during the period from December 17, 2013 through and including May 22, 2014, and were allegedly damaged thereby.
The Claims Administrator in this case received a high number of late requests from brokers and other nominees to send notice of this Settlement to potential Settlement Class Members, such that copies of the Postcard Notice were sent to some 6,000 potential Settlement Class Members as late as August 31.  As a result, the Parties to the litigation asked the Court to reschedule the Settlement Hearing and to extend the deadlines for potential Settlement Class Members to: (i) submit a Proof of Claim form; and (ii) request exclusion from the Settlement Class or object to the Settlement, Plan of Allocation, and/or Lead Counsel’s request for attorneys’ fees and expenses. 
On September 29, 2016, the Court entered an order granting the Parties’ request.  According to the Court’s Order:
(i) Proof of Claim forms must be postmarked on or before November 25, 2016 in order to be considered for inclusion in the Settlement;
(ii) Requests for Exclusion must be received on or before November 10, 2016; and
(iii) Objections to the Settlement, Plan of Allocation, and/or Lead Counsel’s request for attorneys’ fees and expenses must be received by the Court and counsel on or before November 10, 2016. 
Additional information concerning how to file a Proof of Claim form, request exclusion from the Settlement Class or object may be found in the Notice.

Finally, please be advised that the Court has rescheduled the Settlement Hearing for December 12, 2016, at 1:30 p.m.  The Settlement Hearing will take place before the Honorable Pamela L. Reeves in Courtroom 3C of the Howard H. Baker, Jr. United States Courthouse, located at 800 Market Street, Knoxville, Tennessee.  You do not have to attend the hearing to be eligible to participate in the Settlement.
Please consult this website for future updates.

If you choose to follow alternative procedure (b), upon such mailing, you must send a statement to the Claims Administrator confirming that the mailing was made as directed and retain the names and addresses for any future mailings to Class Members. You are entitled to reimbursement from the Settlement Fund of your reasonable expenses actually incurred in connection with the foregoing, including reimbursement of postage expense and the cost of ascertaining the names and addresses of beneficial owners.

A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER 

















A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER

It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer. But what was once the fruit of a wild imagination is today a reality.
Rather than killing cancer cells directly with traditional approaches like radiation or chemotherapy, immunotherapy harnesses the immune system’s power to eliminate the cancer or slow its growth and ability to spread. Research shows immunotherapy is improving outcomes and survival rates for some patients, including kidney and lung cancer. In fact, research from the American Association for Cancer Research shows that for advanced-melanoma patients, survival rates are improving thanks in part to these new treatment options.
"It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer." Tweet
Biopharmaceutical researchers are urgently working to gain new insights into the complex interactions between patients’ immune systems and the cancer cells growing in their bodies with the goal of markedly improving outcomes in more tumor types.
With 836 medicines and vaccines in development for cancer, 80 percent of which have the potential to be first-in-class treatments, millions of Americans living with cancer have hope for a brighter future.
Welcome to the new era of medicine.
For all of us.

HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

















HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

Diabetes is a serious condition that effects more than 30 million Americans. While complications of the disease can be dire, there is hope. Biopharmaceutical researchers are helping patients manage the condition today and envision a bright outlook for future treatments.
Diabetes: the patient perspective
Diabetes is a general term for a chronic condition where there is too much glucose (sugar) in the blood. Normally, the pancreas makes insulin to help convert glucose into energy. With diabetes, the body either does not make enough insulin (type 1 diabetes) or does not use it properly (type 2 diabetes), leading to high blood glucose levels. Uncontrolled diabetes can lead to serious health complications, such as heart attack, lower-limb amputation, vision impairment and blindness.
Endocrinologist Dr. William "Bill" Chin has experience treating endocrine disorders, including diabetes. As chief medical officer at PhRMA, he works to ensure that patient voices are heard, drawing on his dual experience as a physician and as the parent of a child with diabetes. When Dr. Chin's son, Danny, was 15, he began experiencing telltale symptoms like excessive thirst. Dr. Chin diagnosed his son himself with type 1 diabetes.
He says, "I don’t think any parent is ever prepared to learn that one of our kids has developed a disease, particularly one that will be chronic. In many ways it’s forever, but the good news is we have great therapies that actually will allow a patient with diabetes to live a full and completely normal life if it’s well managed."
The changing landscape of diabetes treatment
The medications that Danny relies on have come a long way in the last ten years. A decade ago, a number of insulin options were available to patients, as well as oral and injected medications. Successful management of diabetes required constant and diligent monitoring of glucose levels. To control their glucose, patients needed multiple daily injections and/or multiple oral medicines.
In recent years, researchers have focused on making treatments much easier for patients, from fewer pills to less frequent injections. Careful monitoring and treatment are still needed, but current medicines in development offer a promising future.
There are 171 medicines currently in development for type 1 and type 2 diabetes and diabetes-related conditions. A new wave of treatments is offering patients better or more sustained control over their glucose levels. Other medicines in the pipeline may address diabetes-related complications that affect the kidneys, blood vessels and eyes. All of the medicines are in clinical trials or awaiting review by the FDA.
While these advances have improved patient quality of life and increased lifespans for type 1 diabetes, ongoing research remains critical. In fact, diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the United States in 2013.
Dr. Chin says, "Collaboration is incredibly important in the understanding and development of new treatments for diabetes ... we are continually seeking to advance our understanding of the disease. This can only be achieved by having academic scientists and physician scientists working closely with scientists in the biopharmaceutical industry."

We cannot take progress for granted

We are in a new era of medical discovery and have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of costly and debilitating diseases. But we must not take this progress for granted.  To ensure medical innovation continues for the benefit of patients we need public policies that reward the investment and time it takes to develop life-saving treatments and cures.
In order to enhance competition and improve affordability for patients, our country must:
1)    Make medicines more affordable by rewarding value
 Today, America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies are partnering with health insurers to improve how we pay for medicines. Prices for medicines may vary based on how well an individual responds to treatment, or agreements may lower co-pays if patients achieve better health outcomes. While these partnerships will vary, they are helping to ensure we get the right medicine to the right patient at the right time – improving care and lowering costs across the health care system.
Yet, outdated regulations prevent wider use of these new payment arrangements.  Government rules and regulations should not prevent the private sector from developing better ways to pay for medicines. Rather, we must ensure health plans can cover more of the newest medicines and give patients more choices – improving care and lowering health care costs for Americans.
2)    Ensure patients get the best deal on medicines
America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies often negotiate large rebates for prescription medicines with insurers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs). Those rebates are growing every year and now exceed $100 billion per year – helping to hold down health care costs for patients and taxpayers.
But we can do more to ensure patients benefit directly from these negotiated savings, and put an end to an unfair practice that requires patients to buy medicines at full price, even when their insurers get a rebate. In fact, patients with large deductibles can end up paying more than their insurer pays for their medicine.  That’s wrong. Health insurance companies should share with patients the discounts they receive. This could lower out-of-pocket costs for some patients by hundreds – if not thousands – of dollars every year.
3)    Make new breakthroughs accessible, and promote competition
We need to make it make it easier for patients to get access to breakthrough medicines. It simply takes too long to get new medicines approved – over 10 years and over one billion dollars, on average.  Outdated regulations and approaches for evaluating drugs can slow things down even more. To get medicines approved faster, while ensuring safety, we need to modernize the FDA with new technologies and expertise to keep up with 21st century science. Modernizing the FDA will bring down the time and cost of developing new medicines, which will bring medicines to patients faster, and enhance competition in the market.
We also need to reduce the backlog of applications for generic medicines at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  This will ensure that patients benefit as less expensive generic medicines replace higher cost treatments that have lost patent protection. 
At the same time, we must avoid policies that deter risk-taking or siphon funding away from the research and development of new medicines for patients. Learn more about our plan to build a sustainable, science-based health care system that harnesses today’s hopes to discover tomorrow’s cures here.
