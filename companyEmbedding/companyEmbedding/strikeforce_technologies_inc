Smarter Cyber Security

                    GuardedID® stops malicious keylogging programs by encrypting keystroke data and routing it directly to your internet browser or desktop through a secure pathway that’s invisible to keyloggers.
                





Stop Cyberthieves!

Traditional keystroke data flows through a series of steps before it appears on your monitor. Hidden in these steps is an area of vulnerability where cyber criminals try to take advantage using keylogging spyware. GuardedID® bypasses the places keyloggers can reside, helping to eliminate your vulnerability to attack. As a second level of security, GuardedID® protects the pathway it creates with a military-grade 256-bit encryption code. GuardedID® also sends out a sequence of meaningless numbers in place of your keystrokes, making any data collected by hackers completely useless.
                        








Keystroke Encryption

                            Encrypt your keystrokes at the lowest kernel layer to safeguard against both existing and new (zero-day) keyloggers.
                        


Anti-Clickjacking

                            Detect and highlight hidden clickjacking attacks to warn you from clicking on malicious invisible objects embedded in legitimate web pages.
                        


Anti-Screen Capture

                            Prevent screen scraping malware from secretly taking screenshots of your personal information.
                        




Malicious Driver Monitoring

                            Operate as an anti-subversive service, detect untrusted drivers, and display a warning containing the name of any suspicious driver.
                        


CryptoColor

                            Change the color of your text fields to let you know that GuardedID® is working behind the scenes to protect your every keystroke.

                                *Feature currently available in
                                Internet Explorer only*




Full Protection

                            Protect USB, wireless, PS2, Bluetooth, and international keyboards.

Eliminate the keylogging threat
MobileTrust® eliminates the threat from keylogging hackers by preventing them from detecting your keystrokes. The idea is simple but our keystroke encryption technology is sophisticated enough to outsmart even the most aggressive keyloggers.





They can’t hack what they can’t see
Traditional keystroke data flows from your mobile keyboard through your operating system before it appears in your apps. Hidden along the way are areas of vulnerability where cyber criminals can plant keylogging spyware.
MobileTrust® protects your keystroke data by installing a secure encrypted keyboard that creates an alternate pathway to your apps, routing your encrypted data around the areas of vulnerability. For added security, the MobileTrust® pathway is protected by a complex 256-bit encryption code.






Secure Keyboard
Encrypts keystrokes and prevents them from being logged in your mobile device’s data storage; no need to cover your tracks or reset your cache. *Works with all apps that accept a third-party keyboard*


Secure Web Browser
Encrypts keystrokes between your on-screen keyboard and our secure browser & wipes traces of browsing activity upon exit.


Encrypted Password Vault
Safely store a virtually unlimited number of login credentials with associated websites.




Strong Password Generator
Generate strong passwords based on your preferences and drop them into your password vault for future use & reference.


Two-Factor Authentication
Works with all OATH-compliant authentication systems to enable secure login to internal/external sites directly from within the application without a physical token.

         WARNING: PLEASE USE THE SYMBOL SFOR OR COMPANY NAME WHEN POSTING-USE OF ABBREVIATIONS SUCH AS "SF" WILL BE DELETED!  This board is to be used to discuss SFOR(D) the company, its officers and its stock. Messages about other posters or intentions, the mods, name calling, profanity, deletions etc. are off topic at the very least.    To answer some of your questions regarding posts, please read the following, that you should have known already, taken from the Ihub FAQ section of the Ihub handbook. So you can stop with the moronic conspiracy theories about the Mods and Admins on this board!  Regarding libel and slander suspected posts:  "Libel can only become a fact if a judge says it is. Nobody else, including Moderators or Site Admins, can nor will determine that Member posted content is libelous. Members are often of the opinion that a post is libelous, but no Moderator should act based on that opinion. Libel is decided by a judge in a court of law after conducting proper evidentiary hearings. If such a judgment is issued by a court of competent jurisdiction, iHub will abide by that ruling. Otherwise, it is not a matter that Site Admin or Mods can decide. Our only role here is to ensure adherence to the Terms of Use. Anecdotally, quite often the information that some Members allege to be libelous ends up being accurate, which is why neither Site Admins nor Moderators remove posts on the basis of being allegedly false or libelous."  Regarding posting lies (or what some posters feel are lies):  "Mods or Admin do not make decisions about the veracity of information posted. "Truth" is a very subjective term and neither Site Admin nor Mods remove posts based on judgments of this type. Each reader has both the right and obligation to decide for themselves if they feel a post is accurate and its author credible. As a participant on the board, the Moderators' recourse is the same as any other Member; to debate the information contained in the post without attacking the Member, or to ignore it. Attack the message, not the messenger."  Regarding a good DD post with a personal attack lumped in:  If a post is 99% on topic and 1% personal attack it still needs to be removed. Personal attacks in any form are disrespectful of others and are unwelcome on the site. These types of gratuitous comments also create noise and dilute the quality of the board. When a Member attacks another poster, other participants inevitably feel the need to respond, either agreeing or defending. Then others feel the need to respond to these…and so on and so on ad nauseam. Pretty soon the board has devolved into personal attacks and discussion about other Members, i.e., noise and no signal. There are plenty of other sites that allow these types of posts and it is difficult to find any meaningful content on such sites. The goal at iHub is to have all information, whether positive, neutral or negative, discussed in a civil manner, free of personal attacks.  Regarding proof of member post content:  Members do not have to provide "proof" when offering their opinions. There is no requirement for Members to substantiate their posts. Veracity of posts and credibility of the author is determined by the reader.     http://www.strikeforcetech.com/index.aspx           SFOR Security Details 			Outstanding Shares confirmed unchanged  as of 8/19/2016 			   2,282,964,907                   Market Value1 $9,497,134 a/o Aug 19, 2016     Authorized Shares 5,000,000,000 a/o May 16, 2016     Outstanding Shares 2,282,964,907 a/o May 16, 2016     -Restricted Not Available     -Unrestricted Not Available     Held at DTC Not Available     Float 2,282,934,907 a/o May 16, 2016                                                                                                                                                                                                 Leadership Team: http://www.guardedid.com/about_leadership.aspx  Advisory Board: http://www.guardedid.com/about_advisory.aspx   StrikeForce Technologies' IR Contact Mark L.
