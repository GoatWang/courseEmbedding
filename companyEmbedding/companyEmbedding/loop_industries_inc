We're leading the sustainable plastic revolution







				Your browser does not support the video tag.
				













This is how  you rethink plastic








   
Disrupt traditional plastic manufacturing...
Most plastic production today is a classic example of the wasteful linear economy. It’s produced from fossil fuels and $80 to $100 billion of it is thrown out after being used only once.









   
...by up-cycling new plastic from waste.
We bring plastic production into the sustainable circular economy.  We decouple plastic from fossil fuels by creating new PET from waste plastic.

Why our technology is revolutionary
Our innovative depolymerization technology produces  Purified Terephthalic Acid (PTA) and  Mono Ethylene Glycol (MEG) from waste plastic feedstocks.  This includes all forms of waste PET plastic, including polyester fibers, colored plastic, and opaque plastic. Our elegant process achieves full depolymerization of waste plastic with zero energy input.
	Loop™ PTA and Loop™ MEG are commodity chemicals that will be repolymerized into Loop™ PET plastic made from 100% re-used materials. 
Loop™-branded PET is of the highest purity: virgin-quality FDA-approved plastic - like the kind used to make water bottles.

Corporate Overview












Loop Industries is an environmentally responsible manufacturer of Purified Terephthalic Acid (PTA) and Ethylene Glycol (EG), the fundamental chemical components used in the manufacturing of Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) plastic.PET plastic is most commonly found in beverage bottles, consumer packaging and polyester fiber. PET is one of the world's most commonly used, versatile and trusted materials. More than half of the world's synthetic fiber is made from PET, and almost all individual-sized and 2-liter bottles of carbonated soft drinks and water sold in the U.S. are made from PET resin.Unlike traditional processes which use petroleum to produce PTA and EG, our industrial quality chemicals are made from 100% recycled PET plastic. Loop Industries’ proprietary process sustainably converts waste plastics into high purity PTA and EG, making it environmentally friendly, elegant in its functional simplicity and extremely efficient achieving a recovery rate of nearly 100%.Our goal is to help consumer products companies and other industries worldwide achieve their sustainability objectives by incorporating PTA and EG manufactured through Loop Industries’ technology into their PET plastic supply chain. By using chemicals produced through Loop’s proprietary technology, companies will be able to dramatically reduce their carbon footprint and lower our society’s dependence on fossil fuels.
