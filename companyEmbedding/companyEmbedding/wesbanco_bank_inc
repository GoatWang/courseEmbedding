Western Pennsylvania expansion[edit]
In late 2012 Wesbanco merged with the Pittsburgh-based Fidelity Bancorp Inc. Remaining Fidelity branches were converted into Wesbanco branches.[5] It further expanded its Pittsburgh-area presence with the purchase of Ellwood City-based ESB Financial Corporation in late 2014, converting those branches to WesBanco in April 2015.[4] The two deals placed WesBanco among the top ten banks in the Pittsburgh metropolitan area by deposits, after it had a handful of branches it opened organically in Washington, Pennsylvania.[4]
Kentucky and Southern Indiana expansion[edit]
On August 19, 2016, the shareholders of Your Community Bankshares approved the merger through adoption of the previously announced agreement and Plan of Merger, pursuant to which Your Community Bankshares will merge with and into WesBanco[6] (slated for November 4, 2016). By merging with Your Community Bank, WesBanco expands its Banking Center footprint into the Kentucky and Southern Indiana areas.

BBB Accreditation





                BBB Accredited Since 06/03/2002
            

                BBB has determined that WesBanco Bank, Inc. meets Standards of BBB Accreditation, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            

                BBB accreditation does not mean that the business's products or services have been evaluated or endorsed by BBB, or that BBB has made a determination as to the business's product quality or competency in performing services.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

                            2. cooperate with BBB's activities and efforts to promote voluntary self- regulation within the business' industry

                    1. Follow federal, state/provincial and local advertising laws.

4. Cooperate with BBB self-regulatory programs for the resolution of advertising disputes.
5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

                    6. Avoid misleading customers by creating the false impression of sponsorship, endorsement, popularity, trustworthiness, product quality or business size through the misuse of logos, trustmarks, pictures, testimonials, or other means

5. the business' return/refund policy

                            6. any recurring commitment into which the customer may be entering, including information on how future billing will occur

                    1. Promptly respond to all complaints forwarded by BBB by: 
1. Resolving the complaint directly with the complainant and notifying BBB, or

                            2. Providing BBB with a response that BBB determines: 

                                    1. is professional,
                                
2. addresses all of the issues raised by the complainant,

                    2. Make a good faith effort to resolve disputes, which includes mediation if requested by BBB. Other dispute resolution options, including arbitration, may be recommended by BBB when other efforts to resolve a dispute have failed. BBB may consider a business' willingness to participate in recommended dispute resolution options in determining compliance with these standards.
                

                    3. Comply with any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

America Saves Designation










































WESBANCO BANK, INC. AGAIN RECEIVES THE AMERICA SAVES DESIGNATION OF SAVINGS EXCELLENCE



Wheeling, WV, June 5, 2017 -


WesBanco, Inc.’s (Nasdaq:WSBC) affiliate, WesBanco Bank was recognized today with the 2017 America Saves Designation of Savings Excellence for its extraordinary efforts during America Saves Week/Military Saves Week to encourage customers to save money. The award is presented annually to financial institutions that succeed in getting people to open and add to wealth-building accounts.
In addition to being an active participant in America Saves Week since its inception in 2007, WesBanco is proud of its more than 11-year partnership with America Saves to provide valuable financial resources to educate and encourage individuals about savings. Across Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia, WesBanco actively encourages savings year-round with special products designed to encourage wealth building.
“WesBanco is extremely pleased to be recognized by America Saves, for the second consecutive year, for the dedication to our communities demonstrated across our organization. This recognition would not have been possible without the devotion and hard work of our employees, as they once again went above and beyond business as usual during America Saves Week to encourage customers to save. For almost 150 years, WesBanco has maintained its strong community banking roots by focusing on the success of the communities in which we do business. In fact, our employees collectively dedicate thousands of hours per year to savings education, including participation in the Teach Children to Save and Get Smart About Credit initiatives, in addition to America Saves Week,” said Lynn Asensio, WesBanco’s Executive Vice President for Retail.
“This was our most competitive year so far, with institutions engaging in creative ways and offering savings incentives,” said Allie Vered, America Saves Director. “A lot of people don’t believe they can find the money to save. But saving is not an amount, it’s an activity. Convincing consumers to pay themselves first, to hang on to dollars instead of spending, and to take a pledge to achieve a goal go a long way towards helping them develop savings habits. We recognize WesBanco Bank for their efforts to educate and inspire.”
Just two in five American households report making good or excellent savings progress. America Saves Week is an annual opportunity for people to assess their savings status and make a plan to start or increase saving, and for organizations like banks or credit unions to support good savings behavior. America Saves Week is coordinated each year by America Saves and the American Savings Education Council. WesBanco Bank was one of 16 banks and 16 credit unions recognized nationally.

Benefits to working at WesBanco.

WesBanco’s Group Health plan includes medical and dental coverage effective the first of the month on or following date of hire.  Employees eligible to participate are all full-time employees and all part-time employees that work on average at least 17.5 hours per week.  

The medical plan includes prescriptions and vision benefits through a PPO or HMO. The High Deductible PPO plan is accompanied by a Health Reimbursement Arrangement (HRA), which is an employer funded account that employees can use to help defray medical expenses.  

The dental plan covers preventive (cleanings and x-rays), basic (fillings, extractions), major (crowns, dentures) and dependent orthodontia services to age 19.  

Flexible Benefits Plan (Flex Plan)
The WesBanco, Inc. Flex Plan is designed to provide employees the opportunity to pay for qualified benefits with pre-tax rather than after-tax dollars, which increases take-home income.  All medical and dental premiums are payroll deducted on a pre-tax basis.

WesBanco, Inc. KSOP Plan
The KSOP has two parts: The Employee Stock Ownership Plan and the 401(k) Plan.  Employees, at least 21 years of age, are automatically enrolled in the plan the first of the month on or after 60 days of employment. Employees, who are not 21, will be automatically enrolled on the first day of the month on or after 60 days following your 21st birthday.

: Vehicle through which the Corporation may purchase shares of WesBanco, Inc. Common Stock for discretionary allocation to the employees.  Employees are vested in any ESOP allocation after the completion of five (5) years of vesting service.  
401(k) Plan
: The 401(k) Plan is a pre-tax vehicle for savings.  The employer-matching contribution is 100% on the first 3% of compensation deferred, and 50% on the next 2% of compensation deferred.  Therefore, an employee who defers 5% of compensation is matched in cash at 4% by WesBanco. Employees are immediately vested in the employer match. WesBanco automatically enrolls employees at 3% of compensation invested in the T. Rowe Price Retirement Fund (based upon appropriate age bracket). Participants may change their contribution rate and investments upon receipt of their plan information via the website or voice response line at any time.

America Saves Designation










































WESBANCO BANK, INC. AGAIN RECEIVES THE AMERICA SAVES DESIGNATION OF SAVINGS EXCELLENCE



Wheeling, WV, June 5, 2017 -


WesBanco, Inc.’s (Nasdaq:WSBC) affiliate, WesBanco Bank was recognized today with the 2017 America Saves Designation of Savings Excellence for its extraordinary efforts during America Saves Week/Military Saves Week to encourage customers to save money. The award is presented annually to financial institutions that succeed in getting people to open and add to wealth-building accounts.
In addition to being an active participant in America Saves Week since its inception in 2007, WesBanco is proud of its more than 11-year partnership with America Saves to provide valuable financial resources to educate and encourage individuals about savings. Across Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia, WesBanco actively encourages savings year-round with special products designed to encourage wealth building.
“WesBanco is extremely pleased to be recognized by America Saves, for the second consecutive year, for the dedication to our communities demonstrated across our organization. This recognition would not have been possible without the devotion and hard work of our employees, as they once again went above and beyond business as usual during America Saves Week to encourage customers to save. For almost 150 years, WesBanco has maintained its strong community banking roots by focusing on the success of the communities in which we do business. In fact, our employees collectively dedicate thousands of hours per year to savings education, including participation in the Teach Children to Save and Get Smart About Credit initiatives, in addition to America Saves Week,” said Lynn Asensio, WesBanco’s Executive Vice President for Retail.
“This was our most competitive year so far, with institutions engaging in creative ways and offering savings incentives,” said Allie Vered, America Saves Director. “A lot of people don’t believe they can find the money to save. But saving is not an amount, it’s an activity. Convincing consumers to pay themselves first, to hang on to dollars instead of spending, and to take a pledge to achieve a goal go a long way towards helping them develop savings habits. We recognize WesBanco Bank for their efforts to educate and inspire.”
Just two in five American households report making good or excellent savings progress. America Saves Week is an annual opportunity for people to assess their savings status and make a plan to start or increase saving, and for organizations like banks or credit unions to support good savings behavior. America Saves Week is coordinated each year by America Saves and the American Savings Education Council. WesBanco Bank was one of 16 banks and 16 credit unions recognized nationally.

What is the history of WesBanco?

From the moment we took our very first deposit, right up to today, our story has been a story of our customers – and of the region. We’ve grown as you’ve grown. And our success has been built on your success.  Today our bank operates under the same basic charter that was issued on January 20, 1870 to “The German Bank” which officially began operations on April 3, 1870. Seventeen years later, on February 3, 1887, the Dollar Savings Bank was organized in Wheeling. The two banks would eventually merge and the combined bank’s leaders were incredibly active in building a better, stronger region. It was the first of many acquisitions and mergers that would allow us to grow with the needs of our customers.  Through the years, we’ve been there as the people of this area fought through the rise and fall of industrial cycles, natural disasters, crop disasters and personal tragedies. And we’ve been inspired by the resilience and optimism of the people we serve. The spirit of our customers drove us to be a better bank then – and it drives us to this day.
