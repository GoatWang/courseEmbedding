Reasons sellers seek liquidity options
There are many reasons that a Seller seeks liquidity, but the “FOUR Ds” illustrate most of the reasons that investors are looking to the Secondary Market to sell their non-listed Alternative Assets.
Death
CFX handles all aspects of liquidating Alternative Investments held in Estates.  Ask us about our Valuation Services.
Divorce
CFX works with attorneys and representatives from both sides to help create a liquidity event that is satisfactory to all the involved parties.
Debt
CFX understands that many Sellers are looking for cash due to unforeseen financial reasons.  Liquidation of an Alternative Asset is often the only option.
Disillusionment
Some investors are just “DONE” waiting for K-1s or other tax information and would just prefer to liquidate their asset. Others may find they want to invest their money into other asset classes or find a better price than a mini-tender offer.  Whatever reason you may have for selling your non-listed REITs and LPs, the problems are the same: The market is fragmented and inefficient and the transfer process is complicated.

 SELL YOUR REIT OR LIMITED PARTNERSHIP
 
CFX Markets is committed to assisting Sellers solving their liquidity needs and overcome the market inefficiencies and the complicated transfer process that follows.  Our on-line platform is designed to streamline the document execution process and reduce the time it takes to release proceeds to the Seller.
