COMMINGLED MULTI-MANAGER PROGRAMS
Capturing the unique characteristics of hedge fund investing, Optima seeks to construct multi-manager hedge fund programs designed to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns with significant downside protection and low correlation to equity and fixed income markets.  Key to the process is: 1) robust manager due diligence, 2) selecting complementary managers considering correlations and volatilities, 3) top-down asset allocation, 4) ongoing risk management and manager monitoring.  Optima currently offers commingled funds in several strategies including:

Long/Short Equity FOFsSince 1988


Global Macro FOFsSince 1991


Multi-Strategy FOFsSince 1999




CUSTOMIZED MULTI-MANAGER PROGRAMS
Since 1991, Optima has been designing and implementing customized multi-manager programs tailored to the specific objectives and constraints of our larger institutional clients. Optima currently manages dedicated long/short equity, discretionary macro, CTA/tactical trading, and multi-strategy programs on behalf of our institutional clients. 

SINGLE MANAGER PROGRAMS
Optima has partnered in sub-advisory relationships with several world-class hedge fund managers who we believe each offer a distinctive and unique investment expertise along with strong track records and outstanding manager pedigree.  Optima serves as sponsor, and provides legal, administrative, risk management, reporting, proprietary technology and marketing support. These  partnerships allow each manager to leverage Optima’s global distribution channels. 







                "We add value on so many levels - our experience ... our knowledge ... the products we offer. Every one at Optima
                is intensely proud of the company we have built." D. Dixon Boardman, Founder and CEO
