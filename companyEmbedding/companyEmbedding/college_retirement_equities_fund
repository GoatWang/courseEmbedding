				Your retirement. Their college. Our help.
			 
		






With college for the kids (or grandkids) plus retirement coming, think about this: skipping $20,000 in retirement contributions from age 50 to 55 could leave you with $85,000 less by age 67.1
That big difference for tomorrow is a good reason to talk to us today. Our Financial Professionals have advice on ways to pay for college—from financial aid and scholarships (even unusual ones, like in this video) to accounts that you, your family or anyone else can contribute to. All while staying on track for retirement and balancing the rest of your financial life.
Just like college, education is the key. Explore this page to learn more, then talk to a Financial Professional today.
1 For illustrative purposes only. Based on five years of a 4% dollar-for-dollar company matching contribution on a $100,000 annual salary and hypothetical 6% rate of return compounded over 17 years.

 Prepare for a life that’s always changing.


Video/Audio Title Goes Here



View transcript






	  Prepare for a life that’s always changing.

	  
Your goals, responsibilities and risks are always evolving. So does your need to be ready for whatever’s next.
That’s why it’s time to find out how life insurance from Prudential can go beyond what you expect to help you prepare for the unexpected. In addition to protecting your family if anything happens to you, we can also help lessen the financial burden on them if you develop a chronic illness. Life insurance can also help replace anticipated retirement savings or offset the impact of income taxes, helping you pass along more of your assets to your heirs.
Keep reading. Then let’s talk about ways to protect what matters most to you.

Inflation is assumed to be 3% and life insurance proceeds are invested to earn 4.5% after tax. The rates reflect the national average for each service provided based on information provided by the National Labor Board. The earnings on the life insurance proceeds plus spending down the life insurance proceeds will be used to cover these expenses over the expected period. The return is purely hypothetical and is used for illustrative purposes only. Performance results are not indicative of any particular investment. Actual results and investment risks will vary. Life insurance is issued by The Prudential Insurance Company of America, Newark, NJ, and its affiliates, all Prudential Financial companies. Our life insurance policies contain exclusions, limitations, reductions in benefits and terms for keeping them in force. Your licensed financial professional can provide you with costs and complete details.

The information generated by this tool is provided for illustrative purposes only and is based upon the information provided by you and is subject to change. This material is designed to provide general information regarding the subject matter covered. No guarantee of future results or outcomes either expressed or implied, is being made. Investing involves risks. Since no one investment program is suitable for all types of investors you need to review your investment objectives, risk tolerance, and liquidity needs before selecting an investment program. It is possible to lose money. You should periodically review your investment allocations particularly if your circumstances change. There is no assurance that an investment will achieve their objectives. Asset allocation does not assure a profit or protect against loss in declining markets.

Save a little more today, 


	  

	  for the things you’ll love forever.

	  
Think about the things you love to do the most. Would you ever want to give them up? That’s the tough financial choice a lot of us could face when we retire. But if we start saving a little more today – even 1% more of our annual income – we could keep doing all the things we love.
It’s all part of Prudential’s goal to help everyone reach their own goals for retirement. We can help with everything from mutual funds to annuities to life insurance. And you can check out our tools for helpful insights on Social Security, ideal places to retire, and more.
Want to see how we can help you? Great – let’s keep going.

How did we calculate this?
 To calculate how many years it might take to spend your guessed amount 
              in retirement, we used your age, years until retirement, and inflation rate 
              of 3%, and average spending data from the 2012 Expenditure Survey. 

Got it >



Based on national spending averages,
$1,500,000 will likely be spent by the age of 76.
How did we calculate this?
 Come up a little short? Guessing how much money you might
            need 
            to save for retirement that could last 30 or 40 years
            is pretty hard. 
            A good place to start: Think about how
            many years you may live in 
            retirement and how much income
            you'll need each year.

Disclaimers: The 1983 Social Security Amendments included a provision to raise the full retirement age gradually to 67, beginning with people born in 1938 or later. The FRA for those born prior to 1943 is 65 and are past the mandated distribution age. For those between 1955 and 1959 the FRA goes up in increments of 2 months beyond age 66. For example the FRA for those born in 1955 is 66 and 2 months, for those born in 1956 is 66 and 4months, and so on. Source: http://www.socialsecurity.gov/planners/retire/agereduction.html

Unexpected
LOSS OF
INCOME

The Impact of

TAXES


The higher your tax rate in retirement, the more you'll have to withdraw from your investments to meet your retirement income target.

Medicare Premiums
AND HEALTH
EXPENSES


At age 65, Social Security payments are reduced to cover premiums for Medicare Parts B and D and Medigap insurance. Then there are health-care costs not covered by Medicare — which could average $220,000 for a 65-year-old couple.

TIAA, formerly TIAA—CREF (Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association—College Retirement Equities Fund), is a Fortune 100 financial services organization that is the leading retirement provider of financial services for the academic, research, medical, cultural and governmental industries. TIAA serves over 5 million active and retired employees participating at more than 15,000 institutions and has $938 billion[1] in combined assets under management with holdings in more than 50 countries (as of March 31, 2017).
Much of TIAA operates on a not-for-profit basis, with surplus returned to participants. TIAA is headquartered in New York City in the United States and has major offices in Denver, Colorado; Charlotte, North Carolina; and Dallas, Texas; as well as seventy local offices throughout the U.S.. In 2016, TIAA ranked 82nd on Fortune's list of the 500 largest corporations in America.[2] As of 2016, TIAA is the largest global investor in agriculture, the 2nd largest grower of wine grapes in the United States (by acreage), and the 3rd largest commercial real estate manager in the world.[1]

Profile[edit]
TIAA was created to replace the system of free pensions provided by Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching for professors. When the original fund proved inadequate, TIAA was created in an Act of the New York State Legislature in 1918 as a stock life insurance company for the purpose of providing retirement income for professors through fixed premium guaranteed deferred annuity contracts. Later, in 1952, CREF was created to allow professors to invest in the stock market through the nation's first variable annuity. Its core business continues to be retirement plan administration and annuity products. It is by far the largest manager of employer-sponsored 403(b) tax-sheltered annuity plans, a defined contribution retirement plan for employees of 501(c)(3) educational, religious, and charitable organizations. The company also offers 401(k) and 457 plans, Keogh plans, and Supplemental Retirement Plans. Contributions from these plans are typically invested in the company's traditional or variable annuities or its line of mutual funds.
In recent years the company has greatly expanded its capabilities and advisory services and broadened clients' investment choices. Internally it has focused on developing customer support IT infrastructure and leadership development.[3]
At the retail level, TIAA offers Traditional and Rollover Individual Retirement Accounts, Roth IRAs, mutual funds, after-tax annuities and life insurance (through TIAA Life), 529 college savings plans, Coverdell Education Savings Accounts, financial planning, and trust and investment management (through TIAA Trust Company, FSB). These investments are offered to the general public, and TIAA is no longer limited to the academic community.[4]
On the institutional side, TIAA Asset Management serves institutional investors and intermediaries, including registered investment advisors, investment-only defined contribution platforms and broker/dealers.
While TIAA is considered to be an academic pension option at universities in the US, it is not associated with the concept of unions or organized labor (which traditionally sought and protected the pensions of workers in the US). So, if a worker's lifetime pension is affected at a university, TIAA is not operated as a party involved in labor-management or management-management disputes.
History[edit]
In 1918, Andrew Carnegie and his Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, under the leadership of Henry S. Pritchett, created the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America (TIAA), a fully funded system of pensions for professors. Funding was provided by a combination of grants from the foundation and Carnegie Corporation of New York, as well as ongoing contributions from participating institutions and individuals.
In 1921, the policyholders voted to nominate Professor Samuel M. Lindsay of Columbia University to represent them on the TIAA board of trustees. Policyholder representation on the TIAA board was consistent with the Carnegie Foundation desire that educators assume a role in running the organization.[4]
Conservative investing allowed TIAA to survive the 1929 stock market crash and the Great Depression.
In 1933, Albert Einstein became a participant, a fact that TIAA–CREF later used in a notable 2001 advertising campaign.[5]
After World War II, in reaction to rising inflation and lengthening life expectancies, and a dramatic expansion of the education sector with the G.I. Bill, TIAA recognized the need for its participants to invest in equities in order to diversify their retirement funds. In 1952, TIAA created the College Retirement Equities Fund (CREF), a variable annuity, for that purpose.[citation needed]
On June 15, 2007, TIAA became one of the first U.S. companies to voluntarily adopt, and the first to implement, a policyholder advisory vote on executive compensation policy.
On August 12, 2008, TIAA–CREF announced the opening of a new office in London. The office will be staffed by local investment professionals who will extend TIAA–CREF Global Real Estate's activities in the United Kingdom and Europe.[citation needed]
On September 7, 2008, Herb Allison, the former chairman and CEO of TIAA–CREF, was tapped to lead beleaguered home mortgage backer Fannie Mae, as part of a government bailout engineered by U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson.[citation needed]




730 Third Avenue


On September 14, 2012, TIAA–CREF bought Festival Place, a shopping center in Basingstoke, England for £280 million.[citation needed]
On May 16, 2013, TIAA–CREF purchased a 50% stake in the Grand Canal Shoppes, including the Shoppes at the Palazzo, in Las Vegas for net proceeds of $410 million USD as part of a new joint venture with General Growth Properties. GGP will continue to oversee the asset management of the project.[citation needed]
On April 14, 2014, TIAA–CREF announced that it would acquire Nuveen Investments in a deal valued at $6.25 billion.[6]
On February 22, 2016, TIAA-CREF rebranded as simply TIAA as part of a new marketing and imaging campaign. CMO Connie Weaver explained that the old name was perceived by customers as being complicated, and that the new branding scheme was meant to portray a simpler and friendlier image of the organization.[7][8]
On August 8, 2016, TIAA reached a deal to buy EverBank Financial Corp. for $2.5 billion in cash.[9]
On June 12, 2017, TIAA completed the acquisition of EverBank. At the time of the press release, the combined bank's legal entity name is TIAA, FSB.[10]

TIAA, formerly TIAA—CREF (Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association—College Retirement Equities Fund), is a Fortune 100 financial services organization that is the leading retirement provider of financial services for the academic, research, medical, cultural and governmental industries. TIAA serves over 5 million active and retired employees participating at more than 15,000 institutions and has $938 billion[1] in combined assets under management with holdings in more than 50 countries (as of March 31, 2017).
Much of TIAA operates on a not-for-profit basis, with surplus returned to participants. TIAA is headquartered in New York City in the United States and has major offices in Denver, Colorado; Charlotte, North Carolina; and Dallas, Texas; as well as seventy local offices throughout the U.S.. In 2016, TIAA ranked 82nd on Fortune's list of the 500 largest corporations in America.[2] As of 2016, TIAA is the largest global investor in agriculture, the 2nd largest grower of wine grapes in the United States (by acreage), and the 3rd largest commercial real estate manager in the world.[1]

Profile[edit]
TIAA was created to replace the system of free pensions provided by Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching for professors. When the original fund proved inadequate, TIAA was created in an Act of the New York State Legislature in 1918 as a stock life insurance company for the purpose of providing retirement income for professors through fixed premium guaranteed deferred annuity contracts. Later, in 1952, CREF was created to allow professors to invest in the stock market through the nation's first variable annuity. Its core business continues to be retirement plan administration and annuity products. It is by far the largest manager of employer-sponsored 403(b) tax-sheltered annuity plans, a defined contribution retirement plan for employees of 501(c)(3) educational, religious, and charitable organizations. The company also offers 401(k) and 457 plans, Keogh plans, and Supplemental Retirement Plans. Contributions from these plans are typically invested in the company's traditional or variable annuities or its line of mutual funds.
In recent years the company has greatly expanded its capabilities and advisory services and broadened clients' investment choices. Internally it has focused on developing customer support IT infrastructure and leadership development.[3]
At the retail level, TIAA offers Traditional and Rollover Individual Retirement Accounts, Roth IRAs, mutual funds, after-tax annuities and life insurance (through TIAA Life), 529 college savings plans, Coverdell Education Savings Accounts, financial planning, and trust and investment management (through TIAA Trust Company, FSB). These investments are offered to the general public, and TIAA is no longer limited to the academic community.[4]
On the institutional side, TIAA Asset Management serves institutional investors and intermediaries, including registered investment advisors, investment-only defined contribution platforms and broker/dealers.
While TIAA is considered to be an academic pension option at universities in the US, it is not associated with the concept of unions or organized labor (which traditionally sought and protected the pensions of workers in the US). So, if a worker's lifetime pension is affected at a university, TIAA is not operated as a party involved in labor-management or management-management disputes.
History[edit]
In 1918, Andrew Carnegie and his Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, under the leadership of Henry S. Pritchett, created the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America (TIAA), a fully funded system of pensions for professors. Funding was provided by a combination of grants from the foundation and Carnegie Corporation of New York, as well as ongoing contributions from participating institutions and individuals.
In 1921, the policyholders voted to nominate Professor Samuel M. Lindsay of Columbia University to represent them on the TIAA board of trustees. Policyholder representation on the TIAA board was consistent with the Carnegie Foundation desire that educators assume a role in running the organization.[4]
Conservative investing allowed TIAA to survive the 1929 stock market crash and the Great Depression.
In 1933, Albert Einstein became a participant, a fact that TIAA–CREF later used in a notable 2001 advertising campaign.[5]
After World War II, in reaction to rising inflation and lengthening life expectancies, and a dramatic expansion of the education sector with the G.I. Bill, TIAA recognized the need for its participants to invest in equities in order to diversify their retirement funds. In 1952, TIAA created the College Retirement Equities Fund (CREF), a variable annuity, for that purpose.[citation needed]
On June 15, 2007, TIAA became one of the first U.S. companies to voluntarily adopt, and the first to implement, a policyholder advisory vote on executive compensation policy.
On August 12, 2008, TIAA–CREF announced the opening of a new office in London. The office will be staffed by local investment professionals who will extend TIAA–CREF Global Real Estate's activities in the United Kingdom and Europe.[citation needed]
On September 7, 2008, Herb Allison, the former chairman and CEO of TIAA–CREF, was tapped to lead beleaguered home mortgage backer Fannie Mae, as part of a government bailout engineered by U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson.[citation needed]




730 Third Avenue


On September 14, 2012, TIAA–CREF bought Festival Place, a shopping center in Basingstoke, England for £280 million.[citation needed]
On May 16, 2013, TIAA–CREF purchased a 50% stake in the Grand Canal Shoppes, including the Shoppes at the Palazzo, in Las Vegas for net proceeds of $410 million USD as part of a new joint venture with General Growth Properties. GGP will continue to oversee the asset management of the project.[citation needed]
On April 14, 2014, TIAA–CREF announced that it would acquire Nuveen Investments in a deal valued at $6.25 billion.[6]
On February 22, 2016, TIAA-CREF rebranded as simply TIAA as part of a new marketing and imaging campaign. CMO Connie Weaver explained that the old name was perceived by customers as being complicated, and that the new branding scheme was meant to portray a simpler and friendlier image of the organization.[7][8]
On August 8, 2016, TIAA reached a deal to buy EverBank Financial Corp. for $2.5 billion in cash.[9]
On June 12, 2017, TIAA completed the acquisition of EverBank. At the time of the press release, the combined bank's legal entity name is TIAA, FSB.[10]

DEFINITION of 'TIAA-CREF'
 A nonprofit organization that provides investment and insurance services for those working in education, medicine, culture and research. TIAA-CREF, short for Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association - College Retirement Equities Fund, has a history that dates back to the late Andrew Carnegie, whose Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching created the initial organization in order to service the pension needs of professors.
As of late 2005, the TIAA-CREF had more than 15,000 clients, amounting to more than $360 billion in assets under management. Its clients are predominantly institutional and come from the nonprofit and educational sectors. The firm started as a pension administration business, and the core operations of the TIAA-CREF remain geared toward retirement plan administration and a line of annuity products.

BREAKING DOWN 'TIAA-CREF'
In 2016, TIAA-CREF rebranded itself as TIAA to portray a simpler and cleaner image while acknowledging the company's 100-year history. The company continues to offer services to customers such as  individual retirement accounts (IRAs), mutual funds, annuities, brokerage,   529 plans, insurance, banking, home loans and estate planning.
The Addition of CREF
While the creation of TIAA in 1918 as a means of providing guaranteed lifetime income and insurance was a groundbreaking new resource for teachers and educators, it was the establishment of CREF in 1952 that started the company on the road to becoming a diverse financial services firm. Citing rapidly increasingly life expectancies, CREF allowed individuals the opportunity to add equity investments to their personal portfolios through a variable annuity product. It was designed to use the higher expected returns of stocks to help stretch out the retirement income streams of workers. Fortune Magazine described CREF as "the biggest development in the insurance investment business since the passage of the Social Security Act in 1935."
Innovative Product Offerings
TIAA has demonstrated a history of accepting investment strategies before the strategies became mainstream. In 1979, the company was one of the first to utilize a broad portfolio of international stocks as part of its investment strategy. In 1990, it added the CREF Social Choice Account to its lineup, giving customers a socially responsible investing option. In 1995, TIAA offered individuals the ability to invest in directly owned real estate properties. In 1998, the company entered the 529 marketplace.
Solid Investment Results
TIAA has received much recognition for the performance of many of its products. The company operates the 529 programs for 10 different states, including the highly ranked plans from California, Michigan and Minnesota. TIAA Investments was awarded Lipper's Best Overall Large Fund Company recognition based on the three-year, risk-adjusted performance across multiple asset classes among 37 mutual fund families. TIAA also received the U.S. Lipper Fund Award for Best Mixed Assets Large Fund Company, the top ranking among 39 mutual fund families eligible for the award.

				Your retirement. Their college. Our help.
			 
		






With college for the kids (or grandkids) plus retirement coming, think about this: skipping $20,000 in retirement contributions from age 50 to 55 could leave you with $85,000 less by age 67.1
That big difference for tomorrow is a good reason to talk to us today. Our Financial Professionals have advice on ways to pay for college—from financial aid and scholarships (even unusual ones, like in this video) to accounts that you, your family or anyone else can contribute to. All while staying on track for retirement and balancing the rest of your financial life.
Just like college, education is the key. Explore this page to learn more, then talk to a Financial Professional today.
1 For illustrative purposes only. Based on five years of a 4% dollar-for-dollar company matching contribution on a $100,000 annual salary and hypothetical 6% rate of return compounded over 17 years.

Save a little more today, 


	  

	  for the things you’ll love forever.

	  
Think about the things you love to do the most. Would you ever want to give them up? That’s the tough financial choice a lot of us could face when we retire. But if we start saving a little more today – even 1% more of our annual income – we could keep doing all the things we love.
It’s all part of Prudential’s goal to help everyone reach their own goals for retirement. We can help with everything from mutual funds to annuities to life insurance. And you can check out our tools for helpful insights on Social Security, ideal places to retire, and more.
Want to see how we can help you? Great – let’s keep going.

How did we calculate this?
 To calculate how many years it might take to spend your guessed amount 
              in retirement, we used your age, years until retirement, and inflation rate 
              of 3%, and average spending data from the 2012 Expenditure Survey.

Based on national spending averages,
$1,500,000 will likely be spent by the age of 76.
How did we calculate this?
 Come up a little short? Guessing how much money you might
            need 
            to save for retirement that could last 30 or 40 years
            is pretty hard. 
            A good place to start: Think about how
            many years you may live in 
            retirement and how much income
            you'll need each year.

There are two steps you can take to help

Disclaimers: The 1983 Social Security Amendments included a provision to raise the full retirement age gradually to 67, beginning with people born in 1938 or later. The FRA for those born prior to 1943 is 65 and are past the mandated distribution age. For those between 1955 and 1959 the FRA goes up in increments of 2 months beyond age 66. For example the FRA for those born in 1955 is 66 and 2 months, for those born in 1956 is 66 and 4months, and so on. Source: http://www.socialsecurity.gov/planners/retire/agereduction.html

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
