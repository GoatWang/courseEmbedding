JOIN THE LISTClickFIND A STOREFaces Of Nascar: A Pictorial Tribute To America's Greatest Sportby Robinson, ScottThe action on the track isn't the only story in NASCAR. In a sport that has trancended its "playing field" to become a cultural phenomenon, NASCAR racing has become as much about the star driver, the grizzled crew chief, the calculating team owner, the hard-working pit crew, the skilled hands back at the race shop, and the die-hard fans as it is about brightly colored cars speeding by at 200 mph. Through evocative candid portrait photography from the lens of Scott Robinson, Faces of NASCAR explores the full spectrum of people involved in the Nextel Cup series, from drivers to officials to spectators. Each subject is photographed in a striking portrait, with incredible detail. Robinson's simple, yet powerful photographic portrayals highlight the passion, intensity, and joy these racing diehards feel when they are spending the weekend at the track. A must-have for any NASCAR fan, Faces of NASCAR speaks to the human side of this exciting and fascinating sport through these portraits as well as commentary from those who love this sport most.History, PictorialCondition: --HPB condition ratingsNew: Item is brand new, unused and unmarked, in flawless condition.Fine/Like New (F): No defects, little usage.
