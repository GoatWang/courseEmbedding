Kraft Sells Celestial Seasonings - tribunedigital-chicagotribune




 



Kraft Sells Celestial SeasoningsDecember 08, 1987|By John Gorman.Thomas J. Lipton Inc. has agreed to buy the Celestial Seasonings tea unit from Kraft Inc. for an undisclosed amount.Sources said Lipton might pay up to $60 million for the specialty tea firm based in Boulder, Colo. Kraft, based in Glenview, paid about $40 million for Celestial Seasonings in July, 1984.A Kraft spokesman said that selling the tea unit is part of a company strategy to get out of the beverage business. Earlier this fall, Kraft said it was selling its citrus juice business in Lakeland, Fla., to Early Industries Inc. of Los Angeles for an undisclosed price.John Bierbusse, an analyst with A.G. Edwards Inc. in St. Louis, said Celestial Seasonings may fit better with Lipton, which is based in Englewood Cliffs, N.J., and is a subsidiary of Unilever N.V.``Celestial Seasonings was doing well off and on with Kraft, but there was always a question of figuring out whether the brand could be extended into other product categories,`` Bierbusse said. ``There was speculation that the name could be brought into the spice business, but that never happened.``Bierbusse said Kraft`s decision to sell Celestial Seasonings, coming after last week`s announcement that it was selling its Duracell battery business, suggests that Kraft ``is taking a serious look at its business mix.````Kraft management is showing more energy than a lot of people had given them credit,`` Bierbusse said. Sources said Kraft might get as much as $1.2 billion for Duracell.Kraft bought Celestial Seasonings, which has 220 employees, after watching its sales soar to $27 million in 1983. Kraft has not disclosed the unit`s sales since it bought it.Among the products made by Celestial Seasonings are such concoctions as Hibiscus Herb, Red Zinger, Morning Thunder and Sleepytime Tea.The companies said the transaction is expected to be completed after Jan. 1.
