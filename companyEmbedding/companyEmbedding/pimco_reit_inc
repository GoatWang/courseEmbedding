We estimate that our net proceeds from the initial public offering of our 
common stock, after deducting the underwriting discount and our estimated 
offering and organizational expenses, will be approximately $         million 
(based on the offering price of $         per share set forth on the cover of 
this prospectus). We estimate that our net proceeds will be approximately $
million if the underwriters exercise their overallotment option in full. 

Concurrently with this offering, we also expect to sell $         million of 
shares of our common stock to certain members of our senior management team and
certain other executives of PIMCO and its affiliates in a private placement, at
the initial public offering price per share, resulting in aggregate net 
proceeds of $         million (or $         million if the underwriters 
exercise their overallotment option in full). No underwriting discount or 
commission is payable in connection with the concurrent private placement. 

We intend to contribute the net proceeds of this offering and the concurrent 
private placement to our subsidiaries, which in turn will use a significant 
portion of the net proceeds to purchase Agency MBS, subject to our investment 
guidelines and to the extent consistent with maintaining our REIT qualification
and our exemption from the 1940 Act. 

The balance of the proceeds will be used to acquire other assets in accordance 
with our objectives and strategies described in this prospectus. We believe the
depth and liquidity of the MBS market will allow us to invest a significant 
portion of our remaining capital in a relatively short period of time. However,
until appropriate assets can be identified for the net proceeds, our Manager 
may invest the net proceeds from this offering and the concurrent private 
placement in interest-bearing short-term investments and/or funds that may 
invest in similar investments (which subject to our conflicts of interest 
policy may include funds managed by PIMCO or its affiliates provided that any 
additional fees payable to PIMCO attributable to our equity investment in such 
funds are credited against any base management or incentive fees payable by us 
or otherwise rebated to us), including money market accounts, that are 
consistent with our intention to qualify as a REIT. These interest-bearing 
short-term investments are expected to provide a lower net return than we will 
seek to achieve from our Target Assets.


Our profitability depends, in large part, on our ability to acquire our Target
Assets at attractive prices. We are subject to significant competition in 
acquiring our Target Assets. In particular, we will compete with a variety 
of institutional investors, including other REITs, specialty finance companies,
public and private funds, commercial and investment banks, hedge funds, 
mortgage bankers, commercial finance and insurance companies, governmental 
bodies and other financial institutions. We may also compete with PIMCO and 
its affiliates for investment opportunities. There are various conflicts of 
interest in our relationship with PIMCO and its affiliates, including our 
Manager, which could result in decisions that are not in the best interests 
of our stockholders. In addition, there are several REITs with similar 
investment objectives, including a number that have been recently formed, 
and others may be organized in the future. These other REITs will increase 
competition for the available supply of commercial mortgage and other real 
estate-related assets suitable for purchase or origination. Some of our 
anticipated competitors have greater financial resources, access to lower 
costs of capital and access to funding sources that may not be available to 
us, such as funding from the U.S. Government, if we are not eligible to 
participate in programs established by the U.S. Government. In addition, 
some of our competitors are not subject to the operating constraints 
associated with REIT tax compliance or maintenance of an exemption from the 
1940 Act. Furthermore, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances
or different risk assessments, which could allow them to consider a wider 
variety of investments, or pay higher prices, than we can. Current market 
conditions may attract more competitors, which may increase the competition 
for our Target Assets. An increase in the competition for such assets may 
increase the price of such assets, which may limit our ability to generate 
attractive risk-adjusted returns for our stockholders, thereby adversely 
affecting the market price of our common stock. 

In the face of this competition, we expect to have access to our Manager’s 
and its affiliates’ professionals and their industry expertise, which we 
believe will provide us with a competitive advantage and help us assess 
investment risks and determine appropriate pricing for potential investments. 
We expect that these relationships will enable us to compete more efficiently
and effectively for attractive investment opportunities. In addition, we 
believe that current market conditions may have adversely affected the 
financial condition of certain competitors. Thus, not having a legacy 
portfolio may also enable us to compete more effectively for attractive 
investment opportunities. Although we believe we are well positioned to 
compete effectively in each facet of our business, there can be no assurance 
that we will be able to achieve our business goals or expectations due to the 
extensive competition in our market sector. We operate in a competitive market 
for investment opportunities and future competition may limit our ability to 
acquire desirable investments in our Target Assets and could also affect the 
pricing of these securities.


Company Description
We are a newly organized real estate finance company that intends to acquire, 
manage and finance, directly or through our subsidiaries, Agency MBS, Non-
Agency RMBS, CMBS, residential and commercial real estate loans, other 
commercial real estate debt, residential and commercial real estate and


 other 
real estate-related assets. We refer to all of the above assets as our Target 
Assets. Our objective is to seek to provide attractive risk-adjusted returns 
to stockholders over the long term, primarily through dividends and 
distributions and secondarily through capital appreciation, by investing, 
directly or indirectly, principally in our Target Assets. We will seek to 
employ a flexible and relative value focused investment strategy and expect to 
reallocate capital from time to time among our Target Assets. We believe this 
flexibility will enable us to more efficiently manage risk and deliver 
attractive risk-adjusted returns under a variety of market conditions and 
economic cycles. 

We will be externally managed and advised by PIMCO REIT Management, LLC, our 
Manager. We are organized as a Maryland corporation and intend to elect and 
qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, commencing with our 
taxable year ending December 31, 2011. We generally will not be subject to U.S.
federal income taxes on our taxable income to the extent that we annually 
distribute all of our taxable income to stockholders and maintain our intended 
qualification as a REIT. We also intend to operate our business in a manner 
that will permit us to maintain our exemption from registration under the 
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the 1940 Act.

PIMCO REIT knows there are no guarantees in life, but there are a few in real estate investment. Formed in 2011 to qualify as a real estate investment trust, or REIT, PIMCO REIT is looking to acquire, manage, and finance commercial and residential mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by the agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The company may also acquire mortgage-backed securities not guaranteed by these agencies, as well as commercial real estate loans and assets. PIMCO REIT is externally managed by PIMCO REIT Management, a subsidiary of fund manager Pacific Investment Management Company, or PIMCO. In connection to its formation, the REIT also filed an initial public offering. It withdrew the filing in 2016.

Strategy & Benefits

Key Benefits
You know that TRADING is different than investing. But the opportunity to take advantage of short-term trends is only won, if you get the direction right.
Whether you’re a bull or a bear, Direxion is with you. Our leveraged ETFs are powerful tools built to help you:

Magnify your short-term perspective with daily 3X leverage
Go where there’s opportunity, with bull and bear funds for both sides of the trade; and
Stay agile – with liquidity to trade through rapidly changing markets

Leveraged and inverse ETFs pursue daily leveraged investment objectives which means they are riskier than alternatives which do not use leverage. They seek daily goals and should not be expected to track the underlying index over periods longer than one day. They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by investors who understand leverage risk and who actively manage their investments.







Target Index

The MSCI US REIT Index (RMS G) is a free float-adjusted market capitalization weighted index that is comprised of equity real estate investment trusts (“REITs”) that are included in the MSCI US Investable Market 2500 Index, with the exception of specialty equity REITs that do not generate a majority of their revenue and income from real estate rental and leasing operations. The Index represents approximately 99% of the U.S. REIT universe. One cannot directly invest in an index.

* The Net Expense Ratio includes management fees, other operating expenses and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses. If Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses were excluded, the Net Expense Ratio would be 0.95%.  The Funds’ Adviser, Rafferty Asset Management, LLC (“Rafferty”) has entered into an Operating Expense Limitation Agreement with each Fund, under which Rafferty has contractually agreed to cap all or a portion of its management fee and/or reimburse each Fund for Other Expenses through September 1, 2018, to the extent that the Fund’s Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses exceed 0.95% of the Fund’s daily net assets other than the following:  taxes, swap financing and related costs, acquired fund fees and expenses, dividends or interest on short positions, other interest expenses, brokerage commissions and extraordinary expenses. If these expenses were included, the expense ratio would be higher.
The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.

Strategy & Benefits

Key Benefits
You know that TRADING is different than investing. But the opportunity to take advantage of short-term trends is only won, if you get the direction right.
Whether you’re a bull or a bear, Direxion is with you. Our leveraged ETFs are powerful tools built to help you:

Magnify your short-term perspective with daily 3X leverage
Go where there’s opportunity, with bull and bear funds for both sides of the trade; and
Stay agile – with liquidity to trade through rapidly changing markets

Leveraged and inverse ETFs pursue daily leveraged investment objectives which means they are riskier than alternatives which do not use leverage. They seek daily goals and should not be expected to track the underlying index over periods longer than one day. They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by investors who understand leverage risk and who actively manage their investments.







Target Index

The MSCI US REIT Index (RMS G) is a free float-adjusted market capitalization weighted index that is comprised of equity real estate investment trusts (“REITs”) that are included in the MSCI US Investable Market 2500 Index, with the exception of specialty equity REITs that do not generate a majority of their revenue and income from real estate rental and leasing operations. The Index represents approximately 99% of the U.S. REIT universe. One cannot directly invest in an index.

The Direxion Daily MSCI Real Estate Bull and Bear 3X Shares seek daily investment results, before fees and expenses, of 300%, or 300% of the inverse (or opposite), of the performance of the MSCI US REIT Index. There is no guarantee the funds will meet their stated investment objective.
These leveraged ETFs seek a return that is 300% or -300% of the return of their benchmark index for a single day. The funds should not be expected to provide three times or negative three times the return of the benchmark’s cumulative return for periods greater than a day.

Strategy & Benefits

Key Benefits
You know that TRADING is different than investing. But the opportunity to take advantage of short-term trends is only won, if you get the direction right.
Whether you’re a bull or a bear, Direxion is with you. Our leveraged ETFs are powerful tools built to help you:

Magnify your short-term perspective with daily 3X leverage
Go where there’s opportunity, with bull and bear funds for both sides of the trade; and
Stay agile – with liquidity to trade through rapidly changing markets

Leveraged and inverse ETFs pursue daily leveraged investment objectives which means they are riskier than alternatives which do not use leverage. They seek daily goals and should not be expected to track the underlying index over periods longer than one day. They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by investors who understand leverage risk and who actively manage their investments.







Target Index

The MSCI US REIT Index (RMS G) is a free float-adjusted market capitalization weighted index that is comprised of equity real estate investment trusts (“REITs”) that are included in the MSCI US Investable Market 2500 Index, with the exception of specialty equity REITs that do not generate a majority of their revenue and income from real estate rental and leasing operations. The Index represents approximately 99% of the U.S. REIT universe. One cannot directly invest in an index.

* The Net Expense Ratio includes management fees, other operating expenses and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses. If Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses were excluded, the Net Expense Ratio would be 0.95%.  The Funds’ Adviser, Rafferty Asset Management, LLC (“Rafferty”) has entered into an Operating Expense Limitation Agreement with each Fund, under which Rafferty has contractually agreed to cap all or a portion of its management fee and/or reimburse each Fund for Other Expenses through September 1, 2018, to the extent that the Fund’s Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses exceed 0.95% of the Fund’s daily net assets other than the following:  taxes, swap financing and related costs, acquired fund fees and expenses, dividends or interest on short positions, other interest expenses, brokerage commissions and extraordinary expenses. If these expenses were included, the expense ratio would be higher.
The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.

 The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost; current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance for one year and under are cumulative, not annualized. Short term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. For additional information, see the fund(s) prospectus.
Each Direxion Fund share price is calculated as of the close of regular trading, usually as of 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time, each day the New York Stock Exchange is open for business. Each fund seeks to meet its investment objective relative to the value of the target index or benchmark as of 4:00 p.m.
Shares of Direxion Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Market Price returns are based upon the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 PM Eastern time (when NAV is normally determined), and do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times. Fund returns assume that dividends and capital gains distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at NAV. Some performance results reflect expense subsidies and waivers in effect during certain periods shown. Absent these waivers, results would have been less favorable.
After-Tax and After-Tax, Post Sales Returns
Tax-adjusted returns and tax cost ratio are estimates of the impact taxes have had on a fund. We assume the highest tax rate in calculating these figures. These returns follow the SEC guidelines for calculating returns before sale of shares. Tax-adjusted returns show a fund’s annualized after tax total return for the one, three and five year periods, excluding any capital-gains effects that would result from selling the fund at the end of the period. To determine this figure, all income and short-term capital gains distributions are taxed at the maximum federal rate at the time of distribution. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a 15% rate. The after tax portion is then assumed to be reinvested in the fund. State and local taxes are not included in our calculations. For more information, please consult your tax consultant.
Distribution Dates

Payable and Ex-Date – With regard to mutual funds, this is the day on which declared distributions (dividends or capital gains) are deducted from the fund’s assets before it calculates its net asset value (NAV). The NAV per share will drop by the amount of the distribution per share.
Record Date – Date by which a shareholder must officially own shares in order to be entitled to a dividend.

Types of Distributions

Income Dividend – A portion of a company’s profit paid to common and preferred shareholders.
Long Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for more than one year.
Short Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for less than one year
