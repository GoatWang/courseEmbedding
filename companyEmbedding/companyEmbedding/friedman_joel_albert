Faculty Profile




Joel M. Friedman, Ph.D., M.D.
Professor, Department of Physiology & Biophysics
Professor, Department of Medicine
Young Men's Division Chair in Physiology




Professional Interests
Nanotechnology and Translational Research
We have developed a novel nanoparticle platform for topical and systemic drug delivery. The platform is capable of sustained delivery of therapeutic levels of nitric oxide. The high collaborative research program consists of nanoparticle platform development, platform characterization, preclinical applications including wound healing, antimicrobial therapies (MRSA, TB, Malaria), topical treatment of erectile dysfunction, hypertension and peripheral vascular disease, enhanced MRI imaging and targeted drug delivery. The goal is tissue specific drug delivery with imaging capability.
Protein Dynamics, Reactivity, Osmolytes and Solvent Slaving
We seek to understand how solvent motions modulate functionally important protein dynamics. Our approach focuses on the water surrounding the protein, the different categories of protein dynamics that contribute to functionality and how the interplay between water and protein dynamics is modulated by osmolytes.
Hemoglobin based blood substitutes and the role of NO/nitrite in the control of vasoactivity.
Dr. Friedman is the Director of the Einstein Blood Substitute Program Project which seeks through a multidisciplinary effort to create acellular hemoglobin based blood substitutes for clinical use. A major focus is on the biophysical mechanisms through which hemoglobin in the presence of nitrite can generate stable nitrosothiols that cause vasodilation.
