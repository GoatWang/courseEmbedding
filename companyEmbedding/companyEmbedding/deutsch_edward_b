Knit Fabrics
They are divided into two basic types: warp knit-fabrics such as Tricot or Double Plush and Circular-knit fabrics. Knit Fabrics tend to have a nap and run in a rib or wale direction and usually have more elasticity along the coarse than along the wale line. Depending on finishing applications and yarn types these fabrics can have a very soft feel or more of a coarse touch. Construction on these products are technical in nature and are very durable for automotive applications. We have grey, beige, and black in plain and fancy designs.
Woven Fabrics
Woven fabrics are made up of fibers linked together by alternating yarns leased together at 90 degree angles. Fabrics can be woven on Flat Woven or Velour which would have more of a Pile. The fabric rib normally runs more in a side to side or fill direction. Depending on Finishing applications and yarn types these fabrics can have a very soft feel or more of a coarse touch. We have grey, beige, and black in plain and fancy designs.
Laminated Body Cloth
A mixed assortment of woven and knitted fabrics are available with foam backing. Foam thickness varies from 1/8” to1/4” and varies from product to product. Laminated body cloth is often more desirable as it saves the trimmer from applying a foam to flat stock or final application. We have grey, beige, and black.
Non-Woven Carpets/Trunk Lining
A mixed assortment of needlepunch fabric is available at very attractive prices. Original application is for backs of seats, bolster, visor, and trunk lining, however, this versatile product can be used for a variety of applications. We have grey, beige, and black.











Product Specifications

Our yarns include acrylic, polyester, viscose, cotton, linen and polypropylene
De Leo Fabrics pass UFAC Class 1, CA 117-2013 and NFPA 260 fire codes
All De Leo fabrics are upholstery ready and most include light latex backing

OUR
BRAND (ED)
WORLD™








 
 


Vision.  Ingenuity.  Guts... It’s how you climb to the top and stay there.

Teenage entrepreneurs. A makeshift garage office. Barely a trace of seed money. From nothing, childhood friends, Jay Deutsch and Eric Bensussen, built an industry-leading global company, a first-of-its-kind Merchandise AgencyTM. And to this day, pulling off the impossible is still what separates BDA. 


    



 

Merchandise wasn't advertising. Until we arrived. 

From the very beginning, we’ve defined branded merchandise differently. This is a powerful, yet often overlooked, form of advertising. We’re the people who whisked the promotional products industry off the ground and into the stratosphere. We’re the people those other people keep trying to imitate. That’s because whether it’s running a company store, a gift with purchase campaign or a product placement on College GameDay, nobody makes it happen the best way like we do.  






 

Game changer is putting it mildly.

By now, it should be clear why we call it the power of merchandise.
 
Drive Revenue

Thump thump, thump thump. That’s the sound of us taking your goals to heart. Boosting sales, generating new revenue streams and maximizing ROI with a branded merchandise campaign that blends seamlessly with your business strategy.


Build Impressions

Tell people who you are, what you represent and why your brand is the best, hands down. Our branded merchandise drives consumer impressions an average of six months longer than our competitors. Now that’s endurance.


Increase Advocates

Want your customers chanting, “This is my brand! This is who I am!” on the inside? You’ve come to the right place. We’ll help ignite your brand community with tangible results.


Motivate Employees

Invest in your employees and watch how it fuels the company’s success. From onboarding kits to custom apparel to inspiring awards programs, branded merchandise will help motivate the lifeblood of your business.


Generate B2B Growth

Nurture your integral business partnerships while building awareness, generating leads and closing new sales. We’re a full-fledged idea factory for self-promotions, tradeshow and event giveaways, holiday gifts and more.


  


 

You have needs. We can exceed them.

That’s the beauty of being an agency that wears many hats. 


Which hat do you wear?

 Marketing: Generating awareness, increasing revenue and creating brand loyalists. 
 Procurement: Supply chain visibility, quality assurance and on-time delivery, every time. 





Which hat do you wear?

 Marketing: Generating awareness, increasing revenue and creating brand loyalists. 
 Procurement: Supply chain visibility, quality assurance and on-time delivery, every time. 



 

We make the complex look simple.

How? For starters, by doing the work ourselves. When you trust us with your brand, it’s really us.
 
Reduce Costs

Our sourcing pros ensure you realize unbeatable hard and soft cost savings. We’ve assembled a diverse network of preferred suppliers and manufacturers, with an expectation that each performs as a valued partner, not simply a provider of goods.


Control Quality

Protecting your brand is more than just our highest priority — it’s the law. We are 100% compliant with U.S. and international laws surrounding product safety, child labor and environmental protection. You’re in safe hands.


Deliver on Time

Even the most ingenious, spot-on product is a failure if it isn’t delivered on time. Our promise is perfect product, superior customer service and on-time delivery — every time. And our clients love us for it.


Source Globally

Between our offices in North America, the Philippines, China, and the UK, procurement is a 24/7 enterprise. Our network of extensively vetted, best-in-class suppliers and manufacturers spans the globe, allowing for 
versatile and cost-efficient solutions.


Customer Service

Behind the products and process, it’s our people who ultimately set us apart. We are invested and engaged in your business and it shows in our agency-wide commitment to providing customer service that leaves a lasting impression.


   






































Because global brands need global partners.

It’s easy to call yourself a global agency. What’s difficult is to deliver like one. 
We welcome the chance to measure our global reach against anyone. Today, we call North America, the Philippines, China, and the UK home. Tomorrow? Stay tuned. Plans are always in motion to further expand our footprint and take your brand to places it’s never been. The international demand for branded merchandise is exploding and our local market expertise opens up a world of possibilities. We’ll see you abroad.

Meet the best people in existence.

Most companies claim to have the best people. We say to them, “Keep dreaming.” Our people are second to none. They set us apart with their entrepreneurial spirit, ambition and borderline unhealthy obsession with Halloween. (Have you seen the pictures?) They come to us from the likes of Amazon, Microsoft, Nordstrom, Starbucks and the sports world, bringing energy, bold ideas and a willingness to dive into the unfamiliar. It’s our people that make BDA one of Seattle’s 100 Best Companies to Work for. From account management to design to operations, our people have a genuine passion for this business that shines through in everything we do.
