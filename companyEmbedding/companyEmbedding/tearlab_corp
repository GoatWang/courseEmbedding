TearLab is...
An objective and quantitative point-of-care diagnostic test that provides precise and predictive information. 
The TearLab Osmolarity System* is intended to measure the osmolarity of human tears to aid in the diagnosis of dry eye disease in patients suspected of having dry eye disease, in conjunction with other methods of clinical evaluation.
*TearLab is for professional in vitro diagnostic use only.

 Osmolarity: What the numbers reveal
TearLab adds data to a doctor's insight by guiding the diagnosis and management of the ocular surface.
Abnormal Osmolarity is defined by:
  An elevated reading, >300 mOsm/L, indicating loss of homeostasis.†
  OR, When the inter-eye difference is >8 mOsm/L, indicating instability of the tear film.†



Osmolarity is an important biomarker of ocular surface health 


  





 



 










   





 



 










   


 How it works
The TearLab Osmolarity Test Card, in conjunction with the TearLab Osmolarity System, provides a quick and simple method for determining tear osmolarity using nanoliter (nL) volumes of tear fluid collected directly from the eyelid margin. The Test Card is held by the Osmolarity Test Pen, for safe collection.
The TearLab Osmolarity Test utilizes a temperature-corrected impedance measurement to provide an indirect assessment of osmolarity. After applying a lot-specific calibration curve, osmolarity is calculated and displayed as a quantitative numerical value.
To learn how to perform the test, see our Training Videos.

 tearlab is predictive
TearLab has a positive predictive value of 89%.
Positive predictive value is the probability that subjects with a positive test truly have the disease.

Serial tear osmolarity measurements were performed on patients with normal and abnormal osmolarity.

Dry Eye Disease
Proper diagnosis is the first step toward relief
 Find a Doctor






 



 










 Dry eye is a disease 





 



 










 Dry eye is a multifactorial disease of the tears and ocular surface that results in symptoms of discomfort, visual disturbance, and tear film instability with potential damage to the ocular surface. It is accompanied by increased osmolarity of the tear film and inflammation of the ocular surface. 1
Dry eye is one of the most under-diagnosed ocular diseases, and yet it is the most common reason why patients go see their eye care professional.
 The value of TearLab's testing 


 
Estimated 55 million Americans with dry eye disease

 





 



 










 

Put a check mark next to the symptoms you have experienced.




Blurry vision



Redness



Burning



Itching



Light sensitivity



Excessive tearing / watery eyes



Tired eyes / eye fatigue



Stringy mucous in or around the eyes



Foreign body sensation



Contact lens discomfort



Scratchy, feeling of sand or grit in eye




YOU MAY HAVE DRY EYE
Discuss your symptoms with your doctor  Find a Doctor 


 Osmolarity
In fact, dry eye disease occurs when your eyes do not produce enough tears or produce poor quality tears. That’s why it’s essential you get your tears analyzed by your eye doctor. Only an eye doctor can properly diagnose your problem and treat it appropriately.
Your eye doctor will take a sample of tears from each eye and use the TearLab device to measure osmolarity (the saltiness of your tears). As osmolarity in your tears increase ocular surface cells become damaged. Your doctor will need an amount of tear fluid no larger than the period at the end of this sentence.



Track your osmolarity?
Download a tracker card and be sure to record your progress with each visit.

 Symptoms
Many people mistake the dry eye symptoms for allergies, climatic conditions or just “eyestrain”. While all of these may aggravate dry eye symptoms, they are not the cause.
Symptoms may include:

Blurred Vision


Stinging


Difficulty Wearing Contact Lenses


Burning


Tired Eyes


Scratchy Sensation


Tearing


Sensitivity to Light
 





 



 













 



 










 

 
Causes of Dry Eye
environmental causes Medications contact lens wear diseases refractive eye surgeries hormonal deficiencies or changes low blink rate
 



 









 

Environmental Causes
Hot, dry and/or windy climates – High altitudes – Excessive sun exposure – Central heating – Air conditioning – Hair dryers – Cigarette smoke – Air pollution – Air travel
 

 

Medications (prescription or over the counter)*
Allergy medications, especially antihistamines – Antidepressants (e.g. amitriptyline, diazepam) – Some blood pressure medications – Parkinson's medications – Birth control pills – Diuretics – Beta blockers – Sleeping pills – Many pain medications – Certain medications which regulate heart rhythm irregularities – Decongestants
*Do not stop usage or change your medications without first consulting your doctor. 

 

Contact Lens Wear
Two million individuals abandon soft contact lens wear altogether each year with nearly 50% of these contact lens "dropouts" attributing dryness or discomfort as the primary reason. 2
 

 

Diseases
Parkinson's disease – Sjögren's syndrome (an auto-immune disease) – Rheumatoid arthritis – Lupus – Lacrimal gland deficiency – Diabetes – Sarcoidosis – Stevens-Johnson syndrome – Rosacea: Facial rosacea is commonly associated with ocular rosacea, which causes conditions such as blepharitis
 

 

Refractive Eye Surgeries
Dry eye is the most common complaint or adverse event following LASIK. 3
 

 

Hormonal Deficiencies or Changes
Thyroid conditions – Hormonal changes during menopause – Decreased production of androgen – Estrogen supplementation (there are reports both of this improving dry eye conditions and worsening them) 4
 

 

Low Blink Rate
Blinking is critical in spreading tears over the surface of the eye and stimulating tear production. A chronic low blink rate is associated with dry eye symptoms. Computer use, reading, and watching TV are the three activities most commonly associated with a low blink rate.

					Full Description



TearLab Corporation, incorporated on June 5, 2002, is an in-vitro diagnostic company. The Company has commercialized a tear testing platform, the TearLab Osmolarity System, which enables eye care practitioners to test for sensitive and specific biomarkers using nanoliters of tear film at the point-of-care. The Company, through its subsidiary TearLab Research, Inc., develops technologies to enable eye care practitioners to test a range of biomarkers (chemistries, metabolites, genes and proteins) at the point-of-care.The Company's product, the TearLab Osmolarity System, enables the measurement of tear osmolarity in the doctor's office. Osmolarity is a quantitative and highly specific biomarker that has been shown to assist in the diagnosis and disease management of Dry Eye Disease (DED). The TearLab Osmolarity System consists of approximately three components: the TearLab disposable, which is a single-use microfluidic microchip; the TearLab Pen, which is a hand-held device that interfaces with the TearLab disposable, and the TearLab Reader, which is a small desktop unit that allows for the docking of the TearLab Pen and provides a quantitative reading for the operator.The Company competes with Lacrisciences, LLC, i-Med Pharma, BioLight Life Sciences Investments, RPS, Inc. and Advanced Tear Diagnostics.
