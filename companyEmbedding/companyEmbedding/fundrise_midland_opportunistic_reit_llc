History[edit]
Fundrise was founded in 2012 by brothers Ben and Dan Miller. They began working on the project in 2010 and launched before the passing of the JOBS Act which enacted securities regulation to streamline the process of equity crowdfunding in the United States.[3] Their father, Herb Miller of Western Development Corp., developed 20 million square feet of real estate based in Washington, D.C. The brothers began the company with the idea to allow residents in the D.C. area to invest in real estate development projects they were building.[2] Fundrise's first project, in the H Street NE Corridor in Washington D.C. raised $325,000 from 175 investors, where any resident of D.C. or Virginia could invest for as little as $100, making it the first crowdfunded real estate project in the United States.[2][4]
After the initial project, Fundrise was contacted by real estate companies looking to use the Fundrise platform to raise capital.[2] Soon thereafter, the company expanded its platform to allow conventional real estate investments from commercial developers across the United States.[2]
By May 2014 the company reported to have facilitated $15 million in investments involving 1,000+ investors[3] and by June of that same year had signed up more than 300 real estate companies looking to raise capital.[5][unreliable source?] One of Fundrise's most publicized investments came in January 2015 when it began offering bonds for the construction of 3 World Trade Center, the location of the third tallest tower at the site of the World Trade Center in lower Manhattan.[6] The initial offering was for $2 million of the $5 million worth of bonds purchased by Fundrise for the financing of the $1 billion project. Bonds were offered for $5,000 each with a 5% tax-free gross annual return for five years.[6][7]
Fundrise also raised more capital in its first-round of Series A investment than any other crowdfunding company, totaling $38 million.[4] Funding was led by Chinese social networking company Renren who invested $31 million of the total $38 million.[8] Additional Series A investors include Guggenheim Partners, Justin Elghanayan of Rockrose Development Corporation, and James Ratner of Forest City Enterprises.[2] By February 2015, Fundrise had commitments from six institutional investors for an additional $100 million in investment into the company's real estate offerings.[9] In October 2015, co-founder and president Daniel Miller left the company.
In February 2016, Fundrise terminated its senior accountant for allegedly attempting to extort over $1 million from the enterprise over a claim that "the company acted inappropriately concerning two real estate deals." The accountant denied the allegations of extortion and claimed that the termination was retaliation for reporting "serious fraudulant behavior." [10] The company denied the claims and hired an outside audit firm to conduct an investigation into the allegations, which ultimately concluded there was no reasonable basis to the allegations.[11][12][13][14]
On December 3, 2015, Fundrise launched the Fundrise Real Estate Investment Trust, the world's first "eREIT" or online real estate investment trust with an initial offering of $50 million pursuant to Regulation A+.[15]
The Fundrise eREIT offering provides prospective investors with the opportunity to invest in an intended portfolio of properties across the United States for a minimum of $1000. The aim of the eREIT is to use new technology to give both accredited and unaccredited investors the option to invest in US real estate. This financial offering, the first of its kind, was made possible by the expansion of Regulation A under the JOBS Act.[citation needed][16]
The company subsequently opened a second eREIT™, the Fundrise Equity REIT™, in February 2016.[11]
In December 2016, the Fundrise Income eREIT was the first company to raise $50 million, the maximum amount allowed under Regulation A. Later in December 2016, the Fundrise Growth eREIT became the second ever issuer to raise $50 million pursuant to Regulation A.[17]

History[edit]
Fundrise was founded in 2012 by brothers Ben and Dan Miller. They began working on the project in 2010 and launched before the passing of the JOBS Act which enacted securities regulation to streamline the process of equity crowdfunding in the United States.[3] Their father, Herb Miller of Western Development Corp., developed 20 million square feet of real estate based in Washington, D.C. The brothers began the company with the idea to allow residents in the D.C. area to invest in real estate development projects they were building.[2] Fundrise's first project, in the H Street NE Corridor in Washington D.C. raised $325,000 from 175 investors, where any resident of D.C. or Virginia could invest for as little as $100, making it the first crowdfunded real estate project in the United States.[2][4]
After the initial project, Fundrise was contacted by real estate companies looking to use the Fundrise platform to raise capital.[2] Soon thereafter, the company expanded its platform to allow conventional real estate investments from commercial developers across the United States.[2]
By May 2014 the company reported to have facilitated $15 million in investments involving 1,000+ investors[3] and by June of that same year had signed up more than 300 real estate companies looking to raise capital.[5][unreliable source?] One of Fundrise's most publicized investments came in January 2015 when it began offering bonds for the construction of 3 World Trade Center, the location of the third tallest tower at the site of the World Trade Center in lower Manhattan.[6] The initial offering was for $2 million of the $5 million worth of bonds purchased by Fundrise for the financing of the $1 billion project. Bonds were offered for $5,000 each with a 5% tax-free gross annual return for five years.[6][7]
Fundrise also raised more capital in its first-round of Series A investment than any other crowdfunding company, totaling $38 million.[4] Funding was led by Chinese social networking company Renren who invested $31 million of the total $38 million.[8] Additional Series A investors include Guggenheim Partners, Justin Elghanayan of Rockrose Development Corporation, and James Ratner of Forest City Enterprises.[2] By February 2015, Fundrise had commitments from six institutional investors for an additional $100 million in investment into the company's real estate offerings.[9] In October 2015, co-founder and president Daniel Miller left the company.
In February 2016, Fundrise terminated its senior accountant for allegedly attempting to extort over $1 million from the enterprise over a claim that "the company acted inappropriately concerning two real estate deals." The accountant denied the allegations of extortion and claimed that the termination was retaliation for reporting "serious fraudulant behavior." [10] The company denied the claims and hired an outside audit firm to conduct an investigation into the allegations, which ultimately concluded there was no reasonable basis to the allegations.[11][12][13][14]
On December 3, 2015, Fundrise launched the Fundrise Real Estate Investment Trust, the world's first "eREIT" or online real estate investment trust with an initial offering of $50 million pursuant to Regulation A+.[15]
The Fundrise eREIT offering provides prospective investors with the opportunity to invest in an intended portfolio of properties across the United States for a minimum of $1000. The aim of the eREIT is to use new technology to give both accredited and unaccredited investors the option to invest in US real estate. This financial offering, the first of its kind, was made possible by the expansion of Regulation A under the JOBS Act.[citation needed][16]
The company subsequently opened a second eREIT™, the Fundrise Equity REIT™, in February 2016.[11]
In December 2016, the Fundrise Income eREIT was the first company to raise $50 million, the maximum amount allowed under Regulation A. Later in December 2016, the Fundrise Growth eREIT became the second ever issuer to raise $50 million pursuant to Regulation A.[17]

LLC (the “Waypoint Austin Controlled Subsidiary”), in which we have the right to receive a preferred economic

construction of a 324-unit class-A multifamily project located at the intersection of Intersection of Colorado Sands Rd and E.
Pflugerville Parkway in Pflugerville, Texas. (the “Waypoint Austin Property”).
 


 
 
 
Aggregate with a construction loan made

equity required by the senior lender.
 
At the time of acquisition, the beginning
stages of construction were underway and included initial site preparation work. Waypoint Residential is targeting construction
to be substantially complete by Q2 2018 and stabilization anticipated Q1 2019. Following stabilization, Waypoint Residential anticipates
redeeming the Waypoint Austin Investment through proceeds from a sale of the following stabilization

History[edit]
Fundrise was founded in 2012 by brothers Ben and Dan Miller. They began working on the project in 2010 and launched before the passing of the JOBS Act which enacted securities regulation to streamline the process of equity crowdfunding in the United States.[3] Their father, Herb Miller of Western Development Corp., developed 20 million square feet of real estate based in Washington, D.C. The brothers began the company with the idea to allow residents in the D.C. area to invest in real estate development projects they were building.[2] Fundrise's first project, in the H Street NE Corridor in Washington D.C. raised $325,000 from 175 investors, where any resident of D.C. or Virginia could invest for as little as $100, making it the first crowdfunded real estate project in the United States.[2][4]
After the initial project, Fundrise was contacted by real estate companies looking to use the Fundrise platform to raise capital.[2] Soon thereafter, the company expanded its platform to allow conventional real estate investments from commercial developers across the United States.[2]
By May 2014 the company reported to have facilitated $15 million in investments involving 1,000+ investors[3] and by June of that same year had signed up more than 300 real estate companies looking to raise capital.[5][unreliable source?] One of Fundrise's most publicized investments came in January 2015 when it began offering bonds for the construction of 3 World Trade Center, the location of the third tallest tower at the site of the World Trade Center in lower Manhattan.[6] The initial offering was for $2 million of the $5 million worth of bonds purchased by Fundrise for the financing of the $1 billion project. Bonds were offered for $5,000 each with a 5% tax-free gross annual return for five years.[6][7]
Fundrise also raised more capital in its first-round of Series A investment than any other crowdfunding company, totaling $38 million.[4] Funding was led by Chinese social networking company Renren who invested $31 million of the total $38 million.[8] Additional Series A investors include Guggenheim Partners, Justin Elghanayan of Rockrose Development Corporation, and James Ratner of Forest City Enterprises.[2] By February 2015, Fundrise had commitments from six institutional investors for an additional $100 million in investment into the company's real estate offerings.[9] In October 2015, co-founder and president Daniel Miller left the company.
In February 2016, Fundrise terminated its senior accountant for allegedly attempting to extort over $1 million from the enterprise over a claim that "the company acted inappropriately concerning two real estate deals." The accountant denied the allegations of extortion and claimed that the termination was retaliation for reporting "serious fraudulant behavior." [10] The company denied the claims and hired an outside audit firm to conduct an investigation into the allegations, which ultimately concluded there was no reasonable basis to the allegations.[11][12][13][14]
On December 3, 2015, Fundrise launched the Fundrise Real Estate Investment Trust, the world's first "eREIT" or online real estate investment trust with an initial offering of $50 million pursuant to Regulation A+.[15]
The Fundrise eREIT offering provides prospective investors with the opportunity to invest in an intended portfolio of properties across the United States for a minimum of $1000. The aim of the eREIT is to use new technology to give both accredited and unaccredited investors the option to invest in US real estate. This financial offering, the first of its kind, was made possible by the expansion of Regulation A under the JOBS Act.[citation needed][16]
The company subsequently opened a second eREIT™, the Fundrise Equity REIT™, in February 2016.[11]
In December 2016, the Fundrise Income eREIT was the first company to raise $50 million, the maximum amount allowed under Regulation A. Later in December 2016, the Fundrise Growth eREIT became the second ever issuer to raise $50 million pursuant to Regulation A.[17]

On December 3, 2015, Fundrise launched the Fundrise Real Estate Investment Trust, the world's first "eREIT" or online real estate investment trust with an initial offering of $50 million pursuant to Regulation A+.[15]
The Fundrise eREIT offering provides prospective investors with the opportunity to invest in an intended portfolio of properties across the United States for a minimum of $1000. The aim of the eREIT is to use new technology to give both accredited and unaccredited investors the option to invest in US real estate. This financial offering, the first of its kind, was made possible by the expansion of Regulation A under the JOBS Act.[citation needed][16]
The company subsequently opened a second eREIT™, the Fundrise Equity REIT™, in February 2016.[11]
In December 2016, the Fundrise Income eREIT was the first company to raise $50 million, the maximum amount allowed under Regulation A. Later in December 2016, the Fundrise Growth eREIT became the second ever issuer to raise $50 million pursuant to Regulation A.[17]

Fundrise Portfolio
“Fundrise Portfolio” is the hypothetical projected return of a portfolio of commercial real estate, based the weighted average projected annual return of (a) the Fundrise Growth eREIT, for Rise Companies Corp. sponsored appreciation-focused investment products (such as joint-venture equity), based on the analysis included in the the Growth eREIT Performance Analysis, and (b) the Fundrise Income eREIT, for Rise Companies Corp. sponsored income-focused investment products (such as senior loans), based on (i) the analysis included in the Income eREIT Performance Analysis, (ii) discounted by approximately 20 – 30% to take into account potential default risks over the long-term. Accordingly, the projected annual returns under such methodology is approximately 11.95% and 8.00% for Rise sponsored appreciation focused investments and income focused investments, respectively, inclusive of appreciation and dividend reinvestment, and net of fees.
Traditional Portfolio
“Traditional Portfolio” is the hypothetical projected return of a portfolio of public equities (stocks), based on the California Public Employees Retirement System’s average annual return on public equities over the 20-year period from 1996 to 2016, which was 8.20%, inclusive of appreciation and dividend reinvestment, and net of fees.

                How Crowdfunding is Expanding the REIT Market            


    By Warren Cassell | October 21, 2016 — 8:49 AM EDT

Real estate investment companies are using new U.S. crowdfunding rules to raise additional capital for new vehicles that are generating superior returns.
Fundrise's REIT Expansion
​Fundrise, one of the pioneers of the online real estate crowdfunding industry, introduced this week, three new funds to their family of eREITs™, which  essentially are a public but non-traded REIT. The additions are the Fundrise West Coast Opportunistic REIT, Fundrise Midland Opportunistic REIT, and Fundrise East Coast Opportunistic REIT. Until now, Fundrise managed two REITs, one being income-focused and other being focused on growth, that both made investments throughout the country. However, the new REITs will each target specific geographic locations in the U.S. Income and growth will be their main investment objectives.
Fast Fundraising
Fundrise says that it has raised over $84 million from individual investors since debuting its first REIT in December 2015, and its second one a little more than five months ago. The company says it's on track to raise a total of $250 million in a little over 12 months. (See also, Is Fundrise's New eREIT Right for You?)
Strong Returns
Fundrise's Growth eREIT™ investors are earning an approximate 8% annualized dividend, while Income eREIT™ investors earn approximately 11.25% gross annualized, Jordan Sale, director of marketing at Fundrise, told Investopedia. (See also, How To Analyze Real Estate Investment Trusts.)
RealtyMogul.com’s MogulREIT I is another crowdfunded REIT that was launched this year. Like Fundrise's REITs, the MogulREIT makes debt and equity investments in various types of commercial property with an aim to distribute a steady stream of income. The REITs NAV is currently fixed until September 2017 at $10 per share, and its first dividend payout was distributed to investors earlier this month, which equates to an approximate 8% return on an annualized basis.  
To put those returns into perspective, last year the FTSE NAREIT Composite increased by only 2.05%.
Crowdfunding's Driver
Equity crowdfunding has been on the rise ever since Regulation A+ was finalized and adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) early last year. It essentially exempts companies from the need to register certain small issues of securities, and also allows them to offer those securities to non-accredited investors, helping to attract funds.

News Briefing - Crowdfunding, SME And Alternative Finance | Another Crowd



































Another Crowd
Crowdfunding and EIS Intelligence, for UK investors






You are here News Briefing - Crowdfunding, SME And Alternative Finance 


Submitted by Another Crowd on Mon, 20/06/2016 - 2:05pm




The essentials are here and will be regularly updated. If you want to be well-informed about the investment crowdfunding scene, and you're short of time, this is the place to visit.
Please register - it's free - to read our daily digest of what's happening in our world. 



Today's Briefing

1. UK – Real Estate

 
CityA.M. reports on the impact of alternative financing, including P2P crowdfunding, on the property market:
 
“UK banks have halved their lending to property developers over the past two years, in an effort to de-risk their balance sheets.
According to new data from peer-to-peer property funding platform Saving Stream, bank loans to property developers fell from £32.5bn in April 2014 to £14.9bn in April 2016.
Meanwhile, alternative financing options have entered the mainstream, as property developers seek new sources of capital.
Since the 2008 financial crash banks have been under increasing pressure to de-risk their balance sheets and reduce their debt exposure in order to meet new capital holding requirements.
According to Saving Stream lending against property development is still viewed as a ‘speculative’ investment by many risk-averse banks.
By contrast, large debt funds are able to step in with financing offers for big property developments, while peer-to-peer lenders can offer favourable terms for small and medium sized developments.
Furthermore, peer-to-peer investors are able to benefit from higher investment returns which are no longer available through banks.”
 

2. UK – Fintech

 
The Migrant reports:
 
“At the core of the current boom in fintech lies to desire to do things better than the traditional financial institutions by leveraging technology to drive down costs and improve the usability of financial products and services. This has been highly beneficial to consumers, including the migrant community in the UK.
In the UK there are now many new financial services, provided by fintech companies, which are either specifically targeted at migrants, such as Monese and WorldRemit, or are advantageous for migrants in general.”
 
The full article is available here.
 
 
3. UK – Equity
 
“Less than a week after successfully securing its initial funding goal on Seedrs, London restaurant Pronto is quickly nearing £800,000. Pronto provides healthy meals delivered hot with a 25-minute free delivery. The restaurant revealed that it is looking to create delicious, affordable, quality meals that are healthy enough to eat every day and available at the touch of a button,” reports Crowdfundinsider.
 
 
4. UK – EIS/SEIS
 
The platform iExpats, aimed at expat Brits, examines EIS/SEIS tax break investments:
 
“British investors are increasingly looking for the chance to invest in overseas companies while collecting generous tax breaks.
Lots of overseas companies have realised that the rules of British tax incentivised investment schemes apply to them as well as British start-ups and growing businesses.
The two tax breaks that cover this are the Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme (SEIS) and the Enterprise Investment Scheme (EIS).
Both offer similar breaks – but have different investment caps and rates of relief.
·       SEIS gives a 50% tax income tax refund up to a limit of £100,000 a tax year
·       EIS gives the refund at 30% up to £1 million.
Other tax breaks exempt investment growth from CGT and deal with loss relief if a company fails.”
 
The full article is available here.
 
 
5. US – Crowdfunding
 
Crowdfundinsider reports on the alternative finance equivalent of a convertible (debt to equity) bond:
 
“Earlier this month Crowdfund Insider Contributor Robin Sosnow wrote about “Simple Agreements for Future Equity”(SAFEs) and how they were quickly becoming the investment vehicle of choice for Reg CF crowdfunding portals. In brief, SAFEs are similar to convertible debt except founders are not faced with a ticking time bomb of a maturity date when they must pay back or refinance the debt.  Investors still receive the option to convert into equity at a future date and thus defer the challenges of establishing a valuation.  Sosnow, an attorney, pointed to the fact that 12 out of the 40 Reg CF issuers (at that time) were using SAFEs.  Now Republic, an offshoot of AngelList, is jumping on board with their very own version of SAFEs.
According to a note forwarded by Ken Ngyuyen, co-founder of Republic, existing security instruments are poorly suited for Title III / Reg CF crowdfunded offers. Issuing companies can be left with many small investors on their cap tables causing additional work for the small company. Some larger investors may be turned off as well if the cap table is bloated. Republic’s solution is the “Crowd SAFE”.
The Crowd SAFE is a derivative of the YCombinator SAFE.”

6. US – Real Estate
 
Crowdfuninsider reports the launch of three new eREITs
 
“Fundrise filed three more 1-A’s with the SEC indicating its intent to expand its service of providing access to real estate investment to a wider audience under Reg A+.  Currently Fundrise is offering two different “eREITs” to investors. The first, the Income eREIT, focusses on quarterly dividend income and invests specifically in debt.  The second and newer vehicle is the Growth eREIT that focuses on equity and is naturally more riskier than the prior eREIT but expected returns may be higher.
The three new filings on the SEC site appear to be more geographic in focus. The three LLCs are as follows:
·       Fundrise West Coast Opportunistic REIT
·       Fundrise Midland Opportunistic REIT
·       Fundrise East Coast Opportunistic REIT
According to the offering circulars, West Coast will invest in and manage a diversified portfolio primarily consisting of investments in multifamily rental properties and development projects located primarily in the Los Angeles, San Francisco, San Diego, Seattle, WA, and Portland, OR. Midlands will target multifamily rental properties and development projects located primarily in the Houston, Dallas, Austin, Chicago, and Denver. The East Coast fund will invest in similar properties in the states of Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia and Florida.
Each LLC hopes to raise up to $50 million, the maximum amount under Reg A+ with price per share of $10 and a minimum purchase of 100 shares.  As no properties are yet in any of these portfolio holdings these are blind pool investments. In the past Fundrise has updated investors on a rolling basis as suitable investments are added to each eREIT.”

7. US – FinTech
 
Institutional Investor runs a blog proclaiming that bankers are all set to embrace FinTech on the principle that it can’t be beaten, so should be joined…
 
 
8. International – FinTech
 
Caitlin Klevorick surveys the FinTech scene in TechCrunch:
 
“Here’s what we know. These signals are actually the chaotic realities of a space that is maturing. Yes, government regulation is on its way, but that doesn’t mean the sky is falling.
Compliance and transparency within markets are good things. Consumer protections are good things. So while many have focused on the role that regulations may play in the industry — with clear fears that government may stifle innovation in the face of this turmoil — the truth is much more complicated.
At heart, the competitive advantages in fintech are the same as the rest of the startup world, with the same power and purpose of “disruption” — better technology, faster iteration and more empathy for users. Regulatory arbitrage, if it ever truly existed within finance, is not a defensible business strategy: product quality, customer outreach and lower cost structures are.
Clear, more specific regulations are forthcoming, but to think it will be the downfall of the industry is naïve.”
 
The full article is available here.
 
 
9. International – FinTech
 
A reprise of a recent report in Singapore’s Business Times:
 
“The Singapore Fintech Consortium and the Fintech Center of Korea, have signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to work more closely in support of emerging technology in the financial sector. The Singapore group posted a brief statement on the arrangement;
We are pleased to sign an MOU with FinTech Center of Korea under which the two institutions will provide proper aid to fintech companies from the partner country.
The formal signing took place at the Echelon Asia Summit this week in Singapore.
Speaking to the Business Times, Gerben Visser, co-founder and managing partner of the Singapore Fintech Consortium, stated;
“It’s very encouraging to see cohesion between the various players in the South Korean fintech ecosystem, comprising the government, regulators, entrepreneurs and the private sector.”
 
10. International – P2P
 
LiveMint examines the regulatory framework of India’s nascent P2P industry.
 
“The consultation paper on peer-to-peer (P2P) lending, released by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in late April, proposes a balanced approach to help P2P players flourish as well as safeguard them from various risks of business fallouts.
The concept, which started with only individuals as participants, now includes micro, small and medium-sized businesses, proprietors and retailers. Through partnerships with leading banks, P2P lending is now moving towards offline channels. According to Morgan Stanley research, P2P lending is estimated to increase to $290 billion globally, growing at an expected compound annual growth rate of 51%.
RBI has proposed six key areas to frame the regulatory guidelines around P2P lending. These include permitted activity; reporting, prudential and governance requirements; business continuity planning and customer interface.”
