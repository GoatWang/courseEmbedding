About RealtyShares
Founded by Nav Athwal, RealtyShares is a crowdfunding website for real estate developments that claims to help you diversify your portfolio and invest in pre-screened and professionally managed residential, commercial, retail, and mixed-use projects. Not only does RealtyShares claim to help you purchase shares in private real estate investments, but the company also claims to help companies access a new source of funding to raise capital for their investments.
How Does RealtyShares Claim To Work?
By now, you’re almost certainly familiar with crowdfunding sites like Kickstarter, Indiegogo, GoFundMe, and Booster.com, which help people raise money for their business ventures and personal needs. Using these websites, all you have to do is list your project, and if other people are interested in helping you out, they can contribute as much money as they’re comfortable with.
Recently though, a new era of crowdfunding has entered the market with websites like RealtyShares, which claims to serve two primary purposes: 1) to help accredited investors invest in a variety of real estate projects, and 2) help companies fund their real estate projects without having to go through traditional banks or other large lenders.
Since coming online in late 2013, RealtyShares has garnered quite a lot of media attention, having been featured on the Wall Street Journal, Forbes, CNN Money, Business Times, and more, due in no small part to their claimed focus on helping individuals invest in real estate projects from their living rooms, and giving them everything they need to invest intelligently.
In short, RealtyShares acts as a centralized area where companies who need funds for their private real estate projects can meet with investors who are willing to purchase shares in these projects. And according to the company, they give you the ability to make real estate investments in 5 simple steps:

Sign up for a RealtyShares account.
Browse investments securely. If you find one you’re interested in, you’ll then be able to access a detailed page explaining the offering, including “financials, property information, legal and financial documents and investment manager bios.”
Finalize your investment directly through the RealtyShares website. The company even claims all documents can be signed electronically using DocuSign and funds can be transferred via Balanced.
Next, each investment comes with a specific funding goal that must be met before you officially own a share. While you’re waiting for this to occur, your money will be held in an FDIC insured escrow account. And if this goal isn’t reached, then 100% of your money will be refunded.
All RealtyShares members have access to a personalized dashboard where you can monitor your investments and returns and manage your documents. You’ll also receive quarterly updates about the project via email, and tax documents are provided once per year.

You’ve worked diligently over the years to make smart investment decisions, and this new breed of real estate crowdfunding websites has piqued your interest, but you’re wondering if they’re ultimately worth your time, or are just a passing fad. After all, you invest carefully and aren’t in the habit of losing your hard-earned money.
But is RealtyShares a company that you can count on to help you make wise investment decisions? Consider the following:
You Have Options When it Comes to Real Estate Investing
First and foremost, if you’re thinking about using a real estate crowdfunding website, keep in mind that RealtyShares isn’t your only option, as other sites such as Fundrise, Realty Mogul, CrowdStreet, Collaperty, and many more are vying for your business.
With this said, according to RealtyShares’ CEO, the company differentiates itself from other real estate crowdfunding websites by offering lower fees, complete transparency, a seamless investment process, and access to a wider range of investment opportunities.
How Much Risk Are You Willing to Take On?
Next, like any other type of investment, real estate projects come with a certain level of risk, so you’re not guaranteed to make any money. In fact, in a worst-case scenario, you could end up losing your entire investment.
Also, remember that real estate investments are not liquid, which means that your money might be tied up for long periods of time. As such, you’ll need to thoroughly vet any investment you’re thinking about becoming involved with it.
RealtyShares’ Investor Guidelines
If you’re thinking about investing in a real estate project featured on RealtyShares, the most important thing you need to know is that you must be qualified as an Accredited Investor. According to the RealtyShares FAQ, this means you must be “a natural person with (1) a net worth or joint net worth with the person’s spouse exceeding $1 million, not including the value of the primary residence, and / or (2) annual income of $200,000 in each of the two most recent years, or joint income with a spouse exceeding $300,000 for those years and a reasonable expectation of the same income in the current year.”
On top of this, you must have a minimum of $5,000 to contribute to a project, although some investments may go as low as $1,000. There is no maximum investment amount, and you can even qualify as a foreign investor.
RealtyShares’ Investment Options
If you qualify as an investor, you’ll have two options: Debt investment and equity investment.
Debt investment means that your contribution funds a loan for the company who’s responsible for the project, and depending on your level of investment, your portion of the money earned from monthly interest charges will be deposited into your account. On the other hand, an equity investment pays a percentage of cash flow from rent on a monthly basis, or on the profits if the project is sold.
Regardless of the type, each investment will come with its own ‘hold period,” which references the expected amount of time that will pass before investors recoup their money after a project has been paid off or sold. This information will be available on the project’s Investment Overview page, and can last anywhere from less than 6 months to more than 5 years.
RealtyShares’ Company Guidelines
According to the company’s website, RealtyShares only provides loans (e.g. debt investments) for 1-4 unit residential properties, and some commercial properties, such as apartment buildings. Specifically, the website’s FAQ states projects must be:

Cash-flowing/Value-Add equity investments in commercial and residential properties such as apartments, retail, office and pools of single family homes;
Equity investments in Fix & Flips located in high demand/low supply markets;
Loans secured by residential and commercial real estate.

On top of this, borrowers must have a minimum 650 credit score, a loan to purchase price of less than 80%, and an “estimated loan to after repair value (once the property is rehabbed) less than 65%.” As such, the RealtyShares will not work for construction or ground-up development projects.
On top of this, RealtyShares claims to closely screen all new projects prior to being listed, including background and credit checks, comps, projected returns, geography, property type and quality, investment structure, a knowledgeable team, and a proven track record.
Although RealtyShares doesn’t guarantee successful funding, the company claims that most projects listed are funded within 5-7 days. However, for any projects listed on RealtyShares, companies will not be able to advertise them elsewhere in order to remain in compliance with Regulation D Rule 506(b).
Finally, RealtyShares’ funding methods are claimed to help you focus on operating the investment instead of communicating with numerous investors, since all funds are pooled into a single LLC.
The Difference Between RealtyShares & REITs
When compared to REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts), RealtyShares claims to give investors the ability to choose the specific type of property or groups of properties they’d like to invest in, whereas REITs traditionally only allow you to invest in specific asset classes or projects based on geography. In addition, RealtyShares claims to charge substantially lower fees than REITs (we’ll talk more about this in a moment).
What Are Other Investors Saying About RealtyShares?
RealtyShares, Inc. has only been in business since late 2013, and there were no individual reviews available online at the time of our research.
However, most professional reviews from large websites such as Forbes and TechCrunch seem to be favorable, not just for RealtyShares, but for the growth of the real estate crowdfunding industry in general.
RealtyShares Pricing
RealtyShares is free to sign up for an account, whether you’re an individual looking to invest or a company looking for funding. However, according to the company’s FAQ, they “will charge a fee to cover ongoing investor reporting and communications for the investment,” although the specific fee for each investment can vary, and will be outlined in the project’s operating agreement.
After a project has been funded, the money is pooled and moved into an individual LLC, which is the entity that will actually provide the loan or hold equity in the investment. As such, you will be a shareholder in this LLC.
Compared to many other real estate crowdfunding websites, RealtyShares accepts Bitcoin for investments, either through Coinbase or your Bitcoin Address, although distributions will be paid in US Dollars.
In order to ask questions about fees, payments, or anything else, you can contact RealtyShares’ customer service department at 866-202-2023.
Can RealtyShares Help You Wisely Diversify Your Investment Portfolio?
Chopping to the Point: Considering the fact that RealtyShares has received a fair amount of positive media attention, that the real estate crowdfunding industry is in a growth phase, and that there aren’t any negative online reviews for the company, they appear to be a solid choice for purchasing shares in real estate projects.

Very positive experience. I've always wanted to invest in real estate, but there haven't been many great options. I was able to invest in 10 different investments (with as little as $5,000) and get exposure to diverse markets and product types.
The user experience is simple, and everything is streamlined.


Bottom Line: Yes, I would recommend this to a friend

                                            Duping investors

I invested two years ago in few offerings and so far, everything is in deep red. "Triwest" who sponsored 12954 Blairwood Dr & 12090 Chalon Rd. investment and Paragon who sponsored 1651 Gilbert Road, have stopped making payments. They have given lame excuses for delays. 
They are running a Ponzi scheme to dupe investors and RealtyShares did not do any due diligence before offering this deal and luring investors. Don't get caught in this poor dealings.


Bottom Line: No, I would not recommend this to a friend

TriWest certainly has been a disaster. Fortunately, they managed to sell the property I had investments in and made some money, but nothing like their claimed return. Even though the property sold for more than the original financial estimate.
I agree that RealtyShares does minimal due diligence. What is shocking is you can't get access to the agreement with the sponsor, only the RealtyShares LLC., you are investing in, so the real terms and conditions aren't available.
They are also easy to dupe, they did an investment that claimed it would put no debt on the property and the sponsor secretly went to another website and got another big loan on the property while claiming it was unencumbered. RealtyShares has been almost completely unresponsive to emails about issues but they certainly keep sending out emails about new opportunities.
A strong buyer beware. Not only does RealityShares do little to no due diligence, but they make it impossible for you to do so either. Go ahead and ask if the sponsor has other projects at RealityShares and they won't answer.
I went back to making my own hard money loans so I have access to the property, the borrower and can track things closely.

It seems natural to approach with caution, since most people don't have much experience with this specific concept. My experience has been very positive. RealtyShares has been very professional and responsible. Any real estate project has risks by default, but I have had no issues after making more than 35 investments using the RealtyShares platform. RealtyShares does a great job screening prospective deal sponsors; because of that, projects that might include underfunded developers, crackpots, slackers or sponsors who are challenged with planning and organization get screened out before any deal is offered on the platform. The return/risk equation has seemed promising to me on the vast majority of the deals offered. I would - and have - recommended RealtyShares to good friends.


Bottom Line: Yes, I would recommend this to a friend

RealtyShares Review: An Easier Way To Invest In Real Estate | Financial Samurai





















































Financial SamuraiSlicing Through Money's MysteriesRealtyShares Review: An Easier Way To Invest In Real Estate
Posted by Financial Samurai 76 Comments 
Real estate is one of the best asset classes to build long term wealth. As an owner of five properties, I’ve seen my net worth soar over the past 15 years as my principal values and rents have increased far beyond inflation.
I came close to buying my 6th property, but instead of taking down a Hawaiian dream home for my parents, I’ve decided to invest more surgically through RealtyShares, the leading real estate crowdsourcing platform in America.
Here are three reasons why I didn’t want to own more physical property:
1) Property taxes. I’m already paying over $50,000 a year in property taxes. If I buy another property that costs let’s say $2M, I’ll have to pay another ~$23,000 in taxes a year. That’s just way too much.
2) Dealing with bad tenants. If I were to buy this Hawaiian home, one of the plans was to rent out my parent’s old house for ~$40,000 – $50,000 a year after they moved. Tenants can be great, or they can be a real PITA. The older you get, the less you want to deal with tenants.
3) Too much financial risk. To add millions of dollars in illiquid real estate exposure near the top of the Honolulu market, when ~40% of my net worth is already exposed to real estate seems like a really bad move. It’s much better to invest smaller sums in higher yielding markets instead.

REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT SOLUTION
Given I’m no longer parting with so much cash, I’ve decided to invest some of the money in RealtyShares, a real estate crowdsourcing company based right here in San Francisco. They’ve raised over $32M in company funding from the likes of 500 Startups (top incubator), General Catalyst Partners, and Union Square Ventures in order to open up investment opportunities for accredited investors in the sub-$50M real estate market. As of May 21, 2017, they’re in the processing of closing their Series C round.
RealtyShares offers a mix of fix-and-flip loans, preferred equity and mezzanine products, joint venture equity and commercial loans. Those commercial buildings with higher returns that were once out of reach are now more readily available. So far, RealtyShares has had over $170 million go through its platform from investors like myself investing in over 2,000 properties.
So why did I decide to invest in RealtyShares rather than another real estate crowdsourcing company? A relationship. I had lunch with an old colleague who used to work at a fintech company I currently consult for. He’s now a VP of Finance at RealtyShares. We had gotten along well at his previous company and he and his colleague made me an offer I couldn’t refuse.
They are giving me $5,000 to invest in their platform. In return, I agreed to write about my experiences with their platform, good and bad, on Financial Samurai. I love the synergies of blogging!
MOBILIZING CAPITAL
The timing of this proposal was superb because not only am I passing on buying another physical property, I also have a $330,000, 4% yielding, 7-year CD expiring. Then I’ve got my final tranche of deferred compensation negotiated in 2012 hitting my bank account in 2017 as well. My main goal is to find suitable income investment replacements for these funds.
Assets that provide yield in this low interest rate environment are attractive. Just look at the 20-year bond ETF, TLT, up over 15% in the past 12 months. The same goes for VNQ, the Vanguard REIT ETF. During this same period, stocks have had a much more volatile ride, and are only up about ~5%. Past performance is not a predictor of future results. But given I believe interest rates will stay low for a long time, and given yield alternatives are so low, I want to continue allocating my cash towards high yielding investments.
I’ve started with a $10,000 RealtyShares commercial property investment and will work my way up to $25,000 – $50,000 investments in 2017 and beyond. It’s always good to start small.
Only the best deals (5%) make it through for investors to choose from
REALTYSHARES SIGN UP PROCESS
The sign up process is pretty straight forward and takes about three minutes.
Step 1: Input your first name, last name, telephone number
Step 2: Self accredit by choosing how you are accredited: income, net worth, joint income, or business
Step 3: Link a checking account or skip to first explore the various investments.
Step 4: Verify your e-mail address.
Step 5: Reach The Cooling Off period. This is a great step for all new investors. The Cooling Off period is suggested by the SEC for all investors to get comfortable with an investment before deploying capital. It’s not mandatory, just recommended. After you fill out the questionnaire, you’ll get a phone call from someone at RealtyShares to talk about the product and answer all your questions.
Examples of funded investments
GROWTH OR INCOME?
You’re either looking to invest in growth or income on the RealtyShares platform. My main focus is income given I’m satisfied with my current financial nut.
Three main investment categories:
1) Single family residential property. Target 9% – 11% annual return. You are the senior debt holder (first position on lien). The investment duration is usually 6 – 24 months and income usually paid out monthly. This product is considered their least risky investment for investors and has been around since the beginning. Roughly 40% – 45% of total investments on the platform are in this category.
2) Preferred Equity/Mezzanine debt. Target 12% – 14% annual return. You provide bridge loan for sponsors and are a lower position in the capital stack. The investment period is usually 2 -3 years. Investments are mostly in commercial property. Roughly 20% – 25% of total investments on the platform are in this category. This is where I will probably focus most of my investments since I already own single family residences.
3) Joint venture equity. Target 10% – 16% annual return. You are an equity owner alongside the sponsor and take part in profits once preferred returns are hit. Typical duration is 5 years, but can be as short as 3 years. Income is usually paid quarterly once the deal is closed. This category accounts for roughly 25% – 30% of all investments.
OTHER IMPORTANT INFORMATION
Real estate crowdsourcing is considered an Alternative asset class. Therefore, it’s recommended you only allocate as much as you feel comfortable investing in Alternatives. Although these investments are more liquid than a Hawaiian dream property, you still have to lock up your money for 6 months – 5 years. Further, there may be additional capital calls if an investment turns out to require more capital than has been committed upfront.
Many private wealth advisors recommend a 10% – 20% allocation. Meanwhile, we know that some large university endowments invest 50% or greater in Alternatives. The whole idea of investing in Alternatives is to capture outsized returns from inefficient markets.
The minimum investment is usually $5,000, but it can go as low as $1,000 for certain investment opportunities. Equity investment minimums are usually higher because there can only be a total of 99 investors per deal, and the sponsor may require more capital depending on the deal.
To generate revenue, RealtyShares take a 2.5% to 3% origination fee on the debt it raises for projects. On equity investments the company takes a cost reimbursement and makes a 1% to 2% percent management fee. That’s better than me paying a property manager one month’s rent (8.33%).
Finally, there have been 134 investments successfully completed so far, and there are currently 240+ active investments on the platform. I want to find cap rates in the Midwest or South that are over 10% compared to just 2% – 4% in SF and Honolulu for diversification purposes.
Below is a map of RealtyShares’ current investment offerings. The arrows are where I’m focused on deploying capital. Texas, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Georgia are my top picks. If anybody is from one of these states, please share how the real estate investment environment is.
Focusing my money away from expensive coastal cities
SURGICALLY DEPLOYING CAPITAL
Instead of overly concentrating new money into one very expensive property in Hawaii, I’m now going to surgically deploy capital into multiple types of investments with potentially greater returns, less hassle, and more liquidity. As of 2H2017, I’ve invested a total of $260,000 in their platform to gain more exposure to the heartland of America where real estate values are lower and yields are higher.
If you’re looking for yield in this low interest rate environment, don’t want the hassle of managing rental properties, don’t have the downpayment for a physical property, want to more easily allocate real estate dollars around the country, don’t like buying REITs or real estate ETFs that have already run, and are looking to diversify your investment portfolio with real estate exposure, take a look at the RealtyShares platform. I think you’ll be pleasantly surprised by their various investment opportunities. This post contains sponsored links from RealtyShares.

Looks like a cool platform. I’ll be interested to see how your investments do. I’ve been intrigued by all of the real estate crowdsourcing platforms available that are making it so accessible. Getting a $5k bonus for trying it out is a nice boost! Will you include that in your next passive income report? ;)

You remind me I have to publish my 2016-2017 annual passive income report. Yes, I’m definitely happy to get the bonus, and I will match it to put skin in the game. I really need to find a comfortable way to deploy capital for income w/ my upcoming CD and final severance payment.
I’m only going to include the income from my RealtyShares investments as part of my passive income report. In the past, I would just go ALL IN too soon and just dump like $50,000 or $100,000 without being thoroughly thorough. Now, I’m much more methodical as there’s no such thing as a risk-free investment except for cash, CDs, and US Treasuries!

Hey, Sam.
I have been evaluating the Crowd Funded Real Estate platforms as well, my concern has been that many of these companies are self auditing their financials and don’t have outside accounting firm(s) reviewing their financials. Do you know how RealtyShare handles this? 
My other big concern is more taxable income, are you setting up this account in a taxable account or Self Directed IRA? I wouldn’t mind having a taxable account but wasn’t sure how the gains are taxed, if you continually reinvest are you not taxed, etc.

Hello Bryan, 
We our a privately held company so we do self audit. We are following GAAP for our account practices and the SEC requires a number of years of GAAP accounting records if a company ever wants to go public so we are following those guidelines.
Investors can invest in taxable accounts or a Self-Directed IRA.

Even privately held businesses can get an independent audit of their financial statements. A company planning to go public will need to have an audit at least a couple years before because IPOs have a lot of legal liability for the CPA so they will not want to issue an opinion on IPO financial statements for a brand new client.

Minus of investing out of IRA is that you can’t easily deduct losses. 
I invest directly in similar properties through an investment group. Have to wait a long time between investments though. Commitments are larger, but there is more visibility and control.

An important distinction between the cap rate in Honolulu, and the cap rates in the south and midwest is that you are not just comparing two different locations, and price points, but also completely different strategies. Renting your parent’s property in Honolulu represents traditional buy and hold, where your profit is driven by aquisition cost, rental income, and operational costs. When investing in residential property through RealtyShares you are not investing in buy and hold, you are investing in either fix and flip, or development.
The distinction here is important as you’d want to consider different factors depending on the approach. With Buy and hold you want to look at rent:price ratios, property tax rates, HOA fees, etc. These are largely predictable, and easily researched. If the borrower has history of profitability as a manager of their property this is a relatively predictable invesment. With fix and flip or development, you are much more interested in the appreciation in that market, as well as the borrowers track record, which could vary wildly from person to person and is where the Realty Shares vetting process is hugely important.
My 2 cents when analyzing the markets you mentioned is to look for areas with near term economic growth / strong appreciation to help hedge against the risk in trusting Realty Shares vetting process. A “rising tides raise all boats” type of approach. The type of thing I would be looking for is a big hiring event in smaller market. A large manufacturing facility, military base exapnsions, etc. A hiring event that is significant enough to create housing shortage pressure in that market and drive prices up.
All that said, my buy and hold properties in Augusta, GA have done well the last 4 years, with yield in excess of 20%. I own and manage 7 of my own properties, and am closing on 2 through a partnership on August 12th, where my cash partner is providing 90% of the initial capital, and we share the profits 50/50. His projected yield in year 1 is 11.5%.

You are correct. I’ve giving up buying a dream property for LIFESTYLE b/c my parents don’t want to move, and am now going to invest my cash for INCOME, the next best thing IMO. 
Related: Buy Real Estate For Lifestyle First, Income Second, And Capital Appreciation Third
Only 5% of the Investments that first go through the vetting process end up available for investors (picture in the post). That gives me some confidence that I’m getting my money’s worth for the fees I will pay. RealtyShares need to offer good investments, or long term, they will not do well because investors will revolt and go somewhere else. Therefore, the interest is aligned.
I don’t know anything about Texas or Georgia property, just that the cap rates are so much better than in Manhattan, Santa Monica, San Francisco, and Honolulu. Given I don’t have to live in TX or GA, not that they are bad places, my investment dollars are location agnostic. I just want to choose the best properties possible for the highest return.
I’m clearly heavily overweight the SF Bay Area along w/ my Tahoe Property. If the tech market crashes (thank goodness Google, FB, and Apple beat numbers), then I will be hit harder than other RE investors. I need to diversify out. I think everybody with coastal investment property should diversify inward and towards the South. 
A 20% yield in Augusta is AMAZING! Just give me a guaranteed 10%, and I will invest ALL my money. You would never get that here in SF. But, you may get a 65%+ capital appreciation in the past 5 years as a consolation. 
Any downsides to your physical properties in GA? Where are you based?
Thanks for the feedback!

Hi Sam, may I ask why you say inwards and towards the South. I have a friend who lives in the Bay Area and he is currently looking at some commercial property (his first such investment) in the Seattle area. His realtor was showing him properties in Texas, but his reluctance with the South is the drought situation. I’m just curious if you have a particular reason to not go North?

Reply






Financial Samurai says 
July 29, 2016 at 3:25 pm 

Hola Mitch, I feel everything is relative to where one is. North for me is Seattle and Portland, two great, booming cities. Could be good! But since I’m already heavy in SF, investing in Seattle and Portland is perhaps more of the same. They are benefiting from Bay Area relocators and strength in Amazon, Microsoft, etc.
I shoulda invested there 5 years ago!
For better diversification, I’m therefore looking inland and South where the dynamics (price, yield, economies) are very different from SF. I’m too levered into this economy. Gotta find new opportunities!

Sam, 
I am physically located in Augusta,  having relocated from the bay area to the south twice now.  First after college at Cal to Wilmington,  NC then again from Mountain View to Augusta after working in San Jose for 2 years. 
Two downsides to the physical properties: 
1) not the strongest appreciation, my properties have appreciated about 10% in 4 years 
2) scalability. properties here are cheap,  with mine ranging from 85-125k in value.  That’s a good thing in that there is low barrier to entry and strong cash flow. For example the last property I bought in may required ~25k investment, and cash flows ~500/month. The downside is that scaling to something larger is more challenging. Cash flowing 100k/yr here will require 15-20 properties, which means managing 15-20 tenants. 
When structuring the agreement with my partner on the two we’re buying now I presented the option of him putting up 100% of initial capital in exchange for a guaranteed 6% preferred return, but he preferred me having skin in the game through a 10% capital contribution and was willing to waive the preferred return. If a partner was willing to do 100% of initial capital, I’d do guaranteed preferred returns all day,  with the rate being largely based on the volume that partner was willing to do. Higher volume of properties means greater dispersal of risk from any one property.

Do you like living there better than the Bay Area? Very curious as I’ve lived in Virginia for 8 years before and have visited more Southern states and not sure I’d be happy there. After all, I’m totally biased after writing: West Coast Living – Yes It Really Is That Much Better!
I have to say, I would prefer owning one property that is generating $100K/yr in rent versus 15-20 properties, even though my capital outlay was bigger ($330K down payment). It just is too much of a PITA to manage so many properties. 15-20 properties means 15-20 to 30-40 bathrooms that could break, 15-20 main electrical panels, etc. I couldn’t do it, unless it is totally hands off like a REIT or real estate crowdsourcing.
Have you not gone through some tremendous tenant pain yet?

If I were in your financial situation I never would have left the bay area.  
When I left I was making ~75k / yr, and very frustrated by my inability to meet my financial goals nor live in comfortable level of housing. When I relocated I viewed it as a sacrifice I was willing to make to achieve my career and financial goals. 
Having now lived here 4 years, I wouldn’t go back. Between my job and passive income,  I should surpass 300k/ yr within the next 6 months,  I’m able to live in a house nice enough to be a forever home with a 1,400/month mortgage, do things like surprise my dad with a Mazda mita  (his dream car) as a retirement gift,  etc.  Life is also simpler not wrestling with traffic nor parking.  Proximity to Atlanta makes travel easy,  and both the beach and mountains are within a 3 hour drive. I live a much much better lifestyle here. 
I’ve had two major issues with $4k+ of damages,  which is significant given that’s 5% of property value.  Most recently I evicted tenants earlier this year that were breeding and selling pit Bulls out of the property. I got them moved out, repairs made,  and new tenants in within 6 days.  They were military,  so a quick call and text of pictures to their commanding officer and I was reimbursed within a week. All told maybe 3 hours of work. Some might view all the issues as tremendous pain,  but I view 3 hours of work as a walk in the park for over 6k in annual yield. 
The numbers will become a pain as we grow,  but given the low cost of living here,  hiring an assistant for $15/hr would go a long way.

It’s great that you’ve had positive experiences with RE crowdfunding! Can you elaborate on why you prefer those two, specifically?
For me, it would be interesting to know whether it’s a matter of ROI, user interface, transparency, vetting, diversity of investments, etc., or something else entirely.

Mainly diversity of investments – I use Alphaflow to invest in their funds so you get the diversification across 75 different residential loans versus focusing on the one offs. For Realtymogul, I like their commercial and office offerings although not happy with their hotel deals that I am in.
What sites have you used?

Thanks for the RealtyShares information Sam. We have been thinking about purchasing another investment property (we already have 10 units) but are dealing with some PITA issues right now too. (A third apartment going vacant next month…) This seems like the perfect thing to consider rather than adding more properties – to diversify more and still stay in real estate. 
One other really interesting point is  #4 about your parents not wanting to move  even to a “dream” home. I can totally see that with my parents and it makes me think hard about finding the “right” house before we get to that age where moving becomes too much to think about.

I’ve noticed that the older you get, the more you are set in your ways. I asked my dad if he wanted my 2015 Honda Fit when I was considering lighting my money on fire by buying a Porsche, and he said, “I don’t know how to use the start stop button.”
I told him you just have to press the brake and push the button to start. He said, “Naaaaaaah.” Hard to change old habits! We like what we know.

C’mon Sam, if you’re talking about buying a nice car, there’s a lot worse you could do than Porsche.
Am I biased? Sure! Just look at my handle here.
Two years ago, our suv was rear-ended. I had already considered a used one, but then the timing of the accident coincided with a nice 2-owner, excellent condition, low-miler S-model becoming available.
It’s the absolute cheapest Porsche you can get. Marketwise, I have a hard time believing that it will depreciate outside of sustaining physical damage, especially with the recent change in engine (718).
Say what you will, but the mid-engine is fun as hell to drive. It’s a manual. Maintenance isn’t exactly cheap, but they really are built to last. I can enjoy it probably forever. If I were into drag racing, maybe I’d get a ‘vette, but I much prefer the mountains and rivers.
Carrying costs are pretty low. I get about 28 mpg. Insurance is actually not very expensive, nor is the annual registration. I will always buy the best tires I can, I’m just that kind of driver. (Though I do park it down the street any time I have contractors coming to the house–people see that and just do not understand that it cost me less than a used Honda)
I generally would not advocate for investing in cars, but “lighting money on fire” is not your only option.

All these options for real-estate crowdfunding really make me looking forward to becoming an accredited investor!
I don’t know about Texas in general, but real-estate in Houston has many good opportunities for rental properties. The market appreciates slowly (2-3%/year in my area) but the rents are relatively high compared to the acquisition cost. I actually bought a house because the monthly cost (taxes, mortgage, HOA, …all included) is lower than my previous rent.

I disagree that Houston real estate represents a good investment opportunity.  The housing market is still inflated from the oil boom of 2008-2014.  Prices have fallen somewhat from their peak, but there are a few factors that suggest the bottom isn’t close.  
First, there is a lag with the oil company layoffs, where people are still able to make ends meet for a while.  Despite massive layoffs, we haven’t seen a significant increase in foreclosures, but its coming. Second, people are still stuck on ideas of what their home is worth based on the 2014 peak.  They are reluctant to sell for less, so homes are sitting on the market and inventory is building.   
Lastly, despite the common assertion that Houston has diversified its economy, oil and gas still drives roughly 80% of the Houston economy.  Most non-oil jobs just recirculate money brought in by oil and gas.  Recently, we’ve hit a tipping point, where not only is the oil and gas sector losing jobs, but non-oil and gas companies are shedding jobs because the oil money that sustains them is evaporating.  Until the oil industry turns around, the Houston job market isn’t going to rebound and support for home prices isn’t going to pick up either.
And the picture for oil doesn’t look good: demand for refined products continues to lag expectations of where it should be based on the low price environment.  The demand is looking a lot less elastic than most analysts assumed (including those within my company), and the competition between oil companies and oil states for market share is likely to hold prices down for quite a while.  
I’m not saying there aren’t opportunities, and it may still make sense to buy vs. rent if you live in Houston (since rents are still also inflated).  But from a big picture perspective I would avoid investing in Houston real estate, at least for the next few years.
Sam, not sure if you can see access my email address, but feel free to contact me to discuss.

Yes, there are several real estate crowdsourcing platforms to choose from. They all have some good things going for them. I chose RS b/c of their offer and my prior relationship with the VP of Finance. When I was in the office, we’d joke around all the time. He’s also a Cal Berkeley MBA grad, so that helps too. SF-based, Cal grad, prior-relationship, able to sit down with them for two hours face to face, able to continue meeting them in person, and solid electronic communication outreach all played a big role.

I’ve been thinking about real estate crowdfunding too. I like it better than P2P lending now. P2P lending isn’t bad, but I’m sure the return will turn negative as soon as we get a recession. I guess we’d see the same with real estate, but at least you’d have some collateral. I need to do more research too. I think Realty Shares and Realty Mogul are two of the better ones.

Thanks for the overview, Sam. 
I’ve been watching this “real estate crowdfunding” movement for some time now and have wondered whether there’s anything more to this movement than a millennial-styled rebranding of REITs, plus a couple of troubling operational differences. 
The lack of liquidity and higher leveraging of investments via crowdfunding platforms relative to REITs makes them much riskier, yet their incrementally higher promised returns and incrementally lower implied correlations with other asset classes don’t seem to compensate for the added downsides. 
Compared with traditional, straight-up physical real estate investment, RealtyShares, et al. are almost certainly better. Compared with REITs or REIT ETFs? Hmmm… Hard to see how they’re any better, if not worse.
Any thoughts on this front? 
Thanks again for the good post.

Financial Samurai says

I think one can and should consider both. REIT ETFs have done great, and will probably continue to outperform as investors search for yield. 
For a real estate crowdsourcing investment, it’s about finding the right property. So, you are making a more concentrated bet on specific regions and properties versus a REIT which has a larger portfolio. Just more surgical.
Everything is relative w/ liquidity. I locked up $250,000 for 7-years with this CD coming due. For folks who have extra savings or aggressively spend less than they make, they WANT to lock money up for as long as possible and just collect income. It’s when the money comes due when there’s actually a reinvestment problem b/c I don’t plan to spend any of the money.
Going from a 7-year CD to a 6M – 3Y investment is more liquidity. I’d prefer 5 – 10Y lockups with a high IRR actually. 
Any particular REITs you are looking at?

FinanciaLibre says 
July 30, 2016 at 9:23 am 

Thanks for the reply, Sam.
Your thoughts make sense. I agree with you entirely on the hunt for yield in this environment, especially with a Fed that seems stuck in limbo. 
I think we have somewhat different views on the role and value of liquidity in the portfolio. Your older CDs are (very) valuable because they locked in relatively high yields in an environment of declining interest rates. And, as you say, for long-term investments with no plans to touch principal, liquidity doesn’t seem to matter much. 
On the other hand, restricted vehicles like CDs make rebalancing a bit tougher and foreclose (or complicate) opportunities to change strategy in the face of an altered investing environment. Betting on the direction/duration of interest rate action is close to gambling. And anything with a 5-10 year lock-in at fixed rates could go either way for the investor relative to the RFR or inflation.
Having said all that, your view is sensible, and the difference in our perspectives probably boils down to little more than delay discounting preferences.
Particular REITs? I’m not one for making stock picks. One REIT I’ll mention, though, because it seems to satisfy two criteria important for REITs (appreciation/income and low-ish correlation with the S&P) is RWR. It’s performed well over the last several years, though it’s hardly “particular” since it’s a broad-based ETF. “Surgical” it isn’t; but that’s kind of the point of these ETFs.
By the way, if you’re looking for a solid IRR in an “alternative” investment with zero correlation with any other asset class, I encourage you to look at the arbitrage opportunity surrounding Dieselgate. If you’re interested, here’s an overview of how to turn a nice profit and get a free car in the process.

What are your thoughts on RealtyMogul’s recently launched non-traded REIT (https://www.realtymogul.com/resource-center/articles/realtymogulcom-launches-its-first-crowdfunded-real-estate-investment-trust)?  They’ve made it available to non-accredited investors with a minimum investment of $2500.  They’ve acquired two properties so far and both seem reasonable.  Might be another option for real estate diversification without the high commissions/fees of traditional non-traded REITs or market correlation of publicly traded REITs.

I’m not sure, but I’ve never been asked to verify my assets or income in the multiple private investments I’ve made since around age 26. The rule is to protect both the issuer and the investor. The issuer doesn’t want to have backlash against the person who couldn’t afford to lose money in case of a bad investment. The gov’t is also trying to protect the investor from not doing a proper investment allocation. But now, when investment limits are so low e.g. $5,000 versus $250,000 or $1,000,000 previously, the rule makes less sense now.

(Also active on PeerStreet, which is mostly first-position notes)  Everything has been great on RealtyShares so far, and I’m now in process of setting up a SD IRA to do even more.  I’ve researched just about all the crowdsourced real estate and other alternative investment platforms (more time than I care to admit) and I highly recommend RealtyShares.  
I’m primarily doing preferred equity deals, as the time horizon (2-3 years) fits with what I want.  Returns are in the 13-15% range.  For crowdfunding deals like this, I personally think preferred equity (or hard money loans) make more sense than JV Equity — the due diligence I’d have to do to feel comfortable with the downside risk of returns on JV deals goes beyond the scope of information shared on crowdfunding sites.  Preferred Equity (investor gets X%, principal takes the rest) seems to fit the crowdfunding model better, where there is less connection and therefore less trust and less info sharing between the LPs and the GPs.  I do JV Equity deals, but with investors I know, not on crowdfunding sites.  
Setting up an SD IRA and putting a heavy allocation into RealtyShares deals seems to be the winning ticket for retirement savings, even if there happen to be some busted deals along the way.  That’s what I’ll be doing, and I’ll end up with about 10X the money vs. the crappy traditional mutual fund route when I start withdrawing in 25 years while sitting on a beach!

Hah! At first, I wrote your comment off because I thought there would be more than enough investment choices to choose from. But as I do more research on the investment opportunities, many are unavailable or I’ve got to get on the waitlist! 
Since I’m focused on the Midwest and South, perhaps only about 30% of the listings are available to me. Hence, I’m learning I need to be patient. 
I definitely want to do a Self-Directed IRA for these types of investments. Hopefully the tax docs will be much simpler as a result. If not, I can just file the K-1s. I need to double check w/ RS and my custodian bank on SD IRAs. I’m waiting on them to get back to me. 
I’m also going to focus on Pref Equity. No JV deals for me. As an experienced RealtyShares investors, I’d love for your to share in a guest post how you go about picking your investments, your process, your reasons, and your returns one day!
Thx

Indeed, you’ll need to be patient if you (very intelligently) have specific criteria you’re looking for.  RealtyShares seems to have one of the highest # of active deals of any of the crowdfunding sites, and at least for me, I still only see a deal I want to invest in once every few weeks or so.  And often time those deals will “sell out” within a day or two, so you have to stay on top of it if you’re serious about it.  I expect that will change as they continue to build up their deal flow.  
There seems to be a lot of good things happening to make it easier to invest SD IRA funds in crowdfunding sites.  Within the last month or so, RealtyShares has made it easier to invest from a SD IRA, or at least they have advertised so.  On the SD IRA custodian side, I’ve noticed a couple of them have setup specific “plans” for people investing in crowdfunding sites — these “plans” have significantly lower fees for crowdfunding deals compared to other SD IRA investments, so you end up paying significantly less to put $50K in a crowdfunding platform vs. $50K in a direct real estate deal or $50K in gold, for example.  Still not as easy as just opening up a Vanguard account for a rollover IRA, but I expect this SD IRA + crowdfunding real estate strategy to pick up a lot of steam soon.  
Guest post about my RealtyShares experience?  Sure, I’d be honored.  My first deal on the platform finishes its term in 11 months…. Personally, at least, that is an interesting date, as I’ll have had experienced how the platform works throughout the entire deal cycle.  At the very least, I’ll update you with the status here in the comments.  
Thanks!

Looks interesting – will have to look into the details closer.
What I’m most curious about is what happens when things start to unravel. We’re at record price levels again, and most of these investments are several years out. While I tend to agree low rates are going to be here for a while – IMHO, there’s going to be a *pop* at some point and it could be a really nasty one again. Same concern with the LendingClubs of the world – everything looks good in hockey stick chart periods, but what happens when the party stops. There’s simply no data points to go by; simply too new.
Short term investments in RE over the next few years at least initially feels like musical chairs – hope you get your money before the music stops. Whereas a traditional rental property, the music stops and you can just hold and ride it out.
RealtyShare website has 3 options for their drop down “How would your $10K have faired” – and 2 of the 3 show you were better off investing in the S&P 500. I get the diversification approach here, just thought it was interesting to see that.
Unprecedented times, with massive amounts of money chasing yield.

True, I wonder when a nationwide RE slowdown will occur. I KNOW it is occurring in NYC, SF, and Honolulu b/c I follow the markets closely. I do not plan to reinvest in these markets for at minimum 1.5 years from now, but most likely 2-4 years if ever.
Instead of throwing $3M into Honolulu w/ leverage, where I think I can get a deal, I’d rather invest $50,000 – $300,000 cash in higher cap rate areas and projects. 
I’m chasing yield for sure. Just trying to be more disciplined about it. 
What are your investments and what are you doing w/ your money?

I’m heavy in the market (60/40 Vanguard US/International) + CA real estate. Then like you ~$50-300K in cash and CA (mostly) tax free Muni that I’m debating what to do w/. Wish I had a great answer there. :)
I’m further South in CA. Housing down here has gotten crazy again IMHO. A couple of my friends are actually looking to sell now to lock in a couple hundred grand in profits, then rent and ride it out expecting a downswing in the next few years.
The number of $90,000 Tesla’s I see on the road seems to be increasing at a dramatic pace.
Market at records highs. Rates at unprecedented lows. Having been through the last two big bubbles, there’s a lot of similarities. 
LendingClub stock is now at $4, and another report just came out showing investments into online lending platforms is down 44% first half of this year vs back half of last over concerns of fraud/risks/etc. If companies like this are already getting thrown back against the ropes in the second largest bull market in US history… what happens when the music changes tunes or stops?
That’s my biggest concern on these new social lending sites (of all varieties). Seems like exponentially more risk, for about the same return as a wildly diversified Vanguard fund.

$50k in property taxes?! dang that’s alot!
Homes seem to have a greater sentimental or emotional value for you, It seems you are very reluctant to sell and take the gains. Maybe the market is different in SF, here in Vancouver it feels like an impending bubble.
If I were in your shoes I’d sell all the properties, put your portfolio or “nut” in bonds/dividend stocks and live off the yield.  With your net worth you probably would get over $100-200k cash annually and factor in low dividend taxes, no property taxes or maintenance you could rent your own dream place in HI. forget about buying!

Joe,
I’m impressed with the 15% Foreigners Tax implemented in Vancouver! Surely that must pop the bubble as everything pauses and causes sellers to get desperate, no? Maybe the foreign money actually makes its way to places like SF as a result.
I’ve wondered for a long time what type of industries and jobs make Vancouver RE so expensive. Could it really just be money from China, accounting for 5% of volume?
I wanted to sell my 2/2 condo when my tenants vacated, but didn’t go all-out in marketing it (didn’t put on MLS, or do any light remodeling). So maybe I didn’t really want to sell. But I did find tenants who are paying $200/more a month (5%) who seem ideal. So we shall see. 
Yes, $50K/year in property taxes is a crap load of money. So it’s vexing when someone who pays $0 property taxes a year votes to raise property taxes further to fund our community. We really should institute a Residence Tax where EVERYBODY pitches in, and therefore thinks twice about voting for ever more spending.

Joe says 
July 30, 2016 at 5:33 pm 

hey Sam, the tax was just implemented so we’ll see what kind of effect it will have.  Prices have risen drastically in the last 15 years.  
I could have bought a brand new condo in downtown then for $100-125k, now prices start at $400k.  And salaries obviously haven’t increased at the same ratio.
There really is no industry or jobs that justify prices.  It makes absolutely no sense except that it’s a bubble mentality.

Sam, 
Thanks for the article!
You mentioned that you opted not to buy in Hawaii, in part, because you didn’t want to pay very much more in property taxes or deal with tenancy issues.
But aren’t the returns on your real estate investments on RealtyShares going to be affected by property taxes, in one way or another? (And potentially subject to tenancy issues?)

Financial Samurai says 
July 30, 2016 at 8:37 am 

Hi Adam,
Yes, the returns should be reflected in a RS investment. The  fees, taxes, maintenance etc should all be baked into the returns. If I can get 9% – 12% net after everything without doing anything, that’s really all I care about. In and out over max 3 years. Not perpetual taxes and maintenance.

This is the way I understood it. I registered for an account and reading more about it but also trying to figure out the tax consequences. If I remember correctly I read that investing in different states may require filing a tax return in that state (I was getting tired). Then there is the choice between debt and equity considerations.
It says there is a 30 day cooling down period which I think is a good thing but after registering there was a message that said that I would get a call that may allow them to  reduce the 30 day cooling down period. I wonder how that works.

“Real estate makes people think irrationally, and I was probably delirious after visiting so many beautiful places. It’s much better to invest smaller sums in higher yielding markets.”
I wish my friends had this mentality. Most of them jump into bidding wars without thinking. Most of them have never even heard of Price-to-Rent ratio or Cap Rate. *shakes head* This is why the Toronto and Vancouver housing markets are doomed.
Real-estate crowd sourcing sounds interesting. We have REITs in our portfolio, that’s the extent of our exposure to real-estate. So far it’s gone up 20% in the past year–higher than the 16% rise in Toronto housing.
What are your thoughts on REITs?

My thought process is should I just keep putting money into Index funds (FSTVX- Taxable account) that have been getting 4-5% yr and not throwing off much taxable events (until i sell) or do I do a Crowdfund for lets say 9-10% but need to pay taxes at end of year (28% tax bracket). With my tax bracket, my 9-10% return on this would be closer to 6-7%? Right?

4) Parents really don’t want to move. 
I have/had dreams like you of buying a place in Hawaii with a nice ohana quarters. The vision is to live that dream life of waking to the smell of plumerias, coffee in hand as I stare into the vast Pacific Ocean, while figuring out which brunch spot to hit before hitting the beach. Part of this vision is that the parents would stay in the quaint ohana quarters so that we have our perfect family compound in paradise. The kid would be going to Punahou, of course. The wife would be working the necessary social network to ensure some position within the community. I would be a 2-index at the golf club and thus feared and admired for my grace, talent and impeccable flop shot with the 60 degree wedge.
It’s funny though, that the parents, who have lived for decades in a seemingly dreary existence in a middling house in a middling neighborhood with middling friends are apprised of this paradise vision of life that can be had…and yet the parents refuse the offer before the pitch is even midway.
The reality is that your parents, my parents, other parents…they are all human beings who have built a life that literally has immovable roots connected to that middling house in the middling neighborhood surrounded by middling friends…and that’s their own version of paradise. Move them to that high falootin house in Kahala and they will lose a comfortable house, a neighborhood they are familiar with, and knucklehead friends who have grown old together with them. The ocean view wouldn’t be the same for them.

I’ve been using Realtyshares for about 2-3 years now. Been in about 5 offerings my self. 2 of the debt deals have already paid back interest and capital since they were the shortest, ranging about 9 to 12 months. The other three are are preferred equity deals which are still in progress. Overall I am happy with the service and platform. They are very responsive over email and will gladly answer any questions that pertain to any deal on the platform. It started off as an experiment but I am now getting more comfortable with crowdfunding and will slowly allocate more of my asset allocation to this asset class. I have also allocated $5500 to the fundrise growth eREIT. I have allocated pretty much the minimums to all these deals. I’d advise start off slow and stick to the minimums, do research, and over time one should get comfortable with how to compare deals.

I’m not sure if anyone has addressed this, but does the company have a contingency plan in place should they burn through all their cash and close their doors? Is there a plan in place to wind down the investments should that happen? I couldn’t find anything on their website or in the comments addressing this. There are a lot of companies entering as well as burning out of the P2P space right now.

Excellent question, and something I asked one of their capital markets people. 
“If RealtyShares goes out of business, your rights will not change and a third party – a back-up servicer called First Associates – would take this management of the LLC and handle payments.”
The capital you deploy will continue to be invested in your particular investments, and First Associates main roll is to handle the distribution and collection of payments.

So far, so good. I invested in one project in PA for $10,000 and I decided to invest $250,000 in the Realtyshares DME Fund in Feb 2017 that chooses the best from its platform. They have a pref return of 8% and a target IRR of 15%.
I figure, might as well have the gatekeepers of the deals choose what they think are the best deals right? The only problem is that the minimum is $250,000, so I haven’t talked about it.

Sam, regarding RealtyShares and investing via Simple IRA, do you have any recommendations on custodians that can hold the IRA without gouging high fees, etc.?  I have a RealtyShares account but want to invest via one of my IRA’s, but the IRA must be transferred to a custodian like Entrust or Millenium that will allow for those types of investments.
I too am in Northern CA and want to diverse holdings to other areas of the country as well.  RealtyShares seems like a great investment vehicle to serve that purpose!

RealtySharesSign Up for RealtySharesBack to PlatformsSimilar Real Estate Crowdfunding Platforms1031 CrowdfundingFundrisePatch of LandRealtyShares ReviewAverage Rating:  2 reviewsSummaryRealtyShares has some strong points including adequate capital, support from savvy backers, a user-friendly website and some good press. Investors also like its low minimums ($1,000 for your first deal, generally $5,000 thereafter) and hold periods as short as six months. It is also trying some innovative things such as accepting Bitcoin and providing market-specific products aimed at its core investor base among IT professionals in five cities.
But the platform’s investments are weighted toward single family home flips, a riskier niche in which projects tend to be put together by individuals and smaller operators. The site does have some funds and multi-family/commercial projects, but on the whole its deal flow is lower quality than some of the top names in the RE crowdfunding universe.
Investors who like the deals it offers will find RealtyShares a likeable and easy to navigate platform. But it is only accessible to accredited investors and it’s imperative that you fully grasp the risks involved.
BACKGROUND
Founded in Q2 2013 by CEO Nav Athwal, RealtyShares has received $11.9 million in three rounds of fundraising from five investors including $10 million in a Series A funding in April 2015. Its backers include well known venture capitalists Menlo Ventures, General Catalyst Partners and 500 Startups.
Menlo Ventures’ Managing Director John Jarve, who sits on the board of hot automated investing service Betterment, is on the RealtyShares board.
RealtyShares has been compared to a Lending Club for real estate, offering a new way for investors to put small amounts into real estate projects. It funds about 10 to 20 projects a month.
The inspiration for Athwal was to disrupt the slow and inefficient process by which developers borrowed money from banks to fund property development. Those loans usually take weeks or months to close – compared to as little as four days for crowdfunded deals on RealtyShares. After the financial crisis of 2007, traditional loans were difficult to impossible for many project sponsors to access.

PROS

Low minimum of $1,000 for first investment (otherwise usually $5,000), focus on deals with short lifecycles



CONS

Deal quality is not high, weighted to single family home flip market, only for accredited investors, high fees



BOTTOM LINE
RealtyShares is a smaller player in the real-estate crowdfunding arena. It has some differentiators that may help it make the cut including deals with short lifecycles and low minimum investments. But its deal flow includes many single family home flips, which are considered riskier and lower quality than typical projects on other platforms. Its fees are considered higher than average too.
PHILOSOPHY
RealtyShares’ founder Athwal says that RealtyShares is intended to fill a niche that banks have not adequately served, especially small real estate developers and house flippers. The process of borrowing money from banks is fraught for these operators as banks reined in their lending after the 2007 economic crisis. They often will not lend to individuals without W2 income.
Crowdfunding via an online platform is more streamlined and offers investors a chance to earn better returns. In one case covered by CNBC, Chicago house flipper Ben Walhood said he can get full funding from RealtyShares in as little as an hour. Investors in his deals would earn around 11% vs loans around 4% if backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in traditional financing.
RealtyShares is “able to provide quicker, more efficient capital that helps meet the needs of these investors who are looking for speed of execution and the ability to be flexible with their terms as well as with the underwriting standards. Banks just aren’t meeting that need,” Athwal said.
TYPICAL PROJECTS AND GEOGRAPHY
At the time of our test, there were five live deals on the site including a fund, two single family flips and two apartment buildings. Three were in California and the others in New York and Florida. RealtyShares has done transactions in 18 states and seems to have a strong representation in past deals from Florida, California, Illinois and Texas.
The deals we saw ranged in size from $160,000 to $1.6 million for the RealtyShares portion and were a mix of debt and equity transactions. Minimum investment ranged from $2,000 to $25,000 and hold terms from eight months to five years.
RealtyShares says it welcomes cash-flowing/value add equity investments in commercial and residential properties such as apartments, retail, office and pools of single family homes; equity investment in fix and flips in high demand/low supply markets and loans secured by residential and commercial real estate.
TARGET DEMOGRAPHIC
RealtyShares is only open to accredited investors, meaning those with net worth of $1 million or income of $200,000 a year. The platform says it is aimed at investors interested in sub institutional projects in the $2 million to $30 million range and all types of cash-flowing residential and commercial projects.
RealtyShares says that its investors prefer hold periods ranging from six months to two years.
Many of its users are technology professionals who are natural early adopters of the online crowdfunding model. RealtyShares said in 2014 that 10 to 15% of its investors are abroad but its website currently states that foreign investors cannot participate.
INTEREST IN INNOVATION
Athwal says most investors who have joined the platform so far have been technology professionals looking for new investment opportunities. Unique among real estate crowdfunding platforms, the company has identified five markets with rising tech and real estate sectors where it sees attractive opportunities. It is creating market-specific products to enable developers in Seattle, Dallas, Austin, Miami and Chicago to raise funding from local investors.
RealtyShares’ interest in innovation led it in 2014 to become the first crowdfunding platform to accept the digital currency bitcoin as a form of payment. The platform says this is a more cost-effective and streamlined way for investors to send money, especially if they are abroad, because it involves lower transaction fees and faster transfers.
WEBSITE POPULARITY
As of June 2015, RealtyShares has an estimated 90,000 monthly unique visitors via desktop who spend an average of about 4 minute on the site with 4.04 page views.  About 92% of the traffic is from the United States. As of mid-May 2015, RealtyShares ranked sixth among real estate crowdfunding sites in the United States.
LEADERSHIP TEAM
RealtyShares’ founder Athwal trained as an electrical engineer and lawyer. He worked as a developer and broker for his own real estate company and then as a real estate and land use attorney representing California and national developers and REITs in the San Francisco Bay area. He doesn’t have the star power of some other crowdfunding entrepreneurs but his credentials are solid.
The management team is rounded out by eight specialists with hands-on experience in operations, transactions, engineering and other disciplines. Again, they have strong resumes but not high name recognition. RealtyShares’ leadership earned a B grade in one review.
WHAT DO THE EXPERTS THINK?
RealtyShares has received funding from some investors with track records for betting on successful ventures such as 500 Startups, so that represents a vote of confidence in the platform. But it has gotten fewer accolades than some other sites, and media coverage has tended to focus on its potential for financing single family home flip projects or more novel features such as acceptance of bitcoin.
Blogger Mark Robertson wrote about his experience with five investments on RealtyShares. While he describes several of the projects as having some unanticipated occurrences such as higher than budgeted taxes or permitting delays, he said they have met or beat expectations.
SUMMARY
RealtyShares looks like a solid platform with long-term potential. While its low minimum investments are attractive, it loses points for its lower quality deal flow and higher than average fees. It is open exclusively to accredited investors and focuses on shorter hold deals, especially fix and flip single family home projects. It’s not a good starting point for novices and may not even be a good first choice for more seasoned investors.
DEAL STRUCTURE
Investors can access both debt investments in the form of first or second-position loans usually yielding a fixed interest rate of 8-12% annually as well as equity investments in residential and commercial properties offering cash flows during the hold period and/or a portion of the profits upon a sale of the property.
HOW DOES REALTYSHARES SCREEN INVESTMENTS?
RealtyShares reviews the sponsors first, looking for companies with experience. It says it runs background and credit checks. Then it reviews proposed transactions including financials, geography, property type and quality, and investment structure.
“While each investment includes risk and RealtyShares cannot guarantee results, our vetting process seeks to ensure that only quality investment properties are listed on the platform,” it says. “Once an investment opportunity is listed on the platform, investors have full discretion as to whether to personally invest in the opportunity, and if so, how much.”
So, like other crowdfunded real estate sites, it’s up to you to do your due diligence.
UNDERWRITING/DEAL FLOW
CEO Athwal said that as of spring 2015 RealtyShares had no defaults or major issues with any of its projects and only lists about 1 in 10 properties that are offered to it.  “I think that really goes to our underwriting criteria and the strictness with which we adhere to when we are looking at a property,” he said.
However, the site more than other real estate crowdfunding platforms focuses on single family home flips. These are often sponsored by solo or smaller operators, and experts consider them generally to be riskier and lower-quality deals than bigger budget projects.
FEES
RealtyShares says it charges a fee when you invest in a specific offering to cover investor reporting and communications. But the site is quite opaque on the details and directs you to the deal operating agreement. The ones we viewed were 40-plus page legal agreements similar to a prospectus that are not for the novice to decipher.
As best we could tell, the ongoing fees to RealtyShares as manager of the transaction LLC amounted to 1% a year. RealtyShares could do a whole lot better explaining the costs and ongoing fees in its deals.
This article says RealtyShares takes an administrative fee on funds raised through the website of 2 percent to 3 percent. It also takes the annual fee in order to service the investment (including providing investors with tax documents and distributions) through the platform. A RealtyShares presentation for a funding round in February 2014 showed it earning fees of 3-5%.
That is comparatively high among RE crowdfunding platforms and reduces the earning potential of your investment.
EASE OF USE
RealtyShares has a more involved sign-up process than other platforms we have test driven. While some sites initially ask only for an email address and password, RealtyShares seeks your phone number, address, employer, amount you want to invest and type of deal that interests you.
If you are just wanting to explore the site without making a commitment, that might make you leery. But it also suggests RealtyShares wants to offer an experience tailored to your interests, so it could be a plus for some. It offers a chance to check boxes signaling interest in such things as residential flips with 11-14% return, 6-9 month hold, unsecured to cash flow retail and long hold apartment deals.
After signing up, you see a countdown clock on the 30-day cooling off period. You are also directed to a helpful eight-minute webinar introducing the site and how to navigate it. We liked this feature a lot.
LISTINGS
The page for individual offerings is nicely laid out and easy to follow. There’s a deal dashboard, and tabs allow you to view an overview, financials, documents, photos, background on management and FAQs. One closed deal we looked at had an audio recording of a webinar the sponsor gave discussing the project, which provided a wealth of information.
WHAT AM I BUYING ON REALTYSHARES?
RealtyShares explains what you are actually buying this way: RealtyShares sets up a separate Limited Liability Company (LLC), for each investment opportunity that is listed on the platform.  That LLC in turn will make a loan on a real estate property (in the case of a debt investment) or hold equity in an LLC or LP that in turn owns real estate property (in the case of an equity investment).  When you invest through RealtyShares, you own shares in that LLC.  Using this structure, you will have the benefit of limited financial exposure while also avoiding taxes at the entity level.
If you invest in a debt deal, the fund you invest in will be secured by a residential or commercial property and will receive monthly interest payments.  A share of those payments will be deposited directly into your bank account.  If you invest in an equity investment opportunity (usually in a residential or commercial property or group of properties), the fund you invest in will receive periodic payments of cash flow from rents and/or a share of the proceeds when the property is eventually sold. As with debt investments, a share of those payments will be deposited directly into your bank account.
HOW SAFE IS MY MONEY?
As we’ve said before, real estate crowdfunding is not for investing novices, and that holds even truer for RealtyShares. Experts point out the niche is in its infancy and there has not yet been a chance to watch a complete life cycle of many deals. Real estate by its nature can be a risky investment, and RealtyShares is weighted toward single family home flips which have more inherent risks than other types of deals.
While offering documents list risk factors ad nauseum, RealtyShares could do a much better job of making its site transparent. It says it is currently affiliated with WealthForge, a registered broker-dealer with FINRA and member of SIPC (both of which are securities industry bodies aimed at protecting investors), and that WealthForge provides compliance and regulatory oversight to RealtyShares.
But it’s unclear if SIPC protections apply to RealtyShares investments. Even if they do, they do not protect against loss in value, liquidity issues or financial problems with sponsors. They would only protect the custody function of the broker dealer.
In truth, it is up to you to research carefully and understand fully the risks of any deal you enter, and that is a big reason why only accredited investors are allowed to participate.

There are various pluses and minuses with the service, but RealtyShares would work better if it didn’t have the requirement for accredited investors. Crowdfunding generally democratizes investing, making it available to even the smallest investors. The accredited investor requirement limits the platform to use by high income and high net worth individuals. We’ll give RealtyShares a rating of 4.0 out of 5.0 stars, with the accredited investor requirement being the biggest negative.


Crowdfunding Website Reviews

We have singled out RealtyShares for the purpose of our first Real Estate Crowdfunding Site review due to a few recent stories that caught our eye. Not the least of which is their forward-thinking leadership giving potential investors the ability to invest using BitCoin. We love the idea of taking a “virtual currency” and turning it in to the most tangible of investments. This move has the potential of bringing a new crowd to real estate investing, the Tech Crowd.

Greenland to Diversify Into Brokerage, RealtyShares Reaches $200M


September 23, 2016
Tatiana Swedek
Week in Review



China Developer Greenland to Diversify Into Brokerage, Banking:
Chinese property developer Greenland Holdings Corp. is in the midst of diversifying into a securities and divestment firm, hoping to manage $10 billion of assets within the next three years. The group has already established a securities arm in Hong Kong, and is planning on applying for an investment banking license in Hong Kong as well when they deem the time to be right. Once the transitions are completed, the new unit will set up overseas REITs totaling up to assets of $4 billion to $6 billion, and will set up an equity investment fund targeting medical and leisure industries.
RealtyShares Reaches $200M in Raised Capital:
RealtyShares, an online real estate investment platform that launched just three years ago, has surpassed the $200 million mark in capital raising. The online marketplaces focuses on both commercial and residential sectors of real estate, and has raised a large sum of money from its variety of investors. As of now, the company has linked approximately 25,000 investors with real estate companies who are seeking debt or equity through crowdfunding.
Philadelphia Portfolio Commands Aggressive Cap Rate:
Rittenhouse Realty Advisors has just set up a $4.7 million sale of a five-property portfolio located in Center City, Philadelphia. The buyer is an affiliate of AMC Delancey Group, and they have plans to upgrade the portfolio after the transaction. The portfolio is located in Rittenhouse Square, Fitler Square, and the Washington Square West neighborhoods, which are renowned for their art galleries, theaters, restaurants, and shops.
Sears Begins New Wave of Kmart Closures:
Seritage Growth Properties announced last Friday that they have exercised their right to terminate 17 stores. SGL is the REIT spinoff of some Sears’ Holdings Sears and Kmart stores, and it has been announced that all 17 of the latest closings will be Kmart stores. This action follows a recent decision by analysts at Moody’s Investor Services last week to downgrade Sears’ speculative grade liquidity rating to a SGL-3, which questions Kmart’s viability in the long run.
Amazon Plans Mammoth West Texas Wind Farm:
Amazon, the online retail giant, has just announced that they have plans to build Amazon Wind Farm Texas, a wind farm in Scurry County, Texas, that at 253-megawatts will generate 1,000,000 megawatt hours of wind energy per year.  This facility alone will be able to power almost 90,000 homes in the U.S. The farm will consist of more than 100 wind turbines, each with rotors twice as long as the diameter of the wingspan of a Boeing 747, and is scheduled to open in late 2017.

Terms of Service
Last Updated June 27, 2016
Introduction
Thank you for visiting the RealtyShares website, owned and operated by RealtyShares, Inc. ("RealtyShares" or the "Company"). Please read these Terms of Service (this "Agreement" or the "Terms") carefully before using the services offered by RealtyShares. This Agreement sets forth the legally binding terms and conditions for your use of the website at www.realtyshares.com, all other sites owned and operated by RealtyShares that redirect to www.realtyshares.com, and all subdomains (collectively, the “Site”), and the service owned and operated by the Company (together with the Site, the “Service”). By accessing, browsing or using the Service in any manner, including, but not limited to, visiting or browsing the Site or contributing content, information, or other materials or services to the Site, you agree to be bound by this Agreement, RealtyShares' Privacy Policy, and all other operating rules, policies and procedures that may be published by RealtyShares from time to time on the Site (collectively, the “Published Information”), each of which is incorporated by reference and each of which may be updated by RealtyShares from time to time without notice to you. In order to access the Site and the Service, you must accept these Terms, the Privacy Policy and any Published Information.

Your use of the Site and Service is governed by the then current version of the Agreement in effect on the date of such use. RealtyShares may, at its sole discretion, modify and replace the Agreement at any time and without prior notice to you by posting the updated Agreement on the Site. By using and accessing the Service, you acknowledge and agree to review the then current version of the Agreement prior to each such use. Your continued use of the Service after any modifications to the Terms have been published on the Service or otherwise provided to you constitutes your acknowledgement of, and binding agreement to, the then current Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the resolution of any dispute that arises between you and RealtyShares will be governed by the Terms in effect at the time the events giving rise to such dispute occurred. RealtyShares further reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to block or otherwise discontinue your access and use of the Site at any time and for any reason. You agree that RealtyShares and its subsidiaries and affiliates will not be liable to you or to any third party for any such modification, suspension or discontinuance.

Please also note that the terms and conditions of this Agreement are in addition to any other agreements between you and RealtyShares, including any customer, account or marketing agreements, and any other agreements that govern your use of products, services, content, tools, and information available on the Site. This Agreement does not alter in any way the terms or conditions of any other agreement you may have with RealtyShares, or its subsidiaries or affiliates, for the Service or otherwise. If you do not agree to all the terms of this Agreement, RealtyShares’ Privacy Policy and/or any Published Information, you are not eligible to participate in RealtyShares’ Service or otherwise use this Site. This Agreement applies to all users of the Site or Service, including investment managers ("Managers"), investors, including Accredited Investors, as defined by SEC Regulation D Rule 501 (collectively, "Investors"), and visitors to the Site, who in any way use the Site or Service provided by RealtyShares (in each case, a "User"). Nothing in these Terms of Service shall be deemed to confer rights on Users or third parties.

Authorized User
The Service is available only to individuals who are at least 18 years old (and at least the legal age in your jurisdiction). You represent and warrant that if you are an individual, you are at least 18 years old and of legal age in your jurisdiction to form a binding contract, and that all registration information you submit is accurate and truthful. RealtyShares may, in its sole discretion, refuse to offer the Service to any person or entity. The Service is not available to any Users suspended or removed from the Site or Service by RealtyShares. By using the Service, you represent that you have not been previously suspended or removed from the Site or Service.

Some of our services, and certain web pages of the Site, are available only to those Users who have been authorized by us to access those services and web pages. Only Users of the Service who are Accredited Investors as defined in Regulation D Rule 501 adopted pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933 (“Accredited Investors”) with a valid User ID and password are authorized to access such services and web pages. In general, to qualify as an Accredited Investor, individuals must have a net worth of more than $1 million (excluding their primary residence), or gross income for each of the last two years of at least $200,000 ($300,000 jointly with their spouse) with the expectation of a similarly qualifying income during the current year. The authorization for such Accredited Investors may require completion of an Accredited Investor questionnaire and satisfactory background information screening and/or identification verification. By registering for, accessing, browsing, and/or otherwise using the services and/or web pages for which access is restricted to Accredited Investors, you represent and agree that you are an Accredited Investor. Should you cease to be an Accredited Investor at any time, you agree to immediately notify RealtyShares and to refrain from accessing such restricted portions of the Site and/or Service. Further, because access to the restricted portions of the Site is limited by applicable law to Accredited Investors, you agree that you will not allow anyone to access such restricted portions of the Site, or share or disclose any information obtained through restricted portions of the Site with anyone, regardless of whether you believe such person or entity to also be an Accredited Investor.

As part of RealtyShares’ authorization process, each user shall be required to provide, among other things, a valid email address. In providing your email address and agreeing to these Terms of Service, each authorized user consents to receiving email notifications from RealtyShares concerning offerings. In some cases, users of the restricted portions of the Site may be required to confirm their status as an Accredited Investor. In order for RealtyShares to confirm that your representation regarding your status as an Accredited Investor is accurate when made and continues to be accurate from time to time, you agree to provide RealtyShares with all information and documentation reasonably required by RealtyShares to verify your status as an Accredited Investor, including (without limitation) delivering a completed Accredited Investor questionnaire, tax returns, brokerage statements, bank statements, resumes and other private financial information. Should you fail to provide any requested information and documentation that confirms your status as an Accredited Investor, RealtyShares may immediately suspend, block or otherwise discontinue your access and use of the Site or Service. RealtyShares may change its eligibility criteria at any time, for any reason, and without prior notice.

Persons who are resident outside of the United States are allowed access to such investment opportunities only if such access does not violate the laws of their country of residence. Our services (and certain pages of the Site) that relate to the viewing of actual investment opportunities or to making investments in the securities offered therein may not be used by any person or entity in any jurisdiction where the provision or use thereof would be contrary to applicable laws, rules or regulations of any governmental authority or where RealtyShares or North Capital is not authorized to provide such information or services.

Securities Offerings; No Professional Advice Provided
The Service and securities offerings on this Site are available only to Accredited Investors who understand economic and investment risk and are willing to bear the consequences of that risk. Additionally, the securities offerings on this Site are only suitable for Accredited Investors who are familiar with and willing to accept the high risk associated with private real estate investments. By using the Site or Service, you represent and warrant that if you are an individual, you are of legal age to form a binding contract and that all registration information you submit is accurate and truthful. You acknowledge and agree that you have significant experience investing in investments of the type offered through the Site, including, without limitation, real estate, equities, notes and other securities, you understand that all of the investments offered through the Service are inherently very risky, and you understand the risks associated with the investments offered through the Site, and you are comfortable with the risk of losing your entire investment invested through the Service. You further acknowledge and agree that investing in private placements carries with it low liquidity concerns and long-term commitments and that the securities sold through private placements are not publicly traded. Additionally, Investors may receive restricted stock that may be subject to holding period requirements. For those reasons, these offerings may be made availabile only to certain institutional investors and high net worth individuals and entities. If you are using the Site on behalf of any entity, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to accept this Agreement on such entity’s behalf, and that such entity agrees to indemnify RealtyShares for violations of this Agreement.
You further represent and agree that you understand that RealtyShares does not guarantee the performance of any offerings made through the Site or Service and any and all projections, estimates, and expectations for investments offered through the Site or Service are merely opinions and should not be relied on for any purpose whatsoever. The value of investments and the income from them can fall as well as rise. Past performance is not a guarantee of future performance. The contents of this Site do not constitute financial, legal, or tax advice. Investors are solely responsible for conducting any legal, accounting or due diligence review. You acknowledge and agree that RealtyShares is not a registered Investment Company or Investment Advisor within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940 and the Investment Advisors Act of 1940, respectively. You should obtain investment and tax advice from your advisers before deciding to invest. Investment products are not FDIC insured, may lose value, and there is no bank guarantee.
The securities offered on the Site have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, in reliance on the exemptive provisions of Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and Regulation D and Rule 506, and/or Regulation S, promulgated thereunder. Securities sold through private placements are restricted and not publicly traded, and are therefore illiquid. Neither the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission nor any state securities commission or other regulatory authority has approved, passed upon or endorsed the merits of any offering on this Website.
RealtyShares is not a registered broker-dealer, funding portal, or investment advisor and does not conduct any activity that would require such registration. Equity securities are offered through North Capital Private Securities Corporation(“North Capital”), member FINRA/SIPC. Individual personnel of RealtyShares may become registered representatives of North Capital. North Capital has developed a business continuity plan on how they will respond to events that significantly disrupt business. North Capital is located at 2825 E. Cottonwood Pkwy, Suite 500, Salt Lake City, UT 84121, tel: (888) 841-9984.

Investment overviews on the Site contain summaries of the purpose and principal business terms of the investment opportunities. Such summaries are intended for informational purposes only and do not purport to be complete, and each is qualified in its entirety by reference to the more detailed discussions contained in the investor document package relating to such investment opportunity. The information contained in the Website has been prepared by RealtyShares without reference to any particular user's investment requirements or financial situation, and potential investors are encouraged to consult with professional tax, legal and financial advisors before making any investment.


You may not become a beneficial owner of 20% or more of any issuer's outstanding voting equity securities (an “Issuer Covered Person”) without becoming subject to certain “bad actor” disqualifying events described in Rule 506(d) (a “Disqualifying Event”). You represent that you are not subject to a Disqualifying Event and that you will promptly notify RealtyShares in writing should any Disqualifying Events be applicable to you. RealtyShares is not liable or responsible for making Rule 506(e) disclosures, nor for determining whether any Issuer Covered Person is subject to a Disqualifying Event.


No Solicitation or Advice
None of the information contained in the publicly available portions of the Site constitutes a recommendation, solicitation or offer to buy or sell any securities, options or other financial instruments or other assets or provide any investment advice or service. The information contained in the Site has been prepared without reference to any particular User's investment requirements or financial situation.

Some products and services described on the Site may not be available in all jurisdictions or to all clients.

You acknowledge that you are not relying on RealtyShares or any of its affiliates, officers, directors, partners, agents or employees in making an investment decision.

If you believe that your work has been copied in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, or that any material on the Site violates this Agreement or your intellectual property rights, please notify RealtyShares as soon as possible by sending an email to contact@realtyshares.com, or by contacting RealtyShares’ Agent (listed below), with the following information pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”) (please confirm these requirements with your legal counsel, or see the U.S. Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. §512(c)(3), for more information): (i) an electronic or physical signature of the person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright interest; (ii) a description of the copyrighted work that you claim has been infringed; (iii) a description of where the material that you claim is infringing is located on the Site, sufficient for RealtyShares to locate the material; (iv) your contact information, including your address, telephone number, and email address; (v) a statement by you that you have a good faith belief that the disputed use is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and (vi) a statement by you that the information in your notice is accurate and, under penalty of perjury, that you are the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf.
Pursuant to Section 512(c)(2) of the DMCA, RealtyShares’ designates the following agent to receive notifications of claimed infringement:

		Nav Athwal

You acknowledge that if you fail to comply with all of the requirements of this section, your DMCA notice may not be valid. We reserve the right to remove User Content alleged to be infringing or otherwise illegal without prior notice and at our sole discretion. In appropriate circumstances, RealtyShares will also terminate a User's account if the user is determined to be a repeat infringer.

        investing easy. We’ll be providing you with access to a broader capital pool made up of investors that
        want to participate in projects like yours. We’ll come to you as a single investor, in a manner that is

        efficient.
RealtyShares can become your company’s capital-raising partner. Please contact us at raise@realtyshares.com to discuss your particular project.
What kind of real estate investments can be listed on RealtyShares?
RealtyShares lists investment opportunities involving a variety of real estate property types, including
        multi-family residential, office, industrial, self-storage, retail, and hospitality facilities.
        Single-family residences being used for investment purposes (not owner-occupied) are also the subject of
        many investment opportunities. We generally prefer to finance properties in or near a significant
        metropolitan area, but it all depends on the particular situation.
RealtyShares also offers several different types of financing options. We can do secured real estate
        loans (both first- or second-lien positions); equity financing, usually for properties involving in-place
        cash flow that provide an income component to the investment; and/or “preferred equity” investments
        involving a preferential position in the equity capital structure but with only limited potential upside
        (so that sponsors retain most of the appreciation). If there is a specific property or financing type you
        might be interested in, let us know
        here.
What criteria does RealtyShares have for debt financing?
RealtyShares, through its lending subsidiary RS Lending, Inc., provides business-purposes loans (i.e., no
        owner-occupied properties) secured by both conventional residential properties (such as single-family
        residences) as well as commercial properties (e.g., larger apartment buildings, retail centers, office
        buildings, etc.). We can provide both short-term (usually, 36 months or less) 1st-lien and 2nd-lien debt
        financing on residential properties. We can also provide both bridge or permanent debt financing on
        commercial properties.
RealtyShares looks at a number of criteria in underwriting potential loan opportunities. Generally, we
        look for certain minimum loan-to-cost (LTC) or loan-to-after-repair-value (ARV) criteria. We also like to
        understand the operating plan for the project, and we verify borrower credit and background history.
Each of these criteria vary slightly by situation and loan product; please contact us here to discuss your particular project.
How do you keep my personal information secure?
We go to great lengths to ensure the security of all of our members and our data and use Secure Sockets
        Layer. SSL is the standard security technology for establishing an encrypted link between a web server and
        a browser. We use 128-bit encryption, which is the same level of encryption used by top national banks. We
        are also regularly audited by third party security firms to ensure compliance with the most rigorous
        security standards.
For added protection, we never store your banking information on our servers and we automatically log you
        out of your account after 30 minutes of inactivity.
How do you choose which real estate companies can raise money through RealtyShares?
We’re looking for companies with a knowledgeable team and a proven strategy and track record. Among other
        diligence inquiries, we will run background and credit checks on the principals of your company, and will
        perform a more thorough review of each project that is initially thought to be a suitable fit for our
        platform. Once we are comfortable with your team and the investment, we can proceed to the details of
        getting your project listed on our platform.
Currently, we list only a relatively small percentage of all of the prospective projects that are
        brought to us.
