Ivy Launches its First Three NextSharesTM Exchange-Traded 
      Managed Funds






October 18, 2016 07:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time



OVERLAND PARK, Kan.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Ivy has expanded the way investors can access active investment 
      management that is packaged with the tax and cost efficiencies found in 
      exchange trading.
    


      Ivy Investment Management Company (IICO) today introduced its first 
      three Ivy NextShares as part of a planned lineup of NextShares 
      exchange-traded managed funds. IICO becomes among the first to offer the 
      new structure.
    

      “NextShares represent another step in our effort to provide clients with 
      unique, progressive investment products. We are pleased to be one of the 
      first firms to bring them to market,” said Thomas W. Butch, president 
      and CEO of Ivy Distributors, Inc. “Ivy NextShares offer the potential 
      for competitive investment returns by applying the strength of Ivy’s 
      experienced portfolio managers and proprietary investment research in a 
      cost-effective and tax-effective structure.”
    

      The three Ivy NextShares, effective today, include:
    


Ivy Energy NextShares, which invests at least 80% of its net 
        assets in securities of companies within all aspects of the energy 
        sector, such as exploration, discovery, production, distribution or 
        infrastructure of energy and/or alternative energy sources. The 
        portfolio typically will hold 50 to 65 stocks. It is managed by 
        veteran portfolio manager David P. Ginther, CPA, senior vice president 
        of IICO, and Michael T. Wolverton, CFA, vice president of IICO.
      

Ivy Focused Growth NextShares, which invests primarily in a 
        portfolio of common stocks issued by large capitalization, 
        growth-oriented companies that the manager believes have the ability 
        to sustain growth over the long term. The portfolio typically will 
        maintain a limited number of stocks, generally 15 to 25. It is managed 
        by veteran portfolio manager Daniel P. Becker, CFA, senior vice 
        president of IICO, and Bradley M. Klapmeyer, CFA, vice president and 
        of IICO.
      

Ivy Focused Value NextShares, which invests primarily in the 
        common stocks of companies that the manager believes are undervalued, 
        trading at a significant discount relative to the intrinsic value of 
        the company as estimated by IICO and/or are out of favor in the 
        financial markets but have a favorable outlook for capital 
        appreciation. The portfolio typically will maintain a limited number 
        of stocks, generally 15 to 25. It will be managed by veteran portfolio 
        manager Matthew T. Norris, CFA, senior vice president of IICO.
      


      “We congratulate Ivy on the launch of their three NextShares funds,” 
      said Stephen W. Clarke, president of NextShares Solutions, LLC. “Ivy is 
      leading the evolution of active fund investing to a potentially 
      better-performing, lower cost and more tax efficient structure.”
    

      NextShares, an innovative way to invest in actively managed strategies, 
      offer the potential for benchmark-beating returns by applying their 
      managers’ proprietary investment research. As exchange-traded products, 
      NextShares may offer cost and tax efficiencies that have the potential 
      to enhance shareholder returns. NextShares may invest across all fund 
      asset classes and are expected to be offered by a range of well-known 
      asset managers.
    

      NextShares are currently available through Folio Investing and Folio 
      Institutional, leading online brokerage services. Interactive Brokers 
      Group, an automated global electronic broker and market maker, and 
      Envestnet, a provider of unified wealth management technology and 
      services, have both announced their intentions to make NextShares 
      available on their platforms in the near term. In July 2016, UBS 
      Financial Services announced plans to become the first full-service 
      wealth manager to offer NextShares through its financial advisor network 
      in early 2017.
    

      The first NextShares funds were launched by Eaton Vance Management 
      earlier this year, at which time they began trading on the Nasdaq Stock 
      Market LLC. In December 2014, the SEC granted exemptive relief to permit 
      the offering of NextShares exchange-traded managed funds, and a year 
      later, they declared effective the registration statements for 
      NextShares funds sponsored by Eaton Vance Management. The Eaton Vance 
      order prescribed that a short-form application could be used for future 
      exemptive relief requests submitted by other advisers that agreed to 
      abide by the terms and conditions of the Eaton Vance order. IICO used 
      the short-form to secure the appropriate approvals from the SEC to 
      launch Ivy NextShares.

About NextShares Solutions and Eaton Vance


      NextShares Solutions LLC is a wholly owned subsidiary of Eaton Vance 
      formed to develop and commercialize NextShares. Aspects of the operation 
      of NextShares are protected intellectual property owned by NextShares 
      Solutions.
    

      Eaton Vance (NYSE: EV) is a leading global asset manager whose history 
      dates to 1924. With offices in North America, Europe, Asia and 
      Australia, Eaton Vance and its affiliates managed $334.3 billion in 
      assets as of July 31, 2016, offering individuals and institutions a 
      broad array of investment strategies and wealth management solutions. 
      For more information, see eatonvance.com.
    

      Shares of NextShares funds are normally bought and sold in the secondary 
      market through a broker, and may not be individually purchased or 
      redeemed from the fund. In the secondary market, buyers and sellers 
      transact with each other, rather than with the fund. NextShares funds 
      issue and redeem shares only in specified creation unit quantities in 
      transactions by or through Authorized Participants. In such 
      transactions, a fund issues and redeems shares in exchange for the 
      basket of securities, other instruments and/or cash that the fund 
      specifies each business day. By transacting in kind, a NextShares fund 
      can lower its trading costs and enhance fund tax efficiency by avoiding 
      forced sales of securities to meet redemptions. Redemptions may be 
      effected partially or entirely in cash when in-kind delivery is not 
      practicable or deemed not in the best interests of shareholders. A 
      fund’s basket is not intended to be representative of the fund’s current 
      portfolio positions and may vary significantly from current positions. 
      As exchange-traded securities, NextShares can operate with low transfer 
      agency expenses by utilizing the same highly efficient share processing 
      system as used for exchange-listed stocks and ETFs.
    

      Market trading prices of NextShares are linked to the fund’s 
      next-computed net asset value (NAV) and will vary from NAV by a 
      market-determined premium or discount, which may be zero. Buyers and 
      sellers of NextShares will not know the value of their purchases and 
      sales until after the fund’s NAV is determined at the end of the trading 
      day. Market trading prices may vary significantly from anticipated 
      levels. NextShares do not offer investors the opportunity to buy and 
      sell intraday based on current (versus end-of-day) determinations of 
      fund value. NextShares trade execution prices will fluctuate based on 
      changes in NAV. Although limit orders may be used to control trading 
      costs, they cannot be used to control or limit trade execution prices. 
      As a new type of fund, NextShares have a limited operating history and 
      may initially be available through a limited number of brokers. There 
      can be no guarantee that an active trading market for NextShares will 
      develop or be maintained, or that their listing will continue unchanged. 
      Buying and selling NextShares may require payment of brokerage 
      commissions and expose transacting shareholders to other trading costs. 
      Frequent trading may detract from realized investment returns. The 
      return on a shareholder’s NextShares investment will be reduced if the 
      shareholder sells shares at a greater discount or narrower premium to 
      NAV than he or she acquired the shares.
    

Risk factors: The value of the Fund’s shares will change, and you 
      could lose money on your investment. An investment in the Fund is not a 
      bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit 
      Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Ivy Energy 
      NextShares: Investing in companies involved in one specified sector 
      may be more risky and volatile than an investment with greater 
      diversification. Investing in the energy sector can be riskier than 
      other types of investment activities because of a range of factors, 
      including price fluctuation caused by real and perceived inflationary 
      trends and political developments, and the cost assumed by energy 
      companies in complying with environmental safety regulations. These and 
      other risks are more fully described in the Fund’s prospectus. Ivy 
      Focused Growth NextShares: Investing in companies involved primarily 
      in a single asset class (large cap) may be more risky and volatile than 
      an investment with greater diversification. Growth stocks may be more 
      volatile or not perform as well as value stocks or the stock market. 
      These and other risks are more fully described in the Fund’s prospectus. 
      Ivy Focused Value NextShares: The value of a security believed by 
      the Fund’s manager to be undervalued may never reach what the manager 
      believes to be its full value, or such security’s value may decrease. 
      Investing in companies in anticipation of a catalyst carries the risk 
      that certain of such catalysts may not happen or the market may react 
      differently than expected to such catalysts, in which case the Fund may 
      experience losses. The securities of many companies may have significant 
      exposure to foreign markets as a result of the company’s operations, 
      products or services in those foreign markets. As a result, a company’s 
      domicile and/or the markets in which the company’s securities trade may 
      not be fully reflective of its sources of revenue. Such securities would 
      be subject to some of the same risks as an investment in foreign 
      securities, including the risk that political and economic events unique 
      to a country or region will adversely affect those markets in which the 
      company’s products or services are sold. These and other risks are more 
      fully described in the Fund’s prospectus.

Ivy Funds Joins NextShares in Plan to Introduce Exchange-Traded Managed Funds | Business Wire
























































Ivy Funds Joins NextShares in Plan to Introduce Exchange-Traded 
      Managed Funds






July 21, 2015 07:30 AM Eastern Daylight Time



OVERLAND PARK, Kan.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Ivy Investment Management Company, a subsidiary of Waddell & Reed 
      Financial, Inc. (NYSE: WDR) has entered into a preliminary agreement 
      with Navigate Fund Solutions LLC (Navigate), a subsidiary of Eaton Vance 
      Corp. (NYSE: EV), to support the launch by Ivy Funds of a family of 
      NextShares™ exchange-traded managed funds.
    


      “Adapting to evolutions in the product landscape has always been one of 
      Ivy’s priorities, as we seek to deliver our investment products in 
      structures that the marketplace may desire,” said Thomas W. Butch, 
      president and CEO of Ivy Funds Distributor, Inc., and executive vice 
      president of Ivy’s parent firm Waddell & Reed Financial, Inc. 
      “NextShares can be a progressive way to offer Ivy’s actively managed 
      products.” Butch indicated that NextShares also may be considered for 
      Waddell & Reed Advisors Funds, Waddell & Reed’s other retail fund family.
    

      NextShares are a new type of actively managed fund designed to have 
      built-in cost and tax efficiencies. Like actively managed mutual funds, 
      they are managed by an investment team that seeks to outperform a 
      benchmark index. However, unlike conventional exchange-traded funds 
      (ETFs), NextShares are designed to protect the confidentiality of fund 
      trading information and provide buyers and sellers of shares with 
      transparency and control of their trading costs. As a result, NextShares 
      potentially offer attractive features unavailable in other investment 
      products. Learn more by visiting www.nextshares.com.
    

      "Ivy Funds is an innovative and respected investment manager that we’re 
      pleased to add as a NextShares partner," said Stephen W. Clarke, 
      president of Navigate. "Together with broker-dealers, we seek to evolve 
      the delivery of active management to a higher-performing and more 
      efficient fund structure."
    

      Among other things, the Ivy Funds launch of NextShares is subject to 
      securing exemptive order relief from the Securities and Exchange 
      Commission to allow it to manage exchange-traded managed funds, as well 
      as the development of implementation technology by broker/dealers and 
      other market participants.

      categories, including international and domestic equity funds, specialty

About Navigate and Eaton Vance


      Navigate is a wholly owned subsidiary of Eaton Vance Corp. formed to 
      develop and commercialize NextShares. Aspects of the operation of 
      NextShares are protected intellectual property owned by Navigate.
    

      Eaton Vance Corp. is one of the oldest investment management firms in 
      the United States, with a history dating to 1924. Eaton Vance and its 
      affiliates managed $307.3 billion in assets as of June 30, 2015, 
      offering individuals and institutions a broad array of investment 
      strategies and wealth management solutions. For more information, see 
      eatonvance.com.
    

This press release is for information purposes only and is not 
      intended to constitute, and should not be construed as, an offer to sell 
      securities. The agreement described herein is preliminary in nature and 
      non-binding, so therefore may not be executed. The launch of Ivy 
      NextShares funds by Ivy Funds is conditional upon regulatory approval, 
      the likelihood and timing of which cannot be predicted. Commercial 
      success also requires completion of enabling implementation technology 
      and acceptance by market participants, which cannot be assured. Like 
      mutual funds, Ivy NextShares will not offer investors the opportunity to 
      buy and sell intraday based on current (versus end-of-day) 
      determinations of fund value. Ivy NextShares trade execution prices will 
      fluctuate based on changes in NAV and may vary significantly from 
      anticipated levels during periods of market volatility. Although limit 
      orders may be used to control trading costs, they cannot be used to 
      control or limit trade execution prices. There can be no guarantee that 
      an active trading market for Ivy NextShares will develop or be 
      maintained, or that their listing will continue unchanged. Buying and 
      selling Ivy NextShares may require payment of brokerage commissions and 
      expose transacting shareholders to other trading costs. Market trading 
      prices of Ivy NextShares may be above, at or below NAV, will fluctuate 
      in relation to NAV based on supply and demand in the market for shares 
      and other factors, and may vary significantly from NAV. The return on a 
      shareholder’s Ivy NextShares investment will be reduced if the 
      shareholder sells shares at a greater discount or narrower premium to 
      NAV than he or she acquired the shares. The performance of actively 
      managed Ivy NextShares will depend in part on the portfolio managers’

IICO becomes among the first to offer the new structure.“NextShares represent another step in our effort to provide clients with unique, progressive investment products. We are pleased to be one of the first firms to bring them to market,” said Thomas W. Butch, president and CEO of Ivy Distributors, Inc. “Ivy NextShares offer the potential for competitive investment returns by applying the strength of Ivy’s experienced portfolio managers and proprietary investment research in a cost-effective and tax-effective structure.”The three Ivy NextShares, effective today, include: Ivy Energy NextShares, which invests at least 80% of its net assets in securities of companies within all aspects of the energy sector, such as exploration, discovery, production, distribution or infrastructure of energy and/or alternative energy sources. The portfolio typically will hold 50 to 65 stocks. It is managed by veteran portfolio manager David P. Ginther, CPA, senior vice president of IICO, and Michael T. Wolverton, CFA, vice president of IICO.  Ivy Focused Growth NextShares, which invests primarily in a portfolio of common stocks issued by large capitalization, growth-oriented companies that the manager believes have the ability to sustain growth over the long term. The portfolio typically will maintain a limited number of stocks, generally 15 to 25. It is managed by veteran portfolio manager Daniel P. Becker, CFA, senior vice president of IICO, and Bradley M. Klapmeyer, CFA, vice president and of IICO.  Ivy Focused Value NextShares, which invests primarily in the common stocks of companies that the manager believes are undervalued, trading at a significant discount relative to the intrinsic value of the company as estimated by IICO and/or are out of favor in the financial markets but have a favorable outlook for capital appreciation. The portfolio typically will maintain a limited number of stocks, generally 15 to 25. It will be managed by veteran portfolio manager Matthew T. Norris, CFA, senior vice president of IICO. “We congratulate Ivy on the launch of their three NextShares funds,” said Stephen W. Clarke, president of NextShares Solutions, LLC. “Ivy is leading the evolution of active fund investing to a potentially better-performing, lower cost and more tax efficient structure.”NextShares, an innovative way to invest in actively managed strategies, offer the potential for benchmark-beating returns by applying their managers’ proprietary investment research. As exchange-traded products, NextShares may offer cost and tax efficiencies that have the potential to enhance shareholder returns. NextShares may invest across all fund asset classes and are expected to be offered by a range of well-known asset managers.NextShares are currently available through Folio Investing and Folio Institutional, leading online brokerage services. Interactive Brokers Group, an automated global electronic broker and market maker, and Envestnet, a provider of unified wealth management technology and services, have both announced their intentions to make NextShares available on their platforms in the near term. In July 2016, UBS Financial Services announced plans to become the first full-service wealth manager to offer NextShares through its financial advisor network in early 2017.The first NextShares funds were launched by Eaton Vance Management earlier this year, at which time they began trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC. In December 2014, the SEC granted exemptive relief to permit the offering of NextShares exchange-traded managed funds, and a year later, they declared effective the registration statements for NextShares funds sponsored by Eaton Vance Management. The Eaton Vance order prescribed that a short-form application could be used for future exemptive relief requests submitted by other advisers that agreed to abide by the terms and conditions of the Eaton Vance order. IICO used the short-form to secure the appropriate approvals from the SEC to launch Ivy NextShares.About Ivy InvestmentsIvy InvestmentsSM is a global organization recognized for inventive, actively-managed investing strategies that help investors best meet their long-term goals.

For more information, see eatonvance.com.Read MoreShares of NextShares funds are normally bought and sold in the secondary market through a broker, and may not be individually purchased or redeemed from the fund. In the secondary market, buyers and sellers transact with each other, rather than with the fund. NextShares funds issue and redeem shares only in specified creation unit quantities in transactions by or through Authorized Participants. In such transactions, a fund issues and redeems shares in exchange for the basket of securities, other instruments and/or cash that the fund specifies each business day. By transacting in kind, a NextShares fund can lower its trading costs and enhance fund tax efficiency by avoiding forced sales of securities to meet redemptions. Redemptions may be effected partially or entirely in cash when in-kind delivery is not practicable or deemed not in the best interests of shareholders. A fund’s basket is not intended to be representative of the fund’s current portfolio positions and may vary significantly from current positions. As exchange-traded securities, NextShares can operate with low transfer agency expenses by utilizing the same highly efficient share processing system as used for exchange-listed stocks and ETFs.Market trading prices of NextShares are linked to the fund’s next-computed net asset value (NAV) and will vary from NAV by a market-determined premium or discount, which may be zero. Buyers and sellers of NextShares will not know the value of their purchases and sales until after the fund’s NAV is determined at the end of the trading day. Market trading prices may vary significantly from anticipated levels. NextShares do not offer investors the opportunity to buy and sell intraday based on current (versus end-of-day) determinations of fund value. NextShares trade execution prices will fluctuate based on changes in NAV. Although limit orders may be used to control trading costs, they cannot be used to control or limit trade execution prices. As a new type of fund, NextShares have a limited operating history and may initially be available through a limited number of brokers. There can be no guarantee that an active trading market for NextShares will develop or be maintained, or that their listing will continue unchanged. Buying and selling NextShares may require payment of brokerage commissions and expose transacting shareholders to other trading costs. Frequent trading may detract from realized investment returns. The return on a shareholder’s NextShares investment will be reduced if the shareholder sells shares at a greater discount or narrower premium to NAV than he or she acquired the shares.Risk factors: The value of the Fund’s shares will change, and you could lose money on your investment. An investment in the Fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Ivy Energy NextShares: Investing in companies involved in one specified sector may be more risky and volatile than an investment with greater diversification. Investing in the energy sector can be riskier than other types of investment activities because of a range of factors, including price fluctuation caused by real and perceived inflationary trends and political developments, and the cost assumed by energy companies in complying with environmental safety regulations. These and other risks are more fully described in the Fund’s prospectus. Ivy Focused Growth NextShares: Investing in companies involved primarily in a single asset class (large cap) may be more risky and volatile than an investment with greater diversification. Growth stocks may be more volatile or not perform as well as value stocks or the stock market. These and other risks are more fully described in the Fund’s prospectus. Ivy Focused Value NextShares: The value of a security believed by the Fund’s manager to be undervalued may never reach what the manager believes to be its full value, or such security’s value may decrease. Investing in companies in anticipation of a catalyst carries the risk that certain of such catalysts may not happen or the market may react differently than expected to such catalysts, in which case the Fund may experience losses. The securities of many companies may have significant exposure to foreign markets as a result of the company’s operations, products or services in those foreign markets. As a result, a company’s domicile and/or the markets in which the company’s securities trade may not be fully reflective of its sources of revenue. Such securities would be subject to some of the same risks as an investment in foreign securities, including the risk that political and economic events unique to a country or region will adversely affect those markets in which the company’s products or services are sold. These and other risks are more fully described in the Fund’s prospectus.NextSharesTM is a trademark of NextShares Solutions LLC. All rights reserved.

Additional Fund Literature

Continue














Data quoted is past performance and current performance may be lower or higher. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate, and shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.Risk factors: The value of the Fund's shares will change, and you could lose money on your investment. An investment in the Fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The value of a security believed by the Fund's manager to be undervalued may never reach what the manager believes to be its full value, or such security's value may decrease. Investing in companies in anticipation of a catalyst carries the risk that certain of such catalysts may not happen or the market may react differently than expected to such catalysts, in which case the Fund may experience losses. The securities of many companies may have significant exposure to foreign markets as a result of the company's operations, products or services in those foreign markets. As a result, a company's domicile and/or the markets in which the company's securities trade may not be fully reflective of its sources of revenue. Such securities would be subject to some of the same risks as an investment in foreign securities, including the risk that political and economic events unique to a country or region will adversely affect those markets in which the company's products or services are sold. These and other risks are more fully described in the Fund's prospectus.Index Description: Russell 1000 Value is an unmanaged index comprised of securities that represent the large cap sector of the stock market. It is not possible to invest directly in an index.NextShares™ is a trademark of NextShares Solutions LLC. All rights reserved. Used with permission.Market trading prices of NextShares are linked to the fund's next-computed net asset value (NAV) and will vary from NAV by a market-determined premium or discount, which may be zero.Ivy NextShares are a new type of fund. NextShares funds have a limited operating history and may not be available at all broker/dealers. There is no guarantee that an active trading market for NextShares funds will develop or be maintained, or that their listings will continue or remain unchanged.Before investing, investors should consider carefully the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of an Ivy NextShares exchange-traded managed fund. This and other important information is contained in the prospectus and summary prospectus, which may be obtained   here  or from a financial advisor. Read it carefully before investing.About NextShares: Shares of NextShares funds are normally bought and sold in the secondary market through a broker, and may not be individually purchased or redeemed from the fund. In the secondary market, buyers and sellers transact with each other, rather than with the fund. NextShares funds issue and redeem shares only in specified creation unit quantities in transactions by or through Authorized Participants. In such transactions, a fund issues and redeems shares in exchange for the basket of securities, other instruments and/or cash that the fund specifies each business day. By transacting in kind, a NextShares fund can lower its trading costs and enhance fund tax efficiency by avoiding forced sales of securities to meet redemptions. Redemptions may be effected partially or entirely in cash when in-kind delivery is not practicable or deemed not in the best interests of shareholders. A fund’s basket is not intended to be representative of the fund’s current portfolio positions and may vary significantly from current positions. As exchange-traded securities, NextShares can operate with low transfer agency expenses by utilizing the same highly efficient share processing system as used for exchange-listed stocks and ETFs. Trading prices are linked to the NextShares next-computed NAV and will vary by a market-determined premium or discount, which may be zero; may be above, at or below NAV; and may vary significantly from anticipated levels. Purchase and sale prices will not be known until the NextShares NAV is determined at the end of the trading day. NextShares do not offer the opportunity to transact intraday based on current (versus end-of-day) determinations of a fund's value. Limit orders can be used to control differences in trade prices versus NAV (cost of trade execution), but cannot be used to control or limit execution price. Buying and selling NextShares may require payment of brokerage commissions and expose transacting shareholders to other trading costs. Frequent trading may detract from realized investment returns. The return on a shareholder’s NextShares investment will be reduced if the shareholder sells shares at a greater discount or narrower premium to NAV than he or she acquired the shares.Please remember that an investment in an Ivy NextShares exchange-traded managed fund involves risk. Investment return and principal value of an Ivy NextShares investment will fluctuate, and when redeemed, may be worth more or less than its original cost.Fee Waiver and/or Expense Reimbursement:Through October 31, 2017, Ivy Investment Management Company (IICO), the Fund’s investment manager, and/or Waddell & Reed Services Company, doing business as WI Services Company (WISC), the Fund’s accounting and administrative services agent, has contractually agreed to reimburse sufficient management fees and/or accounting and administrative services fees to cap the total annual ordinary fund operating expenses at 0.78%. Prior to that date, the expense limitation may not be terminated by IICO, WISC or the Board of Trustees.Pricing: All prices and year-to-date returns are based on closing quotes unless noted, as supplied to the NASDAQ by 6:00 p.m. Eastern time. YTD Prices can be updated 3 to 4 hours after the Daily Pricing information which can result in mismatching data.When a fund's share class has less than a year of performance to report, the returns shown are cumulative.Information is subject to change and is not intended to represent any past or future investment recommendations.Ivy NextShares funds are managed by Ivy Investment Management Company and are distributed by ALPS Distributors, Inc.ALPS Distributors, Inc., NextShares Solutions LLC, and Ivy Investment Management Company or Ivy Distributors, Inc. (or their affiliates), are all unaffiliated companies.

Data quoted is past performance and current performance may be lower or higher. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate, and shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.Risk factors: The value of the Fund’s shares will change, and you could lose money on your investment. An investment in the Fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Investing in companies involved in one specified sector may be more risky and volatile than an investment with greater diversification. Investing in the energy sector can be riskier than other types of investment activities because of a range of factors, including price fluctuation caused by real and perceived inflationary trends and political developments, and the cost assumed by energy companies in complying with environmental safety regulations. These and other risks are more fully described in the Fund's prospectus.Index Description: S&P 1500 Energy Sector is an unmanaged index comprised of securities that represent the energy sector of the stock market. It is not possible to invest directly in an index.NextShares™ is a trademark of NextShares Solutions LLC. All rights reserved. Used with permission.Market trading prices of NextShares are linked to the fund's next-computed net asset value (NAV) and will vary from NAV by a market-determined premium or discount, which may be zero.Ivy NextShares are a new type of fund. NextShares funds have a limited operating history and may not be available at all broker/dealers. There is no guarantee that an active trading market for NextShares funds will develop or be maintained, or that their listings will continue or remain unchanged.Before investing, investors should consider carefully the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of an Ivy NextShares exchange-traded managed fund. This and other important information is contained in the prospectus and summary prospectus, which may be obtained   here  or from a financial advisor. Read it carefully before investing.About NextShares: Shares of NextShares funds are normally bought and sold in the secondary market through a broker, and may not be individually purchased or redeemed from the fund. In the secondary market, buyers and sellers transact with each other, rather than with the fund. NextShares funds issue and redeem shares only in specified creation unit quantities in transactions by or through Authorized Participants. In such transactions, a fund issues and redeems shares in exchange for the basket of securities, other instruments and/or cash that the fund specifies each business day. By transacting in kind, a NextShares fund can lower its trading costs and enhance fund tax efficiency by avoiding forced sales of securities to meet redemptions. Redemptions may be effected partially or entirely in cash when in-kind delivery is not practicable or deemed not in the best interests of shareholders. A fund’s basket is not intended to be representative of the fund’s current portfolio positions and may vary significantly from current positions. As exchange-traded securities, NextShares can operate with low transfer agency expenses by utilizing the same highly efficient share processing system as used for exchange-listed stocks and ETFs. Trading prices are linked to the NextShares next-computed NAV and will vary by a market-determined premium or discount, which may be zero; may be above, at or below NAV; and may vary significantly from anticipated levels. Purchase and sale prices will not be known until the NextShares NAV is determined at the end of the trading day. NextShares do not offer the opportunity to transact intraday based on current (versus end-of-day) determinations of a fund's value. Limit orders can be used to control differences in trade prices versus NAV (cost of trade execution), but cannot be used to control or limit execution price. Buying and selling NextShares may require payment of brokerage commissions and expose transacting shareholders to other trading costs. Frequent trading may detract from realized investment returns. The return on a shareholder’s NextShares investment will be reduced if the shareholder sells shares at a greater discount or narrower premium to NAV than he or she acquired the shares.Please remember that an investment in an Ivy NextShares exchange-traded managed fund involves risk. Investment return and principal value of an Ivy NextShares investment will fluctuate, and when redeemed, may be worth more or less than its original cost.Fee Waiver and/or Expense Reimbursement: Through Oct. 31, 2017, Ivy Investment Management Company (IICO), the Fund’s investment manager, and/or Waddell & Reed Services Company, doing business as WI Services Company (WISC), the Fund’s accounting and administrative services agent, has contractually agreed to reimburse sufficient management fees and/or accounting and administrative services fees to cap the total annual ordinary fund operating expenses at 0.95%. Prior to that date, the expense limitation may not be terminated by IICO, WISC or the Board of Trustees.Pricing: All prices and year-to-date returns are based on closing quotes unless noted, as supplied to the NASDAQ by 6:00 p.m. Eastern time. YTD Prices can be updated 3 to 4 hours after the Daily Pricing information which can result in mismatching data.When a fund's share class has less than a year of performance to report, the returns shown are cumulative.Information is subject to change and is not intended to represent any past or future investment recommendations.Ivy NextShares funds are managed by Ivy Investment Management Company and are distributed by ALPS Distributors, Inc.ALPS Distributors, Inc., NextShares Solutions LLC, and Ivy Investment Management Company or Ivy Distributors, Inc.
