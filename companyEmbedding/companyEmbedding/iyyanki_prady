I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Cris Gaut, our Executive Chairman. Cris?
C. Christopher Gaut - Forum Energy Technologies, Inc.
Thanks, Mark. Good morning. Forum continues to show good growth in orders and revenue, led by our strong position in completion- and production-oriented products. Relative to the other U.S. public oilfield equipment companies, Forum has a leading exposure to the continued growth in land-based North America completion and production spending.
With a growing backlog of wells yet to be fracked, completed and brought on production, we see an attractive runway and strong demand for our products. We're also pleased with the progress of our acquisition effort. Following the acquisition of the assets of Cooper Valves in the first quarter of the year, we completed this month the acquisition of Multilift. Although not a large deal, Multilift will add to the growing stable of artificial lift products within our Completions segment . We believe the market for acquisition opportunities is continuing to improve for us.

So without further ado, let me hand the call to Forum's new CEO, Prady Iyyanki. Prady?
Prady Iyyanki - Forum Energy Technologies, Inc.
Thanks, Cris. Good morning, everyone. I'm going to provide an overview for the quarter, discuss our strategy and focus areas, and some operational highlights. Then I will turn the call over to Jim Harris to provide further details on our financial performance. Our team performed well in the second quarter.
Our second quarter revenue was $201 million, an 18% increase sequentially, and we had positive adjusted EBITDA for the company in every segment during the quarter. We continue to execute our strategic plan of ensuring strong financial discipline, having a balanced business portfolio, emphasizing consumable and activity-based products and growing through organic initiatives and acquisitions. This allows us to respond to market conditions in any part of the cycle.
Currently, our focus is on the robust North America completions activity and infrastructure build-out as evident from our two recent acquisitions, Multilift and the assets of Cooper Valves. The U.S. land drilling and completions activity remains strong and our U.S. revenue in the second quarter increased 23% sequentially, in line with growth in the U.S. rig count and completions activity. And every segment experienced revenue growth in the U.S. during the quarter.
For four quarters in a row, we saw an increase in our inbound orders, which is a good indicator of our near-term business prospects. Forum's total inbound orders during the second quarter were $214 million, a 10% increase from the level in the first quarter. The second quarter book-to-bill ratio was 106% for the company as a whole, led by 123% for the Completions segment. Orders in our Completions segment increased 31% and over 45% for stimulation and intervention products, as customer spending improved on almost all product offerings across the segment.
The strong fundamentals for the pressure pumping services are driving demand for our pressure pumping products, including orders for approximately 480,000 horsepower of our power ends year-to-date. In addition, our new products are gaining traction. We received orders for eight of our new innovative manifold trailer, the ICBM, and several good orders for our new Race Track suction manifold and several other new products. We are starting to see price improvement on recent pressure pumping orders now in backlog, which will be reflected in our second half results.
We're pleased with the acquisition of Multilift in early July. The SandGuard and Cyclone completion tools extend the useful life of an electrical submersible pump by protecting it against sand and other solids. The acquisition fits with our strategy of expanding a product offering in the artificial lift value chain. Forum is well positioned for the growth in artificial lift with the Cannon Protectors and Multilift completion tools for downhole pumps, and our Global Tubing coiled line pipe for gas lift.
In our Production & Infrastructure segment, orders improved 24% and our book-to-bill ratio was 112% as demand continues to be strong for U.S. land drill separation equipment. I want to recognize our valves team for achieving a record level of orders during the quarter. This was accomplished without any contribution from Forum Arabia, our new manufacturing facility being built in Saudi Arabia, which is on schedule to be fully operational in 2018.
Our first quarter acquisition of Cooper Valves is progressing on target. The integration is complete and our sales team are beginning to leverage our existing midstream and downstream customer base and distribution network to expand Cooper sales.
Orders in our Drilling & Subsea segment were down 21% resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 84% during the quarter. The decline in drilling orders was due to fewer rig upgrades as the land drilling fleet moves into a maintenance mode for the balance of the year. The offshore recovery continues to lag. As a result, we now expect orders for our Subsea product line to be at a low level for an extended period and weighted to non-oil and gas activity.

Our operating margins continue to improve as we see the benefit of better manufacturing cost absorption and operational efficiencies and lower procurement cost. Our operating margins will further expand as the pricing improves in second half. We continue to build our pipeline of M&A targets with a primary focus on expanding our completions offering, followed by midstream and downstream opportunities.
As we look ahead to the third quarter of 2017, we expect demand for Completions and Production & Infrastructure segments to increase as activity continues in the U.S. land market. Our incrementals in second half in Completions will be stronger than first half as pricing materializes and better absorption of ramp-up cost. We expect our revenue to improve by around 8% to 12% and we expect a diluted loss per share to be in the range of $0.07 to $0.04.
Let me ask Jim to take you through our results and financial position. Jim?
James W. Harris - Forum Energy Technologies, Inc.
Thank you, Prady, and good morning, everyone. Our second quarter revenue was $201 million, an 18% increase sequentially. This is the third increase in our quarterly revenue in a row and consolidated revenue is up 45% from the trough in the third quarter last year. Our adjusted EBITDA increased $9 million and our adjusted net loss per share was $0.10, excluding special items, an improvement from the first quarter as the U.S. land recovery continued. I will summarize our results on a sequential basis for the quarter and provide additional details on the second quarter results.
Our Drilling & Subsea segment revenue of $64 million was up 4%, primarily due to the improvement in sales of drilling equipment and products. The Completions segment revenue of $55 million increased 29% sequentially as customer spending improved on higher well construction and completions activity in North America. Our Production & Infrastructure segment revenue of $83 million was up 23% due to improved sales of both our U.S. land well site production equipment and our valve products.
For the quarter, we had adjusted EBITDA of $5.9 million. Importantly, this was our first positive EBITDA quarter since 2015. Our incremental operating margins were 33% on an adjusted basis, with little to no pricing improvement. Including the additional Subsea goodwill impairment charge, the net loss for the second quarter was $78 million or $0.81 per share. The quarter included special items on a pre-tax basis of $68 million for the goodwill impairment, $3 million of foreign exchange losses, and $3 million of restructuring and other expenses. The adjusted net loss, excluding these items and the associated income taxes, was $0.10.
During the quarter, we evaluated the carrying value of the goodwill in our Subsea product line, which currently represents less than 10% of our revenues. The review was triggered by the softening of oil prices and the developing consensus view that production from lower-cost oil basins would be sufficient to meet anticipated demand for a longer period. This has delayed the need for production from higher cost basins, like offshore. As a result, we determine that the carrying value of the remaining goodwill and our Subsea product line was impaired.
Our free cash flow after net capital expenditures in the second quarter was $12 million, which included an IRS tax refund of about $31 million. With the accelerated receipt of this anticipated tax refund in the second quarter and our continued build in working capital due to increased revenue expectations in the second half of the year, we now expect to be free cash flow positive no later than the first quarter of 2018 as earnings continue to improve.
Our net capital expenditures in the second quarter were $8 million. Our budget for 2017 capital expenditures is approximately $30 million, which includes the investment in our new production facility in Saudi Arabia expected to come online later this year.

Our balance sheet and financial position remained strong. We ended the quarter with $221 million of cash on hand and with no bank debt outstanding. We closed the Multilift acquisition in early July for approximately $40 million using available cash. We remained well positioned and ready to execute our acquisition strategy.
Our weighted average diluted share count for the second quarter was 96.2 million shares. When we turn profitable on a net income basis, the diluted share count will increase to approximately 99 million shares at the current share price to, once again, include the impact of options.
Net debt at the end of the second quarter was $179 million, down $15 million, bringing our net debt to total capitalization ratio to 13.2%. Interest expense was $6 million in the second quarter. Corporate expenses were $8 million and we now expect corporate expenses to be around $9 million in the third quarter.
Depreciation and amortization expense was $15 million for the quarter and should be similar in the third quarter. Our effective tax rate on the second quarter adjusted operating loss was 39%. We estimate our effective tax rate on normal operations for the remainder of the year will be approximately 37%.
For more information about our financial results, please review the earnings release on our website. And with that, let me turn the call back over to Prady.
Prady Iyyanki - Forum Energy Technologies, Inc.
Thanks, Jim. Forum's team is capitalizing on opportunities the market is presenting currently in North America and expanding our operating margins even without any meaningful pricing improvement. I'm pleased with the new market-leading products the team has developed. You will see us continue to invest in organic growth initiatives and execute our M&A strategy, especially in Completions and Production & Infrastructure segments.
Thank you for your interest. At this point, we'll open the line for questions. Operator, please take the first question.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Our first question comes from the line of George O'Leary with TPH & Company. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
George O’Leary - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.
Good morning, guys. I thought the results on the Production & Infrastructure segment were particularly interesting just given the magnitude and move quarter-on-quarter. I realized Cooper is in there now, so that had something to do with it. I wonder if you could just parse out maybe, going forward, how we should think about the Production side versus the Infrastructure side. Are we starting to see some kind of underlying demand growth on the Valves side of the business, or is the growth, going forward, still really more production-oriented, i.e. kind of U.S. onshore well count-oriented? How would you guys kind of break that out?
Prady Iyyanki - Forum Energy Technologies, Inc.
Yeah. Thanks, George. I would say the P&I had a very strong bookings in revenue in second quarter. I mean, let me talk about Valves for a second. Even without the Cooper Valves contribution in the second quarter, they still had a record level of bookings. And it's primarily the upstream in North America is up and the midstream in the U.S. is either flattish or a little bit up, but we're gaining market share as there's an infrastructure build out in basins for transportation, gas terminals, the liquid pipelines. And on the international front, both the midstream and downstream is pretty active and we're trying to gain market share and that's one of the reasons, George, why we are building this operation in Saudi Arabia focused on Middle East and downstream. And we're also increasing our presence in the Southeast Asia to penetrate the midstream and downstream part of the market.

On the utility side, either pipeline's being refurbished or the new pipeline is being built and we are maximizing on that. So, this is primarily a market share gain opportunity for us, which we're capitalizing on with the exception of riding the wave on the upstream side. And on the production equipment side, I think the demand is strong and we continue to ramp up on the production equipment side.
George O’Leary - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.
Great. That's very helpful color. And then you guys have been a little bit more acquisitive and you talked about generally where you're looking to deploy incremental capital as bid-ask spreads have compressed. I guess, when I think about the completion side, going forward, are acquisitions going to be more focused you think on the downhole tool side of that business or more kind of Flow Equipment adding on to the pressure pump offering you guys have?
Prady Iyyanki - Forum Energy Technologies, Inc.
Yeah. Good question, George. I would say on the acquisition side, I think our strategy remains intact. Our number one area of focus is completions, which includes the surface and also the downhole products. And obviously, the Multilift acquisition we did is consistent with the strategy, right, on the artificial lift, which plays a roll, both on the completion side and also on the production side. And then the second priority is any opportunities we can get on the midstream/downstream side would be the second priority, which is also the Cooper acquisition which we did in earlier part of the year. So, I think our M&A strategy is intact. I'd also say the M&A environment is probably friendly in the second half, just because the value gap has come down, which is primarily the IPO season is coming to an end. And the expectations on pricing is getting more reasonable. However, it is very competitive, but I think deals will get done in the second half.
George O’Leary - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.
Great. And then maybe if I could just sneak one more in, Prady. The Multilift acquisition is one that seems pretty intriguing to us, as there does seem to be a growing trend of ESPs and ESPs being in wells over longer durations than they historically were, especially U.S. onshore, these kind of high pressure, longer-lateral horizontal wells. Given kind of the unique nature of that business, to some degree, it seems to me that that might be accretive to Forum's margins. I realize the transaction wasn't super large. But would you call that kind of product line within the Forum complex, accretive to you all's margins?
Prady Iyyanki - Forum Energy Technologies, Inc.
So, we're really excited about Multilift, George. I would say it's accretive to the business. Probably, the deal got done at a historic ranges, which you have seen us do in the past. It'll be meaningful for the downhole product line in 2018. It's going to move the needle for those guys. And again, it's an IP protected product, the SandGuard, which is a self-cleaning device without any flow disruptions, and also the Cyclone product. And I think our differentiation in the Cyclone product is they've a lot of different configurations out there and, in our case, one size fits all. And in the case of SandGuard, which is an IP-protected product, the competitive landscape is very favorable to us and the customer saves significant amount of cost when the pump has a failure because of the sand intrusion into the ESP. So, we're really excited about the Multilift acquisition. And consistent with our acquisition strategy, are focused on completions.
George O’Leary - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.
Great. Thanks very much for the color, guys.
Prady Iyyanki - Forum Energy Technologies, Inc.

Thanks, George.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Martin Malloy with Johnson Rice. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Martin W. Malloy - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC
Good morning.
C. Christopher Gaut - Forum Energy Technologies, Inc.
Hi, Martin.
James W. Harris - Forum Energy Technologies, Inc.
Hey, Martin.
Martin W. Malloy - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC
Had a question on the Drilling & Subsea segment, and maybe if you could talk a little bit more about what's going on there. The revenues are relatively flat, it looks like, quarter-over-quarter and the inbounds were down quite a bit. And if you could maybe talk about that, what you're seeing with the drilling rig, land drilling rig upgrade cycle, and particularly the mud pumps and how much longer that might last.
Prady Iyyanki - Forum Energy Technologies, Inc.
Yeah. Good question, Marty. I would say, on the – let me talk about the consumables and then also about the capital equipment. Then I'll also talk about the Subsea piece. On the consumable front, our expectation is, with the rig count stabilizing or maybe a little bit of decline, some of the active rigs will go into the maintenance mode, but they will still need the OpEx part of the consumables. But what we expect to see is less mud pump upgrades in second half compared to the first half. However, completion-weighted products, like the centrifugal pumps, the Little Trippers and bearings, we expect still good activity on that front.
But overall, we expect the drilling product line to have a decline in the third quarter from a revenue standpoint. Now, fourth quarter, there are a few variables there, mostly on the capital equipment side, is there are several discussions with customers on upgrading the lower spec rigs to the higher spec rigs where the content for us could be anywhere from $0.5 million to $2 million. And primarily, where we come into play is rather than just doing the recertification, we are upgrading our catwalks, extending the reach and the height and the 7,500 psi upgrades. And also, in some cases, the handling tools and the condition-based monitoring could play a role.
There's a little bit of uncertainty there when that's going to materialize. But the pipeline on that in U.S. pretty good. And there's a little bit more uncertainty on the international front. But the pipeline on the international front is a little stronger than what it was about four months ago, primarily in Middle East and in India, and also in North America, but more in Middle East and in India. So, on the capital equipment side, there is a level of uncertainty. But if some of that materializes, our fourth quarter could be stronger than third quarter, but we don't know at this point.
On the Subsea front, Marty, I would say that we have a great franchise. We got a great team. It's a bad market on the oil and gas front. But in our case, it's less than 10% of the portfolio. And our target, again for this year, is EBITDA flat at the product line level, so it doesn't drag the mother ship down. But we are exploring opportunities outside oil and gas, and I'll be disappointed if we don't announce any orders in the second half of 2018, because there is a pipeline for us outside oil and gas.
But the oil and gas is pretty weak and the pipeline is pretty much nonexistent on the oil and gas side. So, we continue to streamline our operations on the Subsea and make very selective investments to protect the franchise. But again, it's less than 10% of the portfolio.
Martin W. Malloy - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC
Okay. And then a second question, could you talk about in the specific product lines where you're seeing the lead times stretch out the most and where you think you have the opportunity to start to have pricing discussions with your customers about increasing pricing?

Prady Iyyanki - Forum Energy Technologies, Inc.
Yeah. Well, great question, Marty. I would say, S&I, stimulation and intervention, the pressure pumping part of the portfolio across the board, I think I would say demand is very strong as evident from our bookings and also revenue the last two, three quarters. We are still ramping up fast, and it's still hand to mouth. The lead times are extending, and it is providing opportunities for us from a pricing standpoint. And I would say, later part of second half, the tail end of second quarter, the pricing started materializing, not meaningful in second quarter, but we'll start seeing that in the results in the third quarter and fourth quarter. And that's one of the reasons why we said is our second half incrementals on completions will be stronger than what you've seen in the first half. But the lead times are getting extended, and we are getting pricing opportunities.
Now, the other point on the S&I side is, with the significant amount of growth we're seeing on the top line and bookings, we're adding significant amount of people. Our workforce has increased significantly. And there's a little bit of productivity which will catch up in the second half of 2017, right? I mean, the folks who come new are not productive right from day one. It takes a couple of months for them to be productive. So we're not seeing the operational productivity yet in S&I, but we do expect to see that in second half. And on top of it, the pricing which is materializing, which is already in the backlog, will start materializing in the second half.
And then the other product line is production equipment. It is pretty much hand to mouth, and the lead times are extending. We got a very strong backlog going into third quarter and fourth quarter. However, the pricing on the production equipment is fourth quarter, first quarter price, right, because as you remember, we got the chunky orders in fourth quarter and first quarter, which are still flowing through the shop. But I would say late fourth quarter, we'll start seeing that pricing materialize through the operations, too. Jim?
James W. Harris - Forum Energy Technologies, Inc.
Yeah. Marty, I would also just highlight that similar to production equipment, we always talk about our stimulation and intervention business being a book-and-ship business. But given the strength of the demand that we've had in orders, we've actually built a backlog there. So likewise, we've taken orders in the first half of this year, and some of those early in the years, especially for the power ends that was at pricing that was very aggressive. And while we've seen pricing increase, until we deliver on the backlog that we now have at these lower prices, once that's done, we'll start seeing the benefit of these pricing increases that Prady was describing. But that's a little bit of a subtle change from what we've said in the past about S&I just given the level of backlog we have today.

Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Scott Gruber with Citigroup. Your line is open. Please, go ahead.
Scott A. Gruber - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Yes, good morning.
Prady Iyyanki - Forum Energy Technologies, Inc.
Good morning, Scott.
Scott A. Gruber - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Prady, the pickup in Middle East demand you highlighted earlier, can you provide some color just across the product spectrum when you look at upstream, midstream, downstream, is it primarily midstream and downstream at this point or is some of the upstream orders trying to pick up as well?
Prady Iyyanki - Forum Energy Technologies, Inc.
Yeah. I think our initial focus – the manufacturing facility we're building in Saudi Arabia will be focused on the midstream and downstream part of the portfolio, more particularly, in valves. And our customers are showing pretty good interest there, and also the local content – we meet the local content requirements which also gives us a pricing premium. And I think the operation will be active in the fourth quarter of 2017, but fully operational in 2018. But as we go through that process, we're going to put other products too in the manufacturing location later part of 2018 and 2019, which would be focused on the completion side and also some of the other products lines on the – like for example, some of the sub-product lines in drilling. So, I think the focus is across the spectrum. But initially, the focus of the manufacturing shop will be on the midstream and downstream, more particularly, on valves.

Scott A. Gruber - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Got it.
Prady Iyyanki - Forum Energy Technologies, Inc.
But I'd also say we are gaining momentum. We do have commercial presence now than what we had in the past, and that commercial team is gaining traction on the completion side. And some orders and revenue are already trickling down, but the manufacturing location is still here in U.S.
Scott A. Gruber - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
And then, how do you think about expanding your capabilities on the rig equipment side? Do you wait to tie it to the big tenders in the Middle East coming into the market, or do you try to move ahead? Any color you can provide on those bigger tenders and what you're seeing there?
Prady Iyyanki - Forum Energy Technologies, Inc.
Sure. I would say, listen, the pipeline in Middle East – in fact, I would say, that's the region which has a strongest pipeline on the capital equipment side, whether it's Kuwait, or whether it's Abu Dhabi, or whether it's Saudi Aramco, or whether it's even Qatar. I mean, the whole Middle East is – the pipeline is pretty strong, Scott. However, things are moving to the right. There's one Middle Eastern customer we just recently heard that maybe some tenders could happen in the fourth quarter. And our view is, probably, they're expecting – they're waiting for the oil price to go past $50, and some of those tenders will come into fruition.
And we have pretty good installed fleet in Middle East from a Forum standpoint. In fact, we have the biggest catwalk installed fleet in Middle East and a pretty good service team in Middle East. So, I think that part of the business will continue to be strong in Middle East. We're trying build up the Completions and the Production, Infrastructure part of the portfolio in Middle East as part of the manufacturing location.
Scott A. Gruber - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Got it. And if we just take a longer-term view, you highlighted the expansion in Southeast Asia focusing on midstream and downstream again, what do you envision – where do you envision potentially going over the next five years? Thinking about the expansion and shale activity in Argentina. And some of your competitors, NOV and Schlumberger are forecasting a rig upgrade cycle in Russia. Could you just provide some color on where else you're thinking about expanding internationally to take advantage of opportunities as shale goes global and opportunities to upgrade the land rig fleet internationally?
Prady Iyyanki - Forum Energy Technologies, Inc.
Yeah. So, I think on the pressure pumping side, Scott, our main focus is North America. And as we mentioned, right now, we're hand-to-mouth and the demand is strong and we need to ramp up fast. So, right now, I think all our resources and everything is focused in North America, and then we're going to start penetrating Canada too. But right now – our focus right now is in the U.S.
In Argentina and China and some of the other countries, I mentioned, they're still at an early phase. I think if we just look from an opportunity standpoint, it's still small. And we are not fully penetrated yet in North America and Canada. And one of the things we do like is our products are gaining traction in North America, some of the new products we've commercialized. So, a lot of market share opportunity for us in U.S. and Canada. Then also on international front, some of our existing customers will take us there. Right? I mean, as they go on international front, some of those pressure pumpers, they will take us and the products will be – we've got to put some service locations there. But right now, our focus more is in U.S. and North America.
Now, the Southeast Asia right now – listen, when the offshore boom was good, we had a pretty good install fleet on onshore and offshore. But right now, the biggest opportunity we see in Far East is on the infrastructure build-out side, which is primarily the valves part of the business. There's a market where we don't participate and our supply chain – most of our supply chain is in that part of the world. So, I think it's a low-hanging fruit, which we want to take advantage of. And as the revenue starts coming and as the profitability starts coming from the Southeast Asia, we'll start building the infrastructure for the rest of the segments, too.

Scott A. Gruber - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Got it. Appreciate the color.
Prady Iyyanki - Forum Energy Technologies, Inc.
Thanks, Scott.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Rob MacKenzie with IBERIA Capital. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Rob J. MacKenzie - IBERIA Capital Partners LLC
Good morning, guys. I wanted to come back to the Subsea product line for a minute. In the wake of the Technip/FMC merger and their decision to standardize going forward on the Schilling product line, are there any specific legacy Schilling customers that you think are right to pick off and convert to Perry in the next upcycle?
Prady Iyyanki - Forum Energy Technologies, Inc.
Absolutely. I think there is an opportunity there, Rob. And I think the closer that tie becomes between the Schilling and Technip, some of our customers will see them as competitors, and that does give us the opportunity to penetrate the market on the oil and gas front. But I'd also say is one of the things we are pleased about our Subsea team is we are diversifying outside oil and gas, whether it's the telecom, or whether it's the defense, or whether it's the marine research, or whether it's the wind farm, and we think for the next couple of years, when the market is down, we can still pay the bills and protect the franchise. And then once the oil and gas business comes, that's on top of, right, the business which we're going to have outside the oil and gas. But absolutely, to your point, I think that will give us the opportunity to penetrate some of the other customers. And the new customers who are also coming on board, that will also give us the opportunity to penetrate those customers.
Rob J. MacKenzie - IBERIA Capital Partners LLC
Great. Thanks. And then on the completions side, I guess – I understand why pricing takes a while to occur there. But I'm a bit surprised given the strong growth in revenues sequentially that incremental margins and absolute margins, therefore, weren't higher than they were. Is there some other moving parts there that you could help us to understand that?
Prady Iyyanki - Forum Energy Technologies, Inc.
It's a great question. Well, I would say, if you look at our growth in second quarter from a revenue standpoint, I mean, two segments drove that growth, right. One is the Completions segment and the second one is the P&I segment, and I want to talk about two specific product lines there, which will add more color here is the S&I the production equipment were strong as part of the revenue growth contribution. And S&I, I think Jim added some color, is on one front we are ramping up significantly, just not for the second quarter, we're also ramping up for the third quarter and fourth quarter, based on the backlog we're building, and a significant amount of orders we are seeing which is providing – which is causing some productivity issues in the shop, because of all the new people coming on board.
And also, on the pricing front, the service customer started getting pricing earlier than us. And now we are seeing less resistance from the service customers on the pricing discussions. As a result, we started seeing the price materialize in the tail end of second quarter, which will start materializing into the results in third quarter and fourth quarter. right? And that's why think our incrementals on the completions side will be much stronger in second half than first half.
The second point, from color standpoint, is production equipment. And as you know, historically, it has been a low margin business and we took chunky orders in the fourth quarter and first quarter of the last year, and the pricing was fourth quarter and first quarter. pretty much at the bottom, or a little bit higher in the first quarter. And that is still flowing through the shop, because we've got a very strong backlog in the third quarter. Pretty much every – we've got everything in the backlog for the third quarter, right, with little opportunity, that we could take on a little bit more work, but in the fourth quarter, tail end of fourth quarter is when we'll start realizing the prices, which we started quoting in second and, more importantly, in third quarter, too. So factor of those two; production equipment and S&I pricing materializing in the tail end of second quarter and of the absorption productivity issues we have because of all the new people.

C. Christopher Gaut - Forum Energy Technologies, Inc.
And just to highlight, Rob, when the Completions business is at a run rate that's almost doubling every six months, with an extremely high growth like that and strong demand that we see and the runway in front of us, we've got to build for the future demand. We see that the market's there. So, we have been adding costs. We've been adding people, adding equipment. So, there's some ramp-up costs that we're seeing here in the second quarter in anticipation of the strong market and the strong orders that we're building. And so, those costs did affect our margins in Q2. But I think you'll see the benefit of not only the continued high rate of growth there, but better margins later in the year. But we're just trying to accommodate such a fast-growing market. That's a challenge.
Prady Iyyanki - Forum Energy Technologies, Inc.
And probably another data point, Rob, we can talk about, because a lot of things we do feel about is the margin expansion which is happening is, if you take our P&I equipment out, from an incremental standpoint, our incrementals are 40%. And without production and equipment, our incrementals are 44%. Right. So, we are seeing incrementals. And as we start getting the price and the cost absorption, which Cris talked about, I think incrementals will be stronger in second half.
Rob J. MacKenzie - IBERIA Capital Partners LLC
Great. That's very helpful. And then one final question, if I can, on the Completions segment. Is there any way for you guys to pull out of that of your numbers, in the growth in revenue, how much of that is coming from the new OEM equipment versus repairing or replacing worn out parts on active equipment in the field already?
Prady Iyyanki - Forum Energy Technologies, Inc.
Yeah. No, I think it's a great question. I would like to use power end as a data point, being a capital equipment, I would say, probably 55% new-builds and 45% refurbished or replacements. That's what we're seeing on the power ends. And then as you go down the chain, then the refurbishment becomes a bigger percentage and the capital equipment becomes a little smaller percentage.
Rob J. MacKenzie - IBERIA Capital Partners LLC
Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.
C. Christopher Gaut - Forum Energy Technologies, Inc.
Thanks, Rob.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Marc Bianchi with Cowen. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Marc Bianchi - Cowen & Co. LLC
Thank you. So, talked a lot about the different segments and in terms of what the near-term outlook is. And I was hoping we could just sort of review and make sure I've got it all down. And I'm just going to run through this and maybe you can tell me where maybe if there is anything you'd update or change. It sounds like, drilling, possibly down a little bit in the third quarter; Subsea, flattish; Completions, growing at a pretty healthy pace; and P&I, about flat. Would you agree with that or how would you change that?
Prady Iyyanki - Forum Energy Technologies, Inc.
D&S, I think you're right on in third quarter. Completions, yes, strong growth. P&I, strong growth.
C. Christopher Gaut - Forum Energy Technologies, Inc.
Yeah. Good fundamentals there, Marc. And as you can tell from the high book-to-bill rate there for book-and-ship business.
Marc Bianchi - Cowen & Co. LLC
Sure.
Prady Iyyanki - Forum Energy Technologies, Inc.
But the D&S decline, and then the Completions and Production & Infrastructure, significant growth.
Marc Bianchi - Cowen & Co. LLC
Okay. Great. And then, in terms of the margin leverage there, Completions at the top. And then, how about between D&S and P&I?
Prady Iyyanki - Forum Energy Technologies, Inc.
I think in the case of D&S, since the revenue is going down, right, I think we'll manage the cost and streamlining of the operations. But I think what's going to move the incrementals for us is the Completions. And on the Production, Infrastructure side, as we talked about is the production equipment has always been a low-margin business. So, even though they will have margin expansion, they cannot move the needle for us.

Marc Bianchi - Cowen & Co. LLC
Okay. And nice to hear that you're getting some pricing traction in Completions. How much have you seen so far? How much is kind of baked into the outlook for the third quarter? Curious if you could provide some more color.
Prady Iyyanki - Forum Energy Technologies, Inc.
Yeah. Then, for competitive reasons, obviously, Marc, we don't want to share that. However, I can add some color to it, is I would say, by no means, it's a broad-based price recovery across all the segments. Where we are seeing price opportunities is in S&I, the pressure pumping part of the portfolio, and a little bit on the production equipment side, right. But we're not seeing pricing opportunities on the downhole products. However, we are commercializing some new products. For example, on the Global Tubing joint venture, we have commercialized our new quencher product which is the DURACOIL, and obviously that's much more reliable and durable, and we do expect the pricing to be better than the old coils. But the new products are driving the pricing in the downhole front. Bottom line is I think it's S&I and it's the production equipment, which is, again, a low-margin business.
Marc Bianchi - Cowen & Co. LLC
Sure. Well, thanks for that, Prady. I'll turn it back.
Prady Iyyanki - Forum Energy Technologies, Inc.
Thanks, Marc.

Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Sean Meakim with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Sean C. Meakim - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Thank you.
James W. Harris - Forum Energy Technologies, Inc.
Hey, Sean.
Sean C. Meakim - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Morning.
Prady Iyyanki - Forum Energy Technologies, Inc.
Good morning, Sean.
Sean C. Meakim - JPMorgan Securities LLC
I was hoping just to drill into the valves a little bit. You highlighted a good bit about the downstream opportunity, particularly as the Middle East and Asia Pac seems like there's tons of runway there. But how about in the U.S.? We've seen so many of these petrochemical projects start to move forward. It seems like there's a lot of opportunity here as well. Maybe you could size the two a little bit for us and maybe give us a little more of a sense of what the mix looks like for your U.S. valves franchise.
Prady Iyyanki - Forum Energy Technologies, Inc.
Yeah. Some of that, Marc (sic) [Sean], is already reflected in our valves bookings, and that's one of the reasons why we had a record quarter, not including Cooper. And I would say, the infrastructure build-out continues to happen, whether it's for the basins, for transportation or gas terminals or liquid pipelines. The downstream in the U.S. is down. The refineries in the petrochemical part of the product line – part of the segment is down in North America, but not internationally. Internationally, the downstream is pretty buoyant and so is the midstream part of the portfolio. So again, it's a big market and we have a small market share. So, I would say, the prospects for our valves business is – it's back on growth track and we are excited about our growth opportunities in valves. And whether it's midstream or downstream on the international front, which is all upside for us, or the market share opportunities in U.S., and we're also riding the upstream being up in North America.
C. Christopher Gaut - Forum Energy Technologies, Inc.
And that's positive in the valves business from a mix standpoint, that greater contribution from the upstream and some from the midstream relative to downstream is positive for margins from a mix standpoint.
Prady Iyyanki - Forum Energy Technologies, Inc.
And probably, the other point which is worth mentioning is, the Cooper acquisition was a strategic acquisition, and Cooper is pretty much on the midstream and the downstream part of the portfolio. And that exposes the power market and also the chemical – the petrochemical market which we're talking about. And a lot of opportunity there in the Cooper side, too.

C. Christopher Gaut - Forum Energy Technologies, Inc.
Okay. Time for one more question.
Operator
Our last question comes from the line of John Watson with Simmons & Company. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
John Watson - Simmons & Company International
Good morning, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in.
Prady Iyyanki - Forum Energy Technologies, Inc.
Good morning.
C. Christopher Gaut - Forum Energy Technologies, Inc.
Hey, John.
John Watson - Simmons & Company International
To follow-up on an earlier question, Prady, in drilling, could you provide us any idea surrounding the number of 7,500 psi and third mud pump upgrades Forum completed in the first half and maybe the potential number of rig upgrades moving forward?
Prady Iyyanki - Forum Energy Technologies, Inc.
Yeah. There are some moving elements still, John, but I think probably the guidance we can give is the second half, for sure, starting third quarter, we do see – from a run rate standpoint, we do see a decline in the mud pump upgrades and more in the fourth quarter, because we do have some in the backlog. I think our opportunity would be on some of those capital equipment discussions we're having with the customers where they may also need 7,500 upgrades, pretty much where you're already hearing the marketplaces, customers are trying to take 1,000 horsepower rig and upgrade that to the latest greatest spec from a rig standpoint, which gives us the opportunity to, not only recertify our catwalk, but also upgrade it to the latest spec. And then it can opportunities in the handling tools and condition-based monitoring, and that could be a content anywhere from $0.5 million to $2 million.
So how much of that will offset the mud pump decline, we don't know at this point of time. But as we've said, if some of those things start materializing, I think the fourth quarter could be a little stronger than Q3, but we don't know at this point of time.
John Watson - Simmons & Company International
Right. Okay. And then on the power end front, as of the Q1 call, I think annualized orders were around 750,000. Today, it's closer to 825,000. How much might that pace accelerate in the back half of the year? Could we be around 1 million horsepower for the full year?
Prady Iyyanki - Forum Energy Technologies, Inc.
I think the run rate is obviously – if you look at the run rate, it feels like that, but it also depends on how much more frac fleets will come into the marketplace between now and end of the year, John. I would say, listen, we had 250 million horsepower by the, I think, last – when we had the last call, and right now, we have about 480,000 horsepower of power ends. But the run rate is – it feels like 1 million, but it also depends how much more frac fleet they're going to put in the marketplace. Our expectation is probably will land somewhere between 15 million to 16 million horsepower, if we read, right, the same things which you guys read. But certainly, we have a shot towards that.
C. Christopher Gaut - Forum Energy Technologies, Inc.
And John, it's probably fair to say at this point that the easy stuff to be put to work went to work a while ago, and anything that's put out to work there now, whether refurbished or obviously new, will require a new power end. So, any additions from this point do require new power ends, iron.
Prady Iyyanki - Forum Energy Technologies, Inc.
It's a great point, right? Once we go past the 14 million, 15 million horsepower, they will – refurbishing more with new versus trying to repair them.
John Watson - Simmons & Company International
Well, I think you all will get to 1 million, for whatever that's worth. And then, one last unrelated follow-up, Jim, on the free cash flow guidance, seems like there's been a bit of a change from positive in the back half to positive in early 2018. Can you provide any additional color surrounding that change and maybe color around commodity price or rig count that's incorporated into that guidance?

James W. Harris - Forum Energy Technologies, Inc.
Sure. So, John, one of the big changes is, when we gave the guidance on the second half, we were expecting that large tax refund to come in the second half, and just through the hard work of our tax department and other folks, we were able to get it in June. So that was a $30 million move. And that's why we were cash flow positive in the second quarter even though we had given guidance that we expected negative. But as we look at the second half, Cris described, as we're growing, the start-up costs that we're putting in place with labor and others as we're ramping up. The same is true for our inventories. So, we are continuing to purchase and invest in materials so that we can ramp up production to meet what we expect to be the demand, and we're still obviously at a low base of earnings.
And so, the confluence of still low EBITDA, while investing in rapid growth is what's driving us into the negative cash flow. And once we work through that, even if growth continues, we'll be able to do, as we have historically, grow positively with positive free cash flow and still cover those investments. It's just there's a bridge here in the second half that we're hedging a little bit.
John Watson - Simmons & Company International
Right. Okay. Thanks. I'll turn it back.
Prady Iyyanki - Forum Energy Technologies, Inc.
Thanks, Jim. Thanks for your interest. Two segments, the Completions segment and the Production & Infrastructure segments are two strong tailwinds for us during the second half. And if you look at our bookings, about 70% of the bookings came from those two segments. And we're excited about that and we'll talk more at the next investor call. Thanks for your interest.

I am now pleased to turn the call over to Cris Gaut, our Chief Executive Officer.
Cris Gaut
Thanks, Mark. Good morning. I will begin with an overview, and talk about the current market conditions. Afterwards, I will turn it over to Prady, who will address the ramp-up in activity and our outlook. And then Jim will discuss our financial results and the impact of resetting our SG&A cost run rate for the recovery.
The recovery in the U.S. land, drilling, and completions activity is well underway, and Forum is highly leveraged to it. Our U.S. revenue in the first quarter increased 25% sequentially, roughly in line with the change in the U.S. rig count. The primary contributors were completions, drilling consumables, and production equipment, which collectively grew by 33% in the first quarter. For the third consecutive quarter we saw an increase in our inbound orders, which is a good indicator of our near-term business prospects. Forum's total inbound orders during the first quarter were $194 million, that's a 6% increase from the level in the fourth quarter. And the first quarter book-to-bill ratio was 113% for the company as a whole, led by 119% for the Completion segment.

Orders in our Completion segment increased 31%, and were up 50% for our pressure pumping products, as customer spending improved on almost all product offerings across the segment. During the quarter, orders from our pressure pumping customers were particularly strong as they were spending money to reactivate their hydraulic fracturing fleets. Orders in our Drilling product line were up 13%, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 107% during the quarter, primarily on the continuing demand for rig consumable products and mud pump upgrade packages for the U.S. land drilling market.
Despite the weak fundamentals in the subsea oil and gas market, Forum was able to achieve a book-to-bill ratio of 119% in the first quarter for our Subsea product line, which continues to focus on non-oilfield opportunities. In our Production Equipment product line our book-to-bill ratio was 123% as demand continues to be strong for U.S. onshore well completions. With over 70% of our business tied to the U.S. land market, Forum is uniquely well-positioned among manufacturing companies in a strong domestic recovery which is underway.
I will now turn the call over to Prady. Prady?
Prady Iyyanki
Thanks, Cris. Good morning everyone. The growth in orders and revenue for our products is leading to increased demand load on our manufacturing facilities. We continue to ramp up production at many of our manufacturing plants. We're seeing strong demand for our drilling consumable products most of the Completions segment, and well site production equipment. For these manufacturing plants our current indication is for full cost absorption in the second or third quarter of this year. We have sufficient roof line and manufacturing equipment capacity, and do not have facility constraints.
As part of the ramp up in our production, we have hired a substantial number of additional manufacturing employees during the quarter, and expect to continue recruitment throughout the remainder of the year. Our procurement team has done a great job securing capacity from our supplier for long-lead items, mitigating a supply chain risk by diversifying our supply base, and shortening the delivery times of many of the critical items. As the recovery continues to gain momentum we are beginning to see the benefit of better manufacturing cost absorption, operational efficiencies, and lower procurement cost.
For certain products in U.S. land, where demand is especially strong and with the lead times extending, we are beginning to see the opportunities of price increases. I am confident in our ability to increase our operating margins as the recovery gains momentum. Our sales and engineering teams continue to work with their customers to develop new products. In particular, we are developing several new products in the Completions segment to address the longer laterals and higher service intensity, and sand loadings now required in the shale plays. I'll give you a few examples. We just delivered our first new pressure pumping manifold trailer, the ICBM, which is a clean design, simplifies the assembly operations and service tests. This allows for a quicker and safer setup in the field, and eliminates premature failure on the high-pressure branch connections.
We designed a new innovative rack track [ph] suction manifold, which attaches to the fluid end of better sand distribution, therefore extending the life of the fluident [ph]. We have already sold over 40 units during the quarter. We have also engineered a new 60-inch [indiscernible] valve stainless steel quintuplex fluid end to match with the 3,000 horsepower frac pump. Another good example is our [indiscernible] pressure pumping power end. We're getting good traction from customers on this product due to the proven reliability and performance. We've added five new customers during the quarter, and have received orders for over 250,000 horsepower thus far in 2017, and continue to gain momentum. Our pipeline of M&A targets is strong, with a primary focus on expanding our Completions offering for the midstream and downstream opportunities.

As we look ahead to the second quarter of 2017, we expect our orders for consumable products to increase as the recovery continues in the U.S. land market. Our revenues improved by around 12% to 15%, positive EBITDA, for the first time since 2015, and a diluted loss per share to be the range of $0.12 to $0.09.
Let me ask Jim to take you through our results and financial positions. Jim?
Jim Harris
Thank you, Prady, and good morning everyone. Our first quarter revenue was $171 million, a 16% increase sequentially. This is the second sequential increase in our quarterly revenue in the last two years.
Our adjusted EBITDA increased $2 million, and our adjusted net loss per share was $0.14 excluding special items, an improvement from the fourth quarter as the industry began to transition to the U.S. land upturn. The step change in SG&A cost required to participate in the U.S. recovery is now in place, and represents a more normalized run rate for the year. I will summarize our segment results on a sequential basis for the quarter, and provide additional details on the first quarter results.
Our Drilling & Subsea segment revenue, of $62 million, was up 13% primarily due to the strong improvement in sales of drilling consumable products. The Completion segment revenue, of $42 million, increased 21% sequentially as customer spending improved on higher well construction and completions activity in North America.
Our Production & Infrastructure segment revenue, of $68 million, was up 18% due to improved sales of our U.S. land well site production equipment, and the addition of the Cooper Valves' asset acquisition during the first quarter. Although for the quarter we had adjusted EBITDA of negative $3.4 million, importantly, we cross over to positive EBITDA for the last month of the quarter.
As we guided in our last quarter call, the first quarter improvement in earnings included overcoming the step change increase in SG&A necessitated by the improving market conditions. In the first quarter, we reinstated historical pay practices for our employees at a quarterly cost of approximately $5 million. These practices include a return to full work schedules, accruing for expected 2017 bonuses at target levels, and providing company-matching contribution to the Forum 401(k) plan. In addition, we added about $1 million of SG&A cost in the quarter that will benefit our operations going forward as the recovery continues. Further, our SG&A run rate now includes the operations of the Copper Valves asset acquisition. The adjusted SG&A increased $6 million in the first quarter, and was approximately $60 million. Going forward, incremental revenue should require modest variable SG&A cost increases.
Excluding the step change cost additions in the quarter, our incremental EBITDA margins were 35%, with little or no pricing improvement. The net loss for the first quarter was $16 million, or $0.16 per share. The quarter included special items on a pretax basis comprised of $2 million of foreign exchange losses, and $1 million of transaction and other expenses. The adjusted net loss excluding these items and the associated income taxes was $0.14 per share. Our free cash flow after net capital expenditures in the first quarter was negative $18 million throughout the downturn. We successfully converted working capital for cash to continue to generate positive free cash flow.
In anticipation of the continuing recovery, we are investing and our highest demand inventory items to respond to the rapid upturn in activity. The increase in sales volumes are also translating in the corresponding increases and accounts receivable. These investments resulted in the negative free cash flow in the quarter. While we expect to use cash and operations for the first half of 2017 as earnings continue to improve throughout the year, with activity levels, we should return to generating positive free cash flow in the second half of the year.

Our growth capital expenditures in the first quarter were $3.5 million. Our budget for 2017 capital expenditures is approximately $30 million, which is sufficient for maintenance and select growth investments, primarily in the Middle East.
Our balance sheet and financial position remains strong. We ended the quarter with $205 million of cash on hand and with no banks that are outstanding. We remain well positioned and ready to execute our acquisition strategy. Our weighted average dilutive share count for the first quarter was $95.9 million shares. When we turn profitable on a net income basis, the diluted share count will increase to approximately $98.6 million shares to once again include the impact of options.
Net debt at the end of the first quarter was $194 million, up $32 million bringing our net debt to total capitalization ratio to 13.5%.
Interest expense was $6.6 million in the first quarter. Corporate expenses were $7.8 million, and we expect corporate expenses to be around $6 million in the second quarter.
Depreciation and amortization expense was $16 million for the quarter, and should be similar in the second quarter. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter operating loss was 45%. The higher effective tax rate benefit is attributable to the street items which occurred in the quarter.
We estimate our effective tax rate for the remainder of the year will be 37%. For more information about our financial results, please review the earnings release on our website. Now let me turn the call back over to Cris.
Cris Gaut
Thanks, James. Before we got to Q&A, let me just note that this is my conference call as CEO having had the privilege to serve as CEO for instances infection seven years ago. I will continue to be active as Chairman and will participate in that role in future conference calls. We brought party on for three years ago to create a more professional streamline and efficient organization that we will be among the leaders in the oil field manufacturing space. Since then Prady has proven himself at every turn to be an excellent leader with strong business judgment.
I was pleased to recommend to Board his move to CEO next month and I look forward to the continued growth and prosperity of the company under Prady's leadership. Prady?
Prady Iyyanki
Thank you, Cris. I'm honored to lead for him into his next chapter. Cris successfully said the direct performs business and financial strategy, but the transition to bring a public company and built a foundation across with the investors and customers. We established forum as a strong competitor within the oil field a different manufacturing sector and has proven to be an excellent mentor for me and many others.
I will ask Cris to continue to assist in this leadership transition. In his new position, he will be actively involved with our large strategic matters as well as acquisition and capital markets of course. I look forward to considering the strong partnership request.
We have a great team, a season broad and a strong business model. I'm excited to lead the next phase of significant profitable growth performed. We thank you for your interest. At this point, we will open the line for questions. Operator, please take the first question.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from David Anderson with Barclays. Your line is now open.
David Anderson
Hi, good morning. So, strong top line quarter overall and clearly you guys have leveraged to occur [ph] all the rate parts of the business. I guess, t part that's a little disappoint to us is just that the EBITDA progression here; you talked about kind of these additional costs that are in there. And Prady, I think you said forecast absorption by second or third quarter. Can you help us to kind of understand what we should be thinking by in terms of incremental margins going forward, or I guess maybe should we think about kind of fourth quarter should end up, it's just a little hard trying to figure out what the trajectory is right now on the EBITDA path.

Jim Harris
Hey, David. Yes, I think that Jim made the point as he was going through the explanation of the SG&A step change that we had that excluding that the impacts of the SG&A one-time effects here, the incremental margins, which were 35% in Q1 without any pricing improvement. I think the implication and the guidance that we've given is that the incremental margins in Q2 will be a bit better than that. And as we moved forward with the recovery here and what the incrementals are from there for the company as a whole, will depend on a few things. As you point out, absorption, getting to full absorption is a positive factor until you get to pull absorption and then you kind of use that one, but what I haven't [ph] kicked in, yes, is pricing.
David Anderson
Right.
Jim Harris
Prady, talked about some of the pricing opportunities that we are seeing, we are getting to see. And so, incremental margins in the fourth quarter will depend upon what rate of improvement in pricing we have across our businesses by that point in time, but I think the overall message is that we had good incremental margins, excluding what -- you know, the well-telegraphed change in SG&A that we talked about last quarter, and they should be better in the next quarter.
David Anderson
And so, as we talk about pricing, I guess one thing I've been kind of curious about is kind of lead times for some of your drilling and completion equipment. Some of the smaller operations has taken a bit longer to get flow, and I would imagine there will be a precursor to kind of this long way inventory restocking cycle, can you talk about those dynamics right now in terms of what you are seeing out there, or is it little early to start seeing this stretching and kind of how you think this kind of walks forward in terms of inventory restocking and pricing and lead times and all that?
Cris Gaut
Yes, yes, I think specially the pressure pumping, David, we still have inventory in the outer rims [ph] and some of the other parts, but some of the long lead items like where you need forging and castings, we are already seeing extensions in the lead time, which does give the opportunity to have discussions on pricing. So, those discussions have already started.
Prady Iyyanki
But the demand for treating iron is high, and we are ramping up our rate of production there as quickly as we can to address the rapid increase in demand. And it's basic economics; demand and supply, and when demand exceeds supply, what's all we learned in economics class, right?
Cris Gaut
Yes, and if we look at our Completion segment as a segment, both bookings, incrementals, and also revenue were all very strong.
David Anderson
Okay. And enhance also why you need to increase the SG&A, because you have more people working and they are going to be all working in there. Just a last question on that, Prady, I think it would sense to me with a midstream and downstream opportunities in there and I noticed in the release you talked of valve orders, how it is for -- very strong this quarter. Can you quantify that valve order increase for us a bit? Just kind of curious how that lined up with the rate cut and maybe what's some of the primary drivers are behind that, that part is maybe we talked about that too much valves in last few years just kind of curious how much is going to be a drive over the next couple of years.
Prady Iyyanki
Yes. Well, I think a good question, David. But I think the valves numbers they gave out are, I think the Cooper acquisition has obviously helped but independent from the Cooper acquisition, if we look at our valve business, we have presence and midstream, downstream and upstream and we are saying activity in the upstream side, which is driving some of the bookings in the valves and we had a pretty strong quarter from a booking standpoint as well.

Cris Gaut
Yes, midstream and downstream, good demand, pretty steady. The increase in demand for valves is on the upstream side as one would expect and in addition to that greater demand for the upstream valves is the addition of Cooper, which is probably levered to the power industry, which we didn't really have exposure to before.
David Anderson
Okay. Great. Thank you, gentlemen.
Cris Gaut
Thanks, David.
Operator
And our next question comes from Jacob Lundberg with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
Jacob Lundberg
Hi, good morning guys. Thanks for taking the question.
Cris Gaut
Hi, there.
Jacob Lundberg
Just wanted to drill down on the guidance for 2Q a little more, are you guys able to speak to what in your mind the guidance range on EPS implies from and EBITDA perspective? Looks like its maybe around $6 million to $8 million, do you agree with that?
Cris Gaut
Yes, obviously we didn't give EBITDA guidance, we gave revenue and EPS and I mean you don't have your model but I think that's the parameters that we want to get back to you. The reason we've given exclusive guidance this quarter for the first time in several quarters. I think it's a reflection of our growing confidence and visibility in the business that we haven't had throughout this downturn. But now with the growth in orders the several quarters have strong book-to-bill ratio and for us given a lot of book and ship business anything over 1.1 is very good. And that we have those kind of book-to-bill ratios across the company. So given the greater visibility our confidence yes we have the ability to look yes and say we are going to give guidance and so that's why we did that this quarter.
Jacob Lundberg
Okay, great. And then, I guess looking for a sense of momentum in the completions business, can you speak to how much compared with January from sort of a sequential growth perspective?
Cris Gaut
Yes, I think there is a sequential growth or month-over-month and right now they are trying to ramp up as fast as you can, get people as fast as you can and we are seeing sequential improvement. In fact we expect April to be stronger than in March.
Jacob Lundberg
Okay, great. And then, last one if I could, can you tell us how much Cooper valves contributed in the first quarter from revenue perspective?
Jim Harris
Jacob, we were having disclosures in our Q - given the size, it's fairly limited and historically we've not provided that information, other than what I would say already about the SG&A contribution.
Jacob Lundberg
Okay. Thanks Harris.
Jim Harris
Thanks, Jacob.
Operator
And our next question comes from Brad Handler with Jefferies. Your line is now open.
Brad Handler
Thanks. Good morning all. I guess before I ask a question. Cris, I know this doesn't sound like it's a goodbye and I hope it's not a goodbye but I just wanted to wish you very well in your - this next phase and just to sort of say how much I've enjoyed kind of faking being with you or following you guys through this process are you sort of coming to public with Forum as well as sort of with such a clear vision? And then, watching so much of that come to collision that's been fun to watch and fun to ride along with you, long?
Cris Gaut
Thank you, Brad.
Brad Handler
Okay. A couple of questions, I guess from me. The 250,000 of orders obviously a nice big number there, maybe a couple of questions around that do you have a sense for how much of that relates to new horsepower versus reactivating horsepower? And then, the second question is a little bit more specific to J-Mac is that you know, is that new customer base or are you upgrading and rebuilding J-Mac power end themselves?
Cris Gaut
Yes, I'll take the second one first is the - if you look at our J-Mac or power end. I mean, the first quarter alone divided new customers, which was not being a customer based in the past and one of the reasons why we secured that customer base is because of our proven reliability and the performance of the powers and the second question was the horsepower, I think we are seeing both. We are seeing some newer companies coming to the fast market and we are also seeing the refurbished power ends. So we are seeing a combination of both in the - not only in the power business but the cost of board for our - for your pumping product line.

Prady Iyyanki
I would add a little that a lot of the orders were for new equipment. So that is an element there more than one might have thought three months ago in this space. But there is also a healthy dose of replacing the power ends on existing fleet in sometimes and some cases moving from and other model pump to the newer model more efficient longer lasting pumps that J-Mac offers. Now you also asked about refurbishment. So this would not include refurbishment, if we are refurbishing a pump that goes into our service revenue. But things are new power ends that we are talking about.
Brad Handler
Okay. Thanks for clarifying that. And then, just an non-related follow-up even if its' a little open-ended. I guess, I'm curious about in the current market, which has more than its fair share of uncertainty around the direction of crude despite the momentum in the US can you comment on what that does to M&A conversations. In other words, you guys have spoken pretty clearly to the past about the need to find bottom before sellers kind of decided they are ready to sell and now presumption wise I think that there was a platform now on the basis now to see some more M&A given kind of this constant sharing and perhaps to some degree a lower setting of oil prices and some people say does that lessen the M&A potential in your mind as you think about the next six months or 12 months, kind of some color on that would be appreciated?
Prady Iyyanki
So I don't think it lessens it Brad with this kind of recent dip. Hopefully, it will take some of the cross off of expectation and I think another factor when you think about M&A is the IPO market, right sometimes people are thinking about whether I should sell a company or whether I can take it public. Clearly, the IPO market the [indiscernible] has come off there. And so, yes I think - I don't think it's had an -- from our standpoint it's a buyer, it has not had a negative impact on the M&A market and hopefully it hopes to bring things into line. We will be active, we are active and we are building our pipeline in the M&A space.
Cris Gaut
Now, Brad probably the other thing I'll add is I mean, our priority is obviously the completion segment and the activity in the completion segment has picked up across the board as a result, I think most of the companies are going from red to green, which becomes easier not only to avoid valuations but more from a seller standpoint they don't have the impression to the selling of the -- for the fall.
Brad Handler
Okay, that will make sense. Thanks. I'll turn it back.
Prady Iyyanki
Thanks, Brad.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Rob MacKenzie with IBERIA Capital. Your line is now open.
Rob MacKenzie
Thank you. Congratulations Prady, and thanks for all your service, Cris; just wanted to shake that. Question for you again following up on the horsepower question, just to ask, when you look at what's the order so far obviously just a lead time to deliver those power ends and through that you would also sell. What portion of the idle U.S. frac equipment do you think has played so far to be refurbished and reactivated and versus how much do you think is left to make the prices orders for?
Cris Gaut
Yes, now I think the -- I think, there is still room. I think, we are still in the early phase of the recovery in the frac side even though at the peak it was 14 million horsepower and today we are probably at 10 million horsepower or eight to 10 million horsepower but we do see opportunity and we're at early phase of the recovery in the price side.
Rob MacKenzie
Any kind of way to put some numbers around that, I mean just 250,000 horsepower that you guys won, is there three times less that more four times, two times, what is left in terms of the revenue opportunity?

Jim Harris
There was eight working and we're trying to get to 10 million horsepower a lot of that increment requires a new power, new pumps right and looking from here to get back to the 18 that we were at back in 14 that is a lot more pumps right. There aren't as from every incremental fleet that goes back to work is going to require more spending, not less. And that is why also people are working at gosh should I bring that older stuff back or does it make sense to kind of build new, it's like refurbishing that old house. And so you know I think we'll continue to see fleets existing fleets brought back but we're digging deeper and deeper into the stacked equipment.
Cris Gaut
Our thought for the utilization is still at 85% kind or range and as utilization goes to 90 and 95 that will also drive activity.
Rob MacKenzie
Right, okay. Thank you. And then I wanted to come back to switch gears to the production equipment side, obviously didn't repeat the stellar quarter you had in the fourth quarter but with the pace of completions ramping up, I would think that that orders there would look pretty bright the next couple of quarters, can you give us some more color on how you see that trajectory playing out?
Cris Gaut
Now, Rob, I think one thing we did share the last call Rob was there was a $16 million of a chunky order that we got from one particular customer who was planning for 2017 and that was a chunky order in fourth quarter of 2016. So if you take that out, I think production equipment guys had pretty good order but production equipment as the ducks start getting completed the activity in the production equipment will pick up and I think the completion side right now is lagging behind little bit on the drilling front, it wouldn't from the number of ducts being increase in the Permian and the other basins but as it starts completing the ducts, there will be a need for production equipment. Now in the case of production equipment, the lead times are little bit longer than a consumable item, so we usually see the quarter ahead and that's one of the reasons why we saw that in the fourth quarter.
Rob MacKenzie
Okay, great. Thank you guys, I will turn it back.
Operator
And our next question comes from Mart Malloy with Johnson Rice. Your line is now open.
Mart Malloy
Good morning. Cris, good luck with your future endeavors.
Cris Gaut
Thank you.
Mart Malloy
Just had a question maybe on the long items that we used to start to see the lead times stretch out, can you give us a little more perspective on how long as we're planning to stretching out and also when we should look for the impact of pricing increases starting to flow through to numbers that more of a third, fourth quarter type of thing?
Cris Gaut
I mean Marty where we are seeing some lead time increases just not say cost of market is the portions whether it's on the frac side, where we do as the frac activity continues to gain momentum those lead times will increase, as of now they have not increased significantly but what we are putting, we are securing a supply chain for the rest of the year and the procurement team has done a pretty good job of securing the supply for the portions but that's where we are seeing it today but as the recovery continues, I think we will see the increase in lead times across the board which at the same time gives the opportunity on the price side. I would say we would stop seeing some minimal price increase starting in the second quarter Marty but as the year progresses I think we'll start seeing more pricing opportunities and we will start seeing on the frac side first and then I think it will spread across the board.
Mart Malloy
Okay. And if I could ask just on the international markets can you update us there what you're seeing particularly in the Middle East.

Cris Gaut
They're all our operation in Middle East is on track I think up in the second half we expect the operation to start producing from product more probably in the fourth quarter of this year. I mean some of the capital equipment orders we've be talking about in Middle East model yet. I think that the Saudi is already cancelled the which but the Kuwait and NBC which were talk to you in the past I think you're moving to the right. So the capital equipment I think is moving to the right but our presence in Middle East is getting stronger and I think starting in the second half we'll start seeing some activity from our standpoint. 
Mart Malloy
Great, thank you.
Cris Gaut
Thank you.
Jim Harris
Thanks, Mike.
Operator
And our next question comes from [indiscernible] with Wolf Resources. Your line is now open.
Unidentified Analyst
Hey, I just want to echo everyone's sentiments; congrats Prady and Cris whish you all the best and try to enjoy you know a bit more free time.
Cris Gaut
Thank you.
Prady Iyyanki
Okay, Chase [ph].
Unidentified Analyst
I guess the first question if we can kind of talk about the pace of orders, throughout 1Q and if they really accelerated as you got into March.
Cris Gaut
On the frac side, for sure, yes, we did see that moment the most in the completion segment with this March being stronger than January, but I've also say part of that is contingent on I think the completions activity is lagging behind the building activity in our customers are trying to mobilize crew, the equipment, the logistics and whatnot right and I think there's a lag between those two so as this but completing the activity we do expect our completion segment to see more activity and that's what was evident in the first quarter at least March was, January. Some of the other product lines I've got different dynamics I think the case of production equipment I will said the lead times a little longer so, we saw a very strong 4Q, you we saw some 20 orders and we expect to be pretty constant on a move forward basis but I think the activity will increase.
If you look at our drilling product line I think the activity we are seeing is in three places right as the is the module a much greater module which is usually a one to two orders ahead so we started seeing that activity not third quarter of 2016, 3Q, 4Q and 1Q we started almost three quarters we saw them a pump upgrade but where we see the increase in activity of the consumable side the OpEx part of the, the drilling consumable our portfolio and now we're seeing the activity on the, on the drilling capital equipment side but more from a services standpoint where our customers are trying to upgrade or remanufacture some of the capital equipment like catwalks and rock mix [ph].
Unidentified Analyst
And this is very helpful. It's a great color, appreciated I don't know if you could help us here when we think about drilling and then also think about completions, how much of your revenues kind of come from services, for each of these businesses and versus product.
Cris Gaut
Yes, the services is not itself is not a big part of our revenue. And it's in, it's an aftermarket services is often a means to sell products so, in our drilling business if we bring in one of our catwalks for a drawing contractor. We'll rework it but, we're selling and sell a lot of parts there too and certainly on the pressure pumping side when they pump truck comes in for recertification whether its one of our yards or we're doing it out in the field. We're going through they're treating our in their manifold trailer. And yes we certifying it but of course, replacing any worn parts so, in many cases the service is a means to an end to sell additional products which is where the margin is.
Unidentified Analyst

Okay, great that's helpful. Last one I'll turn it back over. On pricing if we think about completion and kind of where pricing is today versus kind of where it peaked at you know on 2014 could you kind of help us understand how much pricing has compressed on average for this segment?
Cris Gaut
Well, I'll give a range across the portfolio, and then [indiscernible] across the portfolio probably you lost about 15% to 20% pricing across the portfolio at an average, in the frac side we lost more, and on the valve side we lost less.
Unidentified Analyst
Okay, that is helpful. All right appreciate it.
Cris Gaut
But on the way up too, it's going to walk the same way, I think will gain more pricing on the frac side and less on the valve side.
Unidentified Analyst
Okay, thanks Prady, thanks Cris.
Cris Gaut
Thanks.
Operator
And our next question comes from Vaibhav Vaishnav with Cowen and Company. Your line is now open.
Vaibhav Vaishnav
Hey, good morning. And congrats Prady and Cris, good luck, it is pleasure working with you.
Cris Gaut
Thanks, Vaibhav.
Vaibhav Vaishnav
So if I think about inflate incremental about 40% in 2Q, what are the puts and takes of that actually declining as we look into second half or is that a case that they should be at least in line or better?
Prady Iyyanki
I will say there are few elements for that I would say as Cris mentioned there is operational efficiencies, there is procurement costs and there is cost absorption on the operational side. Right and it is also pricing on the commercial side, right. So I think it depends on how we recovered the price, I think the on the operational side, the procurement staking, the operational efficiencies and the cost absorption, we expect to get those already done right, we expect to get those but we also mentioned there is cost absorption starting in Q2 some of the plants will be absorbed in the third quarter all plants where we are seeing the activities will be fully absorbed.
So the pricing is the element is how it recovers starting second quarter.
Cris Gaut
Okay and that procurement impact want to make sure as it works its way through our inventory cost that benefit.
Vaibhav Vaishnav
Thinking about drilling business at least the way I think is that one-third consumables, one third handling tools and one third capital equipment. Can you help us think about what consumables obviously is progressing well, can you help us think about if the capital equipment backlog driving from that backlog is near trough or early trough. And also on the handling tools, how that's progressing?
Cris Gaut
Yes on the capital equipment side I think our bottom of depleting the backlog was couple of quarters ago. So consumables, the drilling consumables is a big part of the drilling product line today. However I think on the handling tools, we expect to start seeing some activity probably in the fourth quarter at a very early stages of recovery, there is still some de-stocking and cannibalization with [indiscernible] but we expect starting in fourth quarter with the handling tools. I think the capital equipment piece is probably to be 18 piece but where we are seeing activity in the capital equipment already is what we talked about is on the services side where customers are trying to upgrade or refurbish the capital equipment and there are also some discussions very early stages with our customers is as they go to the mixed phase of getting to rigs. The older rigs backed into work the amount of money they need to spend from the wallet, from a capital standpoint will become little bigger than what they've sent in the past that is more like one to five kind of range, 1 to 5 million kind of range. If that happens obviously we will participate in that growth tier.
Vaibhav Vaishnav

Okay, that is helpful and last one I'm going to try my level best, can we get to breakeven EPS by the end of the fourth quarter and the path to getting there.
Cris Gaut
So that as we've given, we've given guidance on that the upcoming quarter that, that's a big change for us. We haven't given guidance for some time and what happened in the fourth quarter really depends on what happens with oil prices and activity in the industry so I don't really want to comment that far out on and give guidance that far out. 
Jim Harris
It also depends on what so rig count point of the year was the horsepower on the on the frac side by the end of the year right when all those things will play all here.
Vaibhav Vaishnav
Fair enough, and thanks for taking my questions.
Operator
Our last question comes from John Watson with Simmons. Your line is now open.
John Watson
Good morning.
Cris Gaut
Hi, John.
John Watson
I wanted to dig back in on the 250,000 horsepower, could you say how much of that was [indiscernible] power end and fluid end versus just power ends?
Cris Gaut
Yes, I mean for us we sell them separately so, we take orders for the power end and separately for the fluid end. So, sometimes they're for the complete pump, but in terms of how we track it internally, we track them in a separate way so we saw a lot of fluid ends during the quarter. And certainly there was a ramp up there but the power ends are bigger ticket items on an individual basis and you know that's why we've highlighted there that number and the fluid end since we do track that independently. Of course the bigger demand for fluid ends is the replacement market so, I can't tell you exactly how many fluid ends we sold with the power end but, the demand for both is strong.
John Watson
Okay, it's helpful and then on the longer lead times for horsepower as mentioned in the press release. Does that imply that some of the orders that you've received in the 250,000 number, that some of those might not be delivered until 2018 or that too long lead time?
Cris Gaut
I think load lead time I think its within 2017 order I don't think lead times were grown past not being 2017 at least from our standpoint because we can still deliver power ends within 2017 and more importantly I think our lead times are off by month but not significantly not at this point.
John Watson
Okay so if I wanted to buy the mac power end today I could get it by December 31.
Cris Gaut
Yes, we got your number.
Jim Harris
We got your number.
John Watson
Okay. I will give a call. Thank you.
Cris Gaut
But especially if you want December the pricing is significantly higher.
John Watson
Perfect, thanks guys.
Cris Gaut
All right. Well, thank you all and appreciate your attention and good questions and have a good weekend. Thanks. Bye.

Cris?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Read MoreC. Christopher Gaut, Forum Energy Technologies, Inc. - Executive Chairman [3]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thanks, Mark. Good morning. Forum continues to show good growth in orders and revenue, led by our strong position in completion and production-oriented products. Relative to the other U.S. public oilfield equipment companies, Forum has a leading exposure to the continued growth in land-based North America completion and production spending.With a growing backlog of wells yet to be fracked, completed and brought on production, we see an attractive runway and strong demand for our products.We are also pleased with the progress of our acquisition effort. Following the acquisition of the assets of Cooper Valves in the first quarter of the year, we completed this month the acquisition of Multilift. Although not a large deal, Multilift will add to the growing stable of artificial lift products within our Completions segment. We believe the market for acquisition opportunities is continuing to improve for us.So without further ado, let me hand the call to Forum's new CEO, Prady Iyyanki. Prady?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Prady Iyyanki, Forum Energy Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [4]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thanks, Cris. Good morning, everyone. I'm going to provide an overview for the quarter, discuss our strategy in focus areas, and some operational highlights. Then I will turn the call over to Jim Harris to provide further details on our financial performance.Our team performed well in the second quarter. Our second quarter revenue was $201 million, an 18% increase sequentially, and we had positive adjusted EBITDA for the company in every segment during the quarter.We continue to execute our strategic plan of ensuring strong financial discipline, having a balanced business portfolio, emphasizing consumable and activity-based products and growing through organic initiatives and acquisitions. This allows us to respond to market conditions in any part of the cycle. Currently, our focus is on the robust North America completions activity and infrastructure buildout, as evident from our 2 recent acquisitions, Multilift and the assets of Cooper Valves.The U.S. land drilling and completions activity remained strong and our U.S. revenue in the second quarter increased 23% sequentially, in line with growth in the U.S. rig count and completions activity. And every segment experienced revenue growth in the U.S. during the quarter.For 4 quarters in a row, we saw an increase in our inbound orders, which is a good indicator of our near-term business prospects. Forum's total inbound orders during the second quarter were $214 million, a 10% increase from the level in the first quarter. The second quarter book-to-bill ratio was 106% for the company as a whole, led by 123% for the Completions segment. Orders in the Completions segment increased 31% and over 45% for our stimulation and intervention products, as customer spending improved in almost all product offerings across the segment.The strong fundamentals for the pressure pumping services are driving demand for our pressure pumping products, including orders for approximately 480,000 horsepower of our power ends year-to-date.In addition, our new products are gaining traction. We received orders for 8 of our new innovative manifold trailer, the ICBM, and several good orders for our new racetrack suction manifold and several other new products.We are starting to see price improvement on recent pressure pumping orders now in backlog, which will be reflected in the second half results.We are pleased with the acquisition of Multilift in early July. The SandGuard and Cyclone completion tools extend the useful life of an electrical submersible pump by protecting it against sand and other solids. The acquisition fits with our strategy of expanding our product offering in the artificial lift value chain.Forum is well positioned for the growth in artificial lift, with the Cannon protectors and Multilift completion tools for downhole pumps and our Global Tubing coiled line pipe for gas lift.In our Production & Infrastructure segment, orders improved 24%. And our book-to-bill ratio was 112% as demand continues to be strong for U.S. land drill separation equipment. I want to recognize our valves team for achieving a record level of orders during the quarter. This was accomplished without any contribution from Forum Arabia, our new manufacturing facility being built in Saudi Arabia, which is on schedule to be fully operational in 2018.Our first quarter acquisition of Cooper Valves is progressing on target. The integration is complete and our sales team are beginning to leverage our existing midstream and downstream customer base and distribution network to expand Cooper sales.Orders in the Drilling & Subsea segment were down 21%, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 84% during the quarter. The decline in drilling orders was due to fewer rig upgrades, as the land drilling fleet moves into a maintenance mode for the balance of the year. The offshore recovery continues to lag. As a result, we now expect orders for our Subsea product line to be at a low level for an extended period and weighted to non oil and gas activity.Our operating margins continued to improve, as we see the benefit of better manufacturing cost absorption, operational efficiencies and lower procurement cost. Our operating margins will further expand as the pricing improves in the second half. We continue to build our pipeline of M&A targets with a primary focus on expanding our completions offering, followed by midstream and downstream opportunities.As we look ahead to the third quarter of 2017, we expect demand for our Completions and Production & Infrastructure segments to increase as activity continues in the U.S. land market.Our incrementals in second half in Completions will be stronger than first half, as pricing materializes and better absorption of ramp-up cost. We expect our revenue to improve by around 8% to 12%, and we expect a diluted loss per share to be in the range of $0.07 to $0.04.Let me ask Jim to take you through our results and financial position. Jim?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------James Whelan Harris, Forum Energy Technologies, Inc. - CFO and EVP [5]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thank you, Prady, and good morning, everyone. Our second quarter revenue was $201 million, an 18% increase sequentially. This is the third increase in our quarterly revenue in a row, and consolidated revenue is up 45% from the trough in the third quarter last year.Our adjusted EBITDA increased $9 million and our adjusted net loss per share was $0.10, excluding special items, an improvement from the first quarter as the U.S. land recovery continued.I will summarize our results on a sequential basis for the quarter and provide additional details on the second quarter results.Our Drilling & Subsea segment revenue of $64 million was up 4%, primarily due to the improvement in sales on drilling equipment and products. The Completions segment revenue of $55 million increased 29% sequentially, as customer spending improved on higher well construction and completions activity in North America.Our Production & Infrastructure segment revenue of $83 million was up 23%, due to improved sales at both our U.S. land well site production equipment and our valve products.For the quarter, we had adjusted EBITDA of $5.9 million. Importantly, this was our first positive EBITDA quarter since 2015. Our incremental operating margins were 33% on an adjusted basis, with little to no pricing improvement.Including the additional Subsea goodwill impairment charge, the net loss for the second quarter was $78 million or $0.81 per share. The quarter included special items on a pretax basis of $68 million for the goodwill impairment, $3 million of foreign exchange losses and $3 million of restructuring and other expenses. The adjusted net loss, excluding these items and the associated income taxes, was $0.10 per share.During the quarter, we evaluated the carrying value of the goodwill on our Subsea product line, which currently represents less than 10% of our revenues. The review was triggered by the softening of oil prices and the developing consensus view that production from lower-cost oil basins would be sufficient to meet anticipated demand for a longer period. This has delayed the need for production from higher-cost basins like offshore. As a result, we determined that the carrying value of the remaining goodwill in our Subsea product line was impaired.Our free cash flow after net capital expenditures in the second quarter was $12 million, which included an IRS tax refund of about $31 million. With the accelerated receipt of this anticipated tax refund in the second quarter and our continued build in working capital due to increased revenue expectations in the second half of the year, we now expect to be free cash flow positive no later than the first quarter of 2018 as earnings continue to improve.Our net capital expenditures in the second quarter were $8 million. Our budget for 2017 capital expenditures is approximately $30 million, which includes the investment in our new production facility in Saudi Arabia expected to come online later this year.Our balance sheet and financial position remain strong. We ended the quarter with $221 million of cash on hand, and with no bank debt outstanding. We closed the Multilift acquisition in early July for approximately $40 million using available cash. We remain well positioned and ready to execute our acquisition strategy.Our weighted average diluted share count for the second quarter was 96.2 million shares. When we turn profitable on a net income basis, the diluted share count will increase to approximately 99 million shares at the current share price to once again include the impact of options.Net debt at the end of the second quarter was $179 million, down $15 million, bringing our net debt to total capitalization ratio to 13.2%.Interest expense was $6 million in the second quarter. Corporate expenses were $8 million, and we now expect corporate expenses to be around $9 million in the third quarter. Depreciation and amortization expense was $15 million for the quarter and should be similar in the third quarter.Our effective tax rate on the second quarter adjusted operating loss was 39%. We estimate our effective tax rate on normal operations for the remainder of the year will be approximately 37%.For more information about our financial results, please review the earnings release on our website. And with that, let me turn the call back over to Prady.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Prady Iyyanki, Forum Energy Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [6]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thanks, Jim. Forum's team is capitalizing on opportunities to market this presenting currently in North America, and expanding our operating margins even without any meaningful pricing improvement. I'm pleased with the new market-leading products the team has developed. You will see us continue to invest in organic growth initiatives and execute our M&A strategy, especially in Completions and Production & Infrastructure segments.Thank you for your interest. At this point, we'll open the line for questions. Operator, please take the first question.================================================================================Questions and Answers--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Operator [1]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of George O'Leary with TPH & Co.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------George Michael O'Leary, Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division - Director, Oil Service Research [2]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------I thought the results on the Production & Infrastructure segment were particularly interesting, just given the magnitude of the move quarter-on-quarter. I realize Cooper is in there now, so that had something to do with it. I wonder if you could just parse out, maybe going forward, how we should think about the Production side versus the Infrastructure side? Are we starting to see some kind of underlying demand growth on the valve side of the business? Or is the growth, going forward, still really more Production oriented, i.e. kind of U.S. onshore well count oriented? How would you guys kind of break that out?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Prady Iyyanki, Forum Energy Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [3]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Yes, thanks, George. I would say the P&I had very strong bookings in revenue in the second quarter. I mean, let me talk about valves for a second. Even without the Cooper Valves contribution in the second quarter, they still had the record level of bookings. And that's primarily the upstream in North America is up. And the midstream in U.S. is either flattish or a little bit up, but we're gaining market share as there's an infrastructure buildout in basins for transportation, gas terminals, the liquid pipelines. And on the international front, both the midstream and downstream is pretty active and we're trying to gain market share. And that's one of the reasons, George, why we're building this operation in Saudi Arabia, focused on Middle East and downstream. And we're also increasing our presence in the Southeast Asia to penetrate the midstream and downstream part of the market. On the utilities side, there are either pipelines being refurbished or there are new pipelines being built, and we are maximizing on that. So this is primarily a market share gain opportunity for us which we're capitalizing on, with the exception of riding the wave on the upstream side. And on the Production Equipment side, I think the demand is strong. And we continue to ramp up on the Production Equipment side.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------George Michael O'Leary, Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division - Director, Oil Service Research [4]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Great. That's very helpful color. And then you guys have been a little bit more acquisitive and you talked about generally where you're looking to deploy incremental capital as bid-ask spreads have compressed. I guess when I think about the Completions side, going forward, are acquisitions going to be more focused, you think, on the downhole tool side of that business? Or more kind of Flow Equipment, adding onto the pressure pumping offering you guys have?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Prady Iyyanki, Forum Energy Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [5]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Yes, a good question, George. I would say on the acquisition side, I think our strategy remains intact. Our #1 area of focus is Completions, which includes the surface and also the downhole products. And obviously, the Multilift acquisition we did is consistent with that strategy, right, on the artificial lift which plays a role both on the Completions side and also on the Production side. And then the second priority is any opportunities we can get on the midstream, downstream side would be the second priority, but it's also the Cooper acquisition which we did in the earlier part of the year, George. So I think our M&A strategy is intact. I would also say the M&A environment is probably friendly in the second half just because the value gap has come down, which is primarily the IPO season is coming to an end and the expectations on pricing is getting more reasonable. However, it is very competitive, but I think deals will get done in the second half.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------George Michael O'Leary, Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division - Director, Oil Service Research [6]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Great. And then maybe if I could just sneak one more in, Prady. The Multilift acquisition is one that seems pretty intriguing to us, as there does seem to be a growing trend of ESPs, and ESPs being in wells over a longer duration than they historically were, especially U.S. onshore, these kind of high-pressure, longer-lateral horizontal wells. Given kind of the unique nature of that business to some degree, it seems to me that, that might be accretive to Forum's margins? And I realize the transaction wasn't super large, but would you call that kind of product line within the Forum complex accretive to your margins?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Prady Iyyanki, Forum Energy Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [7]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Listen, we are really excited about Multilift, George. I would say it's accretive to the business. Probably the deal got done at the historic ranges, which you've seen us do in the past. It'll be meaningful for the downhole product line in 2018. It's going to move the needle for those guys. And again, it's an IP-protected product, the SandGuard, which is a self-cleaning device without any flow disruptions; and also the Cyclone product. And I think our differentiation in the Cyclone product is -- there are a lot of different configurations out there. And in our case, one size fits all. And in the case of SandGuard, which is an IP-protected product, the competitive landscape is very favorable to us. And the customer saves significant amount of cost than when the pump has a failure because of the sand intrusion into the ESP. So we're really excited about the Multilift acquisition, and consistent with our acquisition strategy of focused on Completions.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Operator [8]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Our next question comes from the line of Martin Malloy with Johnson Rice.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Martin W. Malloy, Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division - Director of Research [9]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------I had a question on the Drilling & Subsea segment, and maybe if you could talk a little bit more about what's going on there. The revenues were relatively flat it looks like quarter-over-quarter and the inbounds were down quite a bit. And if you could maybe talk about that, what you're seeing with the drilling rig, land drilling rig upgrade cycle, and particularly the mud pumps and how much longer that might last.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Prady Iyyanki, Forum Energy Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [10]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Yes, yes. Good question, Marty. I would say on the -- let me talk about the consumables and then also about the capital equipment. And then I'll also talk about the subsea piece. On the consumable front, our expectation is with the rig count stabilizing or maybe a little bit of a decline, some of the active rigs will go into the maintenance mode, but they will still need the OpEx part of the consumables. But what we expect to see is less mud pump upgrades in second half compared to the first half. However, completion-weighted products, like the centrifugal pumps, the (inaudible) and bearings, we expect still good activity on that front. But overall, we expect the drilling product line to have a decline in the third quarter from a revenue standpoint. Now fourth quarter, there are a few variables there, but mostly on the capital equipment side is there are several discussions with customers on upgrading the lower-spec rigs to the higher-spec rigs, where the content for us could be anywhere from $0.5 million to $2 million. And primarily where we come into play is rather than just doing the recertification, we are upgrading our catwalks, extending the reach and the height and the 7,500 psi upgrades and also, in some cases, the handling tools, and the condition-based monitoring could play a role. There's a little bit of uncertainty there on when that's going to materialize. But the pipeline on that in the U.S. is pretty good. And there's a little bit of uncertainty on the international front, but the pipeline on the international front is a little stronger than what it was about 4 months ago, primarily in the Middle East and in India, and also in North America, but more in Middle East and in India. So on the capital equipment side, there's a little bit of uncertainty, but if some of that materializes, our fourth quarter could be stronger than third quarter. But we don't know at this point. On the Subsea front, Marty, I would say this: We've got a great franchise; we've got a great team. It's a bad market on the oil and gas front. But in our case, it's less than 10% of the portfolio, and our target, again, for this year is EBITDA flat at the product line level so it doesn't drag the mother ship down. But we are exploring opportunities outside oil and gas, and I'll be disappointed if we don't announce any orders in the second half of '18, because there is a pipeline for us outside oil and gas. But the oil and gas is pretty weak and the pipeline is pretty much nonexistent on the oil and gas side. So we continue to streamline our operations on the Subsea and make very selective investments to protect the franchise, but again, it's less than 10% of the portfolio.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Martin W. Malloy, Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division - Director of Research [11]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Okay. And then a second question, could you talk about any specific product lines where you're seeing the lead time stretch out the most and where you think you have the opportunity to start to have pricing discussions with your customers about increasing pricing?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Prady Iyyanki, Forum Energy Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [12]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Yes -- no, great question, Marty. I would say S&I, or stimulation and intervention, the pressure pumping part of the portfolio, across the board, I think I would say demand is very strong. As evident from our bookings and also revenue in the last 2, 3 quarters, we are still ramping up fast, and it's still hand to mouth. The lead times are extending and it is providing opportunities for us, well, from a pricing standpoint. And I would say, later part of second half, at the tail end of second quarter, the pricing started materializing. Not meaningful in second quarter but we'll start seeing that in the results in the third quarter and fourth quarter. That's one of the reasons why we said our second half incrementals on Completions will be stronger than what you've seen in the first half. But the lead times are getting extended and we are getting pricing opportunities. Now the other point on the S&I side is, with the significant amount of growth we're seeing on the top line and bookings, we're adding significant amount of people. Our workforce has increased significantly and there's a little bit of productivity which will catch up in the second half of '17, right? I mean, the folks who come new don't get -- are not productive right from Day 1. It takes a couple of months for them to be productive. So we're not seeing the operational productivity yet in S&I, but we do expect to see that in the second half. And on top of it, the material -- the pricing which is materializing, which is already in the backlog, start materializing in the second half. And then the other product line is Production Equipment. It is pretty much hand to mouth. And the lead times are extending. We've got a very strong backlog going into third quarter and fourth quarter. However, the pricing on the production equipment is fourth quarter, first quarter price, right? Because as you'll remember, we got the chunky orders in fourth quarter and first quarter, which are still flowing to the shop. But I would say late fourth quarter, we'll start seeing the pricing materialize through the -- to the operations too. Jim?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------James Whelan Harris, Forum Energy Technologies, Inc. - CFO and EVP [13]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Yes, Marty, I would also just highlight that similar to Production Equipment, we always talk about our stimulation and intervention business being a book-and-ship business. But given the strength of the demand that we've had in orders, we've actually built a backlog there. So likewise, we've taken orders in the first half of this year and some of those early in the years, especially for the power ends, that was at pricing that was very aggressive. And while we've seen pricing increase, until we deliver on the backlog that we now have at these lower prices, once that's done, we'll start seeing the benefit of these pricing increases that Prady was describing. But that's a little bit of a subtle change from what we've said in the past about S&I, just given the level of backlog we have today.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Operator [14]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------And our next question comes from the line of Scott Gruber with Citigroup.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Scott Andrew Gruber, Citigroup Inc, Research Division - Director and Senior Analyst [15]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Prady, the pickup in Middle East demand that you highlighted earlier, can you provide some color just across the product spectrum, when you're looking at upstream, midstream, downstream? Is it primarily midstream and downstream at this point? Or is some of the upstream orders starting to pick up as well?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Prady Iyyanki, Forum Energy Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [16]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Yes, I think our initial focus, the manufacturing facility we're building in Saudi Arabia will be focused on the midstream and downstream part of the portfolio, more particularly in valves. And our customers are showing pretty good interest there and also the local content -- we meet the local content requirements, which also gives us a pricing premium. And I think the operation will be active in the fourth quarter of 2017, but fully operational in 2018. But as we go through the process, we've got to put other products too in the manufacturing location, later part of '18 and '19, which would be focused on the Completions side and also some of the other product lines on the -- like, for example, some of the subproduct lines in drilling. So I think the focus is across the spectrum. But initially, the focus of the manufacturing shop will be on the midstream and downstream, more particularly in valves. What I will also say, we are gaining momentum. We do have commercial presence now than what we had in the past. And that commercial team is gaining traction on the Completions side and some orders and revenue are already trickling down. But the manufacturing location is still here in the U.S.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Scott Andrew Gruber, Citigroup Inc, Research Division - Director and Senior Analyst [17]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------And then how do you think about expanding your capabilities on the rig equipment side? Do you wait to tie it to the big tenders in the Middle East coming into the market? Have you tried to move ahead? And any color you can provide on those bigger tenders and what you're seeing there.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Prady Iyyanki, Forum Energy Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [18]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Sure. I would say this. In the pipeline in the Middle East -- in fact, I would say that's the region which has the strongest pipeline on the capital equipment side, whether it's Kuwait or whether it's Abu Dhabi or it's Saudi Aramco or it's even Qatar. I mean, the whole Middle East is -- the pipeline is pretty strong, Scott; however, things are moving to the right. There's one Middle Eastern customer we just recently heard that maybe some tenders could happen in the fourth quarter. And our view is probably they're expecting -- they're waiting for the oil price to go past $50, and some of those tenders will come into fruition. And now we have pretty good installed fleet in Middle East from a Forum standpoint. In fact, we have the biggest catwalk installed fleet in the Middle East and a pretty good service team in the Middle East. So I think that part of the business will continue to be strong in the Middle East. We're trying to build up the Completions and the Production & Infrastructure part of the portfolio in the Middle East as part of the manufacturing location.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Scott Andrew Gruber, Citigroup Inc, Research Division - Director and Senior Analyst [19]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Got it. And if we just take a longer-term view, you highlighted the expansion in Southeast Asia, focusing on midstream and in downstream again. What do you envision -- where do you envision potentially going over the next 5 years? I'm thinking about the expansion in shale activity in Argentina and some of your competitors. NOV and Schlumberger are forecasting a rig upgrade cycle in Russia. Can you just provide some color on where else you're thinking about expanding internationally to take advantage of opportunities as shale goes global and opportunities to upgrade the land rig fleet internationally?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Prady Iyyanki, Forum Energy Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [20]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Yes. So I think on the pressure pumping side, Scott, our main focus is North America. I mean, as we mentioned, right now we're hand to mouth and the demand is strong and we need to ramp up fast. So right now, I think all the resources and everything is focused in North America, and then we can start penetrating Canada, too. But right now, our focus right now is in the U.S. And in Argentina and China and some of the other countries, I mentioned they are still at an early phase. I think if we just looked at it from an opportunity standpoint, it's still small. And we are not fully penetrated yet in North America and Canada. And one of the things we do like is our products are gaining traction in North America, some of the new products we've commercialized. So there's a lot of market share opportunity for us in U.S. and Canada. And then also on the international front, some of our existing customers will take us there, right? I mean, as they go on the international front, some of those pressure pumpers, they will take us -- and the product will be -- we've got to put some service locations there. But right now, our focus more is in U.S. and North America. And in the Southeast Asia right now, with -- when the offshore boom was good, we had a pretty good installed fleet on onshore and offshore. But right now, the biggest opportunity we see in Far East is on the infrastructure buildout side. But it's primarily the valves part of the business there's a big market where we don't participate. And our supply chain, or most of our supply chain, is in that part of the world. So I think it's a low-hanging fruit which we want to take advantage of. And as the revenues start coming and as the profitability starts coming from the Southeast Asia, we'll start building the infrastructure for the rest of the segments too.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Operator [21]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------And our next question comes from the line of Rob MacKenzie with Iberia Capital.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Robert James MacKenzie, Iberia Capital Partners, LLC, Research Division - MD of Equity Research [22]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------I wanted to come back to the Subsea product line for a minute. In the wake of the TechnipFMC merger and their decision to standardize, going forward, on the Schilling product line, are there any specific legacy Schilling customers that you think are ripe to pick off and convert to Perry in the next upcycle?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Prady Iyyanki, Forum Energy Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [23]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Absolutely. I think there is an opportunity there, Rob, and I think the closer that tie becomes between the Schilling and Technip, some of our customers will see them as competitors, and that does give us the opportunity to penetrate the market on the oil and gas front. But I will also say is one of the things we are pleased about our Subsea team is we are diversifying outside oil and gas, which -- whether it's the telecom or whether it's the defense or whether it's the marine research or whether it's the wind farm, and we think for the next couple of years, when the market is down, we can still pay the bills and protect the franchise. And then once the oil and gas business comes, [starts from] the top off, right, the base of this business which we're going to have outside the oil and gas. But absolutely, to your point, I think that will give us the opportunity to penetrate some of the other customers. There are new customers who are also coming onboard, and that will also give us the opportunity to penetrate those customers.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Robert James MacKenzie, Iberia Capital Partners, LLC, Research Division - MD of Equity Research [24]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Great. And then on the Completions side, I guess I understand why pricing takes a while to occur there. But I'm a bit surprised, given the strong growth in revenue sequentially, that incremental margins and absolute margins, therefore, weren't higher than they were. Are there some other moving parts there that you can help us to understand that?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Prady Iyyanki, Forum Energy Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [25]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------That's a great question. Well, I would say if you look at our growth in the second quarter from a revenue standpoint, I mean 2 segments drove that growth, right? One is the Completions segment and the second one is the P&I segment. And I want to talk about 2 specific product lines there, which will add more color here, is the S&I and the Production Equipment growth were strong as part of the revenue growth contribution. And S&I, I think Jim added some color, is on one front, we are ramping up significantly. Just not for the second quarter. We were also ramping up for the third quarter and fourth quarter based on the backlog we're building and the significant amount of orders we are seeing, which is providing -- which is causing some productivity issues in the shop because of all the new people coming onboard. And also on the pricing front, the service customers started getting pricing earlier than us. And now we're seeing less resistance from the service customers on the pricing discussions. As a result, we started seeing the price materialize in the tail end of second quarter, which will start materializing into the results in third quarter and fourth quarter, right? And that's why we think our incrementals on the Completions side will be much stronger in second half than first half. The second point on the -- from a color standpoint is Production Equipment. And as you know, historically, it has been a low-margin business. And we took chunky orders in the fourth quarter and first quarter of last year, and the pricing was fourth quarter and first quarter, pretty much at the bottom or a little bit higher in the first quarter. And that is still flowing through the shop because we've got a very strong backlog in the third quarter. Pretty much -- we've got everything in the backlog for the third quarter, right, with little of opportunity that we can take on a little bit more work. But in the fourth quarter, tail end of fourth quarter is when we'll start realizing the prices which we started quoting in second and, more importantly, in the third quarter, too. So a factor of those 2: Production Equipment and S&I pricing materializing in the tail end of second quarter and the absorption productivity issues we had because of all the new people.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------C. Christopher Gaut, Forum Energy Technologies, Inc. - Executive Chairman [26]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------And just to highlight, Rob, when the Completions business is at a run rate that's almost doubling every 6 months, with an extremely high growth rate like that and strong demand that we see in the runway in front of us, we've got to build for that future demand. We see that the market's there. So we have been adding costs, we've been adding people, adding equipment. So there's the ramp-up cost that we're seeing here in the second quarter in anticipation of the strong market and the strong orders that we're building. And so those costs did affect our margins in Q2. But I think you'll see the benefit of not only the continued high rate of growth there, but better margins later in the year. But we're just trying to accommodate such a fast-growing market. And that's a challenge.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Prady Iyyanki, Forum Energy Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [27]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Probably another data point, Rob, we can talk about, because one of the things we do feel about is the margin expansion which is happening, is if you take our P&I equipment out from an incremental standpoint our incrementals are 40%; and without Production Equipment, our incrementals are 44%, right? So we are seeing incrementals, and as we start getting the price and the cost absorption which Cris talked about, I think incrementals will be stronger in the second half.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Robert James MacKenzie, Iberia Capital Partners, LLC, Research Division - MD of Equity Research [28]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Great. That's very helpful. And then one final question if I can on the Completions segment. Is there any way for you guys to pull out of that, of your numbers, in the growth in revenue, how much of that is coming from the new OEM equipment versus repairing or replacing worn-out parts on active equipment in the field already?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Prady Iyyanki, Forum Energy Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [29]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Yes -- no, I think it's a great question. I -- to use power end as a data point, being a capital equipment, I would say probably 55% newbuilds and 45% refurbished or replacements. And that's what we're seeing on the power ends. And then as you go down the chain, the refurbishment becomes a bigger percentage and the capital equipment becomes a little smaller percentage.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Operator [30]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------And our next question comes from the line of Marc Bianchi with Cowen.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Marc Gregory Bianchi, Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD [31]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------So you talked a lot about the different segments in terms of what the near-term outlook is. And I was hoping we could just sort of review and make sure I've got it all down, and I'm just going to run through this and maybe you can tell me where maybe if there's anything you'd update or change. It sounds like Drilling, possibly down a little bit in the third quarter; Subsea, flattish; Completions, growing pretty -- at a pretty healthy pace; and P&I, about flat. Would you agree with that? Or how would you change that?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Prady Iyyanki, Forum Energy Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [32]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------D&S, I think you're right on in the third quarter. Completions, yes, strong growth. P&I strong growth.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------C. Christopher Gaut, Forum Energy Technologies, Inc. - Executive Chairman [33]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Yes, good fundamentals there, Marc. And as you can tell from the high book-to-bill rate there for book-and-ship business.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Prady Iyyanki, Forum Energy Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [34]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------But the D&I -- D&S decline and then the Completions and Production & Infrastructure, significant growth.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Marc Gregory Bianchi, Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD [35]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Okay, great. And then in terms of the margin leverage there, Completions at the top, and then how about between D&S and P&I?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Prady Iyyanki, Forum Energy Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [36]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------I think in the case of D&S, since the revenue is going down, right, I think we'll manage the cost and streamlining the operations. But I think what's going to move the incrementals for us is the Completions. And on the Production & Infrastructure side, as we talked about, is the Production Equipment has always been a low-margin business. So even though they will have margin expansion, they cannot move the needle for us.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Marc Gregory Bianchi, Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD [37]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Okay. And it's nice to hear that you're getting some pricing traction in Completions. How much have you seen so far? How much is kind of baked into the outlook for the third quarter? I'm curious if you could provide some more color.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Prady Iyyanki, Forum Energy Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [38]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------For competitive reasons, obviously, Marc, we don't want to share that. However, I can add some color to it, is I would say by no means it's a broad-based price recovery across all the segments. Where we are seeing price opportunities is in S&I, the pressure pumping part of the portfolio, and a little bit on the Production Equipment side, right? But we're not seeing pricing opportunities on the downhole products. However, we are commercializing some new products, for example, on the -- on our Global Tubing joint venture. We have commercialized our new quencher product, which is the (inaudible). And obviously, that's much more reliable and durable and we would expect that the pricing to be better than the old coils. But the new products are driving the pricing in the downhole front. Bottom line is, I think it's S&I and it's the Production Equipment, which is again a low-margin business.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Operator [39]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------And our next question comes from the line of Sean Meakim with JPMorgan.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Sean Christopher Meakim, JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Senior Equity Research Analyst [40]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------I was hoping you could just drill on the valves a little bit. You highlighted a good bit about the downstream opportunity, particularly some Middle East and Asia Pac. It seems like there's tons of runway there. But how about in the U.S.? We've seen so many of these petrochemical projects start to move forward. It seems like there's a lot of opportunity here as well. Maybe you could size the 2 a little bit for us? And maybe give us a little more of a sense of what the mix looks like for your U.S. valves franchise.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Prady Iyyanki, Forum Energy Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [41]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Yes, well, some of that, Marc (sic) [Sean], is already reflected in the valves bookings, and that's one of the reasons why we had a record quarter. I'm not including Cooper. And I would say the infrastructure buildout continues to happen, whether it's for the basins, for transportation or gas terminals or liquid pipelines. The downstream in U.S. is down. The refineries in the petrochemical part of the product line -- part of the segment is down in North America but not internationally. Internationally, the downstream is pretty buoyant and so is the midstream part of the portfolio. So again, it's a big market and we have a small market share. So I would say the prospects for our valves business is back on growth track. And we're excited about our growth opportunities in valves. And whether it's midstream or downstream on the international front, which is all upside for us, or the market share opportunities in the U.S., and we're also riding the upstream being up in North America.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------C. Christopher Gaut, Forum Energy Technologies, Inc. - Executive Chairman [42]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------And that's positive in the valves business from a mix standpoint that, that greater contribution from the upstream and some from the midstream relative to the downstream is positive for margins from a mix standpoint.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Prady Iyyanki, Forum Energy Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [43]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------And probably another point which is worth mentioning is the Cooper acquisition was a strategic acquisition, and Cooper is pretty much on the midstream and the downstream part of the portfolio. And that exposes the power market and also the chemical -- the petrochemical market which we're talking about. And a lot of opportunity there on the Cooper side, too.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Operator [44]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Our last question comes from the line of John Watson from Simmons & Company.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------John H. Watson, Simmons & Company International, Research Division - Analyst, Research [45]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------To follow up on an earlier question, Prady, in Drilling, could you provide us any idea surrounding the number of 7,500 psi and third mud pump upgrades formally completed in the first half? And maybe the potential number of rig upgrades, moving forward?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Prady Iyyanki, Forum Energy Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [46]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Yes. Probably, there are some more moving elements still, John, but I think probably the guidance we can give is second half, for sure, starting third quarter, we do see -- from a run rate standpoint, we do see a decline in the mud pump upgrades and more in the fourth quarter because we do have some in the backlog. I think our opportunity would be on some of this capital equipment discussions we are having with the customers, where they may also need 7,500 psi upgrades. Pretty much rare. We're already hearing in the marketplaces customers are trying to take a 1,000 horsepower rig and upgrade that to the latest, greatest spec from a rig standpoint, which gives us the opportunity to not only recertify our catwalk but also upgrade it to the latest spec. And then it could provide opportunities in the handling tools and condition-based monitoring, and that could be a content anywhere from $0.5 million to $2 million. So how much of that will offset the mud pump decline, we don't know at this point of time. But as we said, if some of those things start materializing, I think the fourth quarter could be a little stronger than Q3. But we don't know at this point of time.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------John H. Watson, Simmons & Company International, Research Division - Analyst, Research [47]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Right. Okay. And then on the power end front, as of the Q1 call, I think annualized orders were around $750,000. Today, it's closer to $825,000. How much might that pace accelerate in the back half of the year? Could we be around 1 million horsepower for the full year?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Prady Iyyanki, Forum Energy Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [48]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------I think the run rate is obviously -- if you look at the run rate, it feels like that, but -- and it also depends on how much more frac fleets will come into the marketplace between now and end of the year, John. I would say, listen, we had 250 million horsepower by the -- I think last -- when we had the last call. And right now, we have a 480,000 horsepower of power ends. But the run rate is -- looks -- it feels like 1 million but it also depends how much more frac fleet they're going to put in the marketplace. Our expectation is probably it will land somewhere between 15 million to 16 million horsepower, if we read, right, the same things which you guys read. But certainly, we have a shot towards that.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------C. Christopher Gaut, Forum Energy Technologies, Inc. - Executive Chairman [49]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------And John, it's probably fair to say at this point, that the easy stuff to be put to work went to work a while ago. And anything that's put out to work there now, whether refurbished or obviously new, will require a new power end. So any additions from this point do require new power ends for those things.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Prady Iyyanki, Forum Energy Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [50]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------It's a great point. Right, once we go past the 14 million, 15 million horsepower, they will refurbishing more with new versus trying to repair them.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------John H. Watson, Simmons & Company International, Research Division - Analyst, Research [51]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Well, I think you all will get to 1 million, for whatever that's worth. And then one last unrelated follow-up. Jim, on the free cash flow guidance, it seems like there's been a bit of a change from positive in the back half to positive in early '18. Can you provide any additional color surrounding that change? And maybe color around commodity price or rig count that's incorporated into that guidance?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------James Whelan Harris, Forum Energy Technologies, Inc. - CFO and EVP [52]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Sure. So John, one of the big changes is, when we gave the guidance on the second half, we were expecting that large tax refund to come in the second half. And just through the hard work of our tax department and the other folks, we were able to get it in June. So that was a $30 million move into -- that's why we were cash-flow positive in the second quarter, even though we had given guidance that we expected negative. But as we look at the second half, Cris described as we're growing, these start-up costs that we're putting in place with labor and others as we're ramping up. The same is true for our inventories. So we are continuing to purchase and invest in materials so that we can ramp up production to meet what we expect to be the demand. And we're still obviously at a low base of earnings. And so the confluence of still low EBITDA while investing in rapid growth is what's driving us into the negative cash flow. And once we work through that, even if growth continues, we'll be able to do, as we have historically, grow positively with positive free cash flow and still cover those investments. It's just there's a bridge here in the second half that we're hedging a little bit.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Prady Iyyanki, Forum Energy Technologies, Inc. - CEO, President & Director [53]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thanks, Jim. Thanks for your interest. 2 segments, the Completions segment and the Production & Infrastructure segments are 2 strong tailwinds for us going into second half. And if we look at our bookings, about 70% of the bookings came from those 2 segments. And we're excited about that. And we'll talk more at the next investor call. Thanks for your interest.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Operator [54]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference.
