Method and apparatus for processing a cardholder's inquiry or dispute about a credit/charge card



Patent number:  8364583
                                            

Abstract:  A method and system for processing a credit request from a credit/charge cardholder which automatically applies a rules-based decision process to determine whether to credit the cardholder's account, the amount of the credit, whether to do a chargeback to the merchant, and the amount of the chargeback. Individual issuing banks who issue credit/charge cards and individual merchants may specify custom rules which must be considered before a credit is issued and/or before a chargeback to the merchant is performed. The rules set forth the conditions under which the merchant will waive its right to prove the disputed transaction such that a chargeback is automatically issued to the merchant. For example, a merchant may specify that if the transaction is $20 or less, it will accept an automatic chargeback without the merchant's involvement and if the transaction is greater than $20, the merchant wants to receive notice of the dispute and the opportunity to prove or verify the authenticity of the transaction.

Publication number:  20110320234
                                            

Abstract:  A system, method, and computer readable medium for providing management of electronic calendar appointments are provided. A database stores records of scheduled appointments of one or more users. The scheduled appointments may be displayed in a calendar view that includes scheduled appointments of the one or more users. A user may designate scheduled appointments associated with the user as private. The calendar system may then hide the scheduled appointments designated as private such that the private appointments are not displayed for view by other users. In another embodiment, a user may select multiple days for printing of scheduled events. In still another embodiment, a user may specify an interval for searching for a period of consecutive days during which the user does not have any scheduled appointments.
