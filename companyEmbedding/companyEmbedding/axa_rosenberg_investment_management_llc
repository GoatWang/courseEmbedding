Quantitative investment uses a disciplined, systematic approach to select what goes into and what is left out of a portfolio. An ongoing evolution Quantitative investing has changed dramatically. Technology has advanced and, with it, the sophistication of investors. Increased use of passives, lower fees and a growing focus on client outcomes have meant that investment is increasingly solutions driven. At the same time, big data and environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors are becoming ever more integral to the investment process. Our approach As a pioneer in quantitative equity investing, we are at the cutting edge of where data, technology and investment strategy meet. We combine deep, fundamental analysis of companies around the globe with a disciplined, systematic approach, and a belief that considering sustainability serves companies and asset owners alike. We aim to deliver investment solutions with varying risk and return profiles, across market caps and countries for investors across a range of investment strategies. Our nimble platform allows us to offer a wide range of bespoke customised portfolios and investment solutions, with varying risk and return profiles, across market caps and countries.                          CONTENT BLOCK - strategies rosenberg equities - EN       Our strategies  Advanced factor strategies Small Cap Active Core Enhanced Index                                   KEYFIGURES - Rosenberg - EURO - EN       Our Rosenberg Equities key figures  Source: Rosenberg Equities - AXA IM as at 31/03/2017          INSIGHT TITLE       Insights                       01 October 2016    Global Small Cap: Coping with the End of Growth    Global Small Caps have a well-deserved reputation for delivering superior earnings growth.

 Career History



Global Chief Investment Officer

                                    1999 - Current                


AXA Rosenberg Investment Management LLC


                  AXA Rosenberg Investment Management provides investment management services based on fundamental equity analysis using quantitative methods. The firm's investment approach is driven by bottom-up stock selection based on the rigorous fundamental analysis of company valuations and earnings combined with an understanding of both the stock specific and environmental risks that accompany this approach. AXA Rosenberg’s approach is applied globally and is implemented locally by experienced investment teams based in the US, Europe and Asia to create broadly diversified portfolios with a range of objectives from active equities (including enhanced index, large cap, small cap and “defensive equity income” type strategies) and \"\"SmartBeta\"\" strategies. The firm primarily invests in common stocks traded on the principal exchanges of major markets. The use of derivatives is currently not a strategic part of their investment approach. However, their goal is to be fully invested in equities at all times. As permitted, AXA Rosenberg may use stock index futures or ETFs to overlay cash or accruals and obtain exposure to the equity markets.
