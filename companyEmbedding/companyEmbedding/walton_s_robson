                                    Do you think that the values and practices that Wall-Mart founder Sam Walton articulated recognized the claims that employees, as stakeholders, have on the firm? 

   1. Yes, Wall-Mart values and practices with founder Sam Walton recognized the claims that employees, as stakeholder have on the firm. But that was during those years that the so-called values and principles have worked effectively.

What might have changed in the ethical climate of Wal-Mart in recent years to contribute to the lawsuits by dis-gruntled employees?

   2. Not being focus on the company’s mission and vision from the management side might have changed in the ethical climate of Wall-Mart. To think, the company have started with a very strong and ambitious values and principles which employees were given the most importance.

Do you think Wal-Mart has an ethical problem? Is the company right to claim that with 1.4 million employees, some problems are bound to arise?

   3. I don’t think Wall-Mart has an ethical problem. I believe no companies dream of just earning without helping their manpower.

If you were running Wal-Mart, what steps would you take to address any potential ethical issues, particularly with regard to employees? 

   4. If I’m running Wall-Mart, I’ll make sure that those people I put in the management have the same vision and dedication to make realize the company’s core values and principles.

...PESTLE Analysis of Walton Mobile

Political

The Political factors relates to the factors which the government also affects such as government instability or rules and regulations which the business must follow. Walton is trying to move one of its manufacturing facilities to Nepal, and because of this it is important that Walton follow the rules and regulations that are set in Nepal, so that they can operate as efficiently as possible. The
 types of things they will have to be aware of is the minimum wage, the maximum hours a week employees can work and especially the Health and Safety regulations; this is to avoid any bad press or revolt from employees that will ultimately damage the reputation of Walton both short term and long term. As well as foreign government it is vital that Walton have a good relationship with their government in Bangladesh, as any political instability such as a change in government or coalition may result in new laws being implemented, which will affect Walton a lot.

...the most famous and successful entrepreneurs and businessmen in America; Sam Walton (1918-1992), who is known for his two big business successes Wal-mart and Sam’s club. In the early years of Sam Walton’s life, he lived with his parents on a farm, but Walton’s father decided to move to Missouri to pursue his former career as a banker. Even though the family moved around, Walton kept his focus on his studies and sports which, already
 back then, had a lot to say about his mentality and center of attention. Sam Walton did not grow up having it easy. His parents made him do chores at home which conflicted with his school work and sports performance. He grew up during the Great Depression which forced the family to always find the cheapest way to survive and make a living. His parents made him milk the cows and deliver milk and newspapers. His childhood must have taught him a lot, and he learned that wealth, fortune and success don’t come easy. You have to work hard to be successful, and this philosophy that he learned already as a child, must have been a great motivator through his life to achieve and succeed. It taught him how to stand on his own feet and revealed to him the asset of individualism which is another great quality that an entrepreneur must acquire.
      When he graduated from high school he went to college in search of an education that eventually would help him support his...

Sam Walton: Great From the Start
 

 Sam Walton’s retailing career began September 1, 1945, in Newport, Arkansas. He paid a princely $25,000 to Butler Brothers to franchise a 5,000-square-foot Ben Franklin’s variety store. In this excerpt from Giants of Enterprise: Seven Business Innovators and the Empires They Built, author and HBS professor Richard S. Tedlow  depicts the huge success Walton made of his first store—against all odds. The book is scheduled for publication later this year by HarperBusiness. Excerpted with permission of the author. 
 
by Richard S. Tedlow
Sam Walton's first store was a second-rate store in a second-rate town in what no one would have classified as a first-rate state. Millions, literally, of small stores failed during the course of the twentieth century in America. There were about 1.7 million retail establishments in the United States in 1945. Why wouldn't this one be among the many that didn't make it?
Surely, any analyst of the situation in 1945 would have found in Walton a good candidate for failure. As he himself put it, "For all of my confidence I hadn't had a day's experience in running a variety store . . .." He could have added that he had not had a day's experience in running a business of any kind. He paid a price for this inexperience and excessive enthusiasm before his store even opened. He had selected the wrong store and paid too much for it. "Only after we closed the deal, of course, did I learn that the store was a real dog." The rent for this "dog" was 5 percent of sales. This sounded fine to Walton; but after signing the lease, he discovered that this "was the highest rent anybody'd ever heard of in the variety store business. No one paid 5 percent of sales for rent."  Here was another economic factor which was going to make it difficult to use low prices as a competitive weapon. And there were more problems with the lease, serious problems, which it would take Walton another half decade to discover.
First he learned all the rules. Then he broke all the rules which did not make sense to himwhich meant almost all of them. Richard S. Tedlow
Walton seemed to have a lot of strikes against him. But he was a spectacular success in his first store. Why? Much of what was to make him a great merchant was evident from the very beginning. First he learned all the rules. Then he broke all the rules which did not make sense to him—which meant almost all of them. Everything he did seems so obvious. It seems that way because it is. Sam Walton did not become a billionaire because he was a genius (although he was without question smart, shrewd, and astute). The real explanation for his success was that he had the courage of his convictions.
Butler Brothers had a training program for variety store franchisees, so Walton was off to Arkadelphia, Arkansas, for two weeks of education prior to opening his store. He found it useful. "You can learn from everybody," he said, and one of the key characteristics of his career was that he kept learning until the day he died. He learned from Butler Brothers, from retail publications, and from his competitor, John Dunham, with his Sterling Store. According to Helen Walton, his wife, "Of course, what really drove Sam was that competition across the street—John Dunham over at the Sterling Store. Sam was always over there checking on John. Always. Looking at his prices, looking at his displays, looking at what was going on .... I'm sure it aggravated him quite a bit early on."
It did not take long for Walton to begin to chafe under the tight controls of Butler Brothers. He began scouting around for less expensive suppliers, and he found them. If there was inspiration in his business strategy, it lay in the next step. Having found less expensive suppliers than Butler Brothers, he did not sell his products at prevailing prices. Instead, he discounted his merchandise, passing the savings he achieved on to the consumer, and made his profit on volume rather than on margin. "Simple enough," as Walton himself admitted. But it took him a decade to appreciate fully the power of the idea. Once seizing on it, never wavering from it became the centerpiece of Wal-Mart's greatness.



 Sam Walton 
 

That was still a long time in the future. Butler Brothers was not thrilled by Walton's freelancing ways, but the numbers he was putting up seemed to mollify them. Sales increased more than 45 percent to $105,000 in his first full year of ownership. The following year, sales were up another third to $140,000. The year after that he surpassed his rival Dunham as sales increased 25 percent to $175,000. After thirty months in business, Walton was able to repay his father-in-law's loan in full. In his fifth year at the Ben Franklin on Front Street in Newport, Arkansas, Sam Walton—the sucker Butler Brothers had been looking for—sold $250,000 worth of merchandise and made a profit of between $30,000 and $40,000.  His loser of a store in the middle of nowhere had posted a compound annual growth rate in sales of over 28 percent. He was the leading variety store operator in Arkansas, and probably in the adjacent states as well.
And then, in a heartbeat, he lost everything.
The problem was the lease Walton had signed back in 1945 for his Front Street store. It contained no renewal clause. Options to renew were standard features of leases such as the one Walton had originally entered into. L. S. Robson, Walton's father-in-law, was reportedly shocked by Walton's mistake.
Not only had Walton built a successful business in Newport, he had invested a lot of himself in the town. He was an active member of the Rotary Club, a member of the board of deacons of the Presbyterian church ("even though I was a Methodist, it worked out real well"), and president of the Chamber of Commerce.
Equally important, Helen loved the town. Three of her four children—John Thomas (1946), James Carr (1948), and Alice (1949)—were born during those five years. "We had built a life there," she recalled in 1992. "I still have good friends from those days."  Now they were going to have to leave because there was no other space available to relocate the store.
"It was the low point of my life," Walton recalled.
"I felt sick to my stomach. I couldn't believe it was happening to me. It was really like a nightmare. I had built the best variety store in the whole region and worked hard in the community—done everything right—and now I was being kicked out of town. It didn't seem fair. I blamed myself for getting suckered into such an awful lease, and I was furious at the landlord. Helen, just settling in with a brand-new family, was heartsick at the prospect of leaving Newport. But that's what we were going to do."
There is a great deal to be learned from Walton's assessment of the situation. First of all, this really hurt. Second, he blamed himself. Third, he had been a sucker—there is that word again. Fourth, even though he took responsibility, he found something fundamentally unfair in what had befallen him. He had "done everything right," yet his reward was exile.
Many another great entrepreneur suffered similar setbacks. Many made mistakes for which they had only themselves to blame. Many encountered situations in which their failure to achieve their goals was experienced as fundamentally unfair. Great entrepreneurs are, speaking generally, people of enormous, innate optimism They believe that honest, intelligent effort will be greeted by appropriate reward. What they do not believe is that life is unfair. When they do everything right, and the result turns out wrong, the cause is a temporary cosmic misunderstanding which will be corrected in due course. Sometimes corrected with a vengeance.
Also like other great entrepreneurs, Walton traveled light. He did not ruminate. "I've never been one to dwell on reverses, and I didn't do so then.... I know I read my leases a lot more carefully after that, and maybe I became a little more wary of just how tough the world can be .... But I didn't dwell on my disappointment."'
It is worth asking why P. K. Holmes, Walton's landlord, did not renew his lease. There were some obvious reasons for him to keep rather than evict Walton. His flair was creating a lot of what Newport had precious little of, excitement. Walton was repeating his high school and college experiences, becoming the most popular man around. And there was what cannot have been the completely insignificant question of money. Before Walton, the local Ben Franklin did $72,000 in sales. Five years into Walton's tenure, it did a quarter of a million. At a rental fee of 5 percent of sales, that meant the difference between $3,600 and $12,500 or $8,900 for Mr. Holmes. $8,900 in 1945 is, inflation adjusted, over $85,000 in 2000. Mr. Holmes received this bounty for doing nothing whatever himself. It was pure luck for him that Helen Walton wanted to live in a small town, that Butler Brothers needed to unload the local Ben Franklin, and that the "sucker" on whom it was unloaded turned out to be the greatest merchant ever.
Think about the future. Let's say that Walton's store eased from its 28 percent compound annual growth rate in sales down to 18 percent. In five years, the sales of that store would be about $572,000. Five percent of that is over $28,000. Not a bad income for sitting around and watching the grass grow. One can imagine worse tenants.
The fact that Walton had acquired the lease to a store in Newport that Kroger was vacating and then set up a small department store himself, which he called the Eagle Store, might not have been completely irrelevant in Holmes's thinking. Walton did not intend to go into the department store business in a serious way. He bought the lease to prevent his "friendly" rival John Dunham from acquiring the property and expanding his Sterling Store. Newport already had a couple of department stores. One of these was owned by P. K. Holmes. Walton's transaction did not go unnoticed.
However, Walton believed, probably correctly, that Holmes refused to renew his lease at any price because he saw how well the Ben Franklin was doing. He purchased the store's inventory and fixtures at what Walton himself concedes was  "a fair price," $50,000.  So Walton did not leave Newport empty-handed. With the store intact, Holmes gave it to his son. Thus, Walton suffered from nepotism in a sense just as George Eastman had. Holmes must have figured there was no particular reason to be content with 5 percent of something when he could have 100 percent of that same thing all in the family.
Eastman returned to the Rochester Savings Bank as a director after he had made his fortune. Walton never came back to Newport as a resident, but he did as a merchant. This is what he had to say:
"Wal-Mart No. 18  opened in 1969, and it marked our return to Newport ... nineteen years after we had basically been run out of town. By then, I was long over what had happened to us down there, and I didn't have revenge in mind. As it happened, we did extraordinarily well with our Newport Wal-Mart, and it wasn't too long before the old Ben Franklin store I had run on Front Street had to close its doors. You can't say we ran that guy—the landlord's son—out of business. His customers were the ones who shut him down. They voted with their feet."
Perhaps Walton did not have revenge uppermost in mind. But odds are it was there somewhere. He found room to mention Wal-Mart No. 18 in his autobiography, which was written on his deathbed.

Early life[edit]
Samuel Moore Walton was born to Thomas Gibson Walton and Nancy Lee, in Kingfisher, Oklahoma. He lived there with his parents on their farm until 1923. However, farming did not provide enough money to raise a family, and Thomas Walton went into farm mortgaging. He worked for his brother's Walton Mortgage Company, which was an agent for Metropolitan Life Insurance,[3][4] where he foreclosed on farms during the Great Depression.[5]
He and his family (now with another son, James, born in 1921) moved from Oklahoma. They moved from one small town to another for several years. While attending eighth grade in Shelbina, Missouri, Sam became the youngest Eagle Scout in the state's history.[6] In adult life, Walton became a recipient of the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award from the Boy Scouts of America.[7]
Eventually the family moved to Columbia, Missouri. Growing up during the Great Depression, he did chores to help make financial ends meet for his family as was common at the time. He milked the family cow, bottled the surplus, and drove it to customers. Afterwards, he would deliver Columbia Daily Tribune newspapers on a paper route. In addition, he sold magazine subscriptions.[8] Upon graduating from David H. Hickman High School in Columbia, he was voted "Most Versatile Boy".
After high school, Walton decided to attend college, hoping to find a better way to help support his family. He attended the University of Missouri as an ROTC cadet. During this time, he worked various odd jobs, including waiting tables in exchange for meals. Also during his time in college, Walton joined the Zeta Phi chapter of Beta Theta Pi fraternity. He was also tapped by QEBH, the well-known secret society on campus honoring the top senior men, and the national military honor society Scabbard and Blade. Additionally, Walton served as president of Burall Bible Class, a large class of students from the University of Missouri and Stephens College.[9] Upon graduating in 1940 with a bachelor's degree in economics, he was voted "permanent president" of the class.[10]
Walton joined J. C. Penney as a management trainee in Des Moines, Iowa,[10] three days after graduating from college.[8] This position paid him $75 a month. Walton spent approximately 18 months with J. C. Penney.[11] He resigned in 1942 in anticipation of being inducted into the military for service in World War II.[8] In the meantime, he worked at a DuPont munitions plant near Tulsa, Oklahoma. Soon afterwards, Walton joined the military in the U.S. Army Intelligence Corps, supervising security at aircraft plants and prisoner of war camps. In this position he served at Fort Douglas in Salt Lake City, Utah. He eventually reached the rank of captain.
The first stores[edit]
In 1945, after leaving the military, Walton took over management of his first variety store at the age of 26. With the help of a $20,000 loan from his father-in-law, plus $5,000 he had saved from his time in the Army, Walton purchased a Ben Franklin variety store in Newport, Arkansas.[8] The store was a franchise of the Butler Brothers chain.
Walton pioneered many concepts that became crucial to his success. Walton made sure the shelves were consistently stocked with a wide range of goods. His second store, the tiny "Eagle" department store, was down the street from his first Ben Franklin and next door to its main competitor in Newport.
With the sales volume growing from $80,000 to $225,000 in three years, Walton drew the attention of the landlord, P. K. Holmes, whose family had a history in retail.[12] Admiring Sam's great success, and desiring to reclaim the store (and franchise rights) for his son, he refused to renew the lease. The lack of a renewal option, together with the prohibitively high rent of 5% of sales, were early business lessons to Walton. Despite forcing Walton out, Holmes bought the store's inventory and fixtures for $50,000, which Walton called "a fair price".[13]




Walton's Five and Dime, now the Wal-Mart Visitors Center, Bentonville.


With a year left on the lease, but the store effectively sold, he, his wife Helen and his father-in-law managed to negotiate the purchase of a new location on the downtown square of Bentonville, Arkansas. Walton negotiated the purchase of a small discount store, and the title to the building, on the condition that he get a 99-year lease to expand into the shop next door. The owner of the shop next door refused six times, and Walton gave up on Bentonville when his father-in-law, without Sam's knowledge, paid the shop owner a final visit and $20,000 to secure the lease. He had just enough left from the sale of the first store to close the deal, and reimburse Helen's father. They opened for business with a one-day remodeling sale on May 9, 1950.[12]
Before he bought the Bentonville store, it was doing $72,000 in sales and it increased to $105,000 in the first year and then $140,000 and $175,000.[14]
A chain of Ben Franklin stores[edit]
With the new Bentonville "Five and Dime" opening for business, and 220 miles away, a year left on the lease in Newport, the money-strapped young Walton had to learn to delegate responsibility.[15][16]
After succeeding with two stores at such a distance (and with the postwar baby boom in full effect), Sam became enthusiastic about scouting more locations and opening more Ben Franklin franchises. (Also, having spent countless hours behind the wheel, and with his close brother James "Bud" Walton having been a pilot in the war, he decided to buy a small second-hand airplane. Both he and his son John would later become accomplished pilots and log thousands of hours scouting locations and expanding the family business.)[15]
In 1954, he opened a store with his brother Bud in a shopping center in Ruskin Heights, a suburb of Kansas City, Missouri. With the help of his brother and father-in-law, Sam went on to open many new variety stores. He encouraged his managers to invest and take an equity stake in the business, often as much as $1000 in their store, or the next outlet to open. (This motivated the managers to sharpen their managerial skills and take ownership over their role in the enterprise.)[15] By 1962, along with his brother Bud, he owned 16 stores in Arkansas, Missouri, and Kansas (fifteen Ben Franklins and one independent, in Fayetteville).[17]
The first Wal-Mart[edit]
Main article: History of Wal-Mart
The first true Wal-Mart opened on July 2, 1962, in Rogers, Arkansas.[18] Called the Wal-Mart Discount City store, it was located at 719 West Walnut Street. He launched a determined effort to market American-made products. Included in the effort was a willingness to find American manufacturers who could supply merchandise for the entire Wal-Mart chain at a price low enough to meet the foreign competition.[19]
As the Meijer store chain grew, it caught the attention of Walton. He acknowledges that his one-stop-shopping center format was based on Meijer’s innovative concept.[20] Contrary to the prevailing practice of American discount store chains, Walton located stores in smaller towns, not larger cities. To make his model work, he emphasized logistics, particularly locating stores within a day's drive proximity to Wal-Mart's regional warehouses, and distributed through its own trucking service. Buying in volume and efficient delivery permitted sale of discounted name brand merchandise. Thus, sustained growth— from 1977's 190 stores to 1985's 800— was achieved.[10]
Personal life[edit]



This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (September 2009)


Walton married Helen Robson on February 14, 1943.[8] They had four children: Samuel Robson (Rob) born in 1944, John Thomas (1946–2005), James Carr (Jim) born in 1948, and Alice Louise born in 1949.[21] Walton supported various charitable causes. He and Helen were active in the Bentonville Church of Christ; Sam served as an Elder and a Sunday School teacher, teaching high school age students.[22] The family made substantial contributions to the congregation.
Death[edit]
Walton died on Sunday, April 5, 1992, of multiple myeloma, a type of blood cancer, in Little Rock, Arkansas.[23] The news of his death was relayed by satellite to all 1,960 Wal-Mart stores.[24] At the time, his company employed 380,000 people. Annual sales of nearly $50 billion flowed from 1,735 Wal-Marts, 212 Sam’s Clubs, and 13 Supercenters.[10]
His remains are interred at the Bentonville Cemetery.[25]
He left his ownership in Wal-Mart to his wife and their children: Rob Walton succeeded his father as the Chairman of Wal-Mart, and John Walton was a director until his death in a 2005 plane crash. The others are not directly involved in the company (except through their voting power as shareholders), however his son Jim Walton is chairman of Arvest Bank. The Walton family held five spots in the top ten richest people in the United States until 2005. Two daughters of Sam's brother Bud Walton—Ann Kroenke and Nancy Laurie—hold smaller shares in the company.
Legacy[edit]
In 1998, Walton was included in Time's list of 100 most influential people of the 20th Century.[26] Walton was honored for his work in retail in March 1992, when he received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President George H. W. Bush.[24]
Forbes ranked Sam Walton as the richest person in the United States from 1982 to 1988, ceding the top spot to John Kluge in 1989 when the editors began to credit Walton's fortune jointly to him and his four children.[27] (Bill Gates first headed the list in 1992, the year Walton died). Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. also runs Sam's Club warehouse stores. Walmart operates in the U.S. and in more than 15 international markets, including Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, South Africa, Botswana, Ghana, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, Kenya, Lesotho, Swaziland, Honduras, Japan, Mexico, Nicaragua and the United Kingdom.[28]
At the University of Arkansas, the Business College (Sam M. Walton College of Business) is named in his honor. Walton was inducted into the Junior Achievement U.S. Business Hall of Fame in 1992.[29]

Early life[edit]
Samuel Moore Walton was born to Thomas Gibson Walton and Nancy Lee, in Kingfisher, Oklahoma. He lived there with his parents on their farm until 1923. However, farming did not provide enough money to raise a family, and Thomas Walton went into farm mortgaging. He worked for his brother's Walton Mortgage Company, which was an agent for Metropolitan Life Insurance,[3][4] where he foreclosed on farms during the Great Depression.[5]
He and his family (now with another son, James, born in 1921) moved from Oklahoma. They moved from one small town to another for several years. While attending eighth grade in Shelbina, Missouri, Sam became the youngest Eagle Scout in the state's history.[6] In adult life, Walton became a recipient of the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award from the Boy Scouts of America.[7]
Eventually the family moved to Columbia, Missouri. Growing up during the Great Depression, he did chores to help make financial ends meet for his family as was common at the time. He milked the family cow, bottled the surplus, and drove it to customers. Afterwards, he would deliver Columbia Daily Tribune newspapers on a paper route. In addition, he sold magazine subscriptions.[8] Upon graduating from David H. Hickman High School in Columbia, he was voted "Most Versatile Boy".
After high school, Walton decided to attend college, hoping to find a better way to help support his family. He attended the University of Missouri as an ROTC cadet. During this time, he worked various odd jobs, including waiting tables in exchange for meals. Also during his time in college, Walton joined the Zeta Phi chapter of Beta Theta Pi fraternity. He was also tapped by QEBH, the well-known secret society on campus honoring the top senior men, and the national military honor society Scabbard and Blade. Additionally, Walton served as president of Burall Bible Class, a large class of students from the University of Missouri and Stephens College.[9] Upon graduating in 1940 with a bachelor's degree in economics, he was voted "permanent president" of the class.[10]
Walton joined J. C. Penney as a management trainee in Des Moines, Iowa,[10] three days after graduating from college.[8] This position paid him $75 a month. Walton spent approximately 18 months with J. C. Penney.[11] He resigned in 1942 in anticipation of being inducted into the military for service in World War II.[8] In the meantime, he worked at a DuPont munitions plant near Tulsa, Oklahoma. Soon afterwards, Walton joined the military in the U.S. Army Intelligence Corps, supervising security at aircraft plants and prisoner of war camps. In this position he served at Fort Douglas in Salt Lake City, Utah. He eventually reached the rank of captain.
The first stores[edit]
In 1945, after leaving the military, Walton took over management of his first variety store at the age of 26. With the help of a $20,000 loan from his father-in-law, plus $5,000 he had saved from his time in the Army, Walton purchased a Ben Franklin variety store in Newport, Arkansas.[8] The store was a franchise of the Butler Brothers chain.
Walton pioneered many concepts that became crucial to his success. Walton made sure the shelves were consistently stocked with a wide range of goods. His second store, the tiny "Eagle" department store, was down the street from his first Ben Franklin and next door to its main competitor in Newport.
With the sales volume growing from $80,000 to $225,000 in three years, Walton drew the attention of the landlord, P. K. Holmes, whose family had a history in retail.[12] Admiring Sam's great success, and desiring to reclaim the store (and franchise rights) for his son, he refused to renew the lease. The lack of a renewal option, together with the prohibitively high rent of 5% of sales, were early business lessons to Walton. Despite forcing Walton out, Holmes bought the store's inventory and fixtures for $50,000, which Walton called "a fair price".[13]




Walton's Five and Dime, now the Wal-Mart Visitors Center, Bentonville.


With a year left on the lease, but the store effectively sold, he, his wife Helen and his father-in-law managed to negotiate the purchase of a new location on the downtown square of Bentonville, Arkansas. Walton negotiated the purchase of a small discount store, and the title to the building, on the condition that he get a 99-year lease to expand into the shop next door. The owner of the shop next door refused six times, and Walton gave up on Bentonville when his father-in-law, without Sam's knowledge, paid the shop owner a final visit and $20,000 to secure the lease. He had just enough left from the sale of the first store to close the deal, and reimburse Helen's father. They opened for business with a one-day remodeling sale on May 9, 1950.[12]
Before he bought the Bentonville store, it was doing $72,000 in sales and it increased to $105,000 in the first year and then $140,000 and $175,000.[14]
A chain of Ben Franklin stores[edit]
With the new Bentonville "Five and Dime" opening for business, and 220 miles away, a year left on the lease in Newport, the money-strapped young Walton had to learn to delegate responsibility.[15][16]
After succeeding with two stores at such a distance (and with the postwar baby boom in full effect), Sam became enthusiastic about scouting more locations and opening more Ben Franklin franchises. (Also, having spent countless hours behind the wheel, and with his close brother James "Bud" Walton having been a pilot in the war, he decided to buy a small second-hand airplane. Both he and his son John would later become accomplished pilots and log thousands of hours scouting locations and expanding the family business.)[15]
In 1954, he opened a store with his brother Bud in a shopping center in Ruskin Heights, a suburb of Kansas City, Missouri. With the help of his brother and father-in-law, Sam went on to open many new variety stores. He encouraged his managers to invest and take an equity stake in the business, often as much as $1000 in their store, or the next outlet to open. (This motivated the managers to sharpen their managerial skills and take ownership over their role in the enterprise.)[15] By 1962, along with his brother Bud, he owned 16 stores in Arkansas, Missouri, and Kansas (fifteen Ben Franklins and one independent, in Fayetteville).[17]
The first Wal-Mart[edit]
Main article: History of Wal-Mart
The first true Wal-Mart opened on July 2, 1962, in Rogers, Arkansas.[18] Called the Wal-Mart Discount City store, it was located at 719 West Walnut Street. He launched a determined effort to market American-made products. Included in the effort was a willingness to find American manufacturers who could supply merchandise for the entire Wal-Mart chain at a price low enough to meet the foreign competition.[19]
As the Meijer store chain grew, it caught the attention of Walton. He acknowledges that his one-stop-shopping center format was based on Meijer’s innovative concept.[20] Contrary to the prevailing practice of American discount store chains, Walton located stores in smaller towns, not larger cities. To make his model work, he emphasized logistics, particularly locating stores within a day's drive proximity to Wal-Mart's regional warehouses, and distributed through its own trucking service. Buying in volume and efficient delivery permitted sale of discounted name brand merchandise. Thus, sustained growth— from 1977's 190 stores to 1985's 800— was achieved.[10]
Personal life[edit]

Walton married Helen Robson on February 14, 1943.[8] They had four children: Samuel Robson (Rob) born in 1944, John Thomas (1946–2005), James Carr (Jim) born in 1948, and Alice Louise born in 1949.[21] Walton supported various charitable causes. He and Helen were active in the Bentonville Church of Christ; Sam served as an Elder and a Sunday School teacher, teaching high school age students.[22] The family made substantial contributions to the congregation.
Death[edit]
Walton died on Sunday, April 5, 1992, of multiple myeloma, a type of blood cancer, in Little Rock, Arkansas.[23] The news of his death was relayed by satellite to all 1,960 Wal-Mart stores.[24] At the time, his company employed 380,000 people. Annual sales of nearly $50 billion flowed from 1,735 Wal-Marts, 212 Sam’s Clubs, and 13 Supercenters.[10]
His remains are interred at the Bentonville Cemetery.[25]
He left his ownership in Wal-Mart to his wife and their children: Rob Walton succeeded his father as the Chairman of Wal-Mart, and John Walton was a director until his death in a 2005 plane crash. The others are not directly involved in the company (except through their voting power as shareholders), however his son Jim Walton is chairman of Arvest Bank. The Walton family held five spots in the top ten richest people in the United States until 2005. Two daughters of Sam's brother Bud Walton—Ann Kroenke and Nancy Laurie—hold smaller shares in the company.
Legacy[edit]
In 1998, Walton was included in Time's list of 100 most influential people of the 20th Century.[26] Walton was honored for his work in retail in March 1992, when he received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President George H. W. Bush.[24]
Forbes ranked Sam Walton as the richest person in the United States from 1982 to 1988, ceding the top spot to John Kluge in 1989 when the editors began to credit Walton's fortune jointly to him and his four children.[27] (Bill Gates first headed the list in 1992, the year Walton died). Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. also runs Sam's Club warehouse stores. Walmart operates in the U.S. and in more than 15 international markets, including Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, South Africa, Botswana, Ghana, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, Kenya, Lesotho, Swaziland, Honduras, Japan, Mexico, Nicaragua and the United Kingdom.[28]
At the University of Arkansas, the Business College (Sam M. Walton College of Business) is named in his honor. Walton was inducted into the Junior Achievement U.S. Business Hall of Fame in 1992.[29]

Early life[edit]
Samuel Moore Walton was born to Thomas Gibson Walton and Nancy Lee, in Kingfisher, Oklahoma. He lived there with his parents on their farm until 1923. However, farming did not provide enough money to raise a family, and Thomas Walton went into farm mortgaging. He worked for his brother's Walton Mortgage Company, which was an agent for Metropolitan Life Insurance,[3][4] where he foreclosed on farms during the Great Depression.[5]
He and his family (now with another son, James, born in 1921) moved from Oklahoma. They moved from one small town to another for several years. While attending eighth grade in Shelbina, Missouri, Sam became the youngest Eagle Scout in the state's history.[6] In adult life, Walton became a recipient of the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award from the Boy Scouts of America.[7]
Eventually the family moved to Columbia, Missouri. Growing up during the Great Depression, he did chores to help make financial ends meet for his family as was common at the time. He milked the family cow, bottled the surplus, and drove it to customers. Afterwards, he would deliver Columbia Daily Tribune newspapers on a paper route. In addition, he sold magazine subscriptions.[8] Upon graduating from David H. Hickman High School in Columbia, he was voted "Most Versatile Boy".
After high school, Walton decided to attend college, hoping to find a better way to help support his family. He attended the University of Missouri as an ROTC cadet. During this time, he worked various odd jobs, including waiting tables in exchange for meals. Also during his time in college, Walton joined the Zeta Phi chapter of Beta Theta Pi fraternity. He was also tapped by QEBH, the well-known secret society on campus honoring the top senior men, and the national military honor society Scabbard and Blade. Additionally, Walton served as president of Burall Bible Class, a large class of students from the University of Missouri and Stephens College.[9] Upon graduating in 1940 with a bachelor's degree in economics, he was voted "permanent president" of the class.[10]
Walton joined J. C. Penney as a management trainee in Des Moines, Iowa,[10] three days after graduating from college.[8] This position paid him $75 a month. Walton spent approximately 18 months with J. C. Penney.[11] He resigned in 1942 in anticipation of being inducted into the military for service in World War II.[8] In the meantime, he worked at a DuPont munitions plant near Tulsa, Oklahoma. Soon afterwards, Walton joined the military in the U.S. Army Intelligence Corps, supervising security at aircraft plants and prisoner of war camps. In this position he served at Fort Douglas in Salt Lake City, Utah. He eventually reached the rank of captain.
The first stores[edit]
In 1945, after leaving the military, Walton took over management of his first variety store at the age of 26. With the help of a $20,000 loan from his father-in-law, plus $5,000 he had saved from his time in the Army, Walton purchased a Ben Franklin variety store in Newport, Arkansas.[8] The store was a franchise of the Butler Brothers chain.
Walton pioneered many concepts that became crucial to his success. Walton made sure the shelves were consistently stocked with a wide range of goods. His second store, the tiny "Eagle" department store, was down the street from his first Ben Franklin and next door to its main competitor in Newport.
With the sales volume growing from $80,000 to $225,000 in three years, Walton drew the attention of the landlord, P. K. Holmes, whose family had a history in retail.[12] Admiring Sam's great success, and desiring to reclaim the store (and franchise rights) for his son, he refused to renew the lease. The lack of a renewal option, together with the prohibitively high rent of 5% of sales, were early business lessons to Walton. Despite forcing Walton out, Holmes bought the store's inventory and fixtures for $50,000, which Walton called "a fair price".[13]




Walton's Five and Dime, now the Wal-Mart Visitors Center, Bentonville.


With a year left on the lease, but the store effectively sold, he, his wife Helen and his father-in-law managed to negotiate the purchase of a new location on the downtown square of Bentonville, Arkansas. Walton negotiated the purchase of a small discount store, and the title to the building, on the condition that he get a 99-year lease to expand into the shop next door. The owner of the shop next door refused six times, and Walton gave up on Bentonville when his father-in-law, without Sam's knowledge, paid the shop owner a final visit and $20,000 to secure the lease. He had just enough left from the sale of the first store to close the deal, and reimburse Helen's father. They opened for business with a one-day remodeling sale on May 9, 1950.[12]
Before he bought the Bentonville store, it was doing $72,000 in sales and it increased to $105,000 in the first year and then $140,000 and $175,000.[14]
A chain of Ben Franklin stores[edit]
With the new Bentonville "Five and Dime" opening for business, and 220 miles away, a year left on the lease in Newport, the money-strapped young Walton had to learn to delegate responsibility.[15][16]
After succeeding with two stores at such a distance (and with the postwar baby boom in full effect), Sam became enthusiastic about scouting more locations and opening more Ben Franklin franchises. (Also, having spent countless hours behind the wheel, and with his close brother James "Bud" Walton having been a pilot in the war, he decided to buy a small second-hand airplane. Both he and his son John would later become accomplished pilots and log thousands of hours scouting locations and expanding the family business.)[15]
In 1954, he opened a store with his brother Bud in a shopping center in Ruskin Heights, a suburb of Kansas City, Missouri. With the help of his brother and father-in-law, Sam went on to open many new variety stores. He encouraged his managers to invest and take an equity stake in the business, often as much as $1000 in their store, or the next outlet to open. (This motivated the managers to sharpen their managerial skills and take ownership over their role in the enterprise.)[15] By 1962, along with his brother Bud, he owned 16 stores in Arkansas, Missouri, and Kansas (fifteen Ben Franklins and one independent, in Fayetteville).[17]
The first Wal-Mart[edit]
Main article: History of Wal-Mart
The first true Wal-Mart opened on July 2, 1962, in Rogers, Arkansas.[18] Called the Wal-Mart Discount City store, it was located at 719 West Walnut Street. He launched a determined effort to market American-made products. Included in the effort was a willingness to find American manufacturers who could supply merchandise for the entire Wal-Mart chain at a price low enough to meet the foreign competition.[19]
As the Meijer store chain grew, it caught the attention of Walton. He acknowledges that his one-stop-shopping center format was based on Meijer’s innovative concept.[20] Contrary to the prevailing practice of American discount store chains, Walton located stores in smaller towns, not larger cities. To make his model work, he emphasized logistics, particularly locating stores within a day's drive proximity to Wal-Mart's regional warehouses, and distributed through its own trucking service. Buying in volume and efficient delivery permitted sale of discounted name brand merchandise. Thus, sustained growth— from 1977's 190 stores to 1985's 800— was achieved.[10]
Personal life[edit]

Walton married Helen Robson on February 14, 1943.[8] They had four children: Samuel Robson (Rob) born in 1944, John Thomas (1946–2005), James Carr (Jim) born in 1948, and Alice Louise born in 1949.[21] Walton supported various charitable causes. He and Helen were active in the Bentonville Church of Christ; Sam served as an Elder and a Sunday School teacher, teaching high school age students.[22] The family made substantial contributions to the congregation.
Death[edit]
Walton died on Sunday, April 5, 1992, of multiple myeloma, a type of blood cancer, in Little Rock, Arkansas.[23] The news of his death was relayed by satellite to all 1,960 Wal-Mart stores.[24] At the time, his company employed 380,000 people. Annual sales of nearly $50 billion flowed from 1,735 Wal-Marts, 212 Sam’s Clubs, and 13 Supercenters.[10]
His remains are interred at the Bentonville Cemetery.[25]
He left his ownership in Wal-Mart to his wife and their children: Rob Walton succeeded his father as the Chairman of Wal-Mart, and John Walton was a director until his death in a 2005 plane crash. The others are not directly involved in the company (except through their voting power as shareholders), however his son Jim Walton is chairman of Arvest Bank. The Walton family held five spots in the top ten richest people in the United States until 2005. Two daughters of Sam's brother Bud Walton—Ann Kroenke and Nancy Laurie—hold smaller shares in the company.
Legacy[edit]
In 1998, Walton was included in Time's list of 100 most influential people of the 20th Century.[26] Walton was honored for his work in retail in March 1992, when he received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President George H. W. Bush.[24]
Forbes ranked Sam Walton as the richest person in the United States from 1982 to 1988, ceding the top spot to John Kluge in 1989 when the editors began to credit Walton's fortune jointly to him and his four children.[27] (Bill Gates first headed the list in 1992, the year Walton died). Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. also runs Sam's Club warehouse stores. Walmart operates in the U.S. and in more than 15 international markets, including Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, South Africa, Botswana, Ghana, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, Kenya, Lesotho, Swaziland, Honduras, Japan, Mexico, Nicaragua and the United Kingdom.[28]
At the University of Arkansas, the Business College (Sam M. Walton College of Business) is named in his honor. Walton was inducted into the Junior Achievement U.S. Business Hall of Fame in 1992.[29]

Before he bought the Bentonville store, it was doing $72,000 in sales and it increased to $105,000 in the first year and then $140,000 and $175,000.[14]
A chain of Ben Franklin stores[edit]
With the new Bentonville "Five and Dime" opening for business, and 220 miles away, a year left on the lease in Newport, the money-strapped young Walton had to learn to delegate responsibility.[15][16]
After succeeding with two stores at such a distance (and with the postwar baby boom in full effect), Sam became enthusiastic about scouting more locations and opening more Ben Franklin franchises. (Also, having spent countless hours behind the wheel, and with his close brother James "Bud" Walton having been a pilot in the war, he decided to buy a small second-hand airplane. Both he and his son John would later become accomplished pilots and log thousands of hours scouting locations and expanding the family business.)[15]
In 1954, he opened a store with his brother Bud in a shopping center in Ruskin Heights, a suburb of Kansas City, Missouri. With the help of his brother and father-in-law, Sam went on to open many new variety stores. He encouraged his managers to invest and take an equity stake in the business, often as much as $1000 in their store, or the next outlet to open. (This motivated the managers to sharpen their managerial skills and take ownership over their role in the enterprise.)[15] By 1962, along with his brother Bud, he owned 16 stores in Arkansas, Missouri, and Kansas (fifteen Ben Franklins and one independent, in Fayetteville).[17]
The first Wal-Mart[edit]
Main article: History of Wal-Mart
The first true Wal-Mart opened on July 2, 1962, in Rogers, Arkansas.[18] Called the Wal-Mart Discount City store, it was located at 719 West Walnut Street. He launched a determined effort to market American-made products. Included in the effort was a willingness to find American manufacturers who could supply merchandise for the entire Wal-Mart chain at a price low enough to meet the foreign competition.[19]
As the Meijer store chain grew, it caught the attention of Walton. He acknowledges that his one-stop-shopping center format was based on Meijer’s innovative concept.[20] Contrary to the prevailing practice of American discount store chains, Walton located stores in smaller towns, not larger cities. To make his model work, he emphasized logistics, particularly locating stores within a day's drive proximity to Wal-Mart's regional warehouses, and distributed through its own trucking service. Buying in volume and efficient delivery permitted sale of discounted name brand merchandise. Thus, sustained growth— from 1977's 190 stores to 1985's 800— was achieved.[10]
Personal life[edit]

Walton married Helen Robson on February 14, 1943.[8] They had four children: Samuel Robson (Rob) born in 1944, John Thomas (1946–2005), James Carr (Jim) born in 1948, and Alice Louise born in 1949.[21] Walton supported various charitable causes. He and Helen were active in the Bentonville Church of Christ; Sam served as an Elder and a Sunday School teacher, teaching high school age students.[22] The family made substantial contributions to the congregation.
Death[edit]
Walton died on Sunday, April 5, 1992, of multiple myeloma, a type of blood cancer, in Little Rock, Arkansas.[23] The news of his death was relayed by satellite to all 1,960 Wal-Mart stores.[24] At the time, his company employed 380,000 people. Annual sales of nearly $50 billion flowed from 1,735 Wal-Marts, 212 Sam’s Clubs, and 13 Supercenters.[10]
His remains are interred at the Bentonville Cemetery.[25]
He left his ownership in Wal-Mart to his wife and their children: Rob Walton succeeded his father as the Chairman of Wal-Mart, and John Walton was a director until his death in a 2005 plane crash. The others are not directly involved in the company (except through their voting power as shareholders), however his son Jim Walton is chairman of Arvest Bank. The Walton family held five spots in the top ten richest people in the United States until 2005. Two daughters of Sam's brother Bud Walton—Ann Kroenke and Nancy Laurie—hold smaller shares in the company.
Legacy[edit]
In 1998, Walton was included in Time's list of 100 most influential people of the 20th Century.[26] Walton was honored for his work in retail in March 1992, when he received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President George H. W. Bush.[24]
Forbes ranked Sam Walton as the richest person in the United States from 1982 to 1988, ceding the top spot to John Kluge in 1989 when the editors began to credit Walton's fortune jointly to him and his four children.[27] (Bill Gates first headed the list in 1992, the year Walton died). Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. also runs Sam's Club warehouse stores. Walmart operates in the U.S. and in more than 15 international markets, including Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, South Africa, Botswana, Ghana, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, Kenya, Lesotho, Swaziland, Honduras, Japan, Mexico, Nicaragua and the United Kingdom.[28]
At the University of Arkansas, the Business College (Sam M. Walton College of Business) is named in his honor. Walton was inducted into the Junior Achievement U.S. Business Hall of Fame in 1992.[29]

Early life[edit]
Samuel Moore Walton was born to Thomas Gibson Walton and Nancy Lee, in Kingfisher, Oklahoma. He lived there with his parents on their farm until 1923. However, farming did not provide enough money to raise a family, and Thomas Walton went into farm mortgaging. He worked for his brother's Walton Mortgage Company, which was an agent for Metropolitan Life Insurance,[3][4] where he foreclosed on farms during the Great Depression.[5]
He and his family (now with another son, James, born in 1921) moved from Oklahoma. They moved from one small town to another for several years. While attending eighth grade in Shelbina, Missouri, Sam became the youngest Eagle Scout in the state's history.[6] In adult life, Walton became a recipient of the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award from the Boy Scouts of America.[7]
Eventually the family moved to Columbia, Missouri. Growing up during the Great Depression, he did chores to help make financial ends meet for his family as was common at the time. He milked the family cow, bottled the surplus, and drove it to customers. Afterwards, he would deliver Columbia Daily Tribune newspapers on a paper route. In addition, he sold magazine subscriptions.[8] Upon graduating from David H. Hickman High School in Columbia, he was voted "Most Versatile Boy".
After high school, Walton decided to attend college, hoping to find a better way to help support his family. He attended the University of Missouri as an ROTC cadet. During this time, he worked various odd jobs, including waiting tables in exchange for meals. Also during his time in college, Walton joined the Zeta Phi chapter of Beta Theta Pi fraternity. He was also tapped by QEBH, the well-known secret society on campus honoring the top senior men, and the national military honor society Scabbard and Blade. Additionally, Walton served as president of Burall Bible Class, a large class of students from the University of Missouri and Stephens College.[9] Upon graduating in 1940 with a bachelor's degree in economics, he was voted "permanent president" of the class.[10]
Walton joined J. C. Penney as a management trainee in Des Moines, Iowa,[10] three days after graduating from college.[8] This position paid him $75 a month. Walton spent approximately 18 months with J. C. Penney.[11] He resigned in 1942 in anticipation of being inducted into the military for service in World War II.[8] In the meantime, he worked at a DuPont munitions plant near Tulsa, Oklahoma. Soon afterwards, Walton joined the military in the U.S. Army Intelligence Corps, supervising security at aircraft plants and prisoner of war camps. In this position he served at Fort Douglas in Salt Lake City, Utah. He eventually reached the rank of captain.
The first stores[edit]
In 1945, after leaving the military, Walton took over management of his first variety store at the age of 26. With the help of a $20,000 loan from his father-in-law, plus $5,000 he had saved from his time in the Army, Walton purchased a Ben Franklin variety store in Newport, Arkansas.[8] The store was a franchise of the Butler Brothers chain.
Walton pioneered many concepts that became crucial to his success. Walton made sure the shelves were consistently stocked with a wide range of goods. His second store, the tiny "Eagle" department store, was down the street from his first Ben Franklin and next door to its main competitor in Newport.
With the sales volume growing from $80,000 to $225,000 in three years, Walton drew the attention of the landlord, P. K. Holmes, whose family had a history in retail.[12] Admiring Sam's great success, and desiring to reclaim the store (and franchise rights) for his son, he refused to renew the lease. The lack of a renewal option, together with the prohibitively high rent of 5% of sales, were early business lessons to Walton. Despite forcing Walton out, Holmes bought the store's inventory and fixtures for $50,000, which Walton called "a fair price".[13]




Walton's Five and Dime, now the Wal-Mart Visitors Center, Bentonville.


With a year left on the lease, but the store effectively sold, he, his wife Helen and his father-in-law managed to negotiate the purchase of a new location on the downtown square of Bentonville, Arkansas. Walton negotiated the purchase of a small discount store, and the title to the building, on the condition that he get a 99-year lease to expand into the shop next door. The owner of the shop next door refused six times, and Walton gave up on Bentonville when his father-in-law, without Sam's knowledge, paid the shop owner a final visit and $20,000 to secure the lease. He had just enough left from the sale of the first store to close the deal, and reimburse Helen's father. They opened for business with a one-day remodeling sale on May 9, 1950.[12]
Before he bought the Bentonville store, it was doing $72,000 in sales and it increased to $105,000 in the first year and then $140,000 and $175,000.[14]
A chain of Ben Franklin stores[edit]
With the new Bentonville "Five and Dime" opening for business, and 220 miles away, a year left on the lease in Newport, the money-strapped young Walton had to learn to delegate responsibility.[15][16]
After succeeding with two stores at such a distance (and with the postwar baby boom in full effect), Sam became enthusiastic about scouting more locations and opening more Ben Franklin franchises. (Also, having spent countless hours behind the wheel, and with his close brother James "Bud" Walton having been a pilot in the war, he decided to buy a small second-hand airplane. Both he and his son John would later become accomplished pilots and log thousands of hours scouting locations and expanding the family business.)[15]
In 1954, he opened a store with his brother Bud in a shopping center in Ruskin Heights, a suburb of Kansas City, Missouri. With the help of his brother and father-in-law, Sam went on to open many new variety stores. He encouraged his managers to invest and take an equity stake in the business, often as much as $1000 in their store, or the next outlet to open.

The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

I've seen articles suggesting that Wal-Mart buys at prices lower than our competitors', and that this gives Wal-Mart an unfair advantage. I don't believe it... What we hear is concern that in some circumstances, Wal-Mart may actually be paying more than our competitors.
