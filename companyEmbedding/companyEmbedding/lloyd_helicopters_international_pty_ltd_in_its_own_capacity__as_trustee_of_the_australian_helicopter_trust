OPINION OF KING & WOOD MALLESONS

<![CDATA[Opinion of King & Wood Mallesons]]>
Exhibit 5.6  To:  28 March 2012  CHC Helicopter S.A.  4740 Agar Drive  Richmond, BC V7B 1A3,  CANADA  CHC Helicopter S.A. (Issuer)  Registration Statement on Form S-4
(Registration Statement) in respect of the registration of US$1,100,000,000 Senior Secured Notes 2020 (Exchange Notes)  We refer to the Registration Statement in respect of which we have acted as the Issuers legal advisers in New South Wales (New South Wales) and the Commonwealth of Australia
(Australia) (together the Relevant Jurisdictions). The Registration Statement relates to the registration under the Securities Act of 1933 (USA) of the Exchange Notes and the guarantee of the Exchange Notes by,
among others, the Guarantors (as defined below).  In this opinion, Guarantors means Lloyd Off-Shore Helicopters Pty Ltd
(ACN 007 970 934), Lloyd Helicopters Pty Ltd (ACN 007 916 912), Lloyd Helicopters Services Pty Ltd (ACN 058 277 491), Lloyd Bass Strait Helicopters Pty Ltd (ACN 007 975 304) and Lloyd Helicopters International Pty Ltd in its own capacity and as
trustee of the Australian Helicopters Trust (ACN 008 284 982) and Guarantor means any one of them.  This opinion relates
only to the laws of the Relevant Jurisdictions and is given on the basis that it will be construed in accordance with the laws of New South Wales whose law is to govern interpretation of this opinion. We express no opinion about the laws of another
jurisdiction or (except as expressly provided in paragraph 4) factual matters.   


1
Documents  We have
examined copies (certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction) of the following documents relating to the Exchange Notes:   


 
(a)
the Registration Statement; and   


 
(b)
the Indenture dated 4 October 2010 (the Indenture) between, amongst others, the Issuer and the Trustee (as defined therein);











CHC Helicopter S.A.
 

 
 28 March 2012
   


 
(c)
the powers of attorney (Powers of Attorney) given by each Guarantor dated 1 October 2010; 
 


 
(d)
the constitution of each Guarantor;   


 
(e)
extracts of the minutes evidencing the resolutions of the boards of directors of each Guarantor dated 1 October 2010 respectively authorising the signing, delivery
and observance of obligations under the Documents; and   


 
(f)
the Australian Helicopter Trust Deed (the Trust Deed) (and the trust constituted by and under the Trust Deed, the Trust).
 In this opinion the expression Documents means the documents listed in paragraphs
(a) and (b) above and laws means the common law, principles of equity and laws constituted or evidenced by documents available to the public generally. 
In addition to the Documents, we have examined all other documents we deemed necessary to render this opinion. 
 


2
Assumptions  We have
assumed:   


 
(a)
the authenticity of all signatures, seals, duty stamps and markings;   


 
(b)
the completeness, and conformity to originals, of all documents submitted to us; 
 


 
(c)
that:   


 
(i)
each Power of Attorney and all authorisations specified above remain in full force and effect; and 
 


 
(ii)
all authorisations required for any party (other than the Guarantors) to enter into the Documents have been obtained and remain in full force and effect;
  


 
(d)
that the Documents have been or will be executed by duly authorised signatories and delivered outside Australia in the form which we have examined;
  


 
(e)
that the Documents have been or will be duly authorised by the parties to them (other than the Guarantors) and constitute valid and binding obligations of all the
parties to them under all relevant laws (including the laws of the Relevant Jurisdictions except insofar as they affect the obligations of the Guarantors); 
 


 
(f)
that the Exchange Notes will be issued on the terms and conditions set out in the Indenture; 
  Page 2











CHC Helicopter S.A.
 

 
 28 March 2012
   


 
(g)
that all the provisions in the Documents have been strictly complied with and all distribution and selling restrictions will be strictly complied with;
  


 
(h)
that:   


 
(i)
the resolutions of the boards of directors were properly passed (including that any meeting convened was properly convened); 
 


 
(ii)
all directors who participated and voted were entitled so to do;   


 
(iii)
the directors have properly performed their duties in connection with the passing of the resolutions, and the entry by each Guarantor into the Documents to which it is
a party and the transactions contemplated by them; and   


 
(iv)
all provisions relating to the declaration of directors interests or the power of interested directors to vote were duly observed, 
but there is nothing in the searches referred to in paragraph 3 or on the face of the extract of the minutes referred to in paragraph 1(i)
that would lead us to believe otherwise. In any event, we note that you may rely on the assumptions specified in section 129 of the Corporations Act 2001 of Australia (Corporations Act) unless you know or suspect that the
assumptions are incorrect. In particular, sections 129(5) & (6) permit the assumption to be made that a document has been duly executed by a company if it appears to have been executed in accordance with section 127 by two people who,
according to certain documents filed by the company with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC), are a director and secretary or two directors of the company. 
We have relied on the searches referred to in paragraph 3 to confirm that the persons who executed the relevant Power of Attorney were
directors of the relevant Guarantor;   


 
(i)
that the obligations assumed by each Guarantor under the Documents are in its best interests and for the purposes of its business; 
 


 
(j)
immediately following execution of the Documents each Guarantor was solvent; 
 


 
(k)
that, if an obligation is to be performed in a jurisdiction outside Australia, its performance will not be contrary to an official directive, impossible or illegal
under the law of that jurisdiction;   


 
(l)
that no party enters into any Document in the capacity of a trustee of any trust other than Lloyd Helicopters International Pty Ltd (ACN 008 284 982) in its capacity as
trustee of the Trust; 
  Page 3











CHC Helicopter S.A.
 

 
 28 March 2012
   


 
(m)
if a Guarantor enters into any Document in the capacity of a trustee of any trust: 
 


 
(i)
that the trust has been duly established; and   


 
(ii)
that it is the only trustee of the trust at the time it executes the Document; and 
 


 
(iii)
that it has been validly appointed as trustee of the trust and no action has been taken or proposed to remove it as trustee of the trust; and 
 


 
(iv)
that the Trust Deed discloses all of the terms of the trust; and   


 
(v)
that no action has been taken or proposed to terminate the trust; and   


 
(vi)
that it has not exercised its powers under the Trust Deed to release, abandon or restrict any power conferred on it by the Trust Deed; and 
 


 
(n)
that no transaction in connection with the Documents constitutes an insolvent transaction or an unfair loan within the meaning of sections 588FC or 588FD respectively
of the Corporations Act;   


 
(o)
that no party has contravened or will contravene the prohibitions on related party transactions in sections 208 or 209 of the Corporations Act by entering into any
Document or a transaction in connection with any Document (including the issuance and subscription of any Exchange Notes);   


 
(p)
that the Code of Banking Practice does not apply to the Documents; and   


 
(q)
that no person has been, or will be, engaged in conduct that is unconscionable, dishonest, misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive.
 We have not taken any steps to verify the assumptions stated above. 
 


3
Searches  We have
examined an extract of company information for each of the Guarantors obtained from ASIC in Sydney on 18 January 2012. These records are not necessarily complete or up to date. We have not made any other searches.

4
Opinion  On the foregoing
basis and subject to the qualifications set out below, we are of the opinion that:   


 
(a)
each Guarantor is incorporated and validly existing under the laws of Australia and is capable of suing and being sued in its corporate name; 
 


 
(b)
each Guarantor has:   


 
(i)
the corporate power to enter into the relevant Power of Attorney and each Document to which it is a party and to observe its obligations under them; and
  


 
(ii)
taken all corporate action required on its part to authorise the execution, delivery and observance of them; 
 


 
(c)
if a Guarantor enters into any Document in the capacity of a trustee of any trust, it has: 
 


 
(i)
the power in its capacity as trustee to enter into the Document and to observe its obligations under it; and 
 


 
(ii)
taken all action required on its part under the Trust Deed and the laws in force in the Relevant Jurisdictions to authorise the execution, delivery and observance of
its obligations under it;   


 
(d)
the execution and delivery by or on behalf of each of each Guarantor of the Documents and the issue of the Exchange Notes and the observance of its obligations under

its constitution; or   


 
(ii)
the Trust Deed;   


 
(e)
each authorisation necessary under the laws in force in the Relevant Jurisdictions for each Guarantor to enter into the Documents and observe obligations under them and
observe obligations under them has been obtained; and

Qualifications  This
opinion is subject to the following qualifications:   


 
(a)
the nature and enforcement of obligations may be affected by lapse of time, failure to take action or laws (including, without limitation, laws relating to bankruptcy,
insolvency, liquidation, receivership, administration, reorganisation, reconstruction, fraudulent transfer or moratoria), certain equitable remedies and defences generally affecting creditors rights; 
 


 
(b)
a creditors rights may be affected by a specific court order obtained under laws and defences generally affecting creditors rights;
  


 
(c)
the rights of a party to a Document (other than the Guarantors) to enforce its rights under the Documents may be limited or affected by: 
 


 
(i)
breaches by that party of its obligations under the Document, or misrepresentations made by it in, or in connection with, the Document; or 
 


 
(ii)
conduct of that party in relation to the Document which is unlawful including without limitation the failure to hold an Australian financial services licence if
required to do so or the failure to comply with obligations in connection with that licence;   


 
(iii)
conduct of that party in relation to the Document which gives rise to an estoppel or claim against that party by the party against whom it is seeking to enforce its
rights under the Document;   


 
(d)
an unsecured creditors right of recourse to trust assets to satisfy a trustees liability depends on the availability of the trustees right of
indemnity out of those assets (and each creditors right of subrogation to the trustees right of indemnity). The trustees right of indemnity may be not available to the extent that the liability was not properly incurred or the
trustee is, or has been, in breach of trust (including an existing or future breach which is not related to the transactions contemplated by the Documents); 
 


 
(e)
the beneficiaries of a trust who have full legal capacity and whose interests have vested may terminate the trust and require the trustee to transfer the trust property
to them (or as they direct) despite any provision to the contrary in the documents creating or evidencing the trust, or any other document However, a trustee has a right to be indemnified out of, and an equitable lien over, trust assets in respect
of debts and liabilities properly incurred by it as trustee, and those rights normally have priority over the claims of the beneficiaries. This priority benefits the creditors in respect of those debts and liabilities if and to the extent they are
entitled to be subrogated to that right of indemnity and lien. These outcomes assume no disentitling conduct on the part of the trustee or a relevant creditor; 
 


 
(f)
the availability of certain equitable remedies (including, without limitation, injunctions and specific performance) is at the discretion of a court in the Relevant
Jurisdictions;

(g)
an obligation to pay an amount may be unenforceable if the amount is held to constitute a penalty; 
 


 
(h)
a provision that a statement, opinion, determination or other matter is final and conclusive will not necessarily prevent judicial enquiry into the merits of a claim by
an aggrieved party;   


 
(i)
the laws of the Relevant Jurisdictions may require that:   


 
(i)
parties act reasonably and in good faith in their dealings with each other; 
 


 
(ii)
discretions are exercised reasonably; and

opinions are based on good faith;

the question whether a provision of a Document which is invalid or unenforceable may be severed from other provisions is determined at the discretion of a court in the
Relevant Jurisdictions;   


 
(k)
an indemnity for legal costs may be unenforceable;   


 
(l)
we express no opinion as to:   


 
(i)
provisions precluding oral amendments or waivers;   


 
(ii)
the revenue consequences of the Exchange Notes being transferred between participants in the secondary market in Australia as this will depend, among other things, on
the identity of the transferor and the transferee; or   


 
(iii)
Australian tax law;   


 
(iv)
whether a judgment for a monetary amount would be given in a currency other than Australian dollars, although recent decisions of English Courts allowing judgments in a
foreign currency have been followed in the Courts of New South Wales; or   


 
(v)
the date on which a conversion from foreign currency would be made for the purpose of enforcing a judgment; 
 


 
(vi)
whether the assets of a trust are sufficient to satisfy the trustees right to be fully indemnified out of those assets in respect of obligations incurred by it
under the Documents to which it is a party and all other obligations in respect of which the trustee has a right to be indemnified out of those assets; 
  Page 7

 28 March 2012
   


 
(vii)
whether a court would determine that the exercise by the trustee of powers set out in the documents creating or evidencing that trust, was a valid exercise of those
powers for the benefit of the beneficiaries of that trust. Whilst the consent of all the beneficiaries of those trusts was obtained the consent of various potential beneficiaries was not; 
 


 
(viii)
the accuracy, completeness or suitability of any formula set out in any Document. If any formula is inaccurate, incomplete or unsuitable for the purpose of determining
the amounts or matters for which it has been included, then a court may find that the relevant formula is void for uncertainty;   


 
(m)
we express no opinion in relation to:   


 
(i)
any proposal to introduce or change a law, or any pending change in law;   


 
(ii)
any law which has been enacted and has not commenced, or if it has commenced, has not started to apply (including without limitation, the Personal Property Securities
Act 2009 and the Personal Property Securities (Consequential Amendments) Act 2009 of Australia);   


 
(iii)
any pending judgment, or the possibility of an appeal from a judgment, of any court; or 
 


 
(iv)
the implications of any of them;   


 
(n)
regulations in Australia restrict or prohibit payments, transactions and dealings with assets having a prescribed connection with certain countries or named individuals
or entities subject to international sanctions or associated with terrorism;   


 
(o)
a party entering into a Document may, in doing so, be acting, or later be held to have acted, in the capacity of a trustee under an undocumented or partially documented
constructive, implied or resulting trust which may have arisen as a consequence of that partys conduct;   


 
(p)
interest withholding tax at the rate of 10% may be payable in respect of payments of interest on overdue amounts and payments of interest or amounts in the nature of
interest by a Guarantor.  It is not clear whether payments by a Guarantor under its guarantee constitute payments
of interest or amounts in the nature of interest, but the better view is that such payments are not payments of interest or amounts in the nature of interest and as such no interest withholding tax should be payable in respect of such payments;
  


 
(q)
court proceedings may be stayed if the subject of the proceedings is concurrently before a court;

 28 March 2012
   


 
(r)
the enforceability of a guarantee may be affected by amendments to the guaranteed obligations if the guaranteed obligations do not remain within the general scope of
the guarantee;   


 
(s)
a court will not give effect to a currency indemnity, a choice of laws to govern the Documents or a submission to the jurisdiction of certain courts if to do so would
be contrary to public policy in the Relevant Jurisdictions. However, we express no opinion as to whether:   


 
(i)
a court will give effect to a choice of laws to govern the Documents to the extent that the choice of laws applies to non-contractual obligations arising out of, or in
connection with, the Documents (including, without limitation, non-contractual obligations within the meaning of Regulation No 864/2007 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 July 2007 on the law applicable to non-contractual
obligations (known as Rome II)); or   


 
(ii)
a foreign judgment in relation to a non-contractual obligation would be enforced in the Relevant Jurisdictions; 
 


 
(t)
a document may not be admissible in court proceedings unless applicable stamp duty has been paid; 
 


 
(u)
a payment made under mistake may be liable to restitution; and   


 
(v)
in order to enforce a foreign judgment in the Relevant Jurisdictions it may be necessary to establish that the judgment, if it is a non-money judgment, qualifies as one
of the relevant kinds of non-money judgment under the Foreign Judgments Act 1991 (Cwlth). It may be necessary to establish also that the judgment is for a fixed and certain sum of money and is not in the nature of a penalty or revenue debt and, if
raised by the judgment debtor, it may be necessary to establish that:   


 
(i)
the judgment debtor (or its duly appointed agent) received actual notice of the proceedings in sufficient time to contest the proceedings; 
 


 
(ii)
the judgment was not obtained by fraud or duress or in a manner contrary to natural justice or public policy in New South Wales; and 
 


 
(iii)
the subject matter of the proceedings giving rise to the judgment was not immovable property situated outside New York; and 
 


 
(w)
we express no opinion on whether goods and services tax is payable in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Documents.

OPINION OF MALLESONS STEPHEN JAQUES

Opinion of Mallesons Stephen Jaques
Exhibit 5.6  To:  18 January 2012  CHC Helicopter S.A.  4740 Agar Drive  Richmond, BC V7B 1A3,  CANADA  CHC Helicopter S.A. (Issuer)  Registration Statement on Form S-4
(Registration Statement) in respect of the registration of US$1,100,000,000 Senior Secured Notes 2020 (Exchange Notes)  We refer to the Registration Statement in respect of which we have acted as the Issuers legal advisers in New South Wales (New South Wales) and the Commonwealth of Australia
(Australia) (together the Relevant Jurisdictions). The Registration Statement relates to the registration under the Securities Act of 1933 (USA) of the Exchange Notes and the guarantee of the Exchange Notes by,
among others, the Guarantors (as defined below).  In this opinion, Guarantors means Lloyd Off-Shore Helicopters Pty Ltd
(ACN 007 970 934), Lloyd Helicopters Pty Ltd (ACN 007 916 912), Lloyd Helicopters Services Pty Ltd (ACN 058 277 491), Lloyd Bass Strait Helicopters Pty Ltd (ACN 007 975 304) and Lloyd Helicopters International Pty Ltd in its own capacity and as
trustee of the Australian Helicopters Trust (ACN 008 284 982) and Guarantor means any one of them.  This opinion relates
only to the laws of the Relevant Jurisdictions and is given on the basis that it will be construed in accordance with the laws of New South Wales whose law is to govern interpretation of this opinion. We express no opinion about the laws of another
jurisdiction or (except as expressly provided in paragraph 4) factual matters. Where we have referred in this opinion to our state of knowledge in connection with any circumstance, transaction or other matter, save as expressly otherwise indicated,
our knowledge relates only to the actual state of knowledge as at the date of this opinion of Richard Hayes (a partner of Mallesons Stephen Jaques) and Will Stawell (an employee of Mallesons Stephen Jaques) (Acting Persons).

examined copies (certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction) of the following documents relating to the Exchange Notes:   


 
(a)
the Registration Statement; and   


 
(b)
the Indenture dated 4 October 2010 (the Indenture) between, amongst others, the Issuer and the Trustee (as defined therein);











CHC Helicopter S.A.
 

 
 18 January 2012
   


 
(c)
the powers of attorney (Powers of Attorney) given by each Guarantor dated 1 October 2010; 
 


 
(d)
the constitution of each Guarantor;   


 
(e)
extracts of the minutes evidencing the resolutions of the boards of directors of each Guarantor dated 1 October 2010 respectively authorising the signing, delivery
and observance of obligations under the Documents; and   


 
(f)
the Australian Helicopter Trust Deed (the Trust Deed) (and the trust constituted by and under the Trust Deed, the Trust).
 In this opinion the expression Documents means the documents listed in paragraphs
(a) and (b) above and laws means the common law, principles of equity and laws constituted or evidenced by documents available to the public generally. 
 


2
Assumptions  We have
assumed:   


 
(a)
the authenticity of all signatures, seals, duty stamps and markings;   


 
(b)
the completeness, and conformity to originals, of all documents submitted to us; 
 


 
(c)
that:   


 
(i)
each Power of Attorney and all authorisations specified above remain in full force and effect; and 
 


 
(ii)
all authorisations required for any party (other than the Guarantors) to enter into the Documents have been obtained and remain in full force and effect;
  


 
(d)
that the Documents have been or will be executed by duly authorised signatories and delivered outside Australia in the form which we have examined;
  


 
(e)
that the Documents have been or will be duly authorised by the parties to them (other than the Guarantors) and constitute valid and binding obligations of all the
parties to them under all relevant laws (including the laws of the Relevant Jurisdictions except insofar as they affect the obligations of the Guarantors); 
 


 
(f)
that the Exchange Notes will be issued on the terms and conditions set out in the Indenture; 
  Page 2











CHC Helicopter S.A.
 

 
 18 January 2012
   


 
(g)
that all the provisions in the Documents have been strictly complied with and all distribution and selling restrictions will be strictly complied with;
  


 
(h)
that:   


 
(i)
the resolutions of the boards of directors were properly passed (including that any meeting convened was properly convened); 
 


 
(ii)
all directors who participated and voted were entitled so to do;   


 
(iii)
the directors have properly performed their duties in connection with the passing of the resolutions, and the entry by each Guarantor into the Documents to which it is
a party and the transactions contemplated by them; and   


 
(iv)
all provisions relating to the declaration of directors interests or the power of interested directors to vote were duly observed, 
but there is nothing in the searches referred to in paragraph 3 or on the face of the extract of the minutes referred to in paragraph 1(i)
that would lead us to believe otherwise. In any event, we note that you may rely on the assumptions specified in section 129 of the Corporations Act 2001 of Australia (Corporations Act) unless you know or suspect that the
assumptions are incorrect. In particular, sections 129(5) & (6) permit the assumption to be made that a document has been duly executed by a company if it appears to have been executed in accordance with section 127 by two people who,
according to certain documents filed by the company with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC), are a director and secretary or two directors of the company. 
We have relied on the searches referred to in paragraph 3 to confirm that the persons who executed the relevant Power of Attorney were
directors of the relevant Guarantor;   


 
(i)
that the obligations assumed by each Guarantor under the Documents are in its best interests and for the purposes of its business; 
 


 
(j)
immediately following execution of the Documents each Guarantor was solvent; 
 


 
(k)
that, if an obligation is to be performed in a jurisdiction outside Australia, its performance will not be contrary to an official directive, impossible or illegal
under the law of that jurisdiction;   


 
(l)
that no party enters into any Document in the capacity of a trustee of any trust other than Lloyd Helicopters International Pty Ltd (ACN 008 284 982) in its capacity as
trustee of the Trust; 
  Page 3











CHC Helicopter S.A.
 

 
 18 January 2012
   


 
(m)
if a Guarantor enters into any Document in the capacity of a trustee of any trust: 
 


 
(i)
that the trust has been duly established; and   


 
(ii)
that it is the only trustee of the trust at the time it executes the Document; and 
 


 
(iii)
that it has been validly appointed as trustee of the trust and no action has been taken or proposed to remove it as trustee of the trust; and 
 


 
(iv)
that the Trust Deed discloses all of the terms of the trust; and   


 
(v)
that no action has been taken or proposed to terminate the trust; and   


 
(vi)
that it has not exercised its powers under the Trust Deed to release, abandon or restrict any power conferred on it by the Trust Deed; and 
 


 
(n)
that no transaction in connection with the Documents constitutes an insolvent transaction or an unfair loan within the meaning of sections 588FC or 588FD respectively
of the Corporations Act;   


 
(o)
that no party has contravened or will contravene the prohibitions on related party transactions in sections 208 or 209 of the Corporations Act by entering into any
Document or a transaction in connection with any Document (including the issuance and subscription of any Exchange Notes);   


 
(p)
that the Code of Banking Practice does not apply to the Documents; and   


 
(q)
that no person has been, or will be, engaged in conduct that is unconscionable, dishonest, misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive.
 We have not taken any steps to verify the assumptions stated above and assume, with respect to each addressee of
this opinion, that that addressee does not know or suspect that any of those assumptions is incorrect. However, without making specific enquiries beyond the steps which are stated in this opinion, none of the Acting Persons has actual knowledge as
at the date of this opinion that any of those assumptions is incorrect.   


3
Searches  We have
examined an extract of company information for each of the Guarantors obtained from ASIC in Sydney on 18 January 2012. These records are not necessarily complete or up to date. We have not made any other searches.

Opinion  On the foregoing
basis and subject to the qualifications set out below, we are of the opinion that:   


 
(a)
each Guarantor is incorporated and validly existing under the laws of Australia and is capable of suing and being sued in its corporate name; 
 


 
(b)
each Guarantor has:   


 
(i)
the corporate power to enter into the relevant Power of Attorney and each Document to which it is a party and to observe its obligations under them; and
  


 
(ii)
taken all corporate action required on its part to authorise the execution, delivery and observance of them; 
 


 
(c)
if a Guarantor enters into any Document in the capacity of a trustee of any trust, it has: 
 


 
(i)
the power in its capacity as trustee to enter into the Document and to observe its obligations under it; and 
 


 
(ii)
taken all action required on its part under the Trust Deed and the laws in force in the Relevant Jurisdictions to authorise the execution, delivery and observance of
its obligations under it;   


 
(d)

them has not violated and will not contravene:   


 
(i)
its constitution; or   


 
(ii)
the Trust Deed;   


 
(e)
each authorisation necessary under the laws in force in the Relevant Jurisdictions for each Guarantor to enter into the Documents and observe obligations under them and
observe obligations under them has been obtained; and   


 
(f)
no Guarantor enjoys any immunity from suit in the Relevant Jurisdictions nor are their assets exempt from executions.

Qualifications  This
opinion is subject to the following qualifications:   


 
(a)
the nature and enforcement of obligations may be affected by lapse of time, failure to take action or laws (including, without limitation, laws relating to bankruptcy,
insolvency, liquidation, receivership, administration, reorganisation, reconstruction, fraudulent transfer or moratoria), certain equitable remedies and defences generally affecting creditors rights; 
 


 
(b)
a creditors rights may be affected by a specific court order obtained under laws and defences generally affecting creditors rights;
  


 
(c)
the rights of a party to a Document (other than the Guarantors) to enforce its rights under the Documents may be limited or affected by: 
 


 
(i)
breaches by that party of its obligations under the Document, or misrepresentations made by it in, or in connection with, the Document; or 
 


 
(ii)
conduct of that party in relation to the Document which is unlawful including without limitation the failure to hold an Australian financial services licence if
required to do so or the failure to comply with obligations in connection with that licence;   


 
(iii)
conduct of that party in relation to the Document which gives rise to an estoppel or claim against that party by the party against whom it is seeking to enforce its
rights under the Document;   


 
(d)
an unsecured creditors right of recourse to trust assets to satisfy a trustees liability depends on the availability of the trustees right of
indemnity out of those assets (and each creditors right of subrogation to the trustees right of indemnity). The trustees right of indemnity may be not available to the extent that the liability was not properly incurred or the
trustee is, or has been, in breach of trust (including an existing or future breach which is not related to the transactions contemplated by the Documents); 
 


 
(e)
the beneficiaries of a trust who have full legal capacity and whose interests have vested may terminate the trust and require the trustee to transfer the trust property
to them (or as they direct) despite any provision to the contrary in the documents creating or evidencing the trust, or any other document However, a trustee has a right to be indemnified out of, and an equitable lien over, trust assets in respect
of debts and liabilities properly incurred by it as trustee, and those rights normally have priority over the claims of the beneficiaries. This priority benefits the creditors in respect of those debts and liabilities if and to the extent they are
entitled to be subrogated to that right of indemnity and lien. These outcomes assume no disentitling conduct on the part of the trustee or a relevant creditor; 
 


 
(f)
the availability of certain equitable remedies (including, without limitation, injunctions and specific performance) is at the discretion of a court in the Relevant
Jurisdictions;

(l)
we express no opinion as to:   


 
(i)
provisions precluding oral amendments or waivers;

the identity of the transferor and the transferee; or

whether a judgment for a monetary amount would be given in a currency other than Australian dollars, although recent decisions of English Courts allowing judgments in a

whether a court would determine that the exercise by the trustee of powers set out in the documents creating or evidencing that trust, was a valid exercise of those
powers for the benefit of the beneficiaries of that trust. Whilst the consent of all the beneficiaries of those trusts was obtained the consent of various potential beneficiaries was not;

any pending judgment, or the possibility of an appeal from a judgment, of any court; or 
 


 
(iv)
the implications of any of them;

a court will not give effect to a currency indemnity, a choice of laws to govern the Documents or a submission to the jurisdiction of certain courts if to do so would
be contrary to public policy in the Relevant Jurisdictions. However, we express no opinion as to whether:

9.250% Senior Secured Notes due 2020
��

 Dear Sirs, 
We, Van Doorne N.V., have acted as special legal advisers to CHC Holding NL B.V., CHC Netherlands B.V., CHC Hoofddorp B.V., CHC Den Helder B.V., Capital
Aviation Services B.V., Heli-One (Netherlands) B.V. and Heli-One Defence B.V. (together referred to as the �Dutch Companies� and each as a �Dutch Company�) for the purpose of rendering a legal opinion on certain
matters of Dutch law in connection with a Registration Statement on Form S-4 (the �Registration Statement�), to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the �SEC�) with respect to the exchange offer to
the holders of the $1,100,000,000 9.250% Senior Secured Notes due 2020 (the �Outstanding Notes�), issued by CHC Helicopter S.A. (the �Issuer�) and guaranteed by inter alia the Dutch Companies under an
Indenture, dated 4�October 2010 made by and between amongst others the Issuer and the Dutch Companies as Guarantors, the other guarantors parties thereto and The Bank of New York Mellon as the Trustee (the �Indenture�), to
issue under the Indenture in exchange for the Outstanding Notes, $1,100,000,000 9.250% Senior Secured Notes due 2020 (the �Exchange Notes�).  Unless otherwise defined in this legal opinion (including the Schedule) or unless the context otherwise requires, words and expressions defined in the Indenture will have the same meaning when used in
this legal opinion.  For the purpose of this legal opinion we have examined and relied on the documents listed in the Schedule (together the
�Documents�) and such other documents as we in our absolute discretion have deemed relevant.  In connection with our
examination and in giving the opinions expressed below we have assumed:  �


a)
the genuineness of the signatures on the Documents, the authenticity and completeness of the Documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to the original
documents of any Documents submitted to us as drafts, (electronic or hard) copies or translations and the authenticity and completeness of the original documents;

�
18.01.12 �


b)
the due incorporation, valid existence and good standing (where such concept is relevant) and the corporate power and authority of, the due authorisation and execution
of the Indenture by, each of the parties thereto (other than the Dutch Companies) under any applicable law;  �


c)
the due compliance with all matters of, and the validity, binding effect and enforceability of the Indenture under, any applicable law (other than Dutch law) and in any
jurisdiction (other than the Netherlands) in which any obligation under the Indenture is to be performed;  �


d)
that (1)�no defects (gebreken) attach to the formation (totstandkoming) of each Dutch Company and that the Deeds of Incorporation have been signed by
a Dutch civil-law notary (notaris) on the basis of a valid certificate of no-objection (verklaring van geen bezwaar), (2)�the Corporate Resolutions and the powers of attorney granted therein have been validly adopted and have not
been revoked and (3)�the Extracts and the factual confirmations contained in the Corporate Resolutions accurately and completely reflect the matters purported to be evidenced thereby; 
�


e)
that (1)�no resolution for the dissolution (ontbinding) of any Dutch Company has been taken, no application has been made for the bankruptcy
(faillissement) or the (provisional) suspension of payments (surs�ance van betaling) of any Dutch Company, (2)�no Dutch Company has been dissolved or has been declared bankrupt or granted a (provisional) suspension of
payments in The Netherlands, (3)�no foreign insolvency proceedings have commenced in respect of any Dutch Company and (4)�no order for the administration of assets of any Dutch Company has been made; although not constituting conclusive
evidence thereof, the assumption referred to under (2)�is supported by the Extract and by information obtained on-line from the Dutch Insolvency Register (Centraal Insolventieregister) on the date hereof; 
�


f)
that any foreign law which may be applied under the The Hague Convention on the Law applicable to Agency of 14�March 1978 does not affect the authority contained
in the Management Board Resolutions and the powers of attorney granted therein;  �


g)
that at the time of execution of the Indenture, save for CHC Hoofddorp B.V. and Heli-One (Netherlands) B.V., no Dutch Company had established a works council
(ondernemingsraad) under or pursuant to the Works Councils Act (Wet op de ondernemingsraden) and that - other than Messrs Hughes, El Hamdani and De Zwart as elected members of a works council of CHC Hoofddorp B.V. and Heli-One
(Netherlands) B.V. jointly - no works council was authorised to render advice or was required to be consulted with respect to any transactions contemplated by the Indenture; 
�


h)
that none of the parties to the Indenture is subject to, controlled by or otherwise connected with a person, organisation or country which is subject to United Nations,
European Union or Dutch sanctions implemented or effective in the Netherlands under or pursuant to the Sanction Act 1977 (Sanctiewet 1977), the Economic Offences Act (Wet economische delicten), the General Customs Act (Algemene
Douanewet) or Regulations of the European Union;

i)
that (i)�the distribution of the Preliminary Prospectus, any documents forming part thereof and any other documents or information relating to the Issuer and/or
the Notes and (ii)�any offers, announcements of offers, sales, transfers and deliveries of the Notes, will be made in conformity with the provisions of the Registration Statement, the Notes and the Preliminary Prospectus, including, without
limitation, the selling restrictions set out therein and that the Issuer otherwise complies with the requirements of the Financial Supervision Act (Wet op het financieel toezicht) and the regulations promulgated thereunder;
 �


j)
that there are no contractual or other restrictions or requirements binding on any Dutch Company in relation to the Indenture, other than such restrictions or
requirements as may be contained in its articles of association; and  �


k)
that any foreign law which may apply with respect to any of the Documents or the transactions contemplated thereby does not affect this legal opinion.
 This legal opinion is given only with respect to Dutch law in force as at the date hereof and as applied and generally
interpreted on the basis of case-law published as at the date hereof. We do not express any opinion on matters of fact or the completeness or accuracy of the representations or warranties contained in or made pursuant to the Indenture. In addition,
we do not express any opinion on matters of foreign law, international law (including the law of the European Union), tax law (except for any specific tax opinions contained herein) and anti-trust and competition law. No opinion is given on
commercial, accounting or non-legal matters or on the ability of the parties to meet their financial or other obligations under the Indenture. We do not assume any obligation to advise you (or any other person entitled to rely on this legal opinion)
of subsequent changes in Dutch law or in the interpretation thereof.  Based on and subject to the foregoing and subject to the qualifications
set out below and matters of fact, documents or events not disclosed to us, we express the following opinions:  �


1
Each Dutch Company is duly incorporated and is validly existing under Dutch law as a private company with limited liability (besloten vennootschap met beperkte
aansprakelijkheid).  �


2
Each Dutch Company has the corporate power and authority to execute the Indenture and to perform its obligations thereunder. 
�


3
Each Dutch Company has taken all corporate action necessary to authorise the execution of the Indenture and the performance of its obligations thereunder.
 �


4
The Indenture has been duly signed on behalf of each Dutch Company that is a party thereto. 
�


5
No authorisations, consents, approvals, licences or exemptions from governmental, judicial or public bodies or authorities in The Netherlands are required for the
execution of the Indenture by each Dutch Company.  �


6
The execution by each Dutch Company of the Indenture does not conflict with or result in a violation of any existing provision of, or rule or regulation under, company
law of The Netherlands.

 18.01.12 �
The opinions expressed above are subject to the following qualifications: 
�


(A)
Our opinions expressed herein are subject to and limited by applicable Dutch or foreign bankruptcy, suspension of payment, insolvency, reorganisation and other laws
relating to or affecting the rights of creditors or secured creditors generally.  �


(B)
We express no opinion on (i)�the effect of any authority to appoint an administrative receiver or other similar official in respect of a Dutch Company or any of
its assets, (ii)�any obligation of a Dutch Company to hold monies or any other assets in trust for and on behalf of third parties and (iii)�the enforceability in the Netherlands of provisions pursuant to which moneys or goods are held in
trust by one party for another party.  �


(C)
To the extent Dutch law applies, provisions to the effect that the Trustee may initiate proceedings or file proofs of claims for the benefit of all Holders, without
such Holders having to become a party to such proceedings or making a filing on their own behalf may not be enforceable in all circumstances.  �


(D)
Under the Dutch rules of corporate benefit, financial assistance and fraudulent preference, the validity of a transaction (such as the execution of an agreement or the
giving of guarantees or security) entered into by a Dutch company may be contested. In particular:  �


�
a)
the validity of a transaction entered into by a Dutch company may be contested by that Dutch company or the public receiver (curator) in its bankruptcy, if as a
result its objects (doel) are transgressed and the counter-party was aware of the transgression or, without personal investigation, should have been so aware; 
�


�
b)
it is prohibited for a Dutch company and any of its Dutch and foreign subsidiaries to give guarantees or security or to act as joint and several debtor or to make loans
(unless in case of a private company with limited liability the loans do not exceed the amount of the freely distributable reserves of the company and the making of loans is permitted under its articles of association) for the purpose of the
subscription or other acquisition by third parties of shares in that Dutch company or of depositary receipts issued in exchange for these shares; and  �


�
c)
if a transaction entered into by a Dutch company is prejudicial to the interests of its creditors, the validity of such transaction may in certain circumstances be
contested by such creditors or the public receiver in the bankruptcy of that Dutch company.  �


(E)
Our opinions expressed herein in respect of the Corporate Resolutions may be affected by the rules of good faith (redelijkheid en billijkheid).
 �


(F)
A power of attorney granted by a Dutch Company will automatically terminate upon the bankruptcy and become ineffective upon the (provisional) suspension of payments of
such Dutch Company. This may also affect the validity of the appointment of a process agent by such Dutch Company.

(G)
Pursuant to the Financial Supervision Act persons, firms or companies (regardless of where they are domiciled) may only provide intermediary services in the Netherlands
in respect of the Notes (which includes the placement of the Notes) if they are licensed by the Netherlands Authority for the Financial Markets (Autoriteit Financi�le Markten) or exempt from such license requirement.
 This legal opinion is strictly limited to the matters stated herein, may not be read by implication as extending to matters not
specifically referred to and may only be relied upon in connection with transactions contemplated by the Registration Statement. This legal opinion is given subject to, and may only be relied upon on, the express condition that (i)�Van Doorne
N.V. is the exclusive contracting party, (ii)�in respect of Dutch legal concepts, which are expressed in this legal opinion in English terms, the original Dutch terms shall prevail, (iii)�this legal opinion shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, Dutch law and (iv)�all disputes arising from or in connection with this legal opinion shall be submitted to the exclusive jurisdiction of, and shall be exclusively decided by, the competent court in Amsterdam,
without prejudice to the right of appeal and appeal to the Supreme Court.  We hereby consent to the filing of this legal opinion as an exhibit
to the Registration Statement and to the reference to Van Doorne N.V under the caption �Legal Matters� in the prospectus included in the Registration Statement. In giving such consent, we do not admit that we come within the category of
persons whose consent is required under Section�7 of the U.S. Securities Act of 1933 or the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. We understand and agree that Simpson Thacher�& Bartlett LLP, counsel to the Issuer, may rely upon
this opinion as if it were an addressee hereof for the purpose of providing the opinion to be delivered by such firm in connection with the Registration Statement.  Yours faithfully,
