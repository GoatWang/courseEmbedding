Innovega Demonstrates Megapixel Contact Lens Eyewear

Commits to High-performance Designs for Augmented Reality (AR)*






Seattle, WA. (PRWEB)
January 10, 2012
 Innovega Inc., a developer of wearable displays that are free from usual bulky optics, announced today that it has demonstrated mega-pixel eyewear in a compact and stylish form-factor. Management now intends to accelerate delivery of designs, components and licenses to selected strategic partners. Innovega will be exhibiting at the 2012 International CES event from Booth # 73403 in the Ballroom at The Venetian Hotel. 
“Conventional mobile device screens are too small to read and certainly too small to enjoy. Over the past months we have demonstrated contact lens enabled eyewear for mobile devices including smartphones, portable game devices and media players that  deliver panoramic, high-resolution experiences for entertainment and planned Augmented Reality (AR)* applications”, said Steve Willey, Innovega CEO.  “During this same period, we collaborated with partners to finalize initial specifications of launch platforms”.
Willey added, “Unless the display industry can deliver transparent, high-performance and compact eyewear, developers of AR and other compelling media applications will simply fail to create the excitement that consumers crave and the functionality that professional users absolutely need”. 
Innovega’s new and natural interface comprises familiar, light-weight eyewear working with advanced contact lenses. One hundred million global consumers, including more than 20% of America’s 18 to 34 year-old, already wear contact lenses.   With low switching costs, Innovega expects many will join other early adopter groups who wish to access rich media while remaining fully involved in their real-world activities.  Management believes that consumers will be thrilled to wear and benefit from its new lens-based eyewear given the unique combination of benefits that this new interface offers. 
Innovega designers and partners considered the future of personal media, social networking, and mobile computing, and converged upon an aggressive design-point that meets today’s needs as well as demands of high-performance AR which require a see-through and panoramic display interface. Innovega refers to its innovative product as a ‘lifestyle interface‘, since consumers view their digital content in a way that is similar to how they see the world around them. By providing a transparent, fashionable, and comfortable interface that is consistent with today’s active lifestyles, the architecture also eliminates the social barrier that traditional opaque and bulky video eyewear seems to create. 
The Innovega iOptikTM architecture meets the demanding performance requirements of AR by eliminating the focusing optics that tend to limit the field of view of displayed media. Innovega replaces them with micro- and nano-fabricated optical elements that are integrated into otherwise conventional contact lenses. The recent demonstration of stylish, megapixel eyewear has proven the power of this proprietary architecture.
Innovega will provide the new system to media and consumer electronics OEMs who wish to design natural display interfaces that consumers want and need. Innovega believes that its new personal display interface will become an essential social media and entertainment accessory. 
  Augmented Reality - Definition from “Wikipedia”: Augmented reality (AR) is a live, direct or indirect, view of a physical, real-world environment whose elements are augmented by computer generated sensory input such as sound, video, graphics or GPS data … With the help of advanced AR technology (e.g. adding computer vision and object recognition) the information about the surrounding real-world of the user becomes interactive and digitally manipulatable. Artificial information about the environment and its objects can be overlaid on the real world.
About Innovega Inc.
Innovega provides components, core technology and reference designs that will enable its customers to develop generations of personal media eyewear. Innovega’s novel approach improves comfort, field of view, and styling by eliminating bulky and heavy focusing optics from the eyewear. At the same time, the use of a modern soft contact lens substantially improves the field of view and resolution of any digital media experience.  Innovega’s media eyewear is also transparent and therefore eliminates the social barrier that traditional wearable displays create.  Innovega maintains offices in Seattle, WA. and in San Diego, CA.

HTML title tags appear in browser tabs, bookmarks and in search results. It looks like your title tag is a little outside the ideal length. Since they are one of the most important on-page SEO elements you should make your title tags between 50 and 60 characters. Make sure each page has a unique title and use your most important keywords. For internal pages start your title tags with your most important keyword(s).

The meta description for innovega-inc.com is missing.Meta descriptions allow you to influence how your web pages are described and displayed in search results. A good description acts as a potential organic advertisement and encourages the viewer to click through to your site.Keep it short and to the point; the ideal meta description should be between 70 and 160 characters (spaces included).Ensure that each of your web pages have a unique meta description that is explicit and contains your most important keywords for each page. These keywords are especially important because they appear in bold when they match the user’s search query (See the Google Preview below).Check your Google Search Console (Search Appearance > HTML Improvements) for any warning messages to identify meta descriptions that are too long/short or duplicated across more than one page.

                                    This is a representation of what your Title Tag and Meta Description will look like in Google search results.Search engines may create their own titles and descriptions if they are missing, poorly written and/or not relevant to the content on the page and cut short if they go over the character limit. So it’s important to be clear, concise and within the suggested character limit.

Great, your website is structured using HTML headings (<H1> to <H6>).Use your keywords in the headings and make sure the first level (<H1>) includes your most important keywords. Never duplicate your title tag content in your header tag.While it is important to ensure every page has an <H1> tag, only include more than one per page if you're using HTML5. Instead, use multiple <H2> - <H6> tags.

Add the important keywords in <H> headings

Alternative text allows you to add a description to an image. Since search engine crawlers cannot see images, they rely on alternative text attributes to determine relevance to a search query. Alternative text also helps makes an image more likely to appear in a Google image search and is used by screen readers to provide context for visually impaired users.It looks like you're missing alternative text for 16 images on innovega-inc.com. Check the images on your website to make sure accurate and relevant alternative text is specified for each image on the page.Try to minimize the number of alt text characters to 150 or less (including spaces!) to optimize page load times.

A low number can indicate that bots are unable to discover your pages, which is commonly caused by bad site architecture & internal linking, or you're unknowingly preventing bots and search engines from crawling & indexing your pages. An unusually high number could be an indication of duplicate content due to URL parameters.Make sure your website's XML sitemap is present and that you've submitted it to the major search engines. Building backlinks to your website's internal pages will also help bots to discover, crawl and index them, while building authority to help them rank in search results at the same time.Check Index Status and Crawl Errors in Google Search Console to track the status of your crawled/indexed pages.If you use parameters in your URL like session IDs or sorting and filtering, use the rel="canonical" tag  tag to tell search engines which version of those pages is the original.

Links pass value from one page to another. This value is called 'link juice'.A page's link juice is split between all the links on that page so lots of unnecessary links on a page will dilute the value attributed to each link. There's no exact number of links to include on a page but best practice is to keep it under 200.Using the Nofollow attribute in your links prevents some link juice, but these links are still taken into account when calculating the value that is passed through each link, so using lots of NoFollow links can still dilute PageRank.

A robots.txt file allows you to restrict the access of search engine crawlers to prevent them from accessing specific pages or directories. They also point the web crawler to your page’s XML sitemap file.We checked innovega-inc.com/robots.txt didn't find a robots.txt file. Use Google Search Console to submit and test your robot.txt file. You can also test individual pages to make sure Google isn't crawling any restricted files.

We checked innovega-inc.com but couldn't find an XML sitemap.XML sitemaps contain the list of your URLs that are available to index and allows the search engines to read your pages more intelligently. They can also include information like your site’s latest updates, frequency of changes and the importance of URLs.Your site is currently missing an XML sitemap. We recommend you generate one for your site and submit it through both Google Search Console and Bing Webmaster Tools. Normally, your XML sitemap would be found at innovega-inc.com/sitemap.Make sure to only include the pages you want search engines to crawl, so leave out any that have been blocked in a robots.txt file. Avoid using any URLs that cause redirects or error codes and be consistent in using your preferred URLs (with or without www.), correct protocols (http vs. https) and trailing slashes. You should also use your robots.txt file to point search engine crawlers to the location of your sitemap.

Add and Optimize your XML sitemap






















                                      URL Parameters
                                    







      Good, the URLs look clean.
      
    


?

                                    URL parameters are used to track user behaviors on site (session IDs), traffic sources (referrer IDs) or to give users control over the content on the page (sorting and filtering). The issue with URL parameters is that Google sees each unique parameter value as a new URL hosting the same thing - meaning you could have a duplicate content problem. Sometimes, it’s able to recognize these URLs and group them together. It then algorithmically decides which URL is the best representation of the group and uses it to consolidate ranking signals and display in search results. You can help Google recognize the best URL by using the rel=”canonical” tag.Use the URL Parameters Tool in Google Search Console to tell Google how your URL parameters affect page content and how to to crawl URLs with parameters. Use this tool very carefully - you can easily prevent Google from crawling pages you want indexed through overly restrictive crawling settings, especially if you have URLs with multiple parameters.
                                    
                                
Rewrite your URLs and clean them up.

      Great, you are not using ‪underscores (these_are_underscores) in your URLs.
      
    


?

Great, you aren't using ‪underscores (these_are_underscores) in your URLs. Google sees hyphens as word separators while underscores aren't recognized. So the search engine sees www.example.com/green_dress as www.example.com/greendress. The bots will have a hard time determining this URL's relevance to a keyword.

Flash: No







Frames: No



?

Great, you aren't using Flash or frames on your site.While it often looks nicer, Flash content can't be properly indexed by search engines. Maximize your SEO efforts by avoiding Flash.Search engines also have problems with frames because they can't crawl or index the content within them. Avoid them if you can and use a NoFrames tag when you can't.

Your domain is the human-readable address of your website on the Internet. How long your domain name has been registered does have a limited impact on your rankings in search results. The newer your domain the harder it can be to achieve a higher rank. To help offset this, consider buying a second-hand domain name.Do you know that you can register your domain for up to 10 years? By doing so, you will show the world that you are serious about your business.
