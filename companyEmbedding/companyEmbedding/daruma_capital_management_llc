WHERE EVERY STOCK COUNTS







Who We Are

Founded in 1995, Daruma Capital Management invests in high-conviction small- and smid-cap portfolios of no more than 35 stocks. Our firm is 100% employee-owned and manages $1.78 billion for public and corporate pension plans, endowments, foundations and individuals.
We practice true active management by owning only our most compelling ideas. We buy stocks with the potential to go up 50% or more over the next two years, with a reward-to-risk ratio of three to one.
This strategy has resulted in outstanding small-cap long-term performance with average annual portfolio turnover of under 50%.
TRUE ACTIVE MANAGEMENTWe run concentrated portfolios because, in our experience, concentration works. A concentrated portfolio means that every stock has to earn its keep.A WILL TO WINAs a 100% employee-owned company, our destiny hinges on long-term investment results. We prefer to measure success by our investment track record rather than the amount of assets under management.OPEN DOOR POLICYOur clients tell us we are refreshingly honest in our updates. We believe that you have a right to speak to the investment team whenever you want, and we will always tell it to you straight.










 

Past performance is not a guarantee of future results. Many factors affect performance, including changes in market conditions and interest rates, as well as other economic, political and financial developments. You should not assume that investment decisions we make in the future will be profitable or will equal the investment performance of the past.
The portfolio is actively managed, so holdings, sector weightings and other portfolio characteristics may have changed since the date shown. They should not be considered recommendations to buy or sell any security or of a particular allocation. You should not presume that any holding or allocation shown has been or will be profitable. The information in the Small-Cap and SMid-Cap commentaries supplements the related Composite Presentations available on our website (click here for the Equity Composite Presentation: Small-Cap, here for the Equity Composite Presentation: SMid-Cap).
The information in each commentary is current as of the date of the commentary, and may have changed by the time you read this. Daruma has obtained some of the information in this presentation from third-party sources we believe to be accurate. However, we cannot guarantee the accuracy of such information.
Statements in any commentary that were not historical facts at the date of that commentary reflect our opinions, beliefs or expectations as of that date. Subsequent events will have, or may yet impact whether they prove to be correct.
Charts included in any commentary are included to demonstrate certain information or conclusions. You should not make any investment decision relying only on these charts.
The appropriate comparison benchmark for the Small-Cap Equity strategy is the Russell 2000. The Russell 2000 includes approximately 2000 of the smallest U.S. common stocks based on a combination of their market cap and current membership in the Russell 3000. The Russell 2000 Value Index includes those Russell 2000 Index companies with lower price-to-book ratios and lower forecasted growth values, while the Russell 2000 Growth Index includes those with higher price-to-value ratios and higher forecasted growth values.

How We Invest | Daruma Capital Management, LLC















































WHERE EVERY STOCK COUNTS








PhilosophyDaruma’s investment approach is defined by certain key beliefs:

A concentrated portfolio compels truly active management.
In any market we can find 25 to 35 stocks with strong potential to outperform.
The best time to buy is not just when a stock offers good value, but when we can clearly define what will drive the price higher — in most cases better-than-expected sales, earnings or cash flow growth.

ProcessManaging a portfolio where every stock counts means managing an investment process where every decision counts:
Step 1 – Screen Universe
Identify smid-cap and small-cap stocks that are undervalued and changing for the better.
Step 2 – Quantitative Analysis
Identify key drivers of past growth.
Step 3 – Qualitative Analysis
Identify key drivers of future growth.
Step 4 – Investment Thesis
Synthesize prior analysis into fundamental milestones.
Step 5 – Valuation
Define upside and downside price targets.
Step 6 – Weekly Review
Monitor and implement sell discipline in light of milestones, price targets, new opportunities and aggregate portfolio risk.
Portfolio ConstructionDaruma invests within a clear set of rules about portfolio concentration and diversification, valuation and the sell discipline — and, most important, rules about paying attention and acting decisively when necessary.
Our Portfolios Do Not Mirror the Benchmarks

We own no more than 35 high-conviction holdings and no less than 25
Sector exposure is capped at the greater of 25% or two times the benchmark weight
A position starts at 2.2%, is capped at 6%, and in practice rarely gets above 5%

Daruma Capital Management, LLC















































WHERE EVERY STOCK COUNTS







Who We Are

Founded in 1995, Daruma Capital Management invests in high-conviction small- and smid-cap portfolios of no more than 35 stocks. Our firm is 100% employee-owned and manages $1.78 billion for public and corporate pension plans, endowments, foundations and individuals.
We practice true active management by owning only our most compelling ideas. We buy stocks with the potential to go up 50% or more over the next two years, with a reward-to-risk ratio of three to one.
This strategy has resulted in outstanding small-cap long-term performance with average annual portfolio turnover of under 50%.
TRUE ACTIVE MANAGEMENTWe run concentrated portfolios because, in our experience, concentration works. A concentrated portfolio means that every stock has to earn its keep.A WILL TO WINAs a 100% employee-owned company, our destiny hinges on long-term investment results. We prefer to measure success by our investment track record rather than the amount of assets under management.OPEN DOOR POLICYOur clients tell us we are refreshingly honest in our updates. We believe that you have a right to speak to the investment team whenever you want, and we will always tell it to you straight.










 

Past performance is not a guarantee of future results. Many factors affect performance, including changes in market conditions and interest rates, as well as other economic, political and financial developments. You should not assume that investment decisions we make in the future will be profitable or will equal the investment performance of the past.
The portfolio is actively managed, so holdings, sector weightings and other portfolio characteristics may have changed since the date shown. They should not be considered recommendations to buy or sell any security or of a particular allocation. You should not presume that any holding or allocation shown has been or will be profitable. The information in the Small-Cap and SMid-Cap commentaries supplements the related Composite Presentations available on our website (click here for the Equity Composite Presentation: Small-Cap, here for the Equity Composite Presentation: SMid-Cap).
The information in each commentary is current as of the date of the commentary, and may have changed by the time you read this. Daruma has obtained some of the information in this presentation from third-party sources we believe to be accurate. However, we cannot guarantee the accuracy of such information.
Statements in any commentary that were not historical facts at the date of that commentary reflect our opinions, beliefs or expectations as of that date. Subsequent events will have, or may yet impact whether they prove to be correct.
Charts included in any commentary are included to demonstrate certain information or conclusions. You should not make any investment decision relying only on these charts.
The appropriate comparison benchmark for the Small-Cap Equity strategy is the Russell 2000. The Russell 2000 includes approximately 2000 of the smallest U.S. common stocks based on a combination of their market cap and current membership in the Russell 3000. The Russell 2000 Value Index includes those Russell 2000 Index companies with lower price-to-book ratios and lower forecasted growth values, while the Russell 2000 Growth Index includes those with higher price-to-value ratios and higher forecasted growth values.
The appropriate comparison benchmark for the SMid-Cap Equity strategy is the Russell 2500. The Russell 2500 includes approximately 2500 of the smallest U.S. common stocks based on a combination of their market cap and current membership in the Russell 3000. The Russell 2500 Value Index includes those Russell 2500 Index companies with lower price-to-book ratios and lower forecasted growth values, while the Russell 2500 Growth Index includes those with higher-price-to-value ratios and higher forecasted growth values.
The Small-Cap and SMid-Cap Equity strategies are concentrated strategies that are not managed to a benchmark, so there are material differences in characteristics, such as the number of holdings and sector and industry weightings. In addition, benchmark performance does not include any fees or expenses. Because of these differences, benchmarks should not be considered a completely accurate comparison.
