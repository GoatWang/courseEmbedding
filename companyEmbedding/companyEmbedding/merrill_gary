Where do we begin? It starts with you.
At Merrill Lynch, your financial advisor focuses on the things you care about most- family, goals and priorities - even as they change over the years.



Understanding Your Life


WelcomePhilosophyApproachInvestment PersonalityYour Goals CapabilitiesFocus On Individuals and Families




Welcome
My mission is to understand you and your priorities. To take the time, to ask hard, smart questions and to listen carefully, then to understand, in great detail, exactly where your wealth stands today, and where you'd like it to be tomorrow. I help you design, implement and periodically monitor a customized wealth management strategy that helps you and your family pursue your personal financial goals without unnecessary investment risk. My wealth management approach is about using wealth to help turn goals into reality. When you succeed, I succeed.




Philosophy 
I believe that the best financial strategy is the one that helps you pursue your goals. That's why, from the start, I talk about your aspirations and encourage you to ask questions about issues that matter most to you. Worried about managing future health care expenses? College on the horizon? Considering the sale of a business or purchase of a home? Preparing to pass your wealth on to future generations? With access to the investing insights of Merrill Lynch and the banking convenience of Bank of America, I will work with you to develop strategies that are designed to address your priorities and financial needs.




Approach
I begin every relationship with a conversation, helping you to identify and prioritize which goals matter most to you. Whether that's transferring wealth to the next generation, customizing financial strategies that help you pursue your passions, or simply providing advice and guidance to help you stay informed, I start by listening to learn more about you. Merrill Lynch developed the Investment Personality Assessment to help us get to know your investing preferences. By gaining a deeper understanding of how you think and feel about investing through this assessment, I can help customize the financial strategy we develop together.




Capabilities
My process is designed to deliver a customized, consistent experience to assist clients not only in wealth accumulation and preservation, but in areas that go beyond portfolio management. My ability to provide access to the investment insights of Merrill Lynch and the banking convenience of Bank of America offers a way for clients to manage all of the pieces of their financial lives. I can be a financial resource, helping clients with the process of transferring wealth to the younger generation.




Focus On Individuals and Families 
I work primarily with high-net-worth individuals and families. I’ll begin by getting to know you as we explore the following seven priorities together:

Health: Managing healthcare expenses, now and in the future
Home: Upsizing, downsizing, remodeling or buying a vacation home
Family: Taking care of your family and other people in your life
Leisure: Spending your free time in meaningful ways
Giving: Volunteering, mentoring others and giving to charities
Work: Working in retirement, selling or starting a business
Finance: Bringing it all together and defining your financial goals

I work closely with other trusted professionals to help clients pursue their goals, drawing on the investment insights of Merrill Lynch and access to the banking convenience of Bank of America as we do so.
																



Your approach to investing
Drawing upon research in the field of behavioral finance, Merrill Lynch developed the Investment Personality Assessment to help us get to know you better as an investor and to potentially help you refine your own investing preferences. By gaining a deeper understanding of how you think and feel about investing, we can help determine a financial strategy that supports what matters most to you. Our Investment Personality Assessment questions will give you a sense of the full assessment and help us provide you with additional insights and resources.




Understanding your goals and priorities
Your life and goals change. We have tools to keep track of these changes so they can be reflected in your financial strategy.










Your Financial Strategy
Drawing from our experience, the investment insights of Merrill Lynch and access to the banking convenience of Bank of America, we will develop a strategy, built around the priorities most important to you. We will strive to help you stay on track, regardless of what the markets are doing.

Staying on Track
We understand that both your life and the financial markets can change over time. By regularly checking-in to discuss changes in your life and revisiting your financial strategy, our goal is to help give you peace of mind* that you're on track to help achieve what's most important to you.





Regular reviews to help you stay on track
We'll meet with you regularly to review your goals and the progress you’ve made toward reaching them. We'll also discuss any adjustments needed to your financial strategy to help you stay on course.

Access to your complete financial life is available with My Financial Picture, Merrill Lynch’s asset aggregation tool




*Peace of mind is an aspirational state of mind that clients hope to achieve. There are no guaranteed results following completion of the Goals-Based Wealth Management process because markets can fluctuate and investments can lose value. Advisors work with clients to help them understand how the goals based wealth management process can help to address their concerns, financial situation and priorities.







Let’s Have a Conversation
Helping you reach your goals starts with getting to know you personally. Through understanding what matters most to you, I can help you create a financial strategy that reflects your personality. Only then can I offer an approach that is built around your life priorities and the ongoing advice you need to help you manage fluctuations in the market and changes in your life. Let’s work together to help you achieve your goals.

Meets Expectations:

            I have only had The New Unger's Bible Handbook for a few weeks but I think it's a book of quality. There are beautiful colored pictures and maps.  Each book of the Bible are covered and most verses with information that adds to my knowledge of the Word Of God. I am a Adult Sunday School Teacher and need to know all aspects of what I am teaching.  In Mark there is a 2-page colored picture of the city of Jerusalem during the time of Jesus.  In front of each Book of the Bible there is something on the author, important dates in Book, the Theme and a outline with much more. I love the book much better than the older one I had.

            our old copy of Unger's Bible handbook was about 30 years old and in paperback.  i bought this updated hardback version for my husband and we both love to read it.  i like the larger book and the color pictures too.  it is packed with information.

Todd Merrill Studio is pleased to present the work of designer Gary Magakis. Magakis has built a cult-like following among top designers and collectors for his dynamic works that are composed of seemingly simple geometric shapes. 
When creating his bronze and steel sculptures and furniture, Magakis looks to ancient metal arts, modern architecture and sculpture, and the American Studio Craft Movement for inspiration. However, it is the handmade sculpted metal furniture of Paul Evans that has left the most significant impression on Magakis. Evans’ unprecedented use of sculpted metal forms and patinated surfaces is reflected in Magakis’ Sculpted Metal series. Magakis’ distinct approach to design produces bold and dense geometric forms that exude a Modernist elegance and buoyancy.
Magakis received a degree in sculpture from Penn State and studied welding under the instruction of sculptor Klaus Ihlenfeld, Harry Bertoia’s former assistant. 
Custom designs may be commissioned.

Gary Fred Merrill (August 2, 1915 – March 5, 1990) was an American film and television character actor whose credits included more than fifty feature films, a half-dozen mostly short-lived TV series, and dozens of television guest appearances. Merrill starred in All About Eve and married his co-star Bette Davis.

Life and career[edit]
Born in Hartford, Connecticut, he attended private Bowdoin College in Brunswick, Maine, and Trinity College[1] and began acting in 1944, while still in the United States Army Air Forces, in Winged Victory. Before entering films, Merrill's deep cultured voice won him a recurring role as Batman in the Superman radio series. His film career began promisingly, with roles in films like Twelve O'Clock High (1949) and All About Eve (1950), but he rarely moved beyond supporting roles in his many Westerns, war movies, and medical dramas. His television career was extensive, if not consistent. He appeared from 1954-1956 as Jason Tyler on the NBC crime drama Justice, about lawyers of the Legal Aid Society of New York. In that series, he was cast opposite Dane Clark and then William Prince in the role of Richard Adams.[2]

Life and career[edit]
Born in Hartford, Connecticut, he attended private Bowdoin College in Brunswick, Maine, and Trinity College[1] and began acting in 1944, while still in the United States Army Air Forces, in Winged Victory. Before entering films, Merrill's deep cultured voice won him a recurring role as Batman in the Superman radio series. His film career began promisingly, with roles in films like Twelve O'Clock High (1949) and All About Eve (1950), but he rarely moved beyond supporting roles in his many Westerns, war movies, and medical dramas. His television career was extensive, if not consistent. He appeared from 1954-1956 as Jason Tyler on the NBC crime drama Justice, about lawyers of the Legal Aid Society of New York. In that series, he was cast opposite Dane Clark and then William Prince in the role of Richard Adams.[2]
In 1958, Merrill guest starred with June Lockhart in the roles of Joshua and Emily Newton in the episode "Medicine Man" of NBC's western series Cimarron City.[3]
Merrill had recurring roles in Then Came Bronson with Michael Parks and Young Doctor Kildare, both of which lasted less than a season.
In 1964, he starred as city editor Lou Sheldon, in the short-lived CBS drama about the fictitious New York Globe, The Reporter, with Harry Guardino in the title role as journalist Danny Taylor.
In 1967, he starred in the Elvis Presley film Clambake, with co-star James Gregory.
Merrill's first marriage, to Barbara Leeds in 1941, ended in divorce in Mexico July 28, 1950. That same day, he married Bette Davis,[4] his co-star from All About Eve, and adopted her daughter Barbara from a previous marriage. He and Davis adopted two more children, Margo and Michael,[1] but they had a bitter divorce in 1960.
Often politically active, he campaigned in 1958 to elect the Democrat, Edmund Sixtus Muskie, as governor of Maine. Merrill also took part in the Selma to Montgomery marches in 1965 to promote Black voter registration. In response to U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson's Vietnam War policy, he unsuccessfully sought nomination to the Maine legislature as an anti-war, pro-environmentalist primary candidate. [1]
Aside from an occasional role as narrator, Merrill essentially retired from the entertainment business after 1980. Shortly before his death, he authored the autobiography Bette, Rita and the Rest of My Life (1989).
Death[edit]
Merrill survived his second ex-wife, Bette Davis, by only five months, dying of lung cancer in Falmouth, Maine on March 5, 1990. He is buried there in the Pine Grove Cemetery. He was survived by a son, Michael; a daughter, Margot; a brother, Jerry; and two grandchildren.[1]
Television[edit]

Life and career[edit]
Born in Hartford, Connecticut, he attended private Bowdoin College in Brunswick, Maine, and Trinity College[1] and began acting in 1944, while still in the United States Army Air Forces, in Winged Victory. Before entering films, Merrill's deep cultured voice won him a recurring role as Batman in the Superman radio series. His film career began promisingly, with roles in films like Twelve O'Clock High (1949) and All About Eve (1950), but he rarely moved beyond supporting roles in his many Westerns, war movies, and medical dramas. His television career was extensive, if not consistent. He appeared from 1954-1956 as Jason Tyler on the NBC crime drama Justice, about lawyers of the Legal Aid Society of New York. In that series, he was cast opposite Dane Clark and then William Prince in the role of Richard Adams.[2]
In 1958, Merrill guest starred with June Lockhart in the roles of Joshua and Emily Newton in the episode "Medicine Man" of NBC's western series Cimarron City.[3]
Merrill had recurring roles in Then Came Bronson with Michael Parks and Young Doctor Kildare, both of which lasted less than a season.
In 1964, he starred as city editor Lou Sheldon, in the short-lived CBS drama about the fictitious New York Globe, The Reporter, with Harry Guardino in the title role as journalist Danny Taylor.
In 1967, he starred in the Elvis Presley film Clambake, with co-star James Gregory.
Merrill's first marriage, to Barbara Leeds in 1941, ended in divorce in Mexico July 28, 1950. That same day, he married Bette Davis,[4] his co-star from All About Eve, and adopted her daughter Barbara from a previous marriage. He and Davis adopted two more children, Margo and Michael,[1] but they had a bitter divorce in 1960.
Often politically active, he campaigned in 1958 to elect the Democrat, Edmund Sixtus Muskie, as governor of Maine. Merrill also took part in the Selma to Montgomery marches in 1965 to promote Black voter registration. In response to U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson's Vietnam War policy, he unsuccessfully sought nomination to the Maine legislature as an anti-war, pro-environmentalist primary candidate. [1]
Aside from an occasional role as narrator, Merrill essentially retired from the entertainment business after 1980. Shortly before his death, he authored the autobiography Bette, Rita and the Rest of My Life (1989).
Death[edit]
Merrill survived his second ex-wife, Bette Davis, by only five months, dying of lung cancer in Falmouth, Maine on March 5, 1990. He is buried there in the Pine Grove Cemetery. He was survived by a son, Michael; a daughter, Margot; a brother, Jerry; and two grandchildren.[1]
Television[edit]
Merrill's television work spanned from 1953-1980. Most of his appearances were in guest-star roles in episodic and anthology series. Among the programs in which Merrill appeared are: The 20th Century-Fox Hour, Wagon Train, Studio 57, Studio One, Playhouse 90, Alcoa Theatre, Rawhide, Laramie, Sam Benedict, Alfred Hitchcock Presents (the episode "Man With A Problem" original air date 1957), Zane Grey Theater, The Twilight Zone (episode "Still Valley"), General Electric Theater, Ben Casey, Combat!, The Outer Limits, Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre, Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea, The Time Tunnel, Marcus Welby, M.D., Medical Center, Kung Fu, Cannon and Movin' On.
Merrill also served as narrator of the 1972–73 syndicated TV series The American Adventure.
