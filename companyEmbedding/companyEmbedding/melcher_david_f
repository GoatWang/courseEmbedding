ARLINGTON, Va., June 4, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- The Aerospace Industries Association announced today that David F. Melcher will become its President and Chief Executive Officer, effective June 8, 2015. 
"Dave is an exceptional leader who, with his balance of corporate and military experience, brings an outstanding record of executive achievement to AIA," said AIA Chairman and President and Chief Executive Officer of GE Aviation, David L. Joyce. "With Dave's guidance, AIA will continue to champion the aerospace and defense industry and its ability to advance innovation in civil aviation, space and defense."
Melcher is well known in Washington and to AIA member companies. Most recently Melcher was Chief Executive Officer and President of Exelis Inc., a leading global aerospace, defense and information solutions company. In this role, he served four years as a member of AIA's Executive and Finance Committees.
Following a 32-year career in the U.S. Army, Lieutenant General (Ret.) Melcher joined ITT Corporation first as Vice President, Strategy and Business Development and then as President, ITT Defense and Information Solutions, before becoming the inaugural chief executive at Exelis following its spinoff from ITT in Oct. 2011.  Melcher also led Exelis through its recent successful merger with Harris Corporation in May 2015.  
Melcher has extensive program management, strategy development and finance experience, and worked closely with key leadership within the Army, Department of Defense, White House, and Congress.  His Army career highlights include battalion and brigade command in Infantry and Armored divisions, and high-level military leadership and staff positions.  As a general officer, he served in the Pentagon as the Army's Military Deputy for Budget, and Deputy Chief of Staff for Programs (G8).  He also served as Commanding General of the Corps of Engineers – Southwest Division in Dallas.
"Our nation currently faces a number of critical global challenges and we must have a strong, vibrant aerospace and defense industry to keep our men and women in uniform safe and successful on the battlefield, ensure that more than two million airline passengers travel safely and efficiently every day, and enable humankind to explore the frontiers of space," Melcher said. 
"Our industry represents more than one million skilled workers in all 50 states, is the nation's largest net exporter and is one of the biggest contributors to the annual U.S. Gross Domestic Product (GDP). To maintain this leadership, we must invest in the research and development necessary to discover innovative, lifesaving and cutting-edge technologies that equip our military and benefit all of society. This is an exciting time and I am proud to lead AIA in its advocacy efforts."

Press Releases



David F. Melcher Named President and CEO of the Aerospace Industries Association






Jun 4, 2015, 10:00am EDT














ARLINGTON, Va., June 4, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- The Aerospace Industries Association announced today that David F. Melcher will become its President and Chief Executive Officer, effective June 8, 2015. 

"Dave is an exceptional leader who, with his balance of corporate and military experience, brings an outstanding record of executive achievement to AIA," said AIA Chairman and President and Chief Executive Officer of GE Aviation, David L. Joyce. "With Dave's guidance, AIA will continue to champion the aerospace and defense industry and its ability to advance innovation in civil aviation, space and defense."
Melcher is well known in Washington and to AIA member companies. Most recently Melcher was Chief Executive Officer and President of Exelis Inc., a leading global aerospace, defense and information solutions company. In this role, he served four years as a member of AIA's Executive and Finance Committees.
Following a 32-year career in the U.S. Army, Lieutenant General (Ret.) Melcher joined ITT Corporation first as Vice President, Strategy and Business Development and then as President, ITT Defense and Information Solutions, before becoming the inaugural chief executive at Exelis following its spinoff from ITT in Oct. 2011.  Melcher also led Exelis through its recent successful merger with Harris Corporation in May 2015.  
Melcher has extensive program management, strategy development and finance experience, and worked closely with key leadership within the Army, Department of Defense, White House, and Congress.  His Army career highlights include battalion and brigade command in Infantry and Armored divisions, and high-level military leadership and staff positions.  As a general officer, he served in the Pentagon as the Army's Military Deputy for Budget, and Deputy Chief of Staff for Programs (G8).  He also served as Commanding General of the Corps of Engineers – Southwest Division in Dallas.
"Our nation currently faces a number of critical global challenges and we must have a strong, vibrant aerospace and defense industry to keep our men and women in uniform safe and successful on the battlefield, ensure that more than two million airline passengers travel safely and efficiently every day, and enable humankind to explore the frontiers of space," Melcher said. 
"Our industry represents more than one million skilled workers in all 50 states, is the nation's largest net exporter and is one of the biggest contributors to the annual U.S. Gross Domestic Product (GDP). To maintain this leadership, we must invest in the research and development necessary to discover innovative, lifesaving and cutting-edge technologies that equip our military and benefit all of society. This is an exciting time and I am proud to lead AIA in its advocacy efforts."

Founded in 1919 shortly after the birth of flight, the Aerospace Industries Association is the most authoritative and influential trade association representing the nation's leading manufacturers and suppliers of civil, military and business aircraft, helicopters, unmanned aircraft systems, space systems, aircraft engines, homeland and cybersecurity systems, materiel and related components, equipment services and information technology.

ARLINGTON, Va., July 13, 2017 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- The Aerospace Industries Association (AIA), the premier association representing the Aerospace and Defense industry, today announced that LTG (Ret.) David F. Melcher, AIA's President and CEO, has informed the association that he is departing to pursue other interests effective December 31, 2017. Mr. Melcher will continue to serve as CEO of AIA until that time, and will participate in the selection and onboarding process leading to the appointment of his successor. AIA's Executive Committee, chaired by Dennis A. Muilenburg, Chairman of the Board, President and CEO of The Boeing Company, has begun the search for the association's next CEO and is committed to a seamless transition.








Mr. Muilenburg, AIA's Chairman, commented, "On behalf of the Executive Committee and AIA's over 340 members, I would like to express our sincere appreciation and gratitude to Dave Melcher for his and AIA's many notable achievements since his appointment as CEO in June 2015. Dave's extraordinary vision, leadership, and attention to member value enabled AIA to superbly represent our industry to the many constituencies we serve, and increased AIA's worldwide brand recognition with a new Administration, Congress and our global counterparts. Thanks to Dave and his team's efforts, AIA is well positioned for continued growth and influence in the future."
Mr. Melcher said, "It has been an incredible honor to lead AIA and represent our great Aerospace and Defense industry. I am proud of what we have accomplished as a team and I am convinced that AIA will continue its growth as a strong force in our industry globally. It has also been my great privilege to work with the amazingly dedicated and skilled employees at AIA and with our member company CEOs as we advocated for a strong national defense, robust civil aviation and space programs, a level playing field for international trade, and the creation of a vibrant and capable future workforce."
