Brightstone Capital Partners and Artisan Realty Advisors have acquired Los Angeles-based Lantana Media Campus, a property comprised of four buildings on about 12 acres. No financial terms were disclosed. Mesa West Capital provided the financing for the transaction.
PRESS RELEASE
NEW YORK & LOS ANGELES–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Brightstone Capital Partners, a global real estate investment management platform, and Artisan Realty Advisors, a Los Angeles-based real estate investment company, have formed a joint venture to acquire Lantana Media Campus in Santa Monica, CA, a four-building office campus totaling 478,713 square feet on approximately 12 acres.
The Class A property is located within the Santa Monica Media District in the heart of “Silicon Beach,” the area’s premier hub for entertainment, media, technology and advertising companies. Conveniently located along the recently completed Metro Expo Line, Lantana Media Campus offers a variety of building types suited to both large and small tenants, particularly those seeking a unique “creative office” campus environment.
“Santa Monica’s strategic location and amenity-rich environment make the area one of the top submarkets in Southern California,” stated Dennis Irvin, Douglas Lee and John Rivard, Managing Directors of Brightstone Capital Partners. “It is one of the most supply constrained markets in the country, making the acquisition of Lantana Media Campus an extraordinary opportunity for Brightstone and one that is consistent with our model of acquiring unique, high quality assets in advance of offering interests to our investors.” 





The new ownership will embark on a comprehensive, multi-million dollar renovation program, ensuring that Lantana will meet the standards of even the most discerning creative companies. Planned upgrades to the property include fresh, contemporary approaches to the lobbies, elevators and restrooms, as well as new enhancements designed to activate and energize interior private courtyards and the addition of a robust, on-site amenity package.
“As the new stewards of this appealing property, our goal is to create a world-class media campus in Santa Monica,” said Mark Laderman and Collin Komae, Co-Founding Partners of Artisan Realty Advisors. “Today’s top creative people seek a work environment that maximizes the potential for collaboration and is also highly amenitized. We are confident that Lantana will increasingly be their new location of choice.”
Los Angeles-based Mesa West Capital provided the acquisition financing, with a portion of the loan proceeds to be used for capital improvements and leasing costs. Steve Fried and Jason Bressler represented Mesa West.

 IS THIS VEHICLE EQUIPPED WITH TPMS?

      


 A Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) is an automated system that monitors the air pressure in a vehicle's tires. When air pressure in one or more tires drops 25 percent or more below the correct pressure, a warning indicator alerts the driver. TPMS typically delivers these alerts to the driver through one of two types of warning lights on the dashboard. If you are unaware if your vehicle is equipped with a TPMS, check your vehicle’s owners manual.

 IS THIS VEHICLE EQUIPPED WITH TPMS?

      


 A Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) is an automated system that monitors the air pressure in a vehicle's tires. When air pressure in one or more tires drops 25 percent or more below the correct pressure, a warning indicator alerts the driver. TPMS typically delivers these alerts to the driver through one of two types of warning lights on the dashboard. If you are unaware if your vehicle is equipped with a TPMS, check your vehicle’s owners manual.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC

"Funded.com has been great and my project is in the final stages of being funded by an investor I found on here. I was surprized at the quick process and how fast investors funded my project. Website was a big help!"

Let me first start by saying I believe your site is THE BEST there is for connecting Entrepreneurs and Investors.  It is the site I've had most success with.  I had about 6 Investors either respond back or contact me because of your site with an interest in investing in my company. Thank you very much!  I love your site and will recommend it to any of my Colleagues.  I love the fact that we are able to contact the Investors directly (which many of the sites joining Entrepreneurs and Investors don't allow).  It looks like I'm about to go into contract with an Investor because of your site.  Thank you again.

I am grateful I had the opportunity to access your network of investors. I am reasonably confident that the current negotiations with one of your investors will go through for our film production. I will be back for my next production.
