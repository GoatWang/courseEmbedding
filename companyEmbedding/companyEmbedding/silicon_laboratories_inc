Silicon Laboratories, Inc. (Silicon Labs) is worldwide fabless semiconductor company headquartered in Austin, Texas, United States. Silicon Labs provides silicon, software and solutions for the Internet of Things (IoT), Internet infrastructure, industrial automation, consumer and automotive markets.
Silicon Labs was founded in 1996 and pioneered RF and CMOS integration, developing the first CMOS RF synthesizer for mobile phones. Since the company’s inception, Silicon Labs has focused on connectivity solutions, starting with PC modems and most recently as a leading provider of solutions for the Internet of Things (IoT) with an emphasis on connectivity, performance, energy savings, and simplicity. Its products include microcontrollers (MCUs), wireless SoCs, timing devices, low-power sensors, and broadcast solutions. The company’s software stack solutions include firmware libraries, protocol-based software, and the Simplicity Studio development platform.
Silicon Labs has shipped more than 7 billion devices[3] worldwide and has more than 1,500 patents[4] issued and pending. Based in Austin, Texas, Silicon Labs has approximately 1,250 employees worldwide and sales, research and development offices located throughout the United States, Europe, and Asia. Silicon Labs’ customers include Samsung, Huawei, LG, Cisco, Alcatel, Harman Becker, and Technicolor.

Products[edit]
Silicon Labs provides solutions and software for use in a variety of electronic products in a range of applications including portable devices, AM/FM radios and other consumer electronics, networking equipment, test and measurement equipment, industrial monitoring and control, home automation and customer premises equipment. These products integrate complex mixed-signal functions that are frequently performed by numerous discrete components in competing products into a single chip or chipset.[9] Silicon Labs’ portfolio is organized around four primary businesses:

Internet of Things - which includes 8-bit and 32-bit microcontrollers (MCUs), environmental sensors such as relative humidity and temperature sensors, and human interface solutions such as capacitive touch controllers and proximity/ambient light sensors
Infrastructure - which includes timing ICs (clock generators and oscillators), digital isolators, wireless ICs (2.4 GHz ZigBee SoCs and sub-GHz transmitters, receivers and transceivers)
Broadcast - which includes single-chip AM/FM radios for consumer radio, automotive infotainment and professional audio applications and silicon TV tuners and demodulators for flat-screen TVs and set-top boxes
Access - which includes analog modems for set-top boxes, point of sale terminals and multi-function printers, SLICs for VoIP gateways, and PoE devices for networking gear

Silicon Labs groups products into several product families.

U.S. benchmarks absorb ‘retail-induced’ whipsaw, S&P 500 maintains first support
Technically speaking, the major U.S. benchmarks have thus far absorbed a slight volatility uptick.  Consider that the S&P 500 has reversed respectably from first support (2,381) at this week’s low, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average has concurrently maintained the 50-day moving average.
