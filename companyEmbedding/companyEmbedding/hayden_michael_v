General Michael V. Hayden


General Michael V. Hayden, Former Director of the National Security Agency and Central Intelligence Agency
Pittsburgh native and former Director of the National Security Agency and Central Intelligence Agency, General Michael V. Hayden recently authored Playing to the Edge: American Intelligence in the Age of Terror, a book chronicling America's responses to new forms of terrorism, a major war and drastic technological advances in intelligence.
The book offers insight into his time in the CIA, beginning in 1999, when he basically set the stage for the U.S. Government's policies for cyber security and a new age of espionage. Hayden says his recent tome is his "best effort to show to the American people what their intelligence services actually do on their behalf."
The title was borrowed from sports terminology, referring to how a good athlete will take advantage of the entire field, right up to sideline markers and endlines. He acknowledges that espionage "often proves controversial, and I fear we will not be able to do that in the future without our public's deeper understanding of what American intelligence is and does."
The New York Times calls Hayden a "proud product of blue-collar Pittsburgh," as his early education was received all within a 10-mile radius. Hayden played quarterback for St. Peter's Elementary (then coached by Dan Rooney) and graduated from North Catholic High School.
Hayden earned both his bachelor's and master's degree from Duquesne's McAnulty College and Graduate School of Liberal Arts before undertaking a career in the Air Force and intelligence. Commissioned as an second lieutenant through ROTC in 1967, Hayden entered active military service in 1969 and rose to the rank of four-star general in 2005.
In 2008, Hayden retired from the Air Force after 40 years of service and continued to serve as Director of the CIA until 2009. He is currently a principal at the Chertoff Group, a security consultancy co-founded by former Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff, and serves as a Distinguished Visiting Professor at George Mason University's School of Public Policy.
Hayden credits Duquesne for providing a broad base of knowledge and for helping him to hone his critical and analytical thinking skills. He received what he called "as close to a classical education as you get today." Hayden has said that "education at Duquesne compels us to see how things fit together, even when violence and world events seem to be pushing them apart."
Hayden recently returned to Duquesne to take part in a speaking forum. Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Joby Warrick, a national security reporter with The Washington Post, joined Hayden in the discussion. More than 450 people attended the event, which was hosted by Duquesne president-elect Ken Gormley. View archived video of the presentation here.

Michael Vincent Hayden (born March 17, 1945) is a retired United States Air Force four-star general and former Director of the National Security Agency, Principal Deputy Director of National Intelligence, and Director of the Central Intelligence Agency. Hayden currently co-chairs the Bipartisan Policy Center's Electric Grid Cyber Security Initiative.[4] In 2017, Hayden became a national security analyst for CNN.[5]
He was Director of the National Security Agency (NSA) from 1999 to 2005. During his tenure as director, he oversaw the controversial NSA surveillance of technological communications between persons in the United States and alleged foreign terrorist groups, which resulted in the NSA warrantless surveillance controversy.
On April 21, 2005, then Lt. Gen Hayden, was confirmed by the United States Senate as the first Principal Deputy Director of National Intelligence and awarded his fourth star-making him "the highest-ranking military intelligence officer in the armed forces".[6] He served in this position under DNI John Negroponte until May 26, 2006.
On May 8, 2006, Hayden was nominated for the position of CIA Director following the May 5 resignation of Porter J. Goss, and on May 23 the Senate Intelligence Committee voted 12–3 to send the nomination to the Senate floor. His nomination was confirmed by the United States Senate on May 26 by a vote of 78–15. On May 30, 2006, and again the following day at the CIA lobby with President George W. Bush in attendance, Hayden was sworn in as the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency.

On July 1, 2008, Hayden retired from the Air Force after over 41 years of service and continued to serve as Director of the CIA until February 12, 2009.[7] He received an honorary doctorate from the Institute of World Politics in Washington, DC in 2009. He is currently a principal at the Chertoff Group, a security consultancy co-founded by former Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff.[8] Hayden also serves as a Distinguished Visiting Professor at George Mason University's Schar School of Policy and Government. He was elected to the Board of Directors of Motorola Solutions effective January 4, 2011.[9]

Early life, career, and family[edit]
Michael Vincent Hayden was born on March 17, 1945, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to an Irish-American couple, Sadie (Murray) and Harry V. Hayden Jr.,[10] who worked as a welder for a Pennsylvania manufacturing company. He has a sister, Debby, and a brother, Harry.
He went to St. Peter's Elementary school where, in 7th and 8th grade he played quarterback on the school football team then being coached by the late Dan Rooney, the son of the founder of the Pittsburgh Steelers, and former Chairman of the team. Michael Hayden graduated from North Catholic High School. One of Hayden's first jobs was as an equipment manager for the Steelers.[11] Hayden went on to Duquesne University in Pittsburgh where he earned a B.A. in history in 1967 and was commissioned as a second lieutenant. He then attended graduate school at Duquesne for an M.A. in modern American history. He continues to be an avid fan of the hometown Pittsburgh Steelers, since the 1990s travelling with his wife and family to at least 3–4 games a year.[11]
He was commissioned through University of Pittsburgh's Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps program.[12] Hayden entered active military service in 1969.
Hayden has served as commander of the Air Intelligence Agency and Director of the Joint Command and Control Warfare Center, both headquartered at Lackland Air Force Base. He also has served in senior staff positions in the Pentagon; Headquarters U.S. European Command, Stuttgart, Germany; the National Security Council, Washington, D.C., and the U.S. Embassy in the then-People's Republic of Bulgaria. Prior to becoming Director of the National Security Agency, the general served as deputy chief of staff for United Nations Command and U.S. Forces Korea, Yongsan Garrison. He has also worked in intelligence in Guam.
He is married to Jeanine Carrier, and they have a daughter and two sons, Margaret, Michael and Liam.
Intelligence career[edit]
Air Intelligence Agency[edit]
From 1996 to 1997, Hayden served as Commander of the AIA, an agency of 16,000 charged with defending and exploiting the "information domain."[13]
National Security Agency[edit]
Hayden served as the Director of the National Security Agency and Chief of the Central Security Service at Fort George G. Meade, Maryland from March 1999 to April 2005. As the Director of NSA and Chief of CSS, he was responsible for a combat support agency of the Department of Defense with military and civilian personnel stationed worldwide.[14]
Strategy for the NSA[edit]
Hayden came to the NSA at a time of great trouble in the agency. Internal government analysis indicated it suffered from a lack of quality management and an outdated IT infrastructure. In fact soon after he came on board, a huge part of the NSA network system crashed and was down for several days. Part of his plan to revitalize the agency was to introduce more outside contractors, induce a lot of old managers to retire and get rid of old management structures. Part of his plan also included increased openness at the agency; it had historically been one of the most secretive organs of government. He notably allowed James Bamford access for his book Body of Secrets.[15] Hayden was also initially extremely concerned with following the laws against domestic surveillance. Many reports say that after 9/11, he became more concerned with stopping terrorism, and allegedly softened his stance against domestic surveillance.[15][16][17][18] Hayden however has said that he believed everything the agency was doing was "effective, appropriate, and lawful".[19]
On 9/11, Hayden immediately evacuated all non-essential personnel from NSA headquarters. After 9/11, the agency greatly increased its activity. Details about its operations have been largely hidden, but it played a major role in the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and the War on Terror. One notable example is its relationship with the unmanned aerial vehicle 'drone' program.[20][page needed]
Wiretaps of domestic communication[edit]
In May 2006, USA Today reported that, under Hayden's leadership, the NSA created a domestic telephone call database. During his nomination hearings, Hayden defended his actions to Senator Russ Feingold and others, stating that he had relied upon legal advice from the White House that building the database was supported by Article Two of the United States Constitution executive branch powers (in which the President must "take care that the laws be faithfully executed"), overriding legislative branch statutes forbidding warrantless surveillance of domestic calls, which included the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). Previously, this action would have required a warrant from a FISA court. The stated purpose of the database was to eavesdrop on international communications between persons within the U.S. and individuals and groups overseas in order to locate terrorists.[21]
Trailblazer[edit]
Hayden also championed the Trailblazer Project, a "transformation" project with a large Information Technology component. The project was criticized by several NSA staffers for not including privacy protections for US citizens and for being a waste of money. The critics included Diane S Roark, of the House Intelligence Committee, NSA workers Thomas Andrews Drake, William Binney, J. Kirk Wiebe, and Loomis, and others. Hayden severely rebuked these critics. Several quit in protest. After investigations by the NSA inspector general, the DOD inspector general, and Congress, Trailblazer was shut down.[19]
Principal Deputy Director of National Intelligence[edit]

This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (June 2008)


As part of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, the CIA chief no longer would run the intelligence community. Instead a new office was created for this purpose; the Director of National Intelligence. General Hayden became the Principal Deputy Director of National Intelligence from May 2005 to May 2006 under the first DNI, John Negroponte.
Civil liberties[edit]
On January 23, 2006, Hayden participated in a news conference.[22] A YouTube video[23] was posted of Michael Hayden telling reporters at a press conference that "probable cause" is not required for all searches or seizures under the Fourth Amendment, correctly indicating instead that the standard is whether the search or seizure is reasonable. "Probable cause" is required for a warrant if the search or seizure is deemed to be "unreasonable."

Hayden referred to people who believed that torture of CIA detainees has never yielded useful intelligence as "interrogation deniers".[24]
Director of the Central Intelligence Agency[edit]




Michael Hayden speaking at the 2015 Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in National Harbor, Maryland on February 27, 2015.


On May 8, 2006, Hayden was nominated by President George W. Bush to be Director of the Central Intelligence Agency after the resignation of Porter J. Goss on May 5, 2006.[25] He was later confirmed on May 26, 2006, as Director, 78–15, by full U.S. Senate vote.[26]
Critics of the nomination and Hayden's attempts to increase domestic surveillance included Senator Dianne Feinstein who stated on May 11, 2006, that "I happen to believe we are on our way to a major constitutional confrontation on Fourth Amendment guarantees of unreasonable search and seizure".[27]
Hayden has been accused of lying to Congress during his 2007 testimony about the CIA's 'enhanced interrogation program.[28][29]
In 2007, Hayden lobbied to allow the CIA to conduct drone strikes purely on the behavior of ground vehicles, with no further evidence of connection to terrorism.[30]
In 2008 Hayden warned from the destabilizing consequences of Muslim migration to Europe that might raise the possibility of civil unrest.[31]
In 2013, after the P5+1 reached a nuclear agreement with Iran, Hayden said, "We have accepted Iranian uranium enrichment."[32]
The 2014 Senate Intelligence Committee report on CIA torture cited an email prepared by a subordinate that indicated that as CIA Director, Hayden instructed that out-of-date information be used in briefing Congress so that fewer than 100 Guantanamo Bay detainees would be reported.[33]
NSA spying scandal[edit]
See also: Global surveillance disclosures (2013–present)
In September 2013, Hayden stressed the indisputable legality of "what the NSA is doing" and called Edward Snowden a "troubled young man", albeit "morally arrogant to a tremendous degree"; he also said about his prospects in Russia: "I suspect he will end up like most of the rest of the defectors who went to the old Soviet Union: Isolated, bored, lonely, depressed—and most of them ended up alcoholics."[34]

Michael Vincent Hayden (born March 17, 1945) is a retired United States Air Force four-star general and former Director of the National Security Agency, Principal Deputy Director of National Intelligence, and Director of the Central Intelligence Agency. Hayden currently co-chairs the Bipartisan Policy Center's Electric Grid Cyber Security Initiative.[4] In 2017, Hayden became a national security analyst for CNN.[5]
He was Director of the National Security Agency (NSA) from 1999 to 2005. During his tenure as director, he oversaw the controversial NSA surveillance of technological communications between persons in the United States and alleged foreign terrorist groups, which resulted in the NSA warrantless surveillance controversy.
On April 21, 2005, then Lt. Gen Hayden, was confirmed by the United States Senate as the first Principal Deputy Director of National Intelligence and awarded his fourth star-making him "the highest-ranking military intelligence officer in the armed forces".[6] He served in this position under DNI John Negroponte until May 26, 2006.
On May 8, 2006, Hayden was nominated for the position of CIA Director following the May 5 resignation of Porter J. Goss, and on May 23 the Senate Intelligence Committee voted 12–3 to send the nomination to the Senate floor. His nomination was confirmed by the United States Senate on May 26 by a vote of 78–15. On May 30, 2006, and again the following day at the CIA lobby with President George W. Bush in attendance, Hayden was sworn in as the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency.

On July 1, 2008, Hayden retired from the Air Force after over 41 years of service and continued to serve as Director of the CIA until February 12, 2009.[7] He received an honorary doctorate from the Institute of World Politics in Washington, DC in 2009. He is currently a principal at the Chertoff Group, a security consultancy co-founded by former Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff.[8] Hayden also serves as a Distinguished Visiting Professor at George Mason University's Schar School of Policy and Government. He was elected to the Board of Directors of Motorola Solutions effective January 4, 2011.[9]

Early life, career, and family[edit]
Michael Vincent Hayden was born on March 17, 1945, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to an Irish-American couple, Sadie (Murray) and Harry V. Hayden Jr.,[10] who worked as a welder for a Pennsylvania manufacturing company. He has a sister, Debby, and a brother, Harry.
He went to St. Peter's Elementary school where, in 7th and 8th grade he played quarterback on the school football team then being coached by the late Dan Rooney, the son of the founder of the Pittsburgh Steelers, and former Chairman of the team. Michael Hayden graduated from North Catholic High School. One of Hayden's first jobs was as an equipment manager for the Steelers.[11] Hayden went on to Duquesne University in Pittsburgh where he earned a B.A. in history in 1967 and was commissioned as a second lieutenant. He then attended graduate school at Duquesne for an M.A. in modern American history. He continues to be an avid fan of the hometown Pittsburgh Steelers, since the 1990s travelling with his wife and family to at least 3–4 games a year.[11]
He was commissioned through University of Pittsburgh's Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps program.[12] Hayden entered active military service in 1969.
Hayden has served as commander of the Air Intelligence Agency and Director of the Joint Command and Control Warfare Center, both headquartered at Lackland Air Force Base. He also has served in senior staff positions in the Pentagon; Headquarters U.S. European Command, Stuttgart, Germany; the National Security Council, Washington, D.C., and the U.S. Embassy in the then-People's Republic of Bulgaria. Prior to becoming Director of the National Security Agency, the general served as deputy chief of staff for United Nations Command and U.S. Forces Korea, Yongsan Garrison. He has also worked in intelligence in Guam.
He is married to Jeanine Carrier, and they have a daughter and two sons, Margaret, Michael and Liam.
Intelligence career[edit]
Air Intelligence Agency[edit]
From 1996 to 1997, Hayden served as Commander of the AIA, an agency of 16,000 charged with defending and exploiting the "information domain."[13]
National Security Agency[edit]
Hayden served as the Director of the National Security Agency and Chief of the Central Security Service at Fort George G. Meade, Maryland from March 1999 to April 2005. As the Director of NSA and Chief of CSS, he was responsible for a combat support agency of the Department of Defense with military and civilian personnel stationed worldwide.[14]
Strategy for the NSA[edit]
Hayden came to the NSA at a time of great trouble in the agency. Internal government analysis indicated it suffered from a lack of quality management and an outdated IT infrastructure. In fact soon after he came on board, a huge part of the NSA network system crashed and was down for several days. Part of his plan to revitalize the agency was to introduce more outside contractors, induce a lot of old managers to retire and get rid of old management structures. Part of his plan also included increased openness at the agency; it had historically been one of the most secretive organs of government. He notably allowed James Bamford access for his book Body of Secrets.[15] Hayden was also initially extremely concerned with following the laws against domestic surveillance. Many reports say that after 9/11, he became more concerned with stopping terrorism, and allegedly softened his stance against domestic surveillance.[15][16][17][18] Hayden however has said that he believed everything the agency was doing was "effective, appropriate, and lawful".[19]
On 9/11, Hayden immediately evacuated all non-essential personnel from NSA headquarters. After 9/11, the agency greatly increased its activity. Details about its operations have been largely hidden, but it played a major role in the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and the War on Terror. One notable example is its relationship with the unmanned aerial vehicle 'drone' program.[20][page needed]
Wiretaps of domestic communication[edit]
In May 2006, USA Today reported that, under Hayden's leadership, the NSA created a domestic telephone call database. During his nomination hearings, Hayden defended his actions to Senator Russ Feingold and others, stating that he had relied upon legal advice from the White House that building the database was supported by Article Two of the United States Constitution executive branch powers (in which the President must "take care that the laws be faithfully executed"), overriding legislative branch statutes forbidding warrantless surveillance of domestic calls, which included the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). Previously, this action would have required a warrant from a FISA court. The stated purpose of the database was to eavesdrop on international communications between persons within the U.S. and individuals and groups overseas in order to locate terrorists.[21]
Trailblazer[edit]
Hayden also championed the Trailblazer Project, a "transformation" project with a large Information Technology component. The project was criticized by several NSA staffers for not including privacy protections for US citizens and for being a waste of money. The critics included Diane S Roark, of the House Intelligence Committee, NSA workers Thomas Andrews Drake, William Binney, J. Kirk Wiebe, and Loomis, and others. Hayden severely rebuked these critics. Several quit in protest. After investigations by the NSA inspector general, the DOD inspector general, and Congress, Trailblazer was shut down.[19]
Principal Deputy Director of National Intelligence[edit]

This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (June 2008)


As part of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, the CIA chief no longer would run the intelligence community. Instead a new office was created for this purpose; the Director of National Intelligence. General Hayden became the Principal Deputy Director of National Intelligence from May 2005 to May 2006 under the first DNI, John Negroponte.
Civil liberties[edit]
On January 23, 2006, Hayden participated in a news conference.[22] A YouTube video[23] was posted of Michael Hayden telling reporters at a press conference that "probable cause" is not required for all searches or seizures under the Fourth Amendment, correctly indicating instead that the standard is whether the search or seizure is reasonable. "Probable cause" is required for a warrant if the search or seizure is deemed to be "unreasonable."

Hayden referred to people who believed that torture of CIA detainees has never yielded useful intelligence as "interrogation deniers".[24]
Director of the Central Intelligence Agency[edit]




Michael Hayden speaking at the 2015 Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in National Harbor, Maryland on February 27, 2015.


On May 8, 2006, Hayden was nominated by President George W. Bush to be Director of the Central Intelligence Agency after the resignation of Porter J. Goss on May 5, 2006.[25] He was later confirmed on May 26, 2006, as Director, 78–15, by full U.S. Senate vote.[26]
Critics of the nomination and Hayden's attempts to increase domestic surveillance included Senator Dianne Feinstein who stated on May 11, 2006, that "I happen to believe we are on our way to a major constitutional confrontation on Fourth Amendment guarantees of unreasonable search and seizure".[27]
Hayden has been accused of lying to Congress during his 2007 testimony about the CIA's 'enhanced interrogation program.[28][29]
In 2007, Hayden lobbied to allow the CIA to conduct drone strikes purely on the behavior of ground vehicles, with no further evidence of connection to terrorism.[30]
In 2008 Hayden warned from the destabilizing consequences of Muslim migration to Europe that might raise the possibility of civil unrest.[31]
In 2013, after the P5+1 reached a nuclear agreement with Iran, Hayden said, "We have accepted Iranian uranium enrichment."[32]
The 2014 Senate Intelligence Committee report on CIA torture cited an email prepared by a subordinate that indicated that as CIA Director, Hayden instructed that out-of-date information be used in briefing Congress so that fewer than 100 Guantanamo Bay detainees would be reported.[33]
NSA spying scandal[edit]
See also: Global surveillance disclosures (2013–present)
In September 2013, Hayden stressed the indisputable legality of "what the NSA is doing" and called Edward Snowden a "troubled young man", albeit "morally arrogant to a tremendous degree"; he also said about his prospects in Russia: "I suspect he will end up like most of the rest of the defectors who went to the old Soviet Union: Isolated, bored, lonely, depressed—and most of them ended up alcoholics."[34]

If Michael V. Hayden were a businessman, he might be called a turnaround artist. When he was named by President George W. Bush to take over the Central Intelligence Agency in mid-2006, it was in wide disrepute. It had failed to break up the 9/11 plot. It couldn’t find Osama bin Laden. It had rubber-stamped phony intelligence about Saddam Hussein’s nonexistent weapons of mass destruction, enabling the catastrophic war in Iraq. Revelations of waterboarding and other “enhanced interrogation techniques” carried out at C.I.A. “black sites” had provoked revulsion.Even the agency’s seventh-floor executive suite reeked of malfeasance and chaos. Yellow crime-scene tape was draped across the doorway of its third-ranking official, who had been arrested on bribery charges. Other top officers had quit or were heading for the door under the fumbling, near-comical administration of Hayden’s predecessor, Porter Goss, a former Republican congressman. Adding insult to injuries, Congress had stripped the C.I.A. of its 60-year primacy among the 16 United States intelligence agencies, creating a new über-bureaucracy that would supposedly ride herd on them all.Hayden was undaunted. In 1999, he’d become head of a hidebound, creaking National Security Agency, shaved off management fat and pumped new muscle into its collection capabilities. But the nation’s premier espionage service was in many ways a harder case.“The C.I.A., deeply engaged in multiple wars, was suffering from a kind of battered child syndrome,” he writes. It needed time on the couch. And a housecleaning. “When I’d taken over N.S.A. in 1999, it needed to be shaken up. Now that I would be leading C.I.A., I knew it needed to be settled down,” he writes in a surprisingly vivid, albeit acronym-heavy, memoir that probably only a Beltway insider could truly love.

“Playing to the Edge,” Hayden says, is his “best effort to show to the American people what their intelligence services actually do on their behalf.” But it’s really more about what C.I.A. directors spend most of their time doing, which, in Hayden’s case, amounted mostly to skirmishing with Congress, huddling with the White House and flying around the world to meet with his spy-service counterparts.

During Hayden’s tenure, trekking to Capitol Hill rarely ended happily. The Democrats, in particular, were on fire over press reports of C.I.A. waterboarding, secret detention centers and the N.S.A.’s extralegal programs tracking the emails, telephone calls, web-browsing habits and financial transactions of American citizens, which he had started as its director after the 9/11 attacks.“Hearings often became shouting matches,” he recounts. “In one session I was asked if I would waterboard my daughter. Then . . . I was accused of looking bored during a lengthy lecture. . . . There were moments (a lot of them, actually) when I was convinced that several members were opposed not just to some of the agency’s actions, but to its existence.”Now a fixture on Fox News, Hayden saves special scorn for Democrats, like former Senator Jay Rockefeller, the chairman of the intelligence committee from 2007 to 2009, who he says seemed perfectly O.K. with torturing the Qaeda kingpin Khalid Shaikh Mohammed in 2003 — “I wouldn’t take anything off the table,” he told CNN at the time — but who later joined the chorus of Democrats who denounced C.I.A. methods in their censorious 2014 Senate Intelligence Committee report on torture.Why were the Democrats so hostile to the C.I.A.? They say it was because agency officials hid interrogation abuses and constantly lied to them about their effectiveness. Hayden, however, theorizes that they were offloading guilt for their own participation in the system. They should have “begun their protest in 2002 — when the trauma” of 9/11 “was recent, the threat seemed imminent and the future was in doubt,” he grouses, “not in 2014, when it was not.”“In the end,” Hayden asserts, “the Congress of the United States had no impact on the shape of the C.I.A. interrogation program going forward. Congress lacked the courage or the consensus to stop it, endorse it or amend it.” But that’s an overly narrow and legalistic interpretation of what transpired. Hayden himself admits the C.I.A. had to pull back on its most egregious interrogation methods after the outcry in Congress over abuses that were exposed by the press.“I decided that the C.I.A. program as we were recrafting it would be worth the freight and that we could buy down the tariff if we aggressively briefed Congress and solicited some public support from it,” he writes, and “if we briefed the American people in as open a way as possible; and if we quietly informed our allies more fully of the parameters and limits of what we were doing.”“For General Michael Hayden, playing to the edge means playing so close to the line that you get chalk dust on your cleats,” the Association of Former Intelligence Officers, a pro-C.I.A. group, said in a recent newsletter. Except that Hayden went well over the chalk with the N.S.A.’s warrantless data-mining programs. In a now-famous 2004 showdown with the White House, Deputy Attorney General James Comey (currently the director of the F.B.I.) threatened to resign unless the program was put on a firmer legal foundation. When the New York Times reporter James Risen got wind of the programs, Hayden took the damage-control lead, ultimately persuading the paper’s editors to sit on the story for nearly a year — until Risen forced its hand by including it in his book “State of War: The Secret History of the C.I.A. and the Bush Administration.” Hayden’s wily account of the Risen episode, as well as his views of other journalists, will probably generate media buzz. He is mostly disdainful of reporters who lust after “espionage porn” — exposing C.I.A. spying foibles, no matter the risk to national security. He sneers at Risen (“irresponsible”), others who are “hopelessly agenda-driven” (the former Times reporter Tim Weiner, The New Yorker’s Jane Mayer) and those who are “consistently anti-Bush” (like the former blogger Andrew Sullivan). Of course he has nothing but scorn for Glenn Green­wald and Laura Poitras, Boswells to the N.S.A. leaker Edward Snowden, “an incredibly naïve, hopelessly narcissistic and insufferably self-important defector.” (Nor do I escape his pique: For reporting in 2006 that the incoming House intelligence committee chairman Silvestre Reyes couldn’t tell me whether Al Qaeda was Sunni or Shia, he says I was “tough and knowledgeable, but . . . specialized in snark.”)

Hayden is no slouch in that regard, either, taking multiple shots at Barack Obama. “More Hamlet than Patton,” he calls one of the president’s landmark speeches on combating terrorism. When Obama visits the C.I.A. and urges the assembled work force not to be “discouraged” by the administration’s release of torture memos, because “we’ve made some mistakes. That’s how we learn,” Hayden says, “the agency consensus” was that Obama “sounded a lot like Mister Rogers.” Even so, he writes, the election of the Republican senator John McCain would have been “more disruptive to the way America produced intelligence than the election of Barack Obama.”

Hayden’s candid takes on his encounters with important foreign officials are more sober. Iraqi President Nouri al Maliki “was pretty dark.” The Kurdish leader Jalal Talabani and his advisers were “disconnected from, and somewhat cavalier about the levels of violence.” The Pakistanis “really were the ally from hell.” Bashar al-Assad is Michael Corleone’s hapless brother Fredo. His thinly disguised Israeli counterpart is “tough, tireless.”A proud product of blue-collar Pittsburgh, Hayden hints that he would have told far more stories about C.I.A. successes had agency censors let him. As it is, he dances around Israel’s role in knocking out a Syrian nuclear reactor, as well as the agency’s management of drone strikes. Amid all the killing, the spymaster remains stoic.At one point President Bush pulled Hayden aside at Camp David “for a private moment.” He asks how he’s doing “spiritually.”“Mr. President, I’m really fine,” Hayden replied, “more honestly (and firmly).”“Good, good,” the president said, and they sat down to eat.PLAYING TO THE EDGEAmerican Intelligence in the Age of TerrorBy Michael V.

Michael Vincent Hayden (born March 17, 1945) is a retired United States Air Force four-star general and former Director of the National Security Agency, Principal Deputy Director of National Intelligence, and Director of the Central Intelligence Agency. Hayden currently co-chairs the Bipartisan Policy Center's Electric Grid Cyber Security Initiative.[4] In 2017, Hayden became a national security analyst for CNN.[5]
He was Director of the National Security Agency (NSA) from 1999 to 2005. During his tenure as director, he oversaw the controversial NSA surveillance of technological communications between persons in the United States and alleged foreign terrorist groups, which resulted in the NSA warrantless surveillance controversy.
On April 21, 2005, then Lt. Gen Hayden, was confirmed by the United States Senate as the first Principal Deputy Director of National Intelligence and awarded his fourth star-making him "the highest-ranking military intelligence officer in the armed forces".[6] He served in this position under DNI John Negroponte until May 26, 2006.
On May 8, 2006, Hayden was nominated for the position of CIA Director following the May 5 resignation of Porter J. Goss, and on May 23 the Senate Intelligence Committee voted 12–3 to send the nomination to the Senate floor. His nomination was confirmed by the United States Senate on May 26 by a vote of 78–15. On May 30, 2006, and again the following day at the CIA lobby with President George W. Bush in attendance, Hayden was sworn in as the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency.

On July 1, 2008, Hayden retired from the Air Force after over 41 years of service and continued to serve as Director of the CIA until February 12, 2009.[7] He received an honorary doctorate from the Institute of World Politics in Washington, DC in 2009. He is currently a principal at the Chertoff Group, a security consultancy co-founded by former Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff.[8] Hayden also serves as a Distinguished Visiting Professor at George Mason University's Schar School of Policy and Government. He was elected to the Board of Directors of Motorola Solutions effective January 4, 2011.[9]

Early life, career, and family[edit]
Michael Vincent Hayden was born on March 17, 1945, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to an Irish-American couple, Sadie (Murray) and Harry V. Hayden Jr.,[10] who worked as a welder for a Pennsylvania manufacturing company. He has a sister, Debby, and a brother, Harry.
He went to St. Peter's Elementary school where, in 7th and 8th grade he played quarterback on the school football team then being coached by the late Dan Rooney, the son of the founder of the Pittsburgh Steelers, and former Chairman of the team. Michael Hayden graduated from North Catholic High School. One of Hayden's first jobs was as an equipment manager for the Steelers.[11] Hayden went on to Duquesne University in Pittsburgh where he earned a B.A. in history in 1967 and was commissioned as a second lieutenant. He then attended graduate school at Duquesne for an M.A. in modern American history. He continues to be an avid fan of the hometown Pittsburgh Steelers, since the 1990s travelling with his wife and family to at least 3–4 games a year.[11]
He was commissioned through University of Pittsburgh's Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps program.[12] Hayden entered active military service in 1969.
Hayden has served as commander of the Air Intelligence Agency and Director of the Joint Command and Control Warfare Center, both headquartered at Lackland Air Force Base. He also has served in senior staff positions in the Pentagon; Headquarters U.S. European Command, Stuttgart, Germany; the National Security Council, Washington, D.C., and the U.S. Embassy in the then-People's Republic of Bulgaria. Prior to becoming Director of the National Security Agency, the general served as deputy chief of staff for United Nations Command and U.S. Forces Korea, Yongsan Garrison. He has also worked in intelligence in Guam.
He is married to Jeanine Carrier, and they have a daughter and two sons, Margaret, Michael and Liam.
Intelligence career[edit]
Air Intelligence Agency[edit]
From 1996 to 1997, Hayden served as Commander of the AIA, an agency of 16,000 charged with defending and exploiting the "information domain."[13]
National Security Agency[edit]
Hayden served as the Director of the National Security Agency and Chief of the Central Security Service at Fort George G. Meade, Maryland from March 1999 to April 2005. As the Director of NSA and Chief of CSS, he was responsible for a combat support agency of the Department of Defense with military and civilian personnel stationed worldwide.[14]
Strategy for the NSA[edit]
Hayden came to the NSA at a time of great trouble in the agency. Internal government analysis indicated it suffered from a lack of quality management and an outdated IT infrastructure. In fact soon after he came on board, a huge part of the NSA network system crashed and was down for several days. Part of his plan to revitalize the agency was to introduce more outside contractors, induce a lot of old managers to retire and get rid of old management structures. Part of his plan also included increased openness at the agency; it had historically been one of the most secretive organs of government. He notably allowed James Bamford access for his book Body of Secrets.[15] Hayden was also initially extremely concerned with following the laws against domestic surveillance. Many reports say that after 9/11, he became more concerned with stopping terrorism, and allegedly softened his stance against domestic surveillance.[15][16][17][18] Hayden however has said that he believed everything the agency was doing was "effective, appropriate, and lawful".[19]
On 9/11, Hayden immediately evacuated all non-essential personnel from NSA headquarters. After 9/11, the agency greatly increased its activity. Details about its operations have been largely hidden, but it played a major role in the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and the War on Terror. One notable example is its relationship with the unmanned aerial vehicle 'drone' program.[20][page needed]
Wiretaps of domestic communication[edit]
In May 2006, USA Today reported that, under Hayden's leadership, the NSA created a domestic telephone call database. During his nomination hearings, Hayden defended his actions to Senator Russ Feingold and others, stating that he had relied upon legal advice from the White House that building the database was supported by Article Two of the United States Constitution executive branch powers (in which the President must "take care that the laws be faithfully executed"), overriding legislative branch statutes forbidding warrantless surveillance of domestic calls, which included the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). Previously, this action would have required a warrant from a FISA court. The stated purpose of the database was to eavesdrop on international communications between persons within the U.S. and individuals and groups overseas in order to locate terrorists.[21]
Trailblazer[edit]
Hayden also championed the Trailblazer Project, a "transformation" project with a large Information Technology component. The project was criticized by several NSA staffers for not including privacy protections for US citizens and for being a waste of money. The critics included Diane S Roark, of the House Intelligence Committee, NSA workers Thomas Andrews Drake, William Binney, J. Kirk Wiebe, and Loomis, and others. Hayden severely rebuked these critics. Several quit in protest. After investigations by the NSA inspector general, the DOD inspector general, and Congress, Trailblazer was shut down.[19]
Principal Deputy Director of National Intelligence[edit]

This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (June 2008)


As part of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, the CIA chief no longer would run the intelligence community. Instead a new office was created for this purpose; the Director of National Intelligence. General Hayden became the Principal Deputy Director of National Intelligence from May 2005 to May 2006 under the first DNI, John Negroponte.
Civil liberties[edit]
On January 23, 2006, Hayden participated in a news conference.[22] A YouTube video[23] was posted of Michael Hayden telling reporters at a press conference that "probable cause" is not required for all searches or seizures under the Fourth Amendment, correctly indicating instead that the standard is whether the search or seizure is reasonable. "Probable cause" is required for a warrant if the search or seizure is deemed to be "unreasonable."

Hayden referred to people who believed that torture of CIA detainees has never yielded useful intelligence as "interrogation deniers".[24]
Director of the Central Intelligence Agency[edit]




Michael Hayden speaking at the 2015 Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in National Harbor, Maryland on February 27, 2015.


On May 8, 2006, Hayden was nominated by President George W. Bush to be Director of the Central Intelligence Agency after the resignation of Porter J. Goss on May 5, 2006.[25] He was later confirmed on May 26, 2006, as Director, 78–15, by full U.S. Senate vote.[26]
Critics of the nomination and Hayden's attempts to increase domestic surveillance included Senator Dianne Feinstein who stated on May 11, 2006, that "I happen to believe we are on our way to a major constitutional confrontation on Fourth Amendment guarantees of unreasonable search and seizure".[27]
Hayden has been accused of lying to Congress during his 2007 testimony about the CIA's 'enhanced interrogation program.[28][29]
In 2007, Hayden lobbied to allow the CIA to conduct drone strikes purely on the behavior of ground vehicles, with no further evidence of connection to terrorism.[30]
In 2008 Hayden warned from the destabilizing consequences of Muslim migration to Europe that might raise the possibility of civil unrest.[31]
In 2013, after the P5+1 reached a nuclear agreement with Iran, Hayden said, "We have accepted Iranian uranium enrichment."[32]
The 2014 Senate Intelligence Committee report on CIA torture cited an email prepared by a subordinate that indicated that as CIA Director, Hayden instructed that out-of-date information be used in briefing Congress so that fewer than 100 Guantanamo Bay detainees would be reported.[33]
NSA spying scandal[edit]
See also: Global surveillance disclosures (2013–present)
In September 2013, Hayden stressed the indisputable legality of "what the NSA is doing" and called Edward Snowden a "troubled young man", albeit "morally arrogant to a tremendous degree"; he also said about his prospects in Russia: "I suspect he will end up like most of the rest of the defectors who went to the old Soviet Union: Isolated, bored, lonely, depressed—and most of them ended up alcoholics."[34]

Michael Vincent Hayden (born March 17, 1945) is a retired United States Air Force four-star general and former Director of the National Security Agency, Principal Deputy Director of National Intelligence, and Director of the Central Intelligence Agency. Hayden currently co-chairs the Bipartisan Policy Center's Electric Grid Cyber Security Initiative.[4] In 2017, Hayden became a national security analyst for CNN.[5]
He was Director of the National Security Agency (NSA) from 1999 to 2005. During his tenure as director, he oversaw the controversial NSA surveillance of technological communications between persons in the United States and alleged foreign terrorist groups, which resulted in the NSA warrantless surveillance controversy.
On April 21, 2005, then Lt. Gen Hayden, was confirmed by the United States Senate as the first Principal Deputy Director of National Intelligence and awarded his fourth star-making him "the highest-ranking military intelligence officer in the armed forces".[6] He served in this position under DNI John Negroponte until May 26, 2006.
On May 8, 2006, Hayden was nominated for the position of CIA Director following the May 5 resignation of Porter J. Goss, and on May 23 the Senate Intelligence Committee voted 12–3 to send the nomination to the Senate floor. His nomination was confirmed by the United States Senate on May 26 by a vote of 78–15. On May 30, 2006, and again the following day at the CIA lobby with President George W. Bush in attendance, Hayden was sworn in as the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency.

On July 1, 2008, Hayden retired from the Air Force after over 41 years of service and continued to serve as Director of the CIA until February 12, 2009.[7] He received an honorary doctorate from the Institute of World Politics in Washington, DC in 2009. He is currently a principal at the Chertoff Group, a security consultancy co-founded by former Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff.[8] Hayden also serves as a Distinguished Visiting Professor at George Mason University's Schar School of Policy and Government. He was elected to the Board of Directors of Motorola Solutions effective January 4, 2011.[9]

Early life, career, and family[edit]
Michael Vincent Hayden was born on March 17, 1945, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to an Irish-American couple, Sadie (Murray) and Harry V. Hayden Jr.,[10] who worked as a welder for a Pennsylvania manufacturing company. He has a sister, Debby, and a brother, Harry.
He went to St. Peter's Elementary school where, in 7th and 8th grade he played quarterback on the school football team then being coached by the late Dan Rooney, the son of the founder of the Pittsburgh Steelers, and former Chairman of the team. Michael Hayden graduated from North Catholic High School. One of Hayden's first jobs was as an equipment manager for the Steelers.[11] Hayden went on to Duquesne University in Pittsburgh where he earned a B.A. in history in 1967 and was commissioned as a second lieutenant. He then attended graduate school at Duquesne for an M.A. in modern American history. He continues to be an avid fan of the hometown Pittsburgh Steelers, since the 1990s travelling with his wife and family to at least 3–4 games a year.[11]
He was commissioned through University of Pittsburgh's Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps program.[12] Hayden entered active military service in 1969.
Hayden has served as commander of the Air Intelligence Agency and Director of the Joint Command and Control Warfare Center, both headquartered at Lackland Air Force Base. He also has served in senior staff positions in the Pentagon; Headquarters U.S. European Command, Stuttgart, Germany; the National Security Council, Washington, D.C., and the U.S. Embassy in the then-People's Republic of Bulgaria. Prior to becoming Director of the National Security Agency, the general served as deputy chief of staff for United Nations Command and U.S. Forces Korea, Yongsan Garrison. He has also worked in intelligence in Guam.
He is married to Jeanine Carrier, and they have a daughter and two sons, Margaret, Michael and Liam.
Intelligence career[edit]
Air Intelligence Agency[edit]
From 1996 to 1997, Hayden served as Commander of the AIA, an agency of 16,000 charged with defending and exploiting the "information domain."[13]
National Security Agency[edit]
Hayden served as the Director of the National Security Agency and Chief of the Central Security Service at Fort George G. Meade, Maryland from March 1999 to April 2005. As the Director of NSA and Chief of CSS, he was responsible for a combat support agency of the Department of Defense with military and civilian personnel stationed worldwide.[14]
Strategy for the NSA[edit]
Hayden came to the NSA at a time of great trouble in the agency. Internal government analysis indicated it suffered from a lack of quality management and an outdated IT infrastructure. In fact soon after he came on board, a huge part of the NSA network system crashed and was down for several days. Part of his plan to revitalize the agency was to introduce more outside contractors, induce a lot of old managers to retire and get rid of old management structures. Part of his plan also included increased openness at the agency; it had historically been one of the most secretive organs of government. He notably allowed James Bamford access for his book Body of Secrets.[15] Hayden was also initially extremely concerned with following the laws against domestic surveillance. Many reports say that after 9/11, he became more concerned with stopping terrorism, and allegedly softened his stance against domestic surveillance.[15][16][17][18] Hayden however has said that he believed everything the agency was doing was "effective, appropriate, and lawful".[19]
On 9/11, Hayden immediately evacuated all non-essential personnel from NSA headquarters. After 9/11, the agency greatly increased its activity. Details about its operations have been largely hidden, but it played a major role in the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and the War on Terror. One notable example is its relationship with the unmanned aerial vehicle 'drone' program.[20][page needed]
Wiretaps of domestic communication[edit]
In May 2006, USA Today reported that, under Hayden's leadership, the NSA created a domestic telephone call database. During his nomination hearings, Hayden defended his actions to Senator Russ Feingold and others, stating that he had relied upon legal advice from the White House that building the database was supported by Article Two of the United States Constitution executive branch powers (in which the President must "take care that the laws be faithfully executed"), overriding legislative branch statutes forbidding warrantless surveillance of domestic calls, which included the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). Previously, this action would have required a warrant from a FISA court. The stated purpose of the database was to eavesdrop on international communications between persons within the U.S. and individuals and groups overseas in order to locate terrorists.[21]
Trailblazer[edit]
Hayden also championed the Trailblazer Project, a "transformation" project with a large Information Technology component. The project was criticized by several NSA staffers for not including privacy protections for US citizens and for being a waste of money. The critics included Diane S Roark, of the House Intelligence Committee, NSA workers Thomas Andrews Drake, William Binney, J. Kirk Wiebe, and Loomis, and others. Hayden severely rebuked these critics. Several quit in protest. After investigations by the NSA inspector general, the DOD inspector general, and Congress, Trailblazer was shut down.[19]
Principal Deputy Director of National Intelligence[edit]

This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (June 2008)


As part of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, the CIA chief no longer would run the intelligence community. Instead a new office was created for this purpose; the Director of National Intelligence. General Hayden became the Principal Deputy Director of National Intelligence from May 2005 to May 2006 under the first DNI, John Negroponte.
Civil liberties[edit]
On January 23, 2006, Hayden participated in a news conference.[22] A YouTube video[23] was posted of Michael Hayden telling reporters at a press conference that "probable cause" is not required for all searches or seizures under the Fourth Amendment, correctly indicating instead that the standard is whether the search or seizure is reasonable. "Probable cause" is required for a warrant if the search or seizure is deemed to be "unreasonable."

Hayden referred to people who believed that torture of CIA detainees has never yielded useful intelligence as "interrogation deniers".[24]
Director of the Central Intelligence Agency[edit]




Michael Hayden speaking at the 2015 Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in National Harbor, Maryland on February 27, 2015.


On May 8, 2006, Hayden was nominated by President George W. Bush to be Director of the Central Intelligence Agency after the resignation of Porter J. Goss on May 5, 2006.[25] He was later confirmed on May 26, 2006, as Director, 78–15, by full U.S. Senate vote.[26]
Critics of the nomination and Hayden's attempts to increase domestic surveillance included Senator Dianne Feinstein who stated on May 11, 2006, that "I happen to believe we are on our way to a major constitutional confrontation on Fourth Amendment guarantees of unreasonable search and seizure".[27]
Hayden has been accused of lying to Congress during his 2007 testimony about the CIA's 'enhanced interrogation program.[28][29]
In 2007, Hayden lobbied to allow the CIA to conduct drone strikes purely on the behavior of ground vehicles, with no further evidence of connection to terrorism.[30]
In 2008 Hayden warned from the destabilizing consequences of Muslim migration to Europe that might raise the possibility of civil unrest.[31]
In 2013, after the P5+1 reached a nuclear agreement with Iran, Hayden said, "We have accepted Iranian uranium enrichment."[32]
The 2014 Senate Intelligence Committee report on CIA torture cited an email prepared by a subordinate that indicated that as CIA Director, Hayden instructed that out-of-date information be used in briefing Congress so that fewer than 100 Guantanamo Bay detainees would be reported.[33]
NSA spying scandal[edit]
See also: Global surveillance disclosures (2013–present)
In September 2013, Hayden stressed the indisputable legality of "what the NSA is doing" and called Edward Snowden a "troubled young man", albeit "morally arrogant to a tremendous degree"; he also said about his prospects in Russia: "I suspect he will end up like most of the rest of the defectors who went to the old Soviet Union: Isolated, bored, lonely, depressed—and most of them ended up alcoholics."[34]

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

Duquesne University Alumni Association

For some, the Duquesne experience is a cherished family legacy; for others, it started with a visit as a high school student. Some complete online programs without ever setting foot on campus. More important than when or where it began is the fact that it never ends.
Duquesne is always with you, in the distinctive ruby ring, in the academic foundation for your professional career, and most of all, in the Spiritan values of respect for -- and service to -- others that you live each day.
The mission of the Office of Alumni Engagement is to create opportunities for alumni to foster lifelong engagement, affinity and pride within the Duquesne community to further the mission of the University.
We invite you to stay connected with the University community, attend alumni events, share your time and talent as a volunteer, and make a gift to support the aspects of Duquesne that mean the most to you.









Registration is now open for Homecoming & Reunion Weekend!

Caption   The beginning of the president’s term has featured controversial executive orders and frequent conflicts with the media.  March 17, 2017 President Donald Trump, first lady Melania Trump and their son, Barron, walk to Marine One at the White House en route to Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Fla. Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post  Buy Photo          Wait 1 second to continue.            By Michael V. Hayden  By Michael V. Hayden  February 5      Michael V. Hayden, a principal at the Chertoff Group and visiting professor at George Mason University’s Schar School of Policy and Government, was director of the National Security Agency from 1999 to 2005 and the Central Intelligence Agency from 2006 to 2009.   President Trump’s executive order on immigration was ill-conceived, poorly implemented and ill-explained. To be fair, it would have been hard to explain since it was not the product of intelligence and security professionals demanding change, but rather policy, political and ideological personalities close to the president fulfilling a campaign promise to deal with a threat they had overhyped.  I’ve heard from a lot of intelligence professionals who are going to have to live with the consequences. They noted that six of the seven countries involved in the ban (Iran being somewhat an exception) are troubled, fragmented states where human sources are essential to defeating threats to the United States.  Paradoxically, they pointed out how the executive order breached faith with those very sources, many of whom they had promised to always protect with the full might of our government and our people. Sources who had risked much, if not all, to keep Americans safe. I understood their angst. As CIA director, I reminded them at their case officer graduations that, when they recruited a source, they would likely be the only face of America that the source would see. And that in the act of recruitment they would assume a powerful and permanent moral responsibility for the well-being of the source and his or her loved ones.      (Jayne Orenstein,Dalton Bennett,Natalie Jennings/The Washington Post)   The case officers believed that they were also empowered to offer the full faith and credit of the American nation for that task. Now, they told me, that promise was eroding. Some will quibble that this, at least technically, is not really the case. That this is a temporary ban (maybe) and exceptions can be made (possibly). But as a former station chief told me, in the places where intelligence officers operate, rumor, whisper and conspiratorial chatter rule people’s lives. It doesn’t take paranoia to connect the action of the executive order with the hateful, anti-Islamic language of the campaign. In the Middle East, with its honor-based cultures, it’s easier to recruit someone we have been shooting at than it is to recruit someone whose society has been insulted. As the station chief reminded me, the fundamental posture of an intelligence service looking for sources is that “We welcome you, you have value. Our society respects you. More than your own.” He feared that would no longer be the powerful American message it once was.  The simple idea of America didn’t hurt either. The station chief said that one of the fundamentals of his business was selling the dream. The Soviets “had a hard time with that. We had it easy. A lot of intelligence targets — officials, military figures, African revolutionaries, tribal leaders — railed against our policies, our interventions, many things . . . but they loved America. It was the idea of the country as a special place. They didn’t necessarily want to go there, but it was a place they kept in their minds where they would be welcome.” The station chief and I knew Mohammed Shahwani, an Iraqi and American hero. Shawani carried the Iraqi flag at the 1960 Rome Olympics and later became a war hero as a commander of a special forces unit in the war against Iran. His popularity grew to a point where Saddam Hussein viewed him as a threat and he had to flee for his life.  Shahwani settled in Leesburg, Va., from where the United States convinced him after the invasion of Iraq to return to set up and run Iraq’s post-Hussein intelligence service. A Sunni, he established a nonsectarian service that was a trusted, professional partner to the CIA and U.S. forces. Not sectarian enough for Shiite Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, Shahwani was eventually sacked as U.S. influence waned. Shahwani acted because he was an Iraqi patriot, but also because he was welcomed and sheltered by the United States, and believed he would be again.         1 of 25       Full Screen Autoplay  Close                                                                       Skip Ad   ×           Travelers affected by ban begin to arrive in U.S. after Trump order is suspended      View Photos   After a federal judge in Seattle temporarily blocked enforcement of President Trump’s travel ban, government authorities immediately told airlines to allow travel by those who had been barred, a U.S. official said.    Caption   After a federal judge in Seattle temporarily blocked enforcement of President Trump’s travel ban, government authorities immediately told airlines to allow travel by those who had been barred, a U.S. official said.   Feb. 6, 2017 Muhamad Alhaj Moustafa, an internal medicine resident at MedStar Washington Hospital Center, embraces his wife, Nabila Alhaffar, after her arrival at Dulles International Airport. She had been temporarily blocked from returning to the United States after a trip to Qatar to see family. Melina Mara/The Washington Post  Buy Photo          Wait 1 second to continue.           Of course, today any members of Shahwani’s family still in Iraq are forbidden to enter the United States. My station chief asks, “How would you look him in the eye these days and promise him we’d take care of him and the men who follow him? What do you tell him to tell those men? We’ll take care of them no matter what? That our president is shoulder to shoulder with them?” Great questions, since we are at war in Iraq today and desperately need partners of Shahwani’s character. These effects will not pass quickly. These are not short-term, transactional societies. Insults rarely just fade away. Honor patiently waits to be satisfied. In the meantime, we will be left with the weak and the merely avaricious, agents who will cut a deal just for the money, the worst kind of sources.  To all the tough-guy ideological thinkers who created this, professional CIA case officers will do what they can to deal with the unnecessary burden you have given them.  But in the future you might want to consult them — before you rush proclamations out the door.

I told them that free people always had to decide where to draw the line between their liberty and their security. I noted that the attacks would almost certainly push us as a nation more toward security.
Michael Hayden


Free,
Liberty,
Security



















When asked if I miss being in government, I usually try to lighten the moment by responding that I awake most days, read the paper, and then observe that, 'It's yet another great day to be the former director of the Central Intelligence Agency.'
Michael Hayden


Great,
Intelligence,
Day
























There's this movie, 'Zero Dark Thirty' about the hunt for Osama bin Laden. Some have complained that too many 'secrets' were dished out by the intelligence and special operations communities to director Kathryn Bigelow, screenwriter Mark Boal and their crew, part of a broader pattern of using intelligence for political effect.
Michael Hayden


Intelligence,
Dark,
Secrets



















When I was at the CIA I asked my civilian advisory board to tackle some tough questions. Among the toughest: In a political culture that every day demands more transparency and more public accountability from every aspect of national life, could American intelligence continue to survive and succeed? That jury is still out.
Michael Hayden


Life,
Intelligence,
Day



















When I was director of the CIA, I knew that we had been - and I'm choosing my words very carefully here - effective in our expansion. We really had - expansion of government agencies and expansion of use of contractors. Effective, we were; efficient, we weren't. And so, as director of the CIA, I went after the inefficiencies part.
Michael Hayden


Words,
Government,
Here



















My literal responsibility as director of the CIA with regard to covert action was to inform the Congress - not to seek their approval; to inform.
Michael Hayden


Responsibility,
Action



















Global security can be formed or threatened by heads of state whose wisdom, folly and obsessions shape global events. But often it is the security practitioners, those rarely in the headlines but whose craft and energy quietly break new ground, who keep us safe or put us in peril.
Michael Hayden


Wisdom,
Energy,
Security



















I used to have a little saying I used when people said, 'What are your priorities?' I'd give them a bit of government alphabet soup. I'd say 'CTCPROW: Counterterrorism, counterproliferation, rest of the world.'
Michael Hayden


World,
Government,
People



















There is no part of the executive branch that more exists on the outer edge of executive prerogative than the American intelligence community - the intelligence community, CIA, covert action. My literal responsibility as director of CIA with regard to covert action was to inform the Congress - not to seek their approval, to inform.
Michael Hayden


Community,
Intelligence
























A writer of fiction lives in fear. Each new day demands new ideas, and he can never be sure whether he is going to come up with them or not.
Michael Hayden


Fear,
Day,
New Day



















American political elites feel very empowered to criticize the American intelligence community for not doing enough when they feel in danger, and as soon as we've made them feel safe again, they feel equally empowered to complain that we're doing too much.
Michael Hayden


Community,
Intelligence



















I enjoyed writing in school. I don't know that I was all that good at it in school. I worked at it later. I feel comfortable writing now. I enjoy writing now. I suspect, like most college students, I viewed writing then to be more tedious.
Michael Hayden


Good,
Writing,
School



















People have a right to privacy, but they also have a right to live. Fundamentally, we need cybersecurity and need to secure communications as well.
Michael Hayden

There's still a lot of things you can legitimately do to make America safe through electronic surveillance.
Michael Hayden


America,
You,
Still



















To be perfectly candid, we're better at stealing other people's secrets than anyone else in the world. But we self-limit. We steal secrets to keep our citizens free and safe.
Michael Hayden


World,
Free,
People
























Apple and Google want to create encryption for which they could not provide you the key. Their business model will not survive if the American government has a special relationship with them that requires them to surrender this kind of information.
Michael Hayden


Business,
Relationship



















National security looks different from the Oval Office than it does from a hotel room in Iowa.
Michael Hayden


Security,
Hotel,
Office



















If we are going to conduct espionage in the future, we are going to have to make some changes in the relationship between the intelligence community and the public it serves.
Michael Hayden


Relationship,
Future



















Nothing more threatens Vladimir Putin than not being able to track his own citizens.
Michael Hayden


Citizens,
More,
Nothing



















The Constitution defends all of us against unreasonable search and seizure. What constitutes reasonableness depends upon threat.
Michael Hayden


Search,
Constitution,
Us



















Accusations fit on a bumper sticker; the truth takes longer.
Michael Hayden


Truth,
Fit,
Longer



















The problem with cyber weapons for a country like ours is the ability to control them.
Michael Hayden


Control,
Problem,
Country
























When I became director of CIA, it was just clear to me intuitively, without a whole lot of science behind it, that we had expanded rapidly and inefficiently. So I arbitrarily picked a number, 10 percent, and I said over the next 12 months, we are going to reduce our reliance on contractors by 10 percent.
Michael Hayden


Science,
Me,
Over



















My personal view is that Iran, left to its own devices, will get itself to that step right below a nuclear weapon, that permanent breakout stage, so the needle isn't quite in the red for the international community. And, frankly, that will be as destabilizing as their actually having a weapon.
Michael Hayden


Community,
Red,
Step



















Responsibility demands action, and dealing with the immediate threat must naturally be a top priority.
Michael Hayden


Responsibility,
Action,
Top



















If Snowden really claims that his actions amounted to genuine civil disobedience, he should go to some English language bookstore in Moscow and get a copy of Henry David Thoreau's 'Civil Disobedience'.
Michael Hayden

Sign up   *Invalid email address   Got it   Got it                  Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. (Evan Vucci/Associated Press)   By Michael V. Hayden  By Michael V. Hayden  November 3, 2016      Michael V. Hayden, a principal at the Chertoff Group and visiting professor at George Mason University’s Schar School of Policy and Government, was director of the National Security Agency from 1999 to 2005 and the Central Intelligence Agency from 2006 to 2009.     I know I’m not the first to notice this, but Donald Trump really does sound a lot like Vladimir Putin. There has always been a sympathetic authoritarian chord between the Republican presidential nominee and the Russian president. Both are on record as admiring The Strong Leader. They’ve even complimented one another on the trait. Putin could have been humming along when Trump was claiming “I alone can fix it” during his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention. Maybe he was. Each seems to have a pretty conspiratorial view of the world, too. Putin comes by his naturally. He’s a product of a KGB Marxist philosophy where “the other” — any other — is reflexively identified as hostile and created by immutable forces of history, something to be feared and ultimately crushed.      At a rally in Springfield, Ohio, Oct. 27, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said he wished the U.S. “actually got along with Russia” so they could defeat the Islamic State together. (The Washington Post)   Trump seems to view business a bit that way. At least I don’t recall a lot of win-win vocabulary when he touts his dealmaking skills.  [The only way Trump can win]  At the political level, Trump sees quite a few powerful “others” in the American electoral process: a corrupt media, international banks, unrestricted immigrants, a variety of globalists, free-traders and (at least some) Muslims. It’s a list Putin could second or, in some cases, jail or worse. Sounding simultaneously populist and a little bit the conspiratorial Marxist, Trump has claimed that these unseen forces could rig the U.S. election. It’s a theme that Putin is happy to echo. Indeed, it’s a theme that his intelligence services are happy to actively propagate. And in that case, the American presidential candidate routinely comes to the defense of his Russian soul mate. In the face of a high-confidence judgment of the U.S. intelligence community that Russia hacked the Democratic National Committee and then weaponized embarrassing emails to sow confusion here, the man who would be president has declared: “Our country has no idea,” “I don’t think anybody knows it was Russia that broke into the DNC. . . . It could also be lots of other people” and “They always blame Russia.”  Rejecting a fact-based intelligence assessment — not because of compelling contrarian data, but because it is inconsistent with a preexisting worldview — that’s the stuff of ideological authoritarianism, not pragmatic democracy. And it is frightening. Trump also echoes Putin when it comes to Syria and the Islamic State, or ISIS. Here he follows the Moscow line that we and the Russians have common purpose and that Russia and Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad (and Iran) are “killing ISIS.”  Actually, they are not. They are bucking up the Assad regime that, if anyone is keeping score, has killed more innocents than the Islamic State and Jabhat al-Nusra, the al-Qaeda affiliate, have combined. And the attractiveness of the Islamic State and al-Qaeda to Sunni Muslims is a direct byproduct of the depredations of the Assad regime — the regime that Russia saved from collapse a year ago.  [Here’s how you destroy a democratic republic]  It’s a little complicated, I suppose, but not so hard that it explains or justifies the willful ignorance that Trump seems to display. His second debate formulation — “I don’t like Assad at all, but Assad is killing ISIS” — is precisely the formulation that the Syrian president has been attempting to craft. “It’s me or the terrorists” has been his false dilemma. It’s hard to explain how the candidate of a major American political party could have gotten there, especially after receiving classified intelligence briefings.  Perhaps some of this is explained by the murky ties of some on team Trump to things Russian. There is certainly a history there, and perhaps a comfort level as well. Former campaign manager Paul Manafort did consulting work for the now-discredited but decidedly pro-Russian regime of Viktor Yanokovych in Ukraine, and recent revelations in Kiev have stoked questions about whether Manafort should have registered here as working on behalf of a foreign power.   Manafort denies any role in July’s successful effort to suppress a Republican platform pledge to provide lethal defensive weapons to the Ukrainians in their continuing battle against separatists and the Russian army. Although it’s clear that the suppression was initiated by Trump staffers, Trump has denied any personal responsibility for it. The whole episode was too quickly forgotten; it begs explanation. Then there’s Carter Page, an adviser with intermittent contacts with the campaign, but with deep ties to Russian money, oil and gas, who has blamed aggressive Western policies for the mess in the Ukraine and what he describes as the “so-called annexation of Crimea.” So-called?   [Dear Donald Trump: I want my $49 back]  And what about the money? Although Trump has said, “I have zero investments in Russia,” his son Donald Jr. conceded in 2008 that “Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets . . . we see a lot of money pouring in from Russia.” Absent more detailed data (such as tax returns), who knows? We have really never seen anything like this. Former acting CIA director Michael Morell says that Putin has cleverly recruited Trump as an unwitting agent of the Russian Federation.  I’d prefer another term drawn from the arcana of the Soviet era: polezni durak. That’s the useful fool, some naif, manipulated by Moscow, secretly held in contempt, but whose blind support is happily accepted and exploited. That’s a pretty harsh term, and Trump supporters will no doubt be offended. But, frankly, it’s the most benign interpretation of all this that I can come up with right now.

Michael Vincent Hayden (born March 17, 1945) is a retired United States Air Force four-star general and former Director of the National Security Agency, Principal Deputy Director of National Intelligence, and Director of the Central Intelligence Agency. Hayden currently co-chairs the Bipartisan Policy Center's Electric Grid Cyber Security Initiative.[4] In 2017, Hayden became a national security analyst for CNN.[5]
He was Director of the National Security Agency (NSA) from 1999 to 2005. During his tenure as director, he oversaw the controversial NSA surveillance of technological communications between persons in the United States and alleged foreign terrorist groups, which resulted in the NSA warrantless surveillance controversy.
On April 21, 2005, then Lt. Gen Hayden, was confirmed by the United States Senate as the first Principal Deputy Director of National Intelligence and awarded his fourth star-making him "the highest-ranking military intelligence officer in the armed forces".[6] He served in this position under DNI John Negroponte until May 26, 2006.
On May 8, 2006, Hayden was nominated for the position of CIA Director following the May 5 resignation of Porter J. Goss, and on May 23 the Senate Intelligence Committee voted 12–3 to send the nomination to the Senate floor. His nomination was confirmed by the United States Senate on May 26 by a vote of 78–15. On May 30, 2006, and again the following day at the CIA lobby with President George W. Bush in attendance, Hayden was sworn in as the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency.

On July 1, 2008, Hayden retired from the Air Force after over 41 years of service and continued to serve as Director of the CIA until February 12, 2009.[7] He received an honorary doctorate from the Institute of World Politics in Washington, DC in 2009. He is currently a principal at the Chertoff Group, a security consultancy co-founded by former Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff.[8] Hayden also serves as a Distinguished Visiting Professor at George Mason University's Schar School of Policy and Government. He was elected to the Board of Directors of Motorola Solutions effective January 4, 2011.[9]

Early life, career, and family[edit]
Michael Vincent Hayden was born on March 17, 1945, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to an Irish-American couple, Sadie (Murray) and Harry V. Hayden Jr.,[10] who worked as a welder for a Pennsylvania manufacturing company. He has a sister, Debby, and a brother, Harry.
He went to St. Peter's Elementary school where, in 7th and 8th grade he played quarterback on the school football team then being coached by the late Dan Rooney, the son of the founder of the Pittsburgh Steelers, and former Chairman of the team. Michael Hayden graduated from North Catholic High School. One of Hayden's first jobs was as an equipment manager for the Steelers.[11] Hayden went on to Duquesne University in Pittsburgh where he earned a B.A. in history in 1967 and was commissioned as a second lieutenant. He then attended graduate school at Duquesne for an M.A. in modern American history. He continues to be an avid fan of the hometown Pittsburgh Steelers, since the 1990s travelling with his wife and family to at least 3–4 games a year.[11]
He was commissioned through University of Pittsburgh's Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps program.[12] Hayden entered active military service in 1969.
Hayden has served as commander of the Air Intelligence Agency and Director of the Joint Command and Control Warfare Center, both headquartered at Lackland Air Force Base. He also has served in senior staff positions in the Pentagon; Headquarters U.S. European Command, Stuttgart, Germany; the National Security Council, Washington, D.C., and the U.S. Embassy in the then-People's Republic of Bulgaria. Prior to becoming Director of the National Security Agency, the general served as deputy chief of staff for United Nations Command and U.S. Forces Korea, Yongsan Garrison. He has also worked in intelligence in Guam.
He is married to Jeanine Carrier, and they have a daughter and two sons, Margaret, Michael and Liam.
Intelligence career[edit]
Air Intelligence Agency[edit]
From 1996 to 1997, Hayden served as Commander of the AIA, an agency of 16,000 charged with defending and exploiting the "information domain."[13]
National Security Agency[edit]
Hayden served as the Director of the National Security Agency and Chief of the Central Security Service at Fort George G. Meade, Maryland from March 1999 to April 2005. As the Director of NSA and Chief of CSS, he was responsible for a combat support agency of the Department of Defense with military and civilian personnel stationed worldwide.[14]
Strategy for the NSA[edit]
Hayden came to the NSA at a time of great trouble in the agency. Internal government analysis indicated it suffered from a lack of quality management and an outdated IT infrastructure. In fact soon after he came on board, a huge part of the NSA network system crashed and was down for several days. Part of his plan to revitalize the agency was to introduce more outside contractors, induce a lot of old managers to retire and get rid of old management structures. Part of his plan also included increased openness at the agency; it had historically been one of the most secretive organs of government. He notably allowed James Bamford access for his book Body of Secrets.[15] Hayden was also initially extremely concerned with following the laws against domestic surveillance. Many reports say that after 9/11, he became more concerned with stopping terrorism, and allegedly softened his stance against domestic surveillance.[15][16][17][18] Hayden however has said that he believed everything the agency was doing was "effective, appropriate, and lawful".[19]
On 9/11, Hayden immediately evacuated all non-essential personnel from NSA headquarters. After 9/11, the agency greatly increased its activity. Details about its operations have been largely hidden, but it played a major role in the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and the War on Terror. One notable example is its relationship with the unmanned aerial vehicle 'drone' program.[20][page needed]
Wiretaps of domestic communication[edit]
In May 2006, USA Today reported that, under Hayden's leadership, the NSA created a domestic telephone call database. During his nomination hearings, Hayden defended his actions to Senator Russ Feingold and others, stating that he had relied upon legal advice from the White House that building the database was supported by Article Two of the United States Constitution executive branch powers (in which the President must "take care that the laws be faithfully executed"), overriding legislative branch statutes forbidding warrantless surveillance of domestic calls, which included the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). Previously, this action would have required a warrant from a FISA court. The stated purpose of the database was to eavesdrop on international communications between persons within the U.S. and individuals and groups overseas in order to locate terrorists.[21]
Trailblazer[edit]
Hayden also championed the Trailblazer Project, a "transformation" project with a large Information Technology component. The project was criticized by several NSA staffers for not including privacy protections for US citizens and for being a waste of money. The critics included Diane S Roark, of the House Intelligence Committee, NSA workers Thomas Andrews Drake, William Binney, J. Kirk Wiebe, and Loomis, and others. Hayden severely rebuked these critics. Several quit in protest. After investigations by the NSA inspector general, the DOD inspector general, and Congress, Trailblazer was shut down.[19]
Principal Deputy Director of National Intelligence[edit]

This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (June 2008)


As part of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, the CIA chief no longer would run the intelligence community. Instead a new office was created for this purpose; the Director of National Intelligence. General Hayden became the Principal Deputy Director of National Intelligence from May 2005 to May 2006 under the first DNI, John Negroponte.
Civil liberties[edit]
On January 23, 2006, Hayden participated in a news conference.[22] A YouTube video[23] was posted of Michael Hayden telling reporters at a press conference that "probable cause" is not required for all searches or seizures under the Fourth Amendment, correctly indicating instead that the standard is whether the search or seizure is reasonable. "Probable cause" is required for a warrant if the search or seizure is deemed to be "unreasonable."

Hayden referred to people who believed that torture of CIA detainees has never yielded useful intelligence as "interrogation deniers".[24]
Director of the Central Intelligence Agency[edit]




Michael Hayden speaking at the 2015 Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in National Harbor, Maryland on February 27, 2015.


On May 8, 2006, Hayden was nominated by President George W. Bush to be Director of the Central Intelligence Agency after the resignation of Porter J. Goss on May 5, 2006.[25] He was later confirmed on May 26, 2006, as Director, 78–15, by full U.S. Senate vote.[26]
Critics of the nomination and Hayden's attempts to increase domestic surveillance included Senator Dianne Feinstein who stated on May 11, 2006, that "I happen to believe we are on our way to a major constitutional confrontation on Fourth Amendment guarantees of unreasonable search and seizure".[27]
Hayden has been accused of lying to Congress during his 2007 testimony about the CIA's 'enhanced interrogation program.[28][29]
In 2007, Hayden lobbied to allow the CIA to conduct drone strikes purely on the behavior of ground vehicles, with no further evidence of connection to terrorism.[30]
In 2008 Hayden warned from the destabilizing consequences of Muslim migration to Europe that might raise the possibility of civil unrest.[31]
In 2013, after the P5+1 reached a nuclear agreement with Iran, Hayden said, "We have accepted Iranian uranium enrichment."[32]
The 2014 Senate Intelligence Committee report on CIA torture cited an email prepared by a subordinate that indicated that as CIA Director, Hayden instructed that out-of-date information be used in briefing Congress so that fewer than 100 Guantanamo Bay detainees would be reported.[33]
NSA spying scandal[edit]
See also: Global surveillance disclosures (2013–present)
In September 2013, Hayden stressed the indisputable legality of "what the NSA is doing" and called Edward Snowden a "troubled young man", albeit "morally arrogant to a tremendous degree"; he also said about his prospects in Russia: "I suspect he will end up like most of the rest of the defectors who went to the old Soviet Union: Isolated, bored, lonely, depressed—and most of them ended up alcoholics."[34]

Michael Vincent Hayden (born March 17, 1945) is a retired United States Air Force four-star general and former Director of the National Security Agency, Principal Deputy Director of National Intelligence, and Director of the Central Intelligence Agency. Hayden currently co-chairs the Bipartisan Policy Center's Electric Grid Cyber Security Initiative.[4] In 2017, Hayden became a national security analyst for CNN.[5]
He was Director of the National Security Agency (NSA) from 1999 to 2005. During his tenure as director, he oversaw the controversial NSA surveillance of technological communications between persons in the United States and alleged foreign terrorist groups, which resulted in the NSA warrantless surveillance controversy.
On April 21, 2005, then Lt. Gen Hayden, was confirmed by the United States Senate as the first Principal Deputy Director of National Intelligence and awarded his fourth star-making him "the highest-ranking military intelligence officer in the armed forces".[6] He served in this position under DNI John Negroponte until May 26, 2006.
On May 8, 2006, Hayden was nominated for the position of CIA Director following the May 5 resignation of Porter J. Goss, and on May 23 the Senate Intelligence Committee voted 12–3 to send the nomination to the Senate floor. His nomination was confirmed by the United States Senate on May 26 by a vote of 78–15. On May 30, 2006, and again the following day at the CIA lobby with President George W. Bush in attendance, Hayden was sworn in as the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency.

On July 1, 2008, Hayden retired from the Air Force after over 41 years of service and continued to serve as Director of the CIA until February 12, 2009.[7] He received an honorary doctorate from the Institute of World Politics in Washington, DC in 2009. He is currently a principal at the Chertoff Group, a security consultancy co-founded by former Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff.[8] Hayden also serves as a Distinguished Visiting Professor at George Mason University's Schar School of Policy and Government. He was elected to the Board of Directors of Motorola Solutions effective January 4, 2011.[9]

Early life, career, and family[edit]
Michael Vincent Hayden was born on March 17, 1945, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to an Irish-American couple, Sadie (Murray) and Harry V. Hayden Jr.,[10] who worked as a welder for a Pennsylvania manufacturing company. He has a sister, Debby, and a brother, Harry.
He went to St. Peter's Elementary school where, in 7th and 8th grade he played quarterback on the school football team then being coached by the late Dan Rooney, the son of the founder of the Pittsburgh Steelers, and former Chairman of the team. Michael Hayden graduated from North Catholic High School. One of Hayden's first jobs was as an equipment manager for the Steelers.[11] Hayden went on to Duquesne University in Pittsburgh where he earned a B.A. in history in 1967 and was commissioned as a second lieutenant. He then attended graduate school at Duquesne for an M.A. in modern American history. He continues to be an avid fan of the hometown Pittsburgh Steelers, since the 1990s travelling with his wife and family to at least 3–4 games a year.[11]
He was commissioned through University of Pittsburgh's Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps program.[12] Hayden entered active military service in 1969.
Hayden has served as commander of the Air Intelligence Agency and Director of the Joint Command and Control Warfare Center, both headquartered at Lackland Air Force Base. He also has served in senior staff positions in the Pentagon; Headquarters U.S. European Command, Stuttgart, Germany; the National Security Council, Washington, D.C., and the U.S. Embassy in the then-People's Republic of Bulgaria. Prior to becoming Director of the National Security Agency, the general served as deputy chief of staff for United Nations Command and U.S. Forces Korea, Yongsan Garrison. He has also worked in intelligence in Guam.
He is married to Jeanine Carrier, and they have a daughter and two sons, Margaret, Michael and Liam.
Intelligence career[edit]
Air Intelligence Agency[edit]
From 1996 to 1997, Hayden served as Commander of the AIA, an agency of 16,000 charged with defending and exploiting the "information domain."[13]
National Security Agency[edit]
Hayden served as the Director of the National Security Agency and Chief of the Central Security Service at Fort George G. Meade, Maryland from March 1999 to April 2005. As the Director of NSA and Chief of CSS, he was responsible for a combat support agency of the Department of Defense with military and civilian personnel stationed worldwide.[14]
Strategy for the NSA[edit]
Hayden came to the NSA at a time of great trouble in the agency. Internal government analysis indicated it suffered from a lack of quality management and an outdated IT infrastructure. In fact soon after he came on board, a huge part of the NSA network system crashed and was down for several days. Part of his plan to revitalize the agency was to introduce more outside contractors, induce a lot of old managers to retire and get rid of old management structures. Part of his plan also included increased openness at the agency; it had historically been one of the most secretive organs of government. He notably allowed James Bamford access for his book Body of Secrets.[15] Hayden was also initially extremely concerned with following the laws against domestic surveillance. Many reports say that after 9/11, he became more concerned with stopping terrorism, and allegedly softened his stance against domestic surveillance.[15][16][17][18] Hayden however has said that he believed everything the agency was doing was "effective, appropriate, and lawful".[19]
On 9/11, Hayden immediately evacuated all non-essential personnel from NSA headquarters. After 9/11, the agency greatly increased its activity. Details about its operations have been largely hidden, but it played a major role in the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and the War on Terror. One notable example is its relationship with the unmanned aerial vehicle 'drone' program.[20][page needed]
Wiretaps of domestic communication[edit]
In May 2006, USA Today reported that, under Hayden's leadership, the NSA created a domestic telephone call database. During his nomination hearings, Hayden defended his actions to Senator Russ Feingold and others, stating that he had relied upon legal advice from the White House that building the database was supported by Article Two of the United States Constitution executive branch powers (in which the President must "take care that the laws be faithfully executed"), overriding legislative branch statutes forbidding warrantless surveillance of domestic calls, which included the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). Previously, this action would have required a warrant from a FISA court. The stated purpose of the database was to eavesdrop on international communications between persons within the U.S. and individuals and groups overseas in order to locate terrorists.[21]
Trailblazer[edit]
Hayden also championed the Trailblazer Project, a "transformation" project with a large Information Technology component. The project was criticized by several NSA staffers for not including privacy protections for US citizens and for being a waste of money. The critics included Diane S Roark, of the House Intelligence Committee, NSA workers Thomas Andrews Drake, William Binney, J. Kirk Wiebe, and Loomis, and others. Hayden severely rebuked these critics. Several quit in protest. After investigations by the NSA inspector general, the DOD inspector general, and Congress, Trailblazer was shut down.[19]
Principal Deputy Director of National Intelligence[edit]

This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (June 2008)


As part of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, the CIA chief no longer would run the intelligence community. Instead a new office was created for this purpose; the Director of National Intelligence. General Hayden became the Principal Deputy Director of National Intelligence from May 2005 to May 2006 under the first DNI, John Negroponte.
Civil liberties[edit]
On January 23, 2006, Hayden participated in a news conference.[22] A YouTube video[23] was posted of Michael Hayden telling reporters at a press conference that "probable cause" is not required for all searches or seizures under the Fourth Amendment, correctly indicating instead that the standard is whether the search or seizure is reasonable. "Probable cause" is required for a warrant if the search or seizure is deemed to be "unreasonable."

Hayden referred to people who believed that torture of CIA detainees has never yielded useful intelligence as "interrogation deniers".[24]
Director of the Central Intelligence Agency[edit]




Michael Hayden speaking at the 2015 Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in National Harbor, Maryland on February 27, 2015.


On May 8, 2006, Hayden was nominated by President George W. Bush to be Director of the Central Intelligence Agency after the resignation of Porter J. Goss on May 5, 2006.[25] He was later confirmed on May 26, 2006, as Director, 78–15, by full U.S. Senate vote.[26]
Critics of the nomination and Hayden's attempts to increase domestic surveillance included Senator Dianne Feinstein who stated on May 11, 2006, that "I happen to believe we are on our way to a major constitutional confrontation on Fourth Amendment guarantees of unreasonable search and seizure".[27]
Hayden has been accused of lying to Congress during his 2007 testimony about the CIA's 'enhanced interrogation program.[28][29]
In 2007, Hayden lobbied to allow the CIA to conduct drone strikes purely on the behavior of ground vehicles, with no further evidence of connection to terrorism.[30]
In 2008 Hayden warned from the destabilizing consequences of Muslim migration to Europe that might raise the possibility of civil unrest.[31]
In 2013, after the P5+1 reached a nuclear agreement with Iran, Hayden said, "We have accepted Iranian uranium enrichment."[32]
The 2014 Senate Intelligence Committee report on CIA torture cited an email prepared by a subordinate that indicated that as CIA Director, Hayden instructed that out-of-date information be used in briefing Congress so that fewer than 100 Guantanamo Bay detainees would be reported.[33]
NSA spying scandal[edit]
See also: Global surveillance disclosures (2013–present)
In September 2013, Hayden stressed the indisputable legality of "what the NSA is doing" and called Edward Snowden a "troubled young man", albeit "morally arrogant to a tremendous degree"; he also said about his prospects in Russia: "I suspect he will end up like most of the rest of the defectors who went to the old Soviet Union: Isolated, bored, lonely, depressed—and most of them ended up alcoholics."[34]

Michael Vincent Hayden (born March 17, 1945) is a retired United States Air Force four-star general and former Director of the National Security Agency, Principal Deputy Director of National Intelligence, and Director of the Central Intelligence Agency. Hayden currently co-chairs the Bipartisan Policy Center's Electric Grid Cyber Security Initiative.[4] In 2017, Hayden became a national security analyst for CNN.[5]
He was Director of the National Security Agency (NSA) from 1999 to 2005. During his tenure as director, he oversaw the controversial NSA surveillance of technological communications between persons in the United States and alleged foreign terrorist groups, which resulted in the NSA warrantless surveillance controversy.
On April 21, 2005, then Lt. Gen Hayden, was confirmed by the United States Senate as the first Principal Deputy Director of National Intelligence and awarded his fourth star-making him "the highest-ranking military intelligence officer in the armed forces".[6] He served in this position under DNI John Negroponte until May 26, 2006.
On May 8, 2006, Hayden was nominated for the position of CIA Director following the May 5 resignation of Porter J. Goss, and on May 23 the Senate Intelligence Committee voted 12–3 to send the nomination to the Senate floor. His nomination was confirmed by the United States Senate on May 26 by a vote of 78–15. On May 30, 2006, and again the following day at the CIA lobby with President George W. Bush in attendance, Hayden was sworn in as the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency.

On July 1, 2008, Hayden retired from the Air Force after over 41 years of service and continued to serve as Director of the CIA until February 12, 2009.[7] He received an honorary doctorate from the Institute of World Politics in Washington, DC in 2009. He is currently a principal at the Chertoff Group, a security consultancy co-founded by former Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff.[8] Hayden also serves as a Distinguished Visiting Professor at George Mason University's Schar School of Policy and Government. He was elected to the Board of Directors of Motorola Solutions effective January 4, 2011.[9]

Early life, career, and family[edit]
Michael Vincent Hayden was born on March 17, 1945, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to an Irish-American couple, Sadie (Murray) and Harry V. Hayden Jr.,[10] who worked as a welder for a Pennsylvania manufacturing company. He has a sister, Debby, and a brother, Harry.
He went to St. Peter's Elementary school where, in 7th and 8th grade he played quarterback on the school football team then being coached by the late Dan Rooney, the son of the founder of the Pittsburgh Steelers, and former Chairman of the team. Michael Hayden graduated from North Catholic High School. One of Hayden's first jobs was as an equipment manager for the Steelers.[11] Hayden went on to Duquesne University in Pittsburgh where he earned a B.A. in history in 1967 and was commissioned as a second lieutenant. He then attended graduate school at Duquesne for an M.A. in modern American history. He continues to be an avid fan of the hometown Pittsburgh Steelers, since the 1990s travelling with his wife and family to at least 3–4 games a year.[11]
He was commissioned through University of Pittsburgh's Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps program.[12] Hayden entered active military service in 1969.
Hayden has served as commander of the Air Intelligence Agency and Director of the Joint Command and Control Warfare Center, both headquartered at Lackland Air Force Base. He also has served in senior staff positions in the Pentagon; Headquarters U.S. European Command, Stuttgart, Germany; the National Security Council, Washington, D.C., and the U.S. Embassy in the then-People's Republic of Bulgaria. Prior to becoming Director of the National Security Agency, the general served as deputy chief of staff for United Nations Command and U.S. Forces Korea, Yongsan Garrison. He has also worked in intelligence in Guam.
He is married to Jeanine Carrier, and they have a daughter and two sons, Margaret, Michael and Liam.
Intelligence career[edit]
Air Intelligence Agency[edit]
From 1996 to 1997, Hayden served as Commander of the AIA, an agency of 16,000 charged with defending and exploiting the "information domain."[13]
National Security Agency[edit]
Hayden served as the Director of the National Security Agency and Chief of the Central Security Service at Fort George G. Meade, Maryland from March 1999 to April 2005. As the Director of NSA and Chief of CSS, he was responsible for a combat support agency of the Department of Defense with military and civilian personnel stationed worldwide.[14]
Strategy for the NSA[edit]
Hayden came to the NSA at a time of great trouble in the agency. Internal government analysis indicated it suffered from a lack of quality management and an outdated IT infrastructure. In fact soon after he came on board, a huge part of the NSA network system crashed and was down for several days. Part of his plan to revitalize the agency was to introduce more outside contractors, induce a lot of old managers to retire and get rid of old management structures. Part of his plan also included increased openness at the agency; it had historically been one of the most secretive organs of government. He notably allowed James Bamford access for his book Body of Secrets.[15] Hayden was also initially extremely concerned with following the laws against domestic surveillance. Many reports say that after 9/11, he became more concerned with stopping terrorism, and allegedly softened his stance against domestic surveillance.[15][16][17][18] Hayden however has said that he believed everything the agency was doing was "effective, appropriate, and lawful".[19]
On 9/11, Hayden immediately evacuated all non-essential personnel from NSA headquarters. After 9/11, the agency greatly increased its activity. Details about its operations have been largely hidden, but it played a major role in the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and the War on Terror. One notable example is its relationship with the unmanned aerial vehicle 'drone' program.[20][page needed]
Wiretaps of domestic communication[edit]
In May 2006, USA Today reported that, under Hayden's leadership, the NSA created a domestic telephone call database. During his nomination hearings, Hayden defended his actions to Senator Russ Feingold and others, stating that he had relied upon legal advice from the White House that building the database was supported by Article Two of the United States Constitution executive branch powers (in which the President must "take care that the laws be faithfully executed"), overriding legislative branch statutes forbidding warrantless surveillance of domestic calls, which included the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). Previously, this action would have required a warrant from a FISA court. The stated purpose of the database was to eavesdrop on international communications between persons within the U.S. and individuals and groups overseas in order to locate terrorists.[21]
Trailblazer[edit]
Hayden also championed the Trailblazer Project, a "transformation" project with a large Information Technology component. The project was criticized by several NSA staffers for not including privacy protections for US citizens and for being a waste of money. The critics included Diane S Roark, of the House Intelligence Committee, NSA workers Thomas Andrews Drake, William Binney, J. Kirk Wiebe, and Loomis, and others. Hayden severely rebuked these critics. Several quit in protest. After investigations by the NSA inspector general, the DOD inspector general, and Congress, Trailblazer was shut down.[19]
Principal Deputy Director of National Intelligence[edit]

This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (June 2008)


As part of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, the CIA chief no longer would run the intelligence community. Instead a new office was created for this purpose; the Director of National Intelligence. General Hayden became the Principal Deputy Director of National Intelligence from May 2005 to May 2006 under the first DNI, John Negroponte.
Civil liberties[edit]
On January 23, 2006, Hayden participated in a news conference.[22] A YouTube video[23] was posted of Michael Hayden telling reporters at a press conference that "probable cause" is not required for all searches or seizures under the Fourth Amendment, correctly indicating instead that the standard is whether the search or seizure is reasonable. "Probable cause" is required for a warrant if the search or seizure is deemed to be "unreasonable."

Hayden referred to people who believed that torture of CIA detainees has never yielded useful intelligence as "interrogation deniers".[24]
Director of the Central Intelligence Agency[edit]




Michael Hayden speaking at the 2015 Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in National Harbor, Maryland on February 27, 2015.


On May 8, 2006, Hayden was nominated by President George W. Bush to be Director of the Central Intelligence Agency after the resignation of Porter J. Goss on May 5, 2006.[25] He was later confirmed on May 26, 2006, as Director, 78–15, by full U.S. Senate vote.[26]
Critics of the nomination and Hayden's attempts to increase domestic surveillance included Senator Dianne Feinstein who stated on May 11, 2006, that "I happen to believe we are on our way to a major constitutional confrontation on Fourth Amendment guarantees of unreasonable search and seizure".[27]
Hayden has been accused of lying to Congress during his 2007 testimony about the CIA's 'enhanced interrogation program.[28][29]
In 2007, Hayden lobbied to allow the CIA to conduct drone strikes purely on the behavior of ground vehicles, with no further evidence of connection to terrorism.[30]
In 2008 Hayden warned from the destabilizing consequences of Muslim migration to Europe that might raise the possibility of civil unrest.[31]
In 2013, after the P5+1 reached a nuclear agreement with Iran, Hayden said, "We have accepted Iranian uranium enrichment."[32]
The 2014 Senate Intelligence Committee report on CIA torture cited an email prepared by a subordinate that indicated that as CIA Director, Hayden instructed that out-of-date information be used in briefing Congress so that fewer than 100 Guantanamo Bay detainees would be reported.[33]
NSA spying scandal[edit]
See also: Global surveillance disclosures (2013–present)
In September 2013, Hayden stressed the indisputable legality of "what the NSA is doing" and called Edward Snowden a "troubled young man", albeit "morally arrogant to a tremendous degree"; he also said about his prospects in Russia: "I suspect he will end up like most of the rest of the defectors who went to the old Soviet Union: Isolated, bored, lonely, depressed—and most of them ended up alcoholics."[34]

Michael Vincent Hayden (born March 17, 1945) is a retired United States Air Force four-star general and former Director of the National Security Agency, Principal Deputy Director of National Intelligence, and Director of the Central Intelligence Agency. Hayden currently co-chairs the Bipartisan Policy Center's Electric Grid Cyber Security Initiative.[4] In 2017, Hayden became a national security analyst for CNN.[5]
He was Director of the National Security Agency (NSA) from 1999 to 2005. During his tenure as director, he oversaw the controversial NSA surveillance of technological communications between persons in the United States and alleged foreign terrorist groups, which resulted in the NSA warrantless surveillance controversy.
On April 21, 2005, then Lt. Gen Hayden, was confirmed by the United States Senate as the first Principal Deputy Director of National Intelligence and awarded his fourth star-making him "the highest-ranking military intelligence officer in the armed forces".[6] He served in this position under DNI John Negroponte until May 26, 2006.
On May 8, 2006, Hayden was nominated for the position of CIA Director following the May 5 resignation of Porter J. Goss, and on May 23 the Senate Intelligence Committee voted 12–3 to send the nomination to the Senate floor. His nomination was confirmed by the United States Senate on May 26 by a vote of 78–15. On May 30, 2006, and again the following day at the CIA lobby with President George W. Bush in attendance, Hayden was sworn in as the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency.

On July 1, 2008, Hayden retired from the Air Force after over 41 years of service and continued to serve as Director of the CIA until February 12, 2009.[7] He received an honorary doctorate from the Institute of World Politics in Washington, DC in 2009. He is currently a principal at the Chertoff Group, a security consultancy co-founded by former Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff.[8] Hayden also serves as a Distinguished Visiting Professor at George Mason University's Schar School of Policy and Government. He was elected to the Board of Directors of Motorola Solutions effective January 4, 2011.[9]

Early life, career, and family[edit]
Michael Vincent Hayden was born on March 17, 1945, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to an Irish-American couple, Sadie (Murray) and Harry V. Hayden Jr.,[10] who worked as a welder for a Pennsylvania manufacturing company. He has a sister, Debby, and a brother, Harry.
He went to St. Peter's Elementary school where, in 7th and 8th grade he played quarterback on the school football team then being coached by the late Dan Rooney, the son of the founder of the Pittsburgh Steelers, and former Chairman of the team. Michael Hayden graduated from North Catholic High School. One of Hayden's first jobs was as an equipment manager for the Steelers.[11] Hayden went on to Duquesne University in Pittsburgh where he earned a B.A. in history in 1967 and was commissioned as a second lieutenant. He then attended graduate school at Duquesne for an M.A. in modern American history. He continues to be an avid fan of the hometown Pittsburgh Steelers, since the 1990s travelling with his wife and family to at least 3–4 games a year.[11]
He was commissioned through University of Pittsburgh's Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps program.[12] Hayden entered active military service in 1969.
Hayden has served as commander of the Air Intelligence Agency and Director of the Joint Command and Control Warfare Center, both headquartered at Lackland Air Force Base. He also has served in senior staff positions in the Pentagon; Headquarters U.S. European Command, Stuttgart, Germany; the National Security Council, Washington, D.C., and the U.S. Embassy in the then-People's Republic of Bulgaria. Prior to becoming Director of the National Security Agency, the general served as deputy chief of staff for United Nations Command and U.S. Forces Korea, Yongsan Garrison. He has also worked in intelligence in Guam.
He is married to Jeanine Carrier, and they have a daughter and two sons, Margaret, Michael and Liam.
Intelligence career[edit]
Air Intelligence Agency[edit]
From 1996 to 1997, Hayden served as Commander of the AIA, an agency of 16,000 charged with defending and exploiting the "information domain."[13]
National Security Agency[edit]
Hayden served as the Director of the National Security Agency and Chief of the Central Security Service at Fort George G. Meade, Maryland from March 1999 to April 2005. As the Director of NSA and Chief of CSS, he was responsible for a combat support agency of the Department of Defense with military and civilian personnel stationed worldwide.[14]
Strategy for the NSA[edit]
Hayden came to the NSA at a time of great trouble in the agency. Internal government analysis indicated it suffered from a lack of quality management and an outdated IT infrastructure. In fact soon after he came on board, a huge part of the NSA network system crashed and was down for several days. Part of his plan to revitalize the agency was to introduce more outside contractors, induce a lot of old managers to retire and get rid of old management structures. Part of his plan also included increased openness at the agency; it had historically been one of the most secretive organs of government. He notably allowed James Bamford access for his book Body of Secrets.[15] Hayden was also initially extremely concerned with following the laws against domestic surveillance. Many reports say that after 9/11, he became more concerned with stopping terrorism, and allegedly softened his stance against domestic surveillance.[15][16][17][18] Hayden however has said that he believed everything the agency was doing was "effective, appropriate, and lawful".[19]
On 9/11, Hayden immediately evacuated all non-essential personnel from NSA headquarters. After 9/11, the agency greatly increased its activity. Details about its operations have been largely hidden, but it played a major role in the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and the War on Terror. One notable example is its relationship with the unmanned aerial vehicle 'drone' program.[20][page needed]
Wiretaps of domestic communication[edit]
In May 2006, USA Today reported that, under Hayden's leadership, the NSA created a domestic telephone call database. During his nomination hearings, Hayden defended his actions to Senator Russ Feingold and others, stating that he had relied upon legal advice from the White House that building the database was supported by Article Two of the United States Constitution executive branch powers (in which the President must "take care that the laws be faithfully executed"), overriding legislative branch statutes forbidding warrantless surveillance of domestic calls, which included the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). Previously, this action would have required a warrant from a FISA court. The stated purpose of the database was to eavesdrop on international communications between persons within the U.S. and individuals and groups overseas in order to locate terrorists.[21]
Trailblazer[edit]
Hayden also championed the Trailblazer Project, a "transformation" project with a large Information Technology component. The project was criticized by several NSA staffers for not including privacy protections for US citizens and for being a waste of money. The critics included Diane S Roark, of the House Intelligence Committee, NSA workers Thomas Andrews Drake, William Binney, J. Kirk Wiebe, and Loomis, and others. Hayden severely rebuked these critics. Several quit in protest. After investigations by the NSA inspector general, the DOD inspector general, and Congress, Trailblazer was shut down.[19]
Principal Deputy Director of National Intelligence[edit]

This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (June 2008)


As part of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, the CIA chief no longer would run the intelligence community. Instead a new office was created for this purpose; the Director of National Intelligence. General Hayden became the Principal Deputy Director of National Intelligence from May 2005 to May 2006 under the first DNI, John Negroponte.
Civil liberties[edit]
On January 23, 2006, Hayden participated in a news conference.[22] A YouTube video[23] was posted of Michael Hayden telling reporters at a press conference that "probable cause" is not required for all searches or seizures under the Fourth Amendment, correctly indicating instead that the standard is whether the search or seizure is reasonable. "Probable cause" is required for a warrant if the search or seizure is deemed to be "unreasonable."

Hayden referred to people who believed that torture of CIA detainees has never yielded useful intelligence as "interrogation deniers".[24]
Director of the Central Intelligence Agency[edit]




Michael Hayden speaking at the 2015 Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in National Harbor, Maryland on February 27, 2015.


On May 8, 2006, Hayden was nominated by President George W. Bush to be Director of the Central Intelligence Agency after the resignation of Porter J. Goss on May 5, 2006.[25] He was later confirmed on May 26, 2006, as Director, 78–15, by full U.S. Senate vote.[26]
Critics of the nomination and Hayden's attempts to increase domestic surveillance included Senator Dianne Feinstein who stated on May 11, 2006, that "I happen to believe we are on our way to a major constitutional confrontation on Fourth Amendment guarantees of unreasonable search and seizure".[27]
Hayden has been accused of lying to Congress during his 2007 testimony about the CIA's 'enhanced interrogation program.[28][29]
In 2007, Hayden lobbied to allow the CIA to conduct drone strikes purely on the behavior of ground vehicles, with no further evidence of connection to terrorism.[30]
In 2008 Hayden warned from the destabilizing consequences of Muslim migration to Europe that might raise the possibility of civil unrest.[31]
In 2013, after the P5+1 reached a nuclear agreement with Iran, Hayden said, "We have accepted Iranian uranium enrichment."[32]
The 2014 Senate Intelligence Committee report on CIA torture cited an email prepared by a subordinate that indicated that as CIA Director, Hayden instructed that out-of-date information be used in briefing Congress so that fewer than 100 Guantanamo Bay detainees would be reported.[33]
NSA spying scandal[edit]
See also: Global surveillance disclosures (2013–present)
In September 2013, Hayden stressed the indisputable legality of "what the NSA is doing" and called Edward Snowden a "troubled young man", albeit "morally arrogant to a tremendous degree"; he also said about his prospects in Russia: "I suspect he will end up like most of the rest of the defectors who went to the old Soviet Union: Isolated, bored, lonely, depressed—and most of them ended up alcoholics."[34]

About Playing to the Edge
An unprecedented high-level master narrative of America’s intelligence wars, demonstrating in a time of new threats that espionage and the search for facts are essential to our democracy For General Michael Hayden, playing to the edge means playing so close to the line that you get chalk dust on your cleats. Otherwise, by playing back, you may protect yourself, but you will be less successful in protecting America. “Play to the edge” was Hayden’s guiding principle when he ran the National Security Agency, and it remained so when he ran CIA.  In his view, many shortsighted and uninformed people are quick to criticize, and this book will give them much to chew on but little easy comfort; it is an unapologetic insider’s look told from the perspective of the people who faced awesome responsibilities head on, in the moment.  How did American intelligence respond to terrorism, a major war and the most sweeping technological revolution in the last 500 years?  What was NSA before 9/11 and how did it change in its aftermath?  Why did NSA begin the controversial terrorist surveillance program that included the acquisition of domestic phone records? What else was set in motion during this period that formed the backdrop for the infamous Snowden revelations in 2013?    As Director of CIA in the last three years of the Bush administration, Hayden had to deal with the rendition, detention and interrogation program as bequeathed to him by his predecessors. He also had to ramp up the agency to support its role in the targeted killing program that began to dramatically increase in July 2008. This was a time of great crisis at CIA, and some agency veterans have credited Hayden with actually saving the agency. He himself won’t go that far, but he freely acknowledges that CIA helped turn the American security establishment into the most effective killing machine in the history of armed conflict. For 10 years, then, General Michael Hayden was a participant in some of the most telling events in the annals of American national security. General Hayden’s goals are in writing this book are simple and unwavering: No apologies. No excuses. Just what happened. And why. As he writes, “There is a story here that deserves to be told, without varnish and without spin. My view is my view, and others will certainly have different perspectives, but this view deserves to be told to create as complete a history as possible of these turbulent times. I bear no grudges, or at least not many, but I do want this to be a straightforward and readable history for that slice of the American population who depend on and appreciate intelligence, but who do not have the time to master its many obscure characteristics.”
