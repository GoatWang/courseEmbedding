	Remark Media Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2016 Results




	Increased fourth quarter 2016 revenue by 27% over fourth quarter of 2015









	Remark Media, Inc. (NASDAQ: MARK), a global digital media technology company, reported its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2016.









	“Our fourth quarter performance provides a strong close to a very successful year for us,” said Kai-Shing Tao, Remark Media's Chairman and CEO. “We achieved several developmental and commercialization milestones related to our KanKan Data Intelligence Platform, including our expansion of KanKan from a social media network into a business-to-business solution and the introduction of new products. We are partnering with companies such as Alibaba Cloud and TenCent to deploy enterprise and precision marketing solutions that leverage our unprecedented data set. In fact, our KanKan Open Artificial Intelligence Platform recently received the “best break-through technology” award from Alibaba. Out of 400 companies invited to participate, KanKan was ranked the number one start-up affiliated with the Alibaba eco-system. In addition, we are introducing proprietary products - such as KanKan Social Credit Service - that utilize the KanKan Data Intelligence Platform to address unmet needs in the China marketplace.









	“Our Vegas.com business is also performing well, highlighting the operational improvements we have made since the acquisition in 2015. In fact, in 18 months’ time, we have successfully turned around a business with no growth into a business with projected double-digit EBITDA growth on an annual basis. We continue to enhance the technologies and website features that reinforce Vegas.com’s position as the official website for Las Vegas entertainment. In fact, of the top 20 show ticket sales days in Vegas.com history, 18 have occurred since Christmas Day of 2016, and all 20 have occurred since we acquired Vegas.com in September 2015.





















	“In addition, our acquisition of FansTang during the third quarter of 2016 provided us with a comprehensive digital media content platform and a prominent portfolio of partnerships with leading brands around the world. We believe we have established a formidable set of synergistic assets, each of which presents significant monetization opportunities in the months and years ahead. We are excited about our ability to accelerate our growth in 2017.”

	Remark Media Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2016 Results




	Increased fourth quarter 2016 revenue by 27% over fourth quarter of 2015




	To hold a conference call today at 4:30 p.m. ET / 1:30 p.m. PT to discuss financial results









	LAS VEGAS, NV - March 30, 2017


	 - Remark Media, Inc. (NASDAQ: MARK), a global digital media technology company, reported its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2016.









	“Our fourth quarter performance provides a strong close to a very successful year for us,” said Kai-Shing Tao, Remark Media's Chairman and CEO. “We achieved several developmental and commercialization milestones related to our KanKan Data Intelligence Platform, including our expansion of KanKan from a social media network into a business-to-business solution and the introduction of new products. We are partnering with companies such as Alibaba Cloud and TenCent to deploy enterprise and precision marketing solutions that leverage our unprecedented data set. In fact, our KanKan Open Artificial Intelligence Platform recently received the “best break-through technology” award from Alibaba. Out of 400 companies invited to participate, KanKan was ranked the number one start-up affiliated with the Alibaba eco-system. In addition, we are introducing proprietary products - such as KanKan Social Credit Service - that utilize the KanKan Data Intelligence Platform to address unmet needs in the China marketplace.









	“Our Vegas.com business is also performing well, highlighting the operational improvements we have made since the acquisition in 2015. In fact, in 18 months’ time, we have successfully turned around a business with no growth into a business with projected double-digit EBITDA growth on an annual basis. We continue to enhance the technologies and website features that reinforce Vegas.com’s position as the official website for Las Vegas entertainment. In fact, of the top 20 show ticket sales days in Vegas.com history, 18 have occurred since Christmas Day of 2016, and all 20 have occurred since we acquired Vegas.com in September 2015.









	“In addition, our acquisition of FansTang during the third quarter of 2016 provided us with a comprehensive digital media content platform and a prominent portfolio of partnerships with leading brands around the world. We believe we have established a formidable set of synergistic assets, each of which presents significant monetization opportunities in the months and years ahead. We are excited about our ability to accelerate our growth in 2017.”

BBB Accreditation





                BBB Accredited Since 01/18/2014
            

                BBB has determined that Remark Media Inc meets Standards of BBB Accreditation, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            

                BBB accreditation does not mean that the business's products or services have been evaluated or endorsed by BBB, or that BBB has made a determination as to the business's product quality or competency in performing services.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB:

5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.
