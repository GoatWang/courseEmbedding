  Product DescriptionProduct DetailsFamed for his charming illustrations of elves, fairies, and gnomes, the prominent Victorian artist Richard Doyle (1824-1883) produced a host of these delightful characters for The Princess Nobody: A Tale of Fairyland, a book he created with British author Andrew Lang in 1884.Illustrator Marty Noble has skillfully adapted 29 of the English artist's most delightful watercolors from that enchanting book. Brimming with a multitude of nature’s tiniest creatures of the air, field, and stream, the collection also features pixies, imps, and a petite princess and an equally diminutive prince. These captivating figures can be brought to life by colorists and fairyland devotees as they apply their own hues to enchanting scenes of mischievous sprites at play.

Item Description: Bradbury and Evans, London, 1848. Hardcover. Book Condition: g- to vg. First edition. Quarto. [12]pp (Almanach), 266pp. (Vol. XIV), IV, 280pp. (Vol. XV). Contemporary 3/4 calf over cloth, with gold lettering and ruling on spine. Binding signed by Bedford & Ogle, Worthing. Founded on 17 July 1841 by Henry Mayhew and engraver Ebenezer Landells, "Punch, or the London Charivari" was a British weekly magazine of humour and satire. Historically, it was most influential in the 1840s and 50s, when it helped to coin the term "cartoon" in its modern sense as a humorous illustration. This bound volume contains all the "Punch" issues published during the fateful year of 1848, which witnessed the most widespread revolutionary wave in European history. However, within a year, reactionary forces had regained control, and the revolutions collapsed. Both volumes contain numerous illustrations by John Leech, Richard Doyle, John Tenniel and Charles Keene. Includes full-page caricatures of Louis-Philippe, Louis Napoleon Bonaparte, Lord Clarendon, Lamartine, Cavaignac, and many others. Index at the end of each volume. Binding rubbed along edges. Gold lettering on spine slightly faded. Page 21/22 of volume XIV misbound, and placed between pages 12 and 13 of the same volume. Pages 107-116 of volume XV trimmed along margin (not affecting text or illustrations). Binding in overall good- to good, interior in very good condition.  Bookseller Inventory # 37980
