Pimco's Commodity Fund is not really a commodity fund


Quote


Postby Browser » Wed Jun 12, 2013 4:36 pm 
Most investors who own PIMCO's real return commodity fund (PCRAX, PCRIX) think they are investing in a commodity futures fund.  Turns out they are investing in a leveraged hybrid bond/commodity fund.  Not a very good option for investors who are seeking commodity exposure in  order to diversify their portfolios, and now it's starting to bite:Last month, the largest commodities fund in the world, the Pimco Commodity Real Return Strategy Fund, fell more than 5 percent, while the worst-performing broad commodities ETF fell slightly more than 2 percent. What gives?A quick look at the holdings list of PCRAX confirms this. As of March 31, PCRAX held everything from Bear Sterns Adjustable Rate Mortgage Trusts to Petrobras corporate debt to Mexican sovereign bonds. In fact, the bulk of the fund’s $16 billion asset tally is invested in TIPS, and the portfolio has an effective maturity and duration of six and 4.6 years, respectively.All of this is to say that PCRAX, like many strategies that provide this type of collateral optimization, are leveraged products that aren’t labeled as such.Why then doesn’t anyone call PCRAX a leveraged fund when it’s clear the collateral in the portfolio is exposed to everything from default risk to geopolitical risk? Considering that most people use commodities and the products that aggregate them as a means to diversify away from credit and equity exposure, why would they want to invite these risks into the commodity portion of their portfolios?http://www.indexuniverse.com/hot-topics/18949-investing-in-commodities-without-leverage.html
We don't know where we are, or where we're going -- but we're making good time.

This fund has always been a black box.  Could never figure out holdings or investment strategy.

Any Commodity Fund of the total return type, will have to utilise  some form of collateral for the Futures that provide the underlying Commodity Exposure. Usually the funds use short-term Treasuries, but Pimco has tried to boost the yield from this collateral by taking more duration and credit risk, and it backfired this time.Personally I like this enhancement, and think it will be a value-added long-run, but also have difficulty understanding why a company like Pimco who also provide tail hedging expertise was not on top of this..there are likely more to the story than we know.

FWIWThere is NO LEVERAGE AND NEVER HAS BEEN ANY.This is just a mistake that is repeated in the pressLeverage means borrowing money to increase the investment in the asset, in this case would be to over 100%, like the Rydex funds doThe only difference here is that PIMCO chooses not to invest the collateral in three month bills, which is the index benchmark--instead they actively manage the collateral with large amounts in TIPS and then some in diversified positions in riskier assets. But there is no leverageLarry

I read the same article the other day.  The author uses the word 'leverage' in a very funny and, I would consider, non-standard---even misleading---manner.  This fund takes the collateral and, instead of investing it in T-bills, as the index assumes, invests it in bonds with longer term (mostly intermediate TIPs) and has a bit of bonds with extra credit risk over treasuries.  So the collateral is invested with a higher risk profile than T-bills.  I think the article's author is trying to say that this higher risk profile is equivilent to leveraging a portfolio of T-bills until it has higher risk.  That may be true in some technical sense, but it seems quite odd to equate term risk with leverage.  And the author doesn't explain what he actually means; he spouts the word 'leverage', even though the fund clearly says it does no borrowing.  I consider it a rather poorly written article that's trying to put a scary slant on something innocuous, in order to drum up interest.  If he'd wanted to say commodities are risky or that term risk is real, he could have just said that.

Here's how the article defines leverage:It’s therefore a matter of perception and how one defines leverage. When you hold a commodity ETF, the requirement is that all cash collateral be invested in cash or cash equivalents.Any departure from this, by definition, represents the introduction of leverage. Meanwhile, PCRAX invests 100 percent of its portfolio’s collateral in a wide range of debt instruments, none of which expires less than a year from now.The author feels that an unleveraged position in commodity futures is defined as holding the collateral in riskless cash (e.g, 3-month treasury bills).  As I understand it, If you use that collateral to invest in riskier assets, you are actually leveraging the cash by effectively  "borrowing" it from riskless collateral  to invest it in something else that is more risky.  In any event, investors should understand that these  PIMCO funds are not pure commodity futures funds.  They are funds that invest in commodity futures, bonds, currencies, and other assets.  There is a much higher correlation between the returns of the PIMCO funds and bond returns than there is for pure, or "unleveraged" commodity funds and ETFs.  Many investors wish to include commodity futures in their investment portfolios because of the relatively low correlation of their returns to the returns of stocks and bonds, and they want to have a relatively precise idea of what percentage of their portfolio is allocated to commodity futures, per se.  The PIMCO funds are not well-suited to this strategy.

Here's the author's own response to question about leverage"While I agree with your assertion that investors understand the term "leverage" to describe a fund that borrows money to enhance returns, the fact that PCRAX's cash collateral is being invested in assets (some riskier than others) other than cash with the aim of enhancing returns should at least make one reconsider how they define the term leverage. That was the goal of the article. After a month where PCRAX fell twice as much as the most widely followed commodities indexes, I felt the question worth asking. It is the largest commodities fund on earth after all.

Consider two S&P 500 index funds. Fund A buys index futures and invests its collateral in a money market fund. Fund B buys index futures and invests its collateral in long term treasuries.If an investor in fund A wanted to replicate the return of fund B, he would have to borrow money on margin and invest the borrowed money in long term treasuries. That's leverage, right? So it would be inconsistent to say that fund B isn't leveraged.

Yes it means more risk and it means that one should consider that risk in the decision to use the fund and that amount of risk was one of the two reasons we shifted to DFA from PCRIXLarry

Can someone correct me if I am wrong.  This fund follows an index to invest in commodity futures.  So proportions of commodities it invests in are fairly constant.   It uses active management to select months to roll contracts to avoid common problems?  Uses active management to invest collateral which can be anything or is limited to bonds of all varieties?

I think the author is pointing out that funds often adopt the practice of investing in riskier securities because they are constrained from using leverage to boost returns.  I don''t know where I  heard that, maybe here.  Security risk is used as a proxy for leverage. That's what PIMCO is effectively doing.  Traders in commodity futures only have to put down a portion of the trade, and the balance is held in low-risk collateral to secure the position, usually 3-month T-Bills.  PIMCO is investing in riskier collateral in order to boost returns, it's that simple.  Is it leverage? Well, if it walks like leverage and it quacks like leverage....   I personally think that if an investor wants to invest in commodity futures as well as other securities such as TIPS they should do it via separate holdings so they know exactly what's going on.

NisipriusNo, if you are negative cash say 5% and other collateral is 105% your total collateral is 100% and there is no leverage. They don't borrow to raise the commodity exposure to more than 100%. Of that I am sureSorry too busy to write M*, but I have seen them make serious errorsNote just got back from two week trip to EuropeLarry

The Prospectus lists this under "risks:"Leveraging Risk: the risk that certain transactions of the Fund, such as reverse repurchase agreements, loans of portfolio securities, and the use of when-issued, delayed delivery or forward commitment transactions, or derivative instruments, may give rise to leverage, causing the Fund to be more volatile than if it had not been leveragedClicking around the PIMCO website's description doesn't really tell me anything about whether it engages in leverage, and doesn't say whether or not it is "fully collateralized." The "fact sheet" says "the fund actively manages the the exposure to commodity futures and collateralizes these positions with an actively managed portfolio of [TIPS]." I don't know whether "collateralizes" is generally understood to mean "fully collateralizes." Is it?I clicked around through various monthly market reports and fund overviews and annual reports to see if it said anything relevant but didn't find anything. The Annual Report mentions some specific holdings as collateralizing or being collateralized by others but I don't see my own way to figuring out whether things are "fully collateralized."The full description of the "principal investment strategy" is quoted below. It doesn't say "fully collateralized" in so many words, but understanding this language is above my pay grade and I'd appreciate some illumination.Is the language below that would tell us that it is fully collateralized and that it is unleveraged except perhaps for occasional anomalies? What is meant by "The Fund will seek to gain exposure to the commodity markets primarily through investments in leveraged or unleveraged commodity index-linked notes?"Principal Investment StrategiesThe Fund seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing under normal circumstances in commodity-linked derivative instruments backed by a portfolio of inflation-indexed securities and other Fixed Income Instruments. "Fixed Income Instruments" include bonds, debt securities and other similar instruments issued by various U.S. and non-U.S. public- or private-sector entities. "Real Return" equals total return less the estimated cost of inflation, which is typically measured by the change in an official inflation measure. The Fund invests in commodity-linked derivative instruments, including commodity index-linked notes, swap agreements, commodity options, futures and options on futures, that provide exposure to the investment returns of the commodities markets, without investing directly in physical commodities. Commodities are assets that have tangible properties, such as oil, metals, and agricultural products. The value of commodity-linked derivative instruments may be affected by overall market movements and other factors affecting the value of a particular industry or commodity, such as weather, disease, embargoes, or political and regulatory developments. The Fund may also invest in common and preferred stocks as well as convertible securities of issuers in commodity-related industries.The Fund will seek to gain exposure to the commodity markets primarily through investments in leveraged or unleveraged commodity index-linked notes, which are derivative debt instruments with principal and/or coupon payments linked to the performance of commodity indices, and through investments in the PIMCO Cayman Commodity Fund I Ltd., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Fund organized under the laws of the Cayman Islands (the "Subsidiary"). These commodity index-linked notes are sometimes referred to as "structured notes" because the terms of these notes may be structured by the issuer and the purchaser of the note. The value of these notes will rise or fall in response to changes in the underlying commodity or related index of investment. The Fund may also gain exposure to commodity markets by investing in the Subsidiary. The Subsidiary is advised by Pacific Investment Management Company LLC ("PIMCO"), and has the same investment objective as the Fund. As discussed in greater detail elsewhere in this prospectus, the Subsidiary (unlike the Fund) may invest without limitation in commodity-linked swap agreements and other commodity-linked derivative instruments.The derivative instruments in which the Fund and the Subsidiary primarily intend to invest are instruments linked to certain commodity indices and instruments linked to the value of a particular commodity or commodity futures contract, or a subset of commodities or commodity futures contracts. These instruments may specify exposure to commodity futures with different roll dates, reset dates or contract months than those specified by a particular commodity index. As a result, the commodity-linked derivatives component of the Fund's portfolio may deviate from the returns of any particular commodity index. The Fund or the Subsidiary may over-weight or under-weight its exposure to a particular commodity index, or a subset of commodities, such that the Fund has greater or lesser exposure to that index than the value of the Fund's net assets, or greater or lesser exposure to a subset of commodities than is represented by a particular commodity index. Such deviations will frequently be the result of temporary market fluctuations, and under normal circumstances the Fund will seek to maintain notional exposure to one or more commodity indices within 5% (plus or minus) of the value of the Fund's net assets.Assets not invested in commodity-linked derivative instruments or the Subsidiary may be invested in inflation-indexed securities and other Fixed Income Instruments, including derivative Fixed Income Instruments. The Fund is non-diversified, which means that it may invest its assets in a smaller number of issuers than a diversified fund. In addition, the Fund may invest its assets in particular sectors of the commodities market.The average portfolio duration of the fixed income portion of this Fund will vary based on PIMCO's forecast for interest rates and under normal market conditions is not expected to exceed ten years. Duration is a measure used to determine the sensitivity of a security's price to changes in interest rates. The longer a security's duration, the more sensitive it will be to changes in interest rates. The Fund may invest up to 10% of its total assets in high yield securities ("junk bonds") rated B or higher by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. ("Moody's"), or equivalently rated by Standard & Poor's Ratings Services ("S&P") or Fitch, Inc. ("Fitch"), or, if unrated, determined by PIMCO to be of comparable quality. The Fund may invest up to 30% of its total assets in securities denominated in foreign currencies and may invest beyond this limit in U.S. dollar-denominated securities of foreign issuers. The Fund may invest up to 10% of its total assets in securities and instruments that are economically tied to emerging market countries. The Fund will normally limit its foreign currency exposure (from non-U.S. dollar-denominated securities or currencies) to 20% of its total assets. The Fund may, without limitation, seek to obtain market exposure to the securities in which it primarily invests by entering into a series of purchase and sale contracts or by using other investment techniques (such as buy backs or dollar rolls). The Fund may also invest up to 10% of its total assets in preferred stocks. The Fund may purchase and sell securities on a when-issued, delayed delivery or forward commitment basis and may engage in short sales.

nisipriusAs I have explained in the past the prospectuses are written to give the fund great flexibility, typically far more than expected to be used by a passive fund. The reason this is the case is that they don't want to have to get permission to do something if an unusual market condition occurs and the action is not already in the prospectus. DFA does this all the time, never intending to do much of what is in the prospectus. It's just a fact of life in the business.You can trust me or not but I assure you there is no leverage used in the fund in the traditional sense of the word nor does the fund actively manage its commodities exposure (meaning it doesn't overweight wheat or underweight gold and so on). Their active management is limited to the actions I have described. And the same for DFALarry

Larry, my interest is in trying to learn how to figure out what's really in a fund and what investment rules the fund really follows. I won't get there, any more than I could ever make much out of the balance sheet in a company's annual report, but they put out this stuff that's supposed to be public information that you are supposed to be using to decide whether to invest in the fund, and I'm nibbling away on trying to learn how to decode it.If the truth is that the public fund information doesn't actually disclose enough for a retail investor to make an informed decision, because the published rules are not a reliable guide to the actual policies by which the fund is managed, and you need to access an insider to learn the unofficial rules and make an informed judgement, so be it--but I don't have to like it.(Yes, I think it sucks that Vanguard will invest >99% of a fund in an index, but not commit to investing more than 80% of it in that index...)Thank you for sharing your knowledge with the forum.

NispriusYes it's unfortunate but it's the way it is because of SEC rules.So fund families have to make the prospectuses so broad that they can often become meaningless in telling you want the fund really does. Otherwise they might be forced into expensive actions to address unique market situations and each time they want to change something they would have to go back and get shareholder approval which takes time and money That is why we insist on what is called an attribution analysis from the fund families we work with whenever there is significant deviation from the benchmark returns. We want to see what caused the deviation.If it's random events like perhaps a sector outperforms (and we don't care about sectors) and that sector is underweighted in the fund relative to an index then that's fine. Example is say REITS outperform value stocks than DFA value funds which don't include REITS because they are treated as separate asset class then that is fine. With PIMCO we became very concerned when the tracking error became very large and it was caused by the collateral management and the collateral taking more credit risk than we expected based on what we were told. We thought the vast majority would be in TIPS and very little in credit type products.With DFA we get an explanation of how their not using the five index roll dates impacts returns on how their use of the non front month impacts returns--just as an example.But we get this type analysis on all the funds we invest client assets in to make sure we understand what is happening and to make sure the fund is doing what it is "supposed to do"Larry

On the leverage question there should be a simple answer that does not require inspecting fund holdings. If the fund is leveraged then its beta on its index should be greater than 1.00. If it is not leveraged then its beta will be 1. The fund might well have to invest in leveraged instruments in order for the overall portfolio to have a beta of 1. That is part of the nature of a fund that has to maintain some lquid cash and hold some assets as collateral. I can sympathize that a fund has to write its prospectus broadly to avoid violating its self imposed restrictions when it takes an action in support of the stated goals of the fund.  It also makes sense that nonsynchronous trading may create fleeting arbitrage opportunities to invest in instruments that are components of the index. They might do this not because they think that wheat is cheap, for example, but because a particular wheat contract or derivative is cheap compared to the index as a whole, or to some other wheat derivative. At the microseond time course, such mispricings come up all the time, and some investors attempt to exploit them. Keeps the market efficient.

Leverage means more than just borrowing money.  The author is using the term in the broad sense, referring to the fact that PIMCO is attempting to add returns to it's commodity fund by taking on additional risk with the collateral.  They forgot that this multiplies losses as well as gains.In finance, leverage (sometimes referred to as gearing in the United Kingdom and Australia) is a general term for any technique to multiply gains and losses.Common ways to attain leverage are borrowing money, buying fixed assets and using derivatives. Important examples are:A public corporation may leverage its equity by borrowing money. The more it borrows, the less equity capital it needs, so any profits or losses are shared among a smaller base and are proportionately larger as a result.A business entity can leverage its revenue by buying fixed assets. This will increase the proportion of fixed, as opposed to variable, costs, meaning that a change in revenue will result in a larger change in operating income.Hedge funds often leverage their assets by using derivatives. A fund might get any gains or losses on $20 million worth of crude oil by posting $1 million of cash as margin.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leverage_(finance)
