Early life[edit]




Coat of Arms of Thomas Lynch, Jr.


He was born in Hopseewee Plantation in Prince George Parish, Winyah, in what is now Georgetown, South Carolina, the son of Thomas Lynch and his wife, Elizabeth Allston Lynch. Before Thomas Lynch Jr. was born, his parents had two daughters named Sabina and Esther who were born in 1747 and 1748. After his mother’s death in 1755, his father remarried Hannah Motte, the sister of Isaac Motte. In this marriage, they gave birth to a daughter named Elizabeth in 1755.[2] Lynch Jr.'s family originally emigrated from Austria to Kent, England. From there, they moved to Ireland and continued to South Carolina.[3] His father was a prominent figure in South Carolina politics which contributed to access of opportunity in high education and wealth.[4]

He was schooled at the Indigo Society School in Georgetown before his parents sent him to England, where he received honors at Eton College and at Gonville & Caius College, Cambridge.[1] He studied law and political philosophy at the Middle Temple in London. His father admired his English education and encouraged him to remain in Great Britain to study law and the principles of the British constitution.[3]
After eight years away from the America, he returned to South Carolina in 1772. Although it was his father's dream, Thomas Lynch Jr. decided to end his pursuit of a profession in law.
High school sweethearts, Lynch Jr. and Elizabeth Shubrick were married on May 14, 1772.[5] Following their marriage, the couple lived at Peach Tree Plantation which was located in close proximity to his homeland plantation.[5] Lynch Jr. enjoyed cultivating the land and remained active in political dialogue in his community.[5]
After his father's death due to a stroke, his widowed mother married another influential political figure, South Carolina Governor William Moultrie. Thomas' sister Elizabeth Lynch married James Hamilton; one of their sons was James Hamilton Jr., who became governor in the state in 1830.
Career[edit]

He was elected a member of the Provincial Congress on February 11, 1775. This committee was formed to prepare a plan of government and represent the people of South Carolina. Lynch Jr. served alongside with Charles Cotesworth Pickney, John Rutledge, Charles Pinckney, Henry Laurens, Christopher Gadsden, Rawlins Lowndes, Arthur Middleton, Henry Middleton, Thomas Bee, Thomas Heyward, Jr. in the Provincial Congress.[6] This group formed the South Carolina constitution. Many people objected to this document including The Continental Congress. It stood as a temporary constitution as many believed there would be reconciliation with Great Britain.[7]
Lynch became a company commander in the First South Carolina regiment on June 12, 1775. He was commissioned by the Provincial Congress. After being appointed, he gathered men and led a march into Charlestown, South Carolina. Amid the march, he became very sick with a bilious fever which prevented him from continuing.[3] When he recovered, he was unable to fulfill his position in a proper way. During his recovery, he received news about his father's declining health.[3] In hope that he could manage his father's illness, he asked his commanding officer, Colonel Christopher Gadsden if he could travel to Philadelphia.[3] His request was denied originally, but after receiving news of his election to the Continental Congress, he was allowed to travel to his father.
On March 23, 1776, the General Assembly of South Carolina Lynch to the Continental Congress as a sixth delegate.[citation needed] Although he was ill, Lynch Jr. traveled to Philadelphia to sign the Declaration of Independence. Thomas Lynch, Sr. and Thomas Lynch, Jr. were the only father and son to serve in the Continental Congress.[3] Lynch Jr. signed the Declaration of Independence along with Arthur Middleton, Thomas Heyward Jr., Edward Rutledge.[8] He was the second youngest delegate in the Continental Congress and filled in his father's place due to illness.[4] The youngest signer, South Carolinian Edward Rutledge was younger by three months.[citation needed] Thomas Lynch Jr. risked his life with this signature which stood against the country where he received his education.
After signing the Declaration of Independence, an ill Thomas Lynch Jr. set out for home with his ailing father. On the way to South Carolina, his father suffered a second stroke and died in Annapolis, Maryland, in December 1776.[2] Thomas Lynch Jr. retired in early 1777.[citation needed]
Legacy[edit]
After two more years of illness in South Carolina where he resided with his wife at Peachtree Plantation on the South Santee River, many suggested that Thomas Lynch Jr. travel to Europe in search for a different atmosphere.[2] Despite the dangers, he and his wife sailed for respite on a vessel to St. Eustatius in the West Indies in late 1779. The ship is known to have disappeared shortly after, standing as the last record of his life. Elizabeth and Thomas Lynch, Jr. having fathered no children, died at sea in 1779.[citation needed] At the age of 30, he was the youngest signer of the Declaration to die.
Before Thomas Lynch, Jr. died at sea, he made a will requiring that the heirs of his female relatives change their last name to Lynch in order to inherit his family estate.[5] His sister, Sabina responded by changing her name. She and her husband owned and managed the property until their son was of age.[5] Their son, John Bowman Lynch and his wife had three male children but all died in the American Civil War.[5]




The autograph letter signed by Lynch Jr. and Taylor is dated November 1780 and refers to business in Taylor's trade of ironmongery. This is one of the few signatures left of his name.


Thomas Lynch Jr. is one of the rarest signers of the Declaration of Independence due to the scarcity of his original signatures. His time in Congress lasted less than a year and much of this time was spent in poor health. Only a singular letter has survived, along with a few signatures on historical documents.[9] This is because many of his autographs have scattered and others were lost in a fire.[10] Today, Lynch's autograph sells as much as $200,000–$250,000.[10]

His legacy is greatly respected. As Rev. Charles A Goodrich said in the book, Lives of the Signers to the Declaration of Independence, "Although the life of Mr. Lynch was thus terminated, at an early age, he had lived sufficiently long to render eminent services to his country, and to establish his character as a man of exalted views and exalted moral worth. Few men possessed a more absolute control over the passions of the heart, and few evinced in a greater degree the virtues which adorn the human mind. In all the relations of life, whether as a husband, a friend, a patriot, or the master of the slave, he appeared conscious of his obligations, and found his pleasure in discharging them. That a man of so much excellence, of such ability and integrity, such firmness and patriotism, so useful to his country, so tender and assiduous in all the obligations of life, should have been thus cut off, in the midst of his course, and in a manner so painful to his friends, is one of those awful dispensations of Him whose way is in the great deep, and whose judgments are past finding out."[11]

The ship is known to have disappeared shortly after, standing as the last record of his life. Elizabeth and Thomas Lynch, Jr. having fathered no children, died at sea in 1779.[citation needed] At the age of 30, he was the youngest signer of the Declaration to die.
Before Thomas Lynch, Jr. died at sea, he made a will requiring that the heirs of his female relatives change their last name to Lynch in order to inherit his family estate.[5] His sister, Sabina responded by changing her name. She and her husband owned and managed the property until their son was of age.[5] Their son, John Bowman Lynch and his wife had three male children but all died in the American Civil War.[5]




The autograph letter signed by Lynch Jr. and Taylor is dated November 1780 and refers to business in Taylor's trade of ironmongery. This is one of the few signatures left of his name.


Thomas Lynch Jr. is one of the rarest signers of the Declaration of Independence due to the scarcity of his original signatures. His time in Congress lasted less than a year and much of this time was spent in poor health. Only a singular letter has survived, along with a few signatures on historical documents.[9] This is because many of his autographs have scattered and others were lost in a fire.[10] Today, Lynch's autograph sells as much as $200,000–$250,000.[10]

His legacy is greatly respected. As Rev. Charles A Goodrich said in the book, Lives of the Signers to the Declaration of Independence, "Although the life of Mr. Lynch was thus terminated, at an early age, he had lived sufficiently long to render eminent services to his country, and to establish his character as a man of exalted views and exalted moral worth. Few men possessed a more absolute control over the passions of the heart, and few evinced in a greater degree the virtues which adorn the human mind. In all the relations of life, whether as a husband, a friend, a patriot, or the master of the slave, he appeared conscious of his obligations, and found his pleasure in discharging them. That a man of so much excellence, of such ability and integrity, such firmness and patriotism, so useful to his country, so tender and assiduous in all the obligations of life, should have been thus cut off, in the midst of his course, and in a manner so painful to his friends, is one of those awful dispensations of Him whose way is in the great deep, and whose judgments are past finding out."[11]

Early life[edit]




Coat of Arms of Thomas Lynch, Jr.


He was born in Hopseewee Plantation in Prince George Parish, Winyah, in what is now Georgetown, South Carolina, the son of Thomas Lynch and his wife, Elizabeth Allston Lynch. Before Thomas Lynch Jr. was born, his parents had two daughters named Sabina and Esther who were born in 1747 and 1748. After his mother’s death in 1755, his father remarried Hannah Motte, the sister of Isaac Motte. In this marriage, they gave birth to a daughter named Elizabeth in 1755.[2] Lynch Jr.'s family originally emigrated from Austria to Kent, England. From there, they moved to Ireland and continued to South Carolina.[3] His father was a prominent figure in South Carolina politics which contributed to access of opportunity in high education and wealth.[4]

He was schooled at the Indigo Society School in Georgetown before his parents sent him to England, where he received honors at Eton College and at Gonville & Caius College, Cambridge.[1] He studied law and political philosophy at the Middle Temple in London. His father admired his English education and encouraged him to remain in Great Britain to study law and the principles of the British constitution.[3]
After eight years away from the America, he returned to South Carolina in 1772. Although it was his father's dream, Thomas Lynch Jr. decided to end his pursuit of a profession in law.
High school sweethearts, Lynch Jr. and Elizabeth Shubrick were married on May 14, 1772.[5] Following their marriage, the couple lived at Peach Tree Plantation which was located in close proximity to his homeland plantation.[5] Lynch Jr. enjoyed cultivating the land and remained active in political dialogue in his community.[5]
After his father's death due to a stroke, his widowed mother married another influential political figure, South Carolina Governor William Moultrie. Thomas' sister Elizabeth Lynch married James Hamilton; one of their sons was James Hamilton Jr., who became governor in the state in 1830.
Career[edit]

He was elected a member of the Provincial Congress on February 11, 1775. This committee was formed to prepare a plan of government and represent the people of South Carolina. Lynch Jr. served alongside with Charles Cotesworth Pickney, John Rutledge, Charles Pinckney, Henry Laurens, Christopher Gadsden, Rawlins Lowndes, Arthur Middleton, Henry Middleton, Thomas Bee, Thomas Heyward, Jr. in the Provincial Congress.[6] This group formed the South Carolina constitution. Many people objected to this document including The Continental Congress. It stood as a temporary constitution as many believed there would be reconciliation with Great Britain.[7]
Lynch became a company commander in the First South Carolina regiment on June 12, 1775. He was commissioned by the Provincial Congress. After being appointed, he gathered men and led a march into Charlestown, South Carolina. Amid the march, he became very sick with a bilious fever which prevented him from continuing.[3] When he recovered, he was unable to fulfill his position in a proper way. During his recovery, he received news about his father's declining health.[3] In hope that he could manage his father's illness, he asked his commanding officer, Colonel Christopher Gadsden if he could travel to Philadelphia.[3] His request was denied originally, but after receiving news of his election to the Continental Congress, he was allowed to travel to his father.
On March 23, 1776, the General Assembly of South Carolina Lynch to the Continental Congress as a sixth delegate.[citation needed] Although he was ill, Lynch Jr. traveled to Philadelphia to sign the Declaration of Independence. Thomas Lynch, Sr. and Thomas Lynch, Jr. were the only father and son to serve in the Continental Congress.[3] Lynch Jr. signed the Declaration of Independence along with Arthur Middleton, Thomas Heyward Jr., Edward Rutledge.[8] He was the second youngest delegate in the Continental Congress and filled in his father's place due to illness.[4] The youngest signer, South Carolinian Edward Rutledge was younger by three months.[citation needed] Thomas Lynch Jr. risked his life with this signature which stood against the country where he received his education.
After signing the Declaration of Independence, an ill Thomas Lynch Jr. set out for home with his ailing father. On the way to South Carolina, his father suffered a second stroke and died in Annapolis, Maryland, in December 1776.[2] Thomas Lynch Jr. retired in early 1777.[citation needed]
Legacy[edit]
After two more years of illness in South Carolina where he resided with his wife at Peachtree Plantation on the South Santee River, many suggested that Thomas Lynch Jr. travel to Europe in search for a different atmosphere.[2] Despite the dangers, he and his wife sailed for respite on a vessel to St. Eustatius in the West Indies in late 1779. The ship is known to have disappeared shortly after, standing as the last record of his life. Elizabeth and Thomas Lynch, Jr. having fathered no children, died at sea in 1779.[citation needed] At the age of 30, he was the youngest signer of the Declaration to die.
Before Thomas Lynch, Jr. died at sea, he made a will requiring that the heirs of his female relatives change their last name to Lynch in order to inherit his family estate.[5] His sister, Sabina responded by changing her name. She and her husband owned and managed the property until their son was of age.[5] Their son, John Bowman Lynch and his wife had three male children but all died in the American Civil War.[5]




The autograph letter signed by Lynch Jr. and Taylor is dated November 1780 and refers to business in Taylor's trade of ironmongery. This is one of the few signatures left of his name.

      Public Company Information:          




NYSE:BMY 






NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Bristol-Myers 
      Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) today announced that it has appointed Dr. 
      Thomas J. Lynch, Jr., 56, executive vice president and chief scientific 
      officer, effective March 16, 2017. He succeeds Dr. Francis Cuss, 62, who 
      will retire from the company. Dr. Cuss will serve as an advisor to the 
      company for the next three months to ensure a seamless transition. In 
      connection with today’s announcement, Dr. Lynch will step down from the 
      Board of Directors of Bristol-Myers Squibb, effective March 15, 2017.
    

      Dr. Lynch has more than 30 years of medical, management and leadership 
      experience, including more than 23 years at Massachusetts General 
      Hospital (MGH). He served as chairman and chief executive officer of 
      Massachusetts General Physicians Organization and as a member of the MGH 
      Board from 2015 to 2017. Before returning to MGH, Dr. Lynch served as 
      the director of Yale Cancer Center and was the Richard and Jonathan 
      Sackler Professor of Internal Medicine at the Yale School of Medicine 
      from 2009 to 2015. While at MGH in 2004, Dr. Lynch was part of the team 
      credited with the significant discovery that certain genetic mutations 
      in lung cancer patients caused therapies to work for some individuals 
      and not for others.
    

      “We are pleased to welcome Tom to the leadership team at Bristol-Myers 
      Squibb,” said Giovanni 
      Caforio, M.D., chief executive officer and chairman designate of 
      Bristol-Myers Squibb. “Tom is an internationally recognized oncologist 
      known for his leadership in the treatment of lung cancer and has made 
      significant contributions to the field of targeted therapies throughout 
      his career. Tom brings deep industry knowledge and a sophisticated 
      understanding of the Bristol-Myers Squibb Research & Development program 
      from his experience as a member of our Board. As we transition to our 
      next phase of growth, we are confident Tom is the right person to lead 
      our dynamic R&D organization as we focus on accelerating the development 
      of our Immuno-Oncology medicines and fully realizing the extraordinary 
      potential of our diverse, innovative pipeline. With deep experience as a 
      clinical researcher, leader of large research centers and a practicing 
      physician, Tom brings unique, important and timely perspectives to the 
      business.”
    

      Dr. Lynch said, “Throughout my career, I have been devoted to advancing 
      oncology research, with a particular focus on lung cancer. I have seen 
      firsthand Bristol-Myers Squibb’s commitment to making a meaningful 
      difference in the lives of patients, and I am honored to lead the 
      company’s R&D program, where lung cancer research is a core area of 
      focus in a highly successful Immuno-Oncology development program. I have 
      a strong appreciation for the depth of Bristol-Myers Squibb’s portfolio 
      and rich pipeline in oncology as well as in the fields of cardiovascular 
      diseases, immunoscience and fibrosis. We have a number of significant 
      opportunities and are uniquely positioned to transform cancer care. I am 
      confident that our team will continue to discover and develop innovative 
      medicines that address serious diseases in areas of significant unmet 
      medical need.”
    

      Caforio concluded, “On behalf of the Board and leadership team, I want 
      to thank Francis for his hard work and dedication to Bristol-Myers 
      Squibb for more than 13 years. Our portfolio and pipeline have been 
      significantly strengthened during his time leading Discovery and R&D, 
      and we wish him the best in his retirement.”
    

      “It has been an honor to lead Bristol-Myers Squibb’s talented R&D team 
      during such a transformative period for the company,” said Cuss. “Today, 
      Bristol-Myers Squibb is creating unprecedented opportunities to address 
      some of the most challenging disease areas in ways we never thought 
      possible even five years ago. I’ve come to know Tom well in his capacity 
      as a board member and I am confident that under his leadership the team 
      will continue to flourish and find new ways to discover, develop and 
      deliver innovative medicines that make a difference in the lives of 
      patients.”

Bristol-Myers Squibb Appoints Dr. Thomas J. Lynch, Jr., Executive Vice President and Chief Scientific Officer | Business Wire
























































Bristol-Myers Squibb Appoints Dr. Thomas J. Lynch, Jr., Executive 
      Vice President and Chief Scientific Officer






March 08, 2017 12:24 PM Eastern Standard Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Bristol-Myers 
      Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) today announced that it has appointed Dr. 
      Thomas J. Lynch, Jr., 56, executive vice president and chief scientific 
      officer, effective March 16, 2017. He succeeds Dr. Francis Cuss, 62, who 
      will retire from the company. Dr. Cuss will serve as an advisor to the 
      company for the next three months to ensure a seamless transition. In 
      connection with today’s announcement, Dr. Lynch will step down from the 
      Board of Directors of Bristol-Myers Squibb, effective March 15, 2017.
    

      Dr. Lynch has more than 30 years of medical, management and leadership 
      experience, including more than 23 years at Massachusetts General 
      Hospital (MGH). He served as chairman and chief executive officer of 
      Massachusetts General Physicians Organization and as a member of the MGH 
      Board from 2015 to 2017. Before returning to MGH, Dr. Lynch served as 
      the director of Yale Cancer Center and was the Richard and Jonathan 
      Sackler Professor of Internal Medicine at the Yale School of Medicine 
      from 2009 to 2015. While at MGH in 2004, Dr. Lynch was part of the team 
      credited with the significant discovery that certain genetic mutations 
      in lung cancer patients caused therapies to work for some individuals 
      and not for others.
    

      “We are pleased to welcome Tom to the leadership team at Bristol-Myers 
      Squibb,” said Giovanni 
      Caforio, M.D., chief executive officer and chairman designate of 
      Bristol-Myers Squibb. “Tom is an internationally recognized oncologist 
      known for his leadership in the treatment of lung cancer and has made 
      significant contributions to the field of targeted therapies throughout 
      his career. Tom brings deep industry knowledge and a sophisticated 
      understanding of the Bristol-Myers Squibb Research & Development program 
      from his experience as a member of our Board. As we transition to our 
      next phase of growth, we are confident Tom is the right person to lead 
      our dynamic R&D organization as we focus on accelerating the development 
      of our Immuno-Oncology medicines and fully realizing the extraordinary 
      potential of our diverse, innovative pipeline. With deep experience as a 
      clinical researcher, leader of large research centers and a practicing 
      physician, Tom brings unique, important and timely perspectives to the 
      business.”
    

      Dr. Lynch said, “Throughout my career, I have been devoted to advancing 
      oncology research, with a particular focus on lung cancer. I have seen 
      firsthand Bristol-Myers Squibb’s commitment to making a meaningful 
      difference in the lives of patients, and I am honored to lead the 
      company’s R&D program, where lung cancer research is a core area of 
      focus in a highly successful Immuno-Oncology development program. I have 
      a strong appreciation for the depth of Bristol-Myers Squibb’s portfolio 
      and rich pipeline in oncology as well as in the fields of cardiovascular 
      diseases, immunoscience and fibrosis. We have a number of significant 
      opportunities and are uniquely positioned to transform cancer care. I am 
      confident that our team will continue to discover and develop innovative 
      medicines that address serious diseases in areas of significant unmet 
      medical need.”
    

      Caforio concluded, “On behalf of the Board and leadership team, I want 
      to thank Francis for his hard work and dedication to Bristol-Myers 
      Squibb for more than 13 years. Our portfolio and pipeline have been 
      significantly strengthened during his time leading Discovery and R&D, 
      and we wish him the best in his retirement.”
    

      “It has been an honor to lead Bristol-Myers Squibb’s talented R&D team 
      during such a transformative period for the company,” said Cuss. “Today, 
      Bristol-Myers Squibb is creating unprecedented opportunities to address 
      some of the most challenging disease areas in ways we never thought 
      possible even five years ago. I’ve come to know Tom well in his capacity 
      as a board member and I am confident that under his leadership the team 
      will continue to flourish and find new ways to discover, develop and 
      deliver innovative medicines that make a difference in the lives of 
      patients.”

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/25/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.  Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.  Illiquidity is an inherent risk associated with investing in real estate and REITs.  There is no guarantee the issuer of a REIT will maintain the secondary market for its shares and redemptions may be at a price which is more or less than the original price paid.  Closed-end funds can trade at a discount to their NAV.  Shareholders of Master Limited Partnerships may be treated as partners for tax purposes.  Partnerships issue a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) rather than a Form 1099 form for tax purposes. It lists the partner's share of income, deductions, credits, etc.  Speak with your tax advisor to determine how this may affect you.  A royalty trust is a type of corporation, mostly in the United States or Canada, usually involved in oil and gas production or mining.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/25/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.

While at MGH in 2004, Dr. Lynch was part of the team credited with the significant discovery that certain genetic mutations in lung cancer patients caused therapies to work for some individuals and not for others.“We are pleased to welcome Tom to the leadership team at Bristol-Myers Squibb,” said Giovanni Caforio, M.D., chief executive officer and chairman designate of Bristol-Myers Squibb. “Tom is an internationally recognized oncologist known for his leadership in the treatment of lung cancer and has made significant contributions to the field of targeted therapies throughout his career. Tom brings deep industry knowledge and a sophisticated understanding of the Bristol-Myers Squibb Research & Development program from his experience as a member of our Board. As we transition to our next phase of growth, we are confident Tom is the right person to lead our dynamic R&D organization as we focus on accelerating the development of our Immuno-Oncology medicines and fully realizing the extraordinary potential of our diverse, innovative pipeline. With deep experience as a clinical researcher, leader of large research centers and a practicing physician, Tom brings unique, important and timely perspectives to the business.”Dr. Lynch said, “Throughout my career, I have been devoted to advancing oncology research, with a particular focus on lung cancer. I have seen firsthand Bristol-Myers Squibb’s commitment to making a meaningful difference in the lives of patients, and I am honored to lead the company’s R&D program, where lung cancer research is a core area of focus in a highly successful Immuno-Oncology development program. I have a strong appreciation for the depth of Bristol-Myers Squibb’s portfolio and rich pipeline in oncology as well as in the fields of cardiovascular diseases, immunoscience and fibrosis. We have a number of significant opportunities and are uniquely positioned to transform cancer care. I am confident that our team will continue to discover and develop innovative medicines that address serious diseases in areas of significant unmet medical need.”Caforio concluded, “On behalf of the Board and leadership team, I want to thank Francis for his hard work and dedication to Bristol-Myers Squibb for more than 13 years. Our portfolio and pipeline have been significantly strengthened during his time leading Discovery and R&D, and we wish him the best in his retirement.”“It has been an honor to lead Bristol-Myers Squibb’s talented R&D team during such a transformative period for the company,” said Cuss. “Today, Bristol-Myers Squibb is creating unprecedented opportunities to address some of the most challenging disease areas in ways we never thought possible even five years ago. I’ve come to know Tom well in his capacity as a board member and I am confident that under his leadership the team will continue to flourish and find new ways to discover, develop and deliver innovative medicines that make a difference in the lives of patients.”About Dr. Thomas J.
