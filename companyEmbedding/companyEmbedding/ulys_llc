Ulysses Management LLC is a diversified investment firm with over $1 billion in capital under management. We follow a variety of investment strategies in pursuit of superior investment results over the long term.  The majority of the capital we manage belongs to our General Partners and their families, creating an uncommonly close alignment of interests in our investments with founders, entrepreneurs and management teams.






Who we are



Founded almost twenty years ago, Ulysses is the successor firm to Odyssey Partners, LP, the pioneering hedge fund formed in 1982 by Jack Nash and Leon Levy. Odyssey was an innovator in the development of the alternative investment market and made some of the earliest private equity investments almost 40 years ago when they were known as ‘boot strap’ investments.  This tradition of investment innovation continues within the Ulysses private equity group, which is one of our three principal areas of investment focus along with public market and real estate investments. 

Our private equity group has a broad and flexible investment mandate that allows us to pursue attractive opportunities as a sponsor, co-investor or limited partner.  Wherever we invest, whatever the industry or transaction size, our core philosophy is always the same: find companies with identifiable barriers to competition, partner with talented managers operating under the right incentives, forge long-term relationships built on accountability, trust, transparency and collaboration, and together we can create substantial value.


We do not invest out of a typical investment fund structure and consequently are not bound by traditional PE capital raising demands. Our capital is more durable and allows us to invest across 5-10 year business cycles, enabling us to be far more strategic and long-term oriented without the time pressures created by funds with typical short-term investment horizons. This appeals to both sellers (no stripping and flipping of their legacies) and to management teams (providing an opportunity to create meaningful wealth over a long period in a stable platform).  We believe the power of compounding has been lost in the private equity world in favor of the generation of fees for the sponsor.  At Ulysses, we earn our investment returns alongside our fellow owners, not in front of them.






Guiding principles



Value Investors
We are value investors. We build conviction by having a firm understanding of a company’s ‘reason to exist’. We are attracted to businesses with defensible, proven business models, enduring free cash flow, motivated management teams and deep customer relationships.  A central corollary to this philosophy is the avoidance of excessive borrowing or financial engineering to generate high risk equity returns. 


Partnership
We believe strongly in the benefits of partnership. We often deploy our capital alongside other like-minded investors, believing in the wisdom of multiple perspectives and the resiliency derived from additional human and capital resources.


Business Building
The power of compounding and thus longer term investment horizons is critical to our investment philosophy. This allows us to focus on real company building rather than financial engineering or quick flips. As a result, we prefer to measure our success in terms of return on investment instead of internal rates of return.



Operational Focus
An operational focus is critical to creating sustainable value in businesses. We routinely rely on a network of operating executives to develop proprietary insights into our investment opportunities. Through many years of experience building businesses and our ability to draw on the talents and knowledge of our operating executives, we can help companies enhance their core advantages and transcend their historical limitations.


Alignment of Interests
Ulysses is an unusual investment firm in that our General Partners and their families have contributed the majority of our capital under management and it represents a meaningful portion of their net worth; we subscribe to the notion of ”eating your own cooking”. We have the ability to hold investments as long as we are the logical owner; there is no artificial or external pressure caused by fund raising cycles.


Value Creation
We work in close partnership with exceptional management teams and provide capital, vision, and operating resources to help build and strengthen the companies in which we invest. We are particularly focused on adding greater intelligence to the companies we invest in, which we define as: (1) creating a data driven culture; and (2) increasing the technology quotient of our products and services to improve the customer experience.

OUR STRATEGIES



We invest in profitable, well-established companies with tangible competitive advantages. Our investment philosophy is to seek out opportunities born through change – change created by fundamental industry trends, economic cycles or specific company circumstances. Frequently, our investment serves as a catalyst to manage the transition from a founder/entrepreneur leadership to a professional management team.  As a sponsor, we seek to drive expanded market presence, improved profitability and a steepened growth trajectory in our portfolio companies.


Ulysses invests across a broad range of industries and geographies. Our goal is to help management teams build long-term value that benefits all stakeholders. We structure our private equity investments based on each company’s circumstances and generally seek to invest in established businesses requiring equity capital of between $10 and $50 million. For larger transactions, we have co-invested in partnership with other family offices or like-minded sponsors.





Recurring Revenue Investments

Razor / razorblade business models
Large installed base of productive field assets
Specialty leasing companies with high customer service
Manufacturers with high aftermarket content
Compelling value proposition to customers (and often high switching costs) resulting in low churn/attrition rates
Attractive return on capital and durability across economic cycles


"Macro Theme" Investments

Companies in industries undergoing fundamental secular change due to powerful, long term, forces
Opportunity to invest across decade plus cycles with sustained tailwind
Examples of fundamental macro themes that are upending a broad range of industries would include: the premiumization of consumer products, technology-driven business intelligence, and the privatization of public services.



Portfolio Company Management
We work closely with management teams to create stronger and more resilient businesses.  Core aptitudes include:

Deploying technology to increase insight or improve customer experience
Establishing business processes and a metric driven decision making culture
Recruiting high caliber management teams
Investing in new products, infrastructure, and strategic acquisitions
Navigating increasingly complex regulatory environments

Ulys - Product Hunt





























Product HuntThe best new products, every dayAsk●|Log InSign up Featured 3 months agoUlysAn app that makes group expenses easierProductivityFintechTechget it111 ShareWould you recommend Ulys to a friend?😡 NO🤔 MAYBE😍 YESHunterHNeeraj ThakurMakersMSéraphin DesumeurMWilliam JauffretMClement JltMGauthier EgotDiscussionYou need to become a Contributor to join the discussion - Find out how.Clement JltMaker@clement_jlt · Co-founter UlysClement, co-founder of Ulys here!

Thanks for hunting us @NeerajT4 and hello Product Hunters 👋 
We're super excited and happy to present you Ulys! Ulys is the new mobile application to make your expenses between your friends easier. 
As students, we used to roommates with friends. And it was very difficult to manage our money when we had to buy some grocery, pay the rent or go to a pub together. So we decide to create a tool which avoids all these problems. Ulys shows up :D
With Ulys you have an eye of who owes to whom. It’s quick and easy, you invite your friends in an Ulys group and add your expenses you made with them during a journey, restaurant, pub, etc. At the end, you have a simple view which resumes all your expenses. 
Ulys is connected to the cloud to permit everyone access to their accounts and obviously Ulys work online and offline. To miss nothing, we add a simple notification feature which notify you when a new expense concern you. The best in this app is that you can use it for going on holiday with friends, with your work team or for the pernicketiest, use it in a couple.
We're looking forward to hearing your feedback and questions!

Thank you! 3Share·3 months agoNeeraj ThakurHunter@neerajt4 · Marketer | www.neerajt.com@clement_jlt All the best! 😊 2Share·3 months agoClement D.@ovanek33 · StudentHi first of all congrats on the app! Small question though, what differentiates yourself with apps such as Splitwise or Tricount ? 1Share·3 months agoClement JltMaker@clement_jlt · Co-founter Ulys@ovanek33 This is an excellent question! We used to use those great applications, but every time, something missed. Ulys is different because it wants to break the financials rules existing with an interface friendlier. We based on the development of this app on the user experiences and the design. The other difference is the notification. All the expenses made by a member of a group will notify the concerned people to avoid mistakes or to let your friends know if you had or not an expense. We also had a label features which sort expenses. We plan to use those labels to create easy feedback on your expenses. And many new features will be developed 😃! 1Share·3 months agoSimon Févry@simonfevry · Co-founder, UmanNice idea, your product is great looking and useful for my roomate! Did you implement a notification system to alert my friends when I add an expense? 1Share·3 months agoClement JltMaker@clement_jlt · Co-founter UlysHey @simon,

Actually yes there is a built-in notifications sender in Ulys. Everytime someone will add an expense, his/her concerned friends will get a notification about how much monney it was and who added it, this way you can't add expenses without people in your account knowing ! UpvoteShare·3 months agoRobin Choy@robin_choyNice product guys, the notifications seems like a killer feature! Do you have a webapp on the roadmap, in order to check the expenses more thoroughly? 1Share·3 months agoGauthier EgotMaker@gauthier_egot · Ulys Co-founderHey @robin_choy,

For now we focus on trying to implement the possibility to reimburse your friends directly from the app, we're not working on a web app yet, but we will as soon as the think that this would be interesting for users !

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year
