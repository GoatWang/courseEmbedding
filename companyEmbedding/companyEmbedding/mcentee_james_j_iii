She has represented employers before federal and state courts, arbitration hearings and administrative agencies. She has defended claims of unlawful discrimination, retaliation, sexual harassment, wrongful discharge, unemployment compensation, breach of contract, trade secret violations and whistleblower complaints.Employment DiscriminationEmployment Contract“Considerations in Understanding and Negotiating Employment Contracts”, Pennsylvania Academy of Dermatology and Dermatologic Surgery Annual Meeting, in Hershey, PA, September 19, 2015Employment LitigationThe Lamb McErlane employment law practice encompasses a full range of services including human resource counseling, employment litigation and representation in labor relations matters.Severance AgreementIn addition, Mary-Ellen provides employers with advice and counseling on investigating and resolving complaints, disability accommodation, compensation, and terminations. She also negotiates and drafts severance agreements, employment agreements, restrictive covenants, as well as personnel policies and employee handbooks.Sexual HarassmentPrior to joining Lamb McErlane, Jake worked for a Philadelphia based law firm litigating complex and high-value commercial matters. He represented global companies in a variety of litigation contexts before federal and state courts in Pennsylvania and New Jersey.  Jake also acted as General Counsel to a non-profit religious organization advising on issues of wrongful termination, sexual harassment, criminal matters, real estate transactions, Affordable Care Act compliance, and strategies to reduce their tax burden.Property LawPremises LiabilityConstruction LitigationThe Firm’s appellate lawyers have briefed and argued many high profile appeals for major national and multinational corporations faced with complex issues from the correct implementation of class action procedures, to admission of expert testimony, to the proper application of substantive law in cases raising issues of employment law, negligence, the law of contracts, professional liability, land use, taxation, and construction disputes.Real Estate TransactionsWe represent clients in a broad range of sophisticated and complex commercial and residential real estate transactions and offer a full range of services for buyers, sellers, developers, landlords, tenants and capital markets clients including...Eminent DomainLamb McErlane is widely known for its dynamic, diverse and efficient litigation practice. Whether the issue is a commercial dispute involving Fortune 100 companies, a complex real estate or estate matter, or an eminent domain proceeding, when a client chooses Lamb McErlane to represent it in litigation, the matter is staffed to achieve the most efficient result in the most responsive, timely and productive manner.Land Use and ZoningCriminal LawInternet CrimesCriminal DefenseThe criminal defense team at Lamb McErlane is well-prepared to deliver a wide range of services, from initial investigations through to trials and appeals. Depending on the needs of a given client, our firm criminal defense lawyers have achieved acquittals at hard-fought trials, declinations of prosecution following complex and intensive investigations or negotiations, comprehensive and favorable global resolutions, and significant appellate victories.DUI/DWIARD is most often available for first time, non-violent offenses, particularly DUIs (driving under the influence). In the case of DUI, completion of the program requires a CRN (court reporting network) evaluation and mandatory highway safety classes. For higher blood alcohol levels (.16 of above), those who refused blood/breath/urine testing, or those with prior DUIs, an additional, more comprehensive drug and alcohol evaluation will be required in addition to counseling. Certain counties also include mandatory community service as a condition of the program.Wrongful DeathTraffic ViolationsRepresented a man charged with driving under the influence of drugs after driving recklessly and being followed by a fellow driver who had called 911 and reported the man’s driving. After successfully positioning the case through pre-trial proceedings, the Commonwealth dropped the DUI charge on the eve of trial and the man pleaded guilty to a traffic ticket with a $25 fine and no points on his license. The DUI charge is in the process of being expunged.Sex CrimesDismissal of multi-million dollar demand for alleged wrongful conviction of man jailed for over 20 years for a rape/murder that later DNA testing established he did not commit;FraudRobberyHis courtroom experience as a criminal defense attorney includes defense of charges ranging from felonies including homicide, rape, burglary, robbery, white-collar crime and aggravated assault to misdemeanors of DUI, theft and drug-related offenses.BurglaryRepresented a college student whose tale began with an arrest for public indecency after he was found nude outside in a residential development. A search of his car revealed what the police believed were chemicals designed for some illicit purpose (most likely the manufacture of drugs). The police impounded the car, and later charged the individual with Burglary and related offenses for physically breaking into the State Police impound lot located adjacent to their barracks by cutting the surrounding fence, retrieving the chemicals from the trunk, and disposing of them. A subsequent mental health evaluation identified that the young man was suffering from a mental illness at the time of these events. Despite the argument of the Commonwealth seeking a significant jail sentence, the young man received probation.White Collar CrimesTheftMisdemeanorsRepresented two brothers charged with the felony offense of shooting a weapon into the trailer of another individual in East Brandywine Township, as well as other misdemeanor charges associated with the same act. During a four-day jury trial, the trial judge granted our motion to dismiss the felony charge and one of the misdemeanor charges for lack of evidence on both clients. Only the remaining misdemeanor charges went to the jury. Despite the length of the trial, the jury returned Not Guilty verdicts for both clients on all charges in approximately 45 minutes. We since have successfully had all weapons rightfully returned to our clients, and more importantly had these offenses expunged from their records.Drug CrimesRepresented a Chester County woman charged with DUI and possession of drugs. Despite the Commonwealth’s belief in the strength of its driving under the influence case, was able to successfully return a verdict of Not Guilty on the DUI charge, which is in the process of being expunged.AssaultMurderHomicideRepresented an individual accused of driving the wrong way on Route 202 and colliding head on with another vehicle, killing both occupants of that vehicle. The Commonwealth alleged that the client had been smoking marijuana “all day”, and drinking alcohol, prior to the accident. In addition to other charges, client was charged with 2 counts of Homicide by Vehicle while DUI, each of which carried a separate mandatory 3 year jail term, which the law required upon conviction to be served consecutively. After a 6 day jury trial, the client was found Not Guilty of the most serious charges of Homicide by Vehicle while DUI, and was found guilty only of the lesser offenses of the case.ArsonMoney LaunderingKevin is a 1996 graduate of the Pennsylvania State Police Academy.  Throughout his State Police career, Kevin worked as a Patrol Trooper, Vice and Narcotics Trooper, Patrol Corporal, Patrol Sergeant, Office Commander and Section Commander within the Bureau of Gaming Enforcement.  He is certified as a narcotics expert and a money laundering expert in Bucks, Chester and Montgomery County Courts.ManslaughterFinance LawTax LawKevin’s estate planning practice includes wealth preservation and wealth transfer tax planning, charitable planning and business succession planning.  His trust and estate administration practice includes the representation of estates and fiduciaries, the administration of trusts, and the preparation of estate, gift, inheritance and fiduciary income tax returns.Family LawDivorceChild SupportChild Custody and VisitationThe Family Law team has extensive knowledge pertaining to divorce, child custody, adoption, financial support, distribution of assets, as well as cases involving complex interstate support enforcement and custody issues.AdoptionPremarital AgreementGuardianshipIncapacity. This may be the single most important reason to have a power of attorney. By preparing a health care power of attorney, you designate who will make health decisions for you when you cannot.  This same person will be able to make end of life decisions for you. In addition, a power of attorney can name someone who will handle your financial affairs when you cannot.  Without one, your family may need to go to court to have a guardian appointed for you.  That person may not be the individual you would choose and the process is expensive, time consuming and subject to public scrutiny.  A power of attorney will prevent a guardianship.Spousal SupportLegal SeparationA parenting plan, parenting arrangement, parenting agreement or access schedule is a voluntary agreement created by a child’s parents that lays out specific terms of child-rearing that the parents will abide by. Such an agreement is incorporated into the divorce decree or legal separation.  The parenting plan allocates parenting tasks and divides duties such as financial responsibility, creating a stable, loving environment for the child, caring for the child’s physical and emotional needs as well as other things. A parenting plan may have specific obligations and conditions as agreed upon by the parents. However, most plans include decisions regarding the following...Child AbuseOnce a license is obtained, it is important to ensure the license is renewed and the physician is continuing to complete his/her required continuing medical education requirements. All licenses are issued on a biennial basis and renew at the same time. These licenses expire on December 31st of every even numbered year. Renewal notices are sent to all “active and active-retired” status licenses at the address information on file with the Board approximately 90 days prior to the expiration date. The Board regulations state that in order to renew a medical license, a physician will need to satisfy the following continuing medical education requirements:  100 total credit hours of CME in the two-year license cycle, a minimum of 20 of the total credit hours in Category 1, 12 credit hours in the areas of patient safety or risk management (either Category 1 or Category 2), and 2 continuing education credits every two-year licensure cycle from a Department of Human Services’ (DHS) approved course on the topic of mandated child abuse recognition and reporting for a license renewal OR three continuing education credits from a DHS approved course on the topic of mandated child abuse recognition and reporting for an initial license (this is a separate and distinct mandate outside of the CME requirements and is a condition of licensure).Trusts and EstatesProbateEstate PlanningJohn represents individuals, Fortune 500 corporations, regional and local businesses, non-profits and charter schools. He also provides counsel to local school districts and municipalities in litigation matters and condemnation cases, and represents clients in orphans’ court and estate litigation.WillsYour Last Will and Testament will contain a detailed list of instructions as to how your property should be distributed after you die.

The Living Will portion allows you to leave a written set of instructions to your physician as to whether or not you want to receive life-sustaining procedures if you have been diagnosed with a terminal condition or are in a persistent vegetative state. It gives guidelines for your family members to follow if you become terminally ill.Health LawPersonal InjuryLamb McErlane's Personal Injury Group has a long and successful track record representing clients on a contingent fee basis in diverse matters including wrongful death and survival actions, medical and dental malpractice, automobile accidents, product liability, liquor vendor liability and premises liability in both federal and state courts.Medical MalpracticeThe Post-trial and Appellate Practice Group is comprised of former law clerks from appellate courts in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, including the Third Circuit Court of Appeals and the Pennsylvania Supreme and Superior Courts, and a former Justice of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court.

About Peer Rating
Martindale-Hubbell® Peer Review Ratings™ are the gold standard in attorney ratings, and have been for more than a century. These ratings indicate attorneys who are widely respected by their peers for their ethical standards and legal expertise in a specific area of practice.


The Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings process is the gold standard due to its objectivity and comprehensiveness. Lawyers solicited for peer reviews include both those selected by the attorney being reviewed and lawyers independently selected by Martindale-Hubbell. All reviewers are verified as attorneys through Martindale-Hubbell's extensive attorney database. Only attorneys practicing at least three years and receiving a sufficient number of reviews from non-affiliated attorneys are eligible to receive a Rating.
What are the different Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings?
AV Preeminent®: The highest peer rating standard. This rating signifies that a large number of the lawyer's peers rank him or her at the highest level of professional excellence for their legal knowledge, communication skills and ethical standards.
Distinguished: An excellent rating for a lawyer with some experience. This rating indicates the attorney is widely respected by their peers for high professional achievement and ethical standards.
Notable: This rating indicates that the lawyer has been recognized by a large number of their peers for strong ethical standards.
Lawyers who have received peer reviews after 2009 will display more detailed information, including practice areas, summary ratings, detailed numeric ratings and written feedback (if available). Details for individual reviews received before 2009 are not displayed.
Attorneys that receive reviews from their peers, but not a sufficient number to establish a Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Rating, will have those reviews display on our websites.
For more information on Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings™, please visit our Ratings Page on Martindale.com and our Frequently Asked Questions
Close ×




About Client Rating
The Martindale-Hubbell® Client Review Ratings™ display reviews submitted by clients of lawyers and law firms.


The Client Review Rating score is determined through aggregation of validated responses. People who submit reviews are clients of law firms who hired a lawyer within the last year, whose matter is not pending and who want to share their experience of that lawyer or law firm with other potential clients. Reviewers can be anyone who hires a lawyer including in-house counsel, corporate executives, small business owners and private individuals.
Martindale-Hubbell validates that the reviewer is a person with a valid email address. As part of the review process, respondents must affirm that they have been a client of the lawyer or law firm identified within the past year, although Martindale-Hubbell cannot confirm the lawyer/client relationship as it is often confidential. The content of the responses are entirely from client reviewers.
Prior results do not guarantee a similar outcome and Martindale-Hubbell accepts no responsibility for the content or accuracy of any review.
