VanEck's suite of municipal income ETFs offers investors the ability to exercise control over their portfolio yield, duration, and credit exposure at different points in the interest rate cycle. The indices underlying each ETF target specific maturity ranges or credit exposures, resulting in distinct performance, yield, and duration characteristics.

Source: VanEck Research. As of 06/30/17. The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Investment returns and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted. Index performance is not illustrative of fund performance. Effective Duration measures a bond's sensitivity to interest rate changes that reflects the change in a bond's price given a change in yield. This duration measure is appropriate for bonds with embedded options. Yield to Worst measures the lowest of either yield-to-maturity or yield-to-call date on every possible call date.

Yield Curve-Focused ETFs
 Our investment grade municipal ETF product offerings seek to track indices that reflect a unique segmentation of the investment grade municipal yield curve: short (years 1-6: SMB), intermediate (years 6-8: ITMS) (years 6-17: ITM) (years 12-17: ITML), and long (years 17-30+: MLN). 

 
Credit-Focused ETFs
Our credit-focused municipal ETF product offerings seek to track indices that include both the highest credit quality available in the municipal asset class (pre-refunded: PRB) and municipal high yield: short (years 1-12: SHYD) and all maturity (years 1-30+: HYD). The high yield indices include an investment grade component to help enhance liquidity.  


 
Smart Beta ETF
Our smart beta municipal ETF (XMPT) seeks to track an index that includes municipal closed-end funds (CEFs). Because CEFs have a fixed number of shares, discrepancies between NAVs and share prices can be common and generally result from changing investor sentiment. When such a fund's share price is lower than its net asset value (NAV) it's called "being at a discount." When its share price is higher than its NAV it's called "being at a premium."
This index has intelligently designed weighting rules that underweight CEFs trading at higher premiums and overweight CEFs trading at wider discounts. This built-in "buy low, sell high" mechanism is one way investors can potentially benefit from investing in the municipal CEF market.  


 
ETFs Provide Low Cost Access to Munis
The fees of an investment vehicle are important; they affect an investor's ultimate return. The average net expense ratio of municipal bond ETFs was 63 bps lower as compared to municipal bond mutual funds and 77 bps lower as compared to municipal bond closed-end funds. Many investors may prefer municipal bond ETFs for this reason.

 

Source: Morningstar. As of 06/30/17. Fees for municipal bond ETFs compared against the average net expense ratio of mutual funds and closed-end funds in the Morningstar Municipal Bond U.S. Category Group. There were 37 funds in the Muni ETF Category, 1,879 funds in the Muni Mutual Fund Category, 167 funds in the Muni Closed-End Fund Category.

Important Disclosure
Municipal bonds are subject to risks including those related to litigation, legislation, political changes, local business or economic conditions, conditions in underlying sectors, bankruptcy or other changes in the financial condition of the issuer, and/or the discontinuance of the taxation supporting the project or assets, or the inability to collect revenues for the project or from the assets. Additional risks include: credit risk, interest rate risk, and call risk. High yield bonds may be subject to a greater risk of loss of income and principal, and are likely to be more sensitive to adverse economic changes than higher rated securities. Some portion of Fund distributions may be subject to the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT).
Taxable equivalent yields are used by investors to compare yields on taxable and tax-exempt securities after accounting for federal income taxes. TEY represents the yield a taxable bond investment would have to earn in order to match, after deducting federal income taxes, the yield available on a tax-exempt municipal bond investment. TEY = Tax-Free Municipal Bond Yield/(1 -Tax Rate).
The investment management agreement between VanEck Vectors ETF Trust (the "Trust") and Van Eck Associates Corporation (the "Adviser") provides that the Adviser will pay all expenses of the Fund, except for the fee payment under the investment management agreement, interest expense, offering costs, trading expenses, taxes and extraordinary expenses. TER, or Total Expense Ratio, is also referred to as "Net Expense Ratio. Expenses for XMPT are capped contractually at 0.40% until 09/01/17. Cap excludes certain expenses, such as interest.
The market for municipal bonds may be less liquid than for taxable bonds. Income from corporate bonds is subject to state and Federal tax. There is no guarantee that a Fund's income will be exempt from federal or state income taxes. Federal or state changes in income or alternative minimum tax rates or in the tax treatment of municipal bonds may make them less attractive as investments and cause them to lose value. Capital gains, if any, are subject to capital gains tax. Please refer to the Funds' 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
                            prospectus for complete risk information.
The "Net Asset Value" (NAV) of a VanEck Vectors exchange-traded fund (ETF) is determined at the close of each business day, and represents the dollar value of one share of the fund; it is calculated by taking the total assets of the fund, subtracting total liabilities, and dividing by the total number of shares outstanding. The NAV is not necessarily the same as the ETF's intraday trading value. VanEck Vectors ETF investors should not expect to buy or sell shares at NAV.
Fund shares are not individually redeemable and will be issued and redeemed at their NAV only through certain authorized broker-dealers in large, specified blocks of shares called "creation units" and otherwise can be bought and sold only through exchange trading. Creation units are issued and redeemed principally in kind. Shares may trade at a premium or discount to their NAV in the secondary market.
Investing involves substantial risk, including possible loss of principal. Bonds and bond funds will decrease in value as interest rates rise. Consider a Fund's investment objective, risks, charges and expenses before investing. To obtain a prospectus and summary prospectus, call 800.826.2333 or visit vaneck.com. Read carefully before investing.

The performance data quotes represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Yield, share price and investment return fluctuate and an investor’s shares may be worth more or less than original cost upon redemption. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Click above for month-end returns.The Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Municipal Bond Index covers the USD-denominated long-term tax-exempt bond market.The total return performance figures presented for Class I shares of the fund represent the performance of the fund's Class A for periods prior to December 15, 2008, the inception date for Class I shares, and the performance of Class I, respectively, from that inception date. Performance reflects the applicable class' distribution/servicing fees since the inception date. Had these fees and expenses been reflected for periods prior, performance would have been different. Investors should consider, when deciding whether to purchase a particular class of shares, the investment amount, anticipated holding period and other relevant factors.

Performance Metrics





Main Risks

					Bond Risk: Bonds are subject generally to interest rate, credit, liquidity, call and market risks, to varying degrees. Generally, all other factors being equal, bond prices are inversely related to interest-rate changes and rate increases can cause price declines.National Municipal Risk: Income for national municipal funds may be subject to state and local taxes. Income may be subject to state and local taxes for out-of-state residents. Some income for non-AMT-Free funds may be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax for certain investors. Capital gains, if any, are taxable.State Risk: Investing primarily in a single state may make the fund's portfolio securities more sensitive to risks specific to the state.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
