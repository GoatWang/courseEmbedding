Robot Bartender
Introducing, Gearmo, Two Bit Circus’ first fully animated, wise-cracking, drink mixing, robot bartender.  What do you get when you take the lights from a crashed airplane cockpit, a scrapped old engine block, some strong servos and a bucket full of spare parts, and dump it all into a cabinet styled after classic jukebox design? In our experience, you get a surprisingly good gimlet and a bunch of laughs.

Create a customizable animal robot
Art may be the key entry point to STEM, especially for girls, according to a new survey released today on the gender gap in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math)-based activities for children.
Two Bit Circus, an engineering entertainment company, surveyed a recent audience of more than 500 parents to understand gender differentiators in how children play and learn in relation to STEM/STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, Math) activities.

The project is the latest creative tech from the Los Angeles company started by Brent Bushnell, the son of famous Atari cofounder Nolan Bushnell. The kit focuses on art as a key entry point to STEM, especially for girls.

The circus is coming to town — the Two Bit Circus that is.
And today the think tank troupe of self-described artisanal engineers is launching a Kickstarter campaign to produce the STEAM Carnival. This isn’t bearded ladies and strong men carnival fare. This is a tech bent affair focused on hooking kids with the thrill of cool education. STEAM stands for science, technology, engineering, art and math. Think educational entertainment. The makers behind this circus maximus want to inspire the youth to pursue careers in the sci-tech world. It’s like a World’s Fair for the iPhone set. [read full article]






  












It’s a Sideshow! It’s Scientific! It’s STEAM Carnival!
Two entrepreneurs hope to teach kids about science and technology via a traveling attraction that’s both new-wave and old-timey.
Not every session at the D11 conference involves one or more tech or media executives in conversation with Kara Swisher and/or Walt Mossberg. The first segment this afternoon was a sneak peak at STEAM Carnival, a Kickstarter project which aims to bring a new-age traveling interactive event to major cities, beginning with Los Angeles and San Francisco in early 2014. And as you can see from the photo above, its creators brought part of the carnival with them. [read full article]






  












Science- And Tech-Focused ‘STEAM Carnival’Hits Its Kickstarter Goal
Looks like Kickstarter can add “reimagined” carnivals with “robots, fire, and lasers” to the list of things that its users have crowdfunded. Earlier today, an event called the STEAM Carnival, put together by a company called Two Bit Circus, reached its $100,000 Kickstarter goal. The initials are a twist on STEM, which stands for Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math — the A adds “art” to the equation. [read full article]






  












Steam Carnival Is One Big Traveling Nerd Circus.
Here’s Why You Should Go
We’ve heard a lot about STEM education lately. But what about STEAM education? The creators of a think tank called Two Bit Circus are convinced that “Arts” is what’s missing from STEM to make it fun and entertaining.
