Questions

Question
How will installation of a Magnehelic® gage 150' away from the pressure source affect accuracy?
Answer
Accuracy will not be affected, but response time will be increased in proportion to the length of the tubing.

Series 2000





Series 2000-SP





Series 605







Question
Which Capsuhelic® gage ports could be connected to the pressure source in liquid service?
Answer
The bottom ports. This allows bleeding of entrapped air from the top ports to eliminate reading error due to compression of entrapped air in the gage. Bleed fittings should be installed in the top ports.
Related




Series 4000







Question
Can the standard Magnehelic® or Capsuhelic® gage be installed outdoors?
Answer
Yes. Front covers are sealed with "O" rings. Capsuhelic vent holes are plugged with foam, and the new high impact acrylic lens material is very resistant to ultra-violet fogging. Additional care is recommended to lead pressure connections downward from the gage and provide as much protection from the elements as possible

Series 4000





Series 2000-SP





Series 605







Question
Can a standard Magnehelic® gage be used for natural gas or propane service?
Answer
No. As the silicone diaphragm will be attacked by these gases. A Buna-N diaphragm should be specified.

Series 605





Series 2000-SP







Question
What happens when a Magnehelic® gage equipped with the low temperature option is operated below -20 degrees Fahrenheit (-29 degrees Celsius)?
Answer
Below that temperature the accuracy of the gage deteriorates beyond our published specification due to stiffening of the diaphragm.
