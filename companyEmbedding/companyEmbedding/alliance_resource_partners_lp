3 Hidden Gems in the Energy Sector
If you're looking for big-time yields or upside, these hidden gems are for you. 











                Matthew DiLallo, Tyler Crowe, and Jason Hall
            

                (TMFmd19)



            
            Jul 20, 2017 at 8:04PM
            
            





The energy sector has had its ups and downs in recent years. However, despite the most recent downturn, worldwide demand for energy continues to rise, which should eventually take commodity prices up with it. Because of that, investors stand to make a tidy profit by investing in companies poised to capture this growing demand, especially those with unique niches in the sector. Three such hidden gems are Alliance Resource Partners (NASDAQ:ARLP), Summitt Midstream Partners (NYSE:SMLP), and Clean Energy Fuels (NASDAQ:CLNE). Here's why we think they could fuel big-time profits for investors in the coming years. 
Good while it lasts 
Tyler Crowe (Alliance Resource Partners): Investing in coal today isn't much a bet on the future of energy. Rather, it's a bet that the future of energy is going to take a while to get here. As much as cheap natural gas and renewable energy has hacked away at coal's dominance as the fuel of choice for the electricity market, it still is responsible for 28% of all electricity generation in the United States. Pretty much every new power-generating facility in the U.S. today runs on natural gas or renewables, but there is still a large established base of coal-fired plants that will be around for a while during this transition phase.

Of the coal-producing companies out there, few are in as good of a position -- both competitively and financially -- as Alliance Resources Partners. The company's coal mines in the Illinois Basin are some of the lowest-cost facilities in the country and are projected to increase output while legacy mines in Appalachia and the Rocky Mountains decline. So even if we see a drop in coal consumption over the next several years, Alliance is much less affected than others.
On top of that, Alliance is an incredibly well-capitalized business that throws off lots of capital to its shareholders. The company avoided the temptation to spend on new mines at the top of the commodity cycle in 2011, and it has a distribution coverage ratio -- a measure of an MLPs payout sustainability -- that suggests it can keep paying investors for quite some time. 
By no means is Alliance, or the coal industry in general, a buy and hold forever kind of investment, but the sunset for coal is going to take a while, and Alliance's 8% distribution yield today can make a decent return over the next several years. 
Building a nice niche
Matt DiLallo (Summit Midstream Partners): With a sub-$2 billion market cap, Summit Midstream Partners is just too small to catch the eye of most investors, especially since most other midstream companies spend that much each year on growth projects. That said, Summit Midstream Partners has established itself as an important niche player by providing gathering and processing services to producers across most of the country's shale plays. The company collects stable fees from these services since minimum volume contracts back the bulk of its assets. In fact, 98% of its income comes from fees. Because of the stability of its cash flow, Summit can send a big chunk of it back to investors, which is why its units currently yield an eye-catching 9.6%.
Typically, a yield that high would be a cause for concern, but that doesn't appear to be the case at Summit. That's because the company expects its coverage ratio to be a comfortable 1.2 times at the midpoint of its guidance this year. Further, its leverage ratio was 4.35 times in of the first quarter, which is fairly conservative for a midstream company. If there's any concern, it's the fact that Summit owes its parent company a deferred payment of more than $800 million in 2020 to pay for a drop-down acquisition it completed last year. That said, it has plenty of time to raise the necessary capital, which reduces its risk.
Meanwhile, the company continues to expand its niche by securing new organic growth projects. Earlier this month, for example, the company secured a deal with an ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) subsidiary for a $110 million gathering and processing system in the red-hot Permian Basin. That facility not only will give Summit another stable cash flow stream starting next June, but it gives the company a platform to grow in that important basin. 
Given the company's solid financial position, and the ability to capture needle-moving growth from smaller investments, Summit Midstream Partners is a gem that could deliver excellent growth and income in the coming years, especially considering its embarrassingly cheap valuation these days. 





After years of tumbling, this natural gas provider is set to shine
Jason Hall (Clean Energy Fuels Corp): Since peaking in early 2012 above $22.50, shares of Clean Energy Fuels are down almost 90%, and only a recent rally has them approaching $3 again. 
And not for no reason -- after all, the company has issued a huge quantity of new shares over the past 18 months, and it hasn't produced a profitable full year (on a GAAP basis) in more than a decade:

CLNE Net Income (Annual) data by YCharts.
Furthermore, low oil prices have impacted its near-term growth prospects, since cheaper diesel and gasoline reduce the financial incentive for vehicle fleet operators to make the move to natural gas. 
Despite these negatives, I think now's an excellent time to invest. 
To start, the balance sheet (once a weakness) is solid, having used all those shares issued to pay off nearly $200 million in debt. The company last reported $221 million in cash and $257 million in debt, down more than half. Combined with double-digit cuts in SG&A and capital spending (while still funding new station growth), this is the leanest the company has been in years. 
With full-year expenses on track to be even lower in 2017, while fuel sales keep growing, look for the results to keep improving. GAAP profits may still be a year or two away, but -- more importantly -- cash flows are already positive and set to grow.

Obscure Coal CEO Rains Money on Trump While Outflanking Rivals
By Tim Loh

July 19, 2017, 6:00 AM EDT










                CEO Joseph Craft thought small as competitors made big buys
            



                Alliance Resource Partners has made money 17 years in a row
            



Coal mogul Joseph Craft was at a Department of Energy conference last month where everyone was reveling in President Donald Trump’s call to achieve “global energy dominance."A big-oil chief wanted more exports of America’s oil and natural gas riches. A union leader called for more investments in energy infrastructure. And Craft? More coal, of course.Joseph CraftSource: Alliance Resource Partners LP“We have been the backbone of the economy” the 66-year-old chief executive officer of Alliance Resource Partners LP declared. “Obviously, we can’t have ‘Energy Dominance’ without coal.”




That’s Craft’s bet, anyway. But he’s got some credibility to talk up his book. He steered Alliance Resource through the teeth of the industry’s worst downturn in generations and came out largely unscathed. For 17 straight years, Alliance has turned an annual profit and in 2016, when Peabody Energy Corp. and Arch Coal Inc. were mired in bankruptcy, the nation’s sixth biggest coal miner was making more money than any of its U.S. rivals.Little known to the general public, the camera-shy Craft is now being thrust into the spotlight. In January, he donated $1 million for Trump’s inauguration. In March, he sat front and center at the Environmental Protection Agency as the president signed an executive order and declared the “war on coal” over. And he’s well-connected: Craft’s wife, Kelly Knight Craft, a political fundraiser in her own right, has been nominated as U.S. ambassador to Canada.In Trump, Craft sees a return to the pro-coal policies that lured him into the industry four decades ago -- and reason to believe Alliance can keep growing into the 2020s.




“Some people don’t like his style,” he said of Trump at an investor conference in Florida this June. “But you can’t argue with the substance.”Changing TrendsCraft’s bullish view on coal runs up against staggering trends going in the opposite direction. Since 2008, U.S. production of the fossil fuel has fallen 40 percent, to 728 million tons last year. In April, coal generated just 28 percent of America’s electricity, about half the share it had when George W. Bush was president. Cheap gas, wind and solar power, tougher environmental policies and flat electricity usage in the U.S. have all played a part in coal’s decline. Few experts predict a rebound.

But Craft and a handful of other coal executives saw an opportunity. During the late 1990s and early 2000s, they bought up additional reserves of that high-sulfur coal on the cheap, betting successfully that more utilities would install scrubber technology to remove the sulfur-dioxide rather than ship in low-sulfur coal from as far away as Wyoming. Between 2000 and 2015, Illinois coal production grew almost 70 percent to 56 million tons.“He made the right move,” said George Dethlefsen, CEO of Corsa Coal, which produces the metallurgical coal used in steelmaking. “He’s stayed true to his strategy arguably better than anyone else in the industry.”For all the industry’s complaints about tough regulation under Barack Obama, the real crusher for several coal giants was self-inflicted.

By 2015, Alliance had methodically grown to produce a record 41 million tons, just when many of his rivals were flailing.At the Department of Energy panel, Craft called on the federal government to prevent more coal-fired power plants from shutting down and to come up with a way to make building new ones economical.But even with Trump’s regulatory rollbacks and promises to bring coal jobs back, competitive challenges remain in a world that appears mostly united in cutting carbon emissions to combat climate change.“He can’t change that in the end,” said Tom Sanzillo, director of finance at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. “But in the meantime, he’s running a disciplined operation”

Obscure Coal CEO Rains Money on Trump While Outflanking RivalsTim LohJul 19, 2017 7:00 am ET(Bloomberg) -- Coal mogul Joseph Craft was at a Department of Energy conference last month where everyone was reveling in President Donald Trump’s call to achieve “global energy dominance."A big-oil chief wanted more exports of America’s oil and natural gas riches. A union leader called for more investments in energy infrastructure. And Craft? More coal, of course.“We have been the backbone of the economy” the 66-year-old chief executive officer of Alliance Resource Partners LP declared. “Obviously, we can’t have ‘Energy Dominance’ without coal.”That’s Craft’s bet, anyway. But he’s got some credibility to talk up his book. He steered Alliance Resource through the teeth of the industry’s worst downturn in generations and came out largely unscathed. For 17 straight years, Alliance has turned an annual profit and in 2016, when Peabody Energy Corp. and Arch Coal Inc. were mired in bankruptcy, the nation’s sixth biggest coal miner was making more money than any of its U.S. rivals.Little known to the general public, the camera-shy Craft is now being thrust into the spotlight. In January, he donated $1 million for Trump’s inauguration. In March, he sat front and center at the Environmental Protection Agency as the president signed an executive order and declared the “war on coal” over. And he’s well-connected: Craft’s wife, Kelly Knight Craft, a political fundraiser in her own right, has been nominated as U.S. ambassador to Canada.In Trump, Craft sees a return to the pro-coal policies that lured him into the industry four decades ago -- and reason to believe Alliance can keep growing into the 2020s.“Some people don’t like his style,” he said of Trump at an investor conference in Florida this June. “But you can’t argue with the substance.”Changing TrendsCraft’s bullish view on coal runs up against staggering trends going in the opposite direction. Since 2008, U.S. production of the fossil fuel has fallen 40 percent, to 728 million tons last year. In April, coal generated just 28 percent of America’s electricity, about half the share it had when George W. Bush was president. Cheap gas, wind and solar power, tougher environmental policies and flat electricity usage in the U.S. have all played a part in coal’s decline. Few experts predict a rebound.But amid the carnage, Alliance Resource is better-positioned to thrive than most peers.

Better Buy: Alliance Resource Partners LP vs. CONSOL Energy
Should you bank on the future of coal or the transition to natural gas?











                Reuben Gregg Brewer
            

                (TMFReubenGBrewer)



            
            Jul 14, 2017 at 8:08AM
            
            





Between them, CONSOL Energy (NYSE:CNX) and Alliance Resource Partners LP (NASDAQ:ARLP) have solid histories in the coal sector. But their responses to thermal coal’s cloudy future have been sharply different. Both strategies have their merits, too — so picking which one is better for your portfolio will mean first deciding what kind of energy-sector exposure you’re interested in, and what sort of time horizon you’re looking toward.
Coal or gas, but not both
CONSOL Energy was once one of the largest coal miners in the United States. But then it parted ways its peers in an aggressive move to follow its key customers -- electric utilities -- in their ongoing shift away from coal and toward lower-priced, less-polluting natural gas. It's a power industry trend that isn't going to reverse itself because so many coal-powered plants have already been replaced with natural gas plants.

CONSOL Energy's choice was a bold one, to be sure, but it was a move that will help ensure its (very) long-term viability. The strategy included selling coal mines and creating a coal-focused limited partnership to which CONSOL could sell its remaining coal assets. And with coal markets starting to improve lately, CONSOL is now looking to speed up the process. Its next moves could include a spinoff or outright sale of those coal businesses it has retained. So for long-term investors, it's best to view CONSOL as a pure-play natural gas business.    
That hasn't been great for investors so far. As the transition unfolded, CONSOL cut its dividend twice, leaving it at a penny share, then eliminated it completely in 2016. That wasn't surprising since the company has been bleeding red ink for a couple of years, a pattern that continued with its recent first-quarter loss of $0.17 a share. And until the company fully divests itself from the coal business it's probably best to expect quarterly results to be... complicated.     
It's all in the distribution
CONSOL made a difficult choice, and it's following through on it. But it's probably the right long-term move if the company wants to be around in 100 years. But coal is far from dead. For example, the U.S. Energy Information Administration forecasts continuing demand for coal out to 2040 and beyond (2040 is as far as its projections go today, but it's safe to say demand won't drop to zero in 2041). It also expects the Interior coal region will command a growing slice of the coal market, expanding its share from 20% to 26%.    

Coal isn't going away anytime soon. Image source: U.S. Energy Information Administration 

These two facts are important to this comparison because Alliance Resource Partners' business is focused on mining thermal coal from the Illinois Basin, which is in the Interior region. So its core business has decades to go before it's dead, and it's operating in the right coal region, too. This helps explain why Alliance has remained profitable right through a coal market downturn that pushed competitors into the red or, worse, into bankruptcy court.    
Add the partnership's roughly 9% distribution yield into the mix, and you might start to be interested in Alliance as an investment. The distribution, meanwhile, was covered by a massive 2.38 times in the first quarter and coverage was roughly 2 times in 2016. (Coverage of 1.2 times is considered good in the partnership space.) To be fair, the distribution was cut in 2016, but at the time, management noted the move was made to appease capital markets, not out of financial necessity. The coverage ratios back that statement up. With capital market fears abating, however, Alliance hinted in the first quarter that distribution hikes could again be in the cards.   
If you are looking for an investment that you can leave to your great-grandchildren, Alliance might not be the best option. But if you are looking for a large and steady income stream with some potential for distribution growth, well, owning one of the best coal miners around might be a good plan for you.





A bird in the hand
When you compare CONSOL and Alliance, you have to ask yourself what you are looking for. CONSOL is still struggling through its long-term transition from coal to natural gas. That's probably the right move if your time horizon is 50 to 100 years. But if your needs are a little nearer term, like helping to pay for retirement expenses, then Alliance's well-covered 9% distribution yield makes it a better option. That thesis is backed up by the coal miner's advantaged industry position in the Illinois coal basin and its hints at distribution increases. I think Alliance is the better option here, as long as you realize that most of your return is going to come from its 9% yield and not business growth.

July 21--An Alliance coal executive offered his take on the recent history, present status and future projections for the coal industry during a Henderson County Republican Party meeting.
Heath Lovell, vice president of public affairs for Alliance Resource Partners, spoke at length during Thursday night's well-attended meeting.
"The way we see it, it was very clear that the Obama administration went to a high-cost energy strategy," said Lovell. "If you think about America, really ever since the 1970s, we have thrived on a low-cost energy strategy."
Historically, Kentucky has attracted steel, car, aluminum, chemical and other manufacturers to the state because of cheap electricity rates.
"We are not going to compete with China and Mexico on cheap labor costs," he said. "We're not going to compete with them on regulations. We're not going to compete with them on a lot of things, but we can compete with them on electricity."
He said energy costs went up because of EPA regulations during the Obama administration. The regulations led to higher costs in electricity and that resulted in the loss of manufacturing and coal jobs, he said. It also affected local and state government because they lost tax revenue.
"In the state of Kentucky, the single largest taxpayer is Alliance Coal," he said. "A lot of people don't realize that. We pay well over $50 million a year in taxes. So when coal goes down, it's not just coal jobs."
Lovell noted that since the Trump administration has taken office, they have worked to dismantle the EPA regulations put in place by the previous administration.
"You turn on the TV, and you know Trump and his administration is being attacked a lot. That may be putting it mildly," Lovell said. "But from the coal perspective, well, I've told people this, I didn't care as long as they put (Neil) Gorsuch on the Supreme Court and then put (Scott) Pruitt in the EPA; we would just call it done."
He added that from a coal perspective, "Don't put too much into his style, but look at what he's done from substance with relationship to coal."
Lovell cited Trump pulling out of the Paris Climate Agreement, signing an executive order to create energy independence, and dismantling the stream protection rule, which was an Obama administration regulation aimed at protecting streams from pollution.
However, on the horizon, Lovell said there are still projections for more coal plant retirements.
There were about 350 megawatts fired generation in 2010 and 66 megawatts have closed, he said. Another 33 megawatts are expected to close by 2020.  He noted that Indiana has the second most amount of coal plants set to close.
But Lovell believes coal can compete with natural gas.
"I'm a conservative. I just want to be able to compete," he said. "If natural gas is the cheapest, that's OK. We'll just buy natural gas leases. If coal's cheapest, we'll just buy mining leases. We could adapt as a company. We believe industries, Americans deserve the cheapest electricity."
While he thinks coal can compete with any energy source, Lovell said the problem is there's not a free market in electricity today. He cited the Production Tax Credit for wind energy, and how wind and solar energy has to be consumed immediately, whereas coal can be stored as examples.
The goal going forward is to preserve the fleet, he said.
"We've got to make sure that no additional coal plant closes," Lovell said. "We'll worry about modifying and we'll worry about building new ones in the second Trump administration. The first Trump administration we just want to keep them open."

Summary  We are a diversified producer and marketer of coal primarily to major United States ("U.S.") utilities and industrial users. We began mining operations in 1971 and, since then, have grown through acquisitions and internal development to become the second largest coal producer in the eastern U.S. As is customary in the coal industry, we have entered into long-term coal supply agreements with many of our customers. We operate eight underground mining complexes in Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland and West Virginia, and operate a coal loading terminal on the Ohio River at Mt. Vernon, Indiana.  We have two reportable segments: Illinois Basin and Appalachia, and an "all other" category referred to as Other and Corporate. Our reportable segments correspond to major coal producing regions in the eastern U.S. Factors similarly affecting financial performance of our operating segments within each of these two reportable segments generally include coal quality, geology, coal marketing opportunities, mining and transportation methods and regulatory issues.  � Illinois Basin reportable segment is comprised of multiple operating segments, including the following current operating mining complexes: a) Webster County Coal, LLC's Dotiki mining complex; b) Gibson County Coal, LLC's mining complex, which includes the Gibson North (currently idled) and Gibson South mines; c) Warrior Coal, LLC's mining complex; d) River View Coal, LLC's mining complex ("River View") and e) Hamilton County Coal, LLC's mining complex ("Hamilton"). The Gibson North mine has been idled since the fourth quarter of 2015 in response to market conditions.  The Illinois Basin reportable segment also includes White County Coal, LLC's Pattiki mining complex ("Pattiki"); Hopkins County Coal, LLC's mining complex, which includes the Elk Creek mine ("Elk Creek"), the Pleasant View surface mineable reserves and the Fies underground project; Sebree Mining, LLC's mining complex ("Sebree"), which includes the Onton mine, Steamport, LLC and certain Sebree reserves; CR Services, LLC; CR Machine Shop, LLC; certain properties and equipment of Alliance Resource Properties; ARP Sebree, LLC; ARP Sebree South, LLC and UC Coal, LLC and its subsidiaries, UC Mining, LLC and UC Processing, LLC (collectively "UC Coal"). The Pattiki mine ceased production in December 2016.  Table of Contents  � Appalachia reportable segment is comprised of multiple operating segments, including the Mettiki mining complex ("Mettiki"); the Tunnel Ridge, LLC mining complex ("Tunnel Ridge"); and the MC Mining, LLC mining complex ("MC Mining"). The Mettiki mining complex includes Mettiki Coal (WV), LLC's Mountain View mine and Mettiki Coal, LLC's preparation plant.  � Other and Corporate includes marketing and administrative activities; Alliance Service, Inc. ("ASI") and its subsidiary, Matrix Design Group, LLC ("Matrix Design") and its subsidiaries Matrix Design International, LLC and Matrix Design Africa (PTY) LTD; Alliance Design Group, LLC; ASI's ownership of aircraft; the Mt. Vernon Transfer Terminal, LLC ("Mt. Vernon") dock activities; coal brokerage activity; the manufacturing and sales (primarily to our mines) of rock dust by Mid-America Carbonates, LLC; certain activities of Alliance Resource Properties; Pontiki Coal, LLC's throughput receivables and prior workers' compensation and pneumoconiosis liabilities; Wildcat Insurance, LLC; Alliance Minerals, LLC ("Alliance Minerals"), which holds direct equity investments in AllDale Minerals III, LP ("AllDale III"), and its affiliate, Cavalier Minerals JV, LLC ("Cavalier Minerals"), which holds equity investments in AllDale Minerals, LP and AllDale Minerals II, LP (collectively with AllDale III, the "AllDale Partnerships"), AROP Funding, LLC ("AROP Funding") and our new subsidiary formed March 30, 2017, Alliance Resource Finance Corporation ("Alliance Finance"). Please read "Item 1. Financial Statements (Unaudited) - Note 6. Long-term Debt", "- Note 7. Variable Interest Entities" and "- Note 8. Equity Investment" of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for more information on AROP Funding, Alliance Finance, Alliance Minerals, Cavalier Minerals and the AllDale Partnerships.  Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 Compared to Three Months Ended March 31, 2016  We reported net income attributable to ARLP of $104.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 ("2017 Quarter") compared to $47.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016 ("2016 Quarter"). The increase of $57.6 million was due to increased coal sales volumes, which rose to 9.6 million tons sold in the 2017 Quarter compared to 7.5 million tons sold in the 2016 Quarter, higher other sales and operating revenues, lower depreciation, depletion and amortization, lower operating expenses and higher equity in earnings of affiliates from our investments in oil and gas mineral interests, offset in part by lower coal sales price realizations. Total revenues increased to $461.1 million in the 2017 Quarter compared to $412.8 million in the 2016 Quarter as increased sales volumes and other sales and operating revenues more than offset lower coal sales prices. Even though coal sales and production volumes increased by 28.9% and 15.0%, respectively, for the 2017 Quarter, operating expenses were slightly lower compared to the 2016 Quarter reflecting the benefits of our recent efficiency initiatives to shift production to lower-cost operations. The favorable production cost mix in the 2017 Quarter significantly lowered operating expenses per ton sold compared to the 2016 Quarter. Results presented for the 2016 Quarter have been recast to reflect a reclassification of depreciation and depletion capitalized into coal inventory as an adjustment to depreciation, depletion and amortization rather than operating expenses.   Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 (in thousands) (per ton sold) Tons sold 9,610 7,456 N/A N/A Tons produced 10,218 8,884 N/A N/A Coal sales $ 438,744 $ 401,292 $ 45.65 $ 53.82 Operating expenses $ 262,792 $ 263,579 $ 27.35 $ 35.35  Coal sales. Coal sales increased $37.4 million or 9.3% to $438.7 million for the 2017 Quarter from $401.3 million for the 2016 Quarter. The increase in coal sales reflected the benefit of increased tons sold, which contributed $115.9 million in additional coal sales, partially offset by lower average coal sales prices, which reduced coal sales by $78.5 million. Sales and production volumes rose to 9.6 million tons sold and 10.2 million tons produced in the 2017 Quarter compared to 7.5 million tons sold and 8.9 million tons produced in the 2016 Quarter, primarily due to strong performances at the Gibson South, River View, Hamilton and Tunnel Ridge mines. Average coal sales prices decreased $8.17 per ton sold in the 2017 Quarter to $45.65 compared to $53.82 per ton sold in the 2016 Quarter, primarily as a result of the expiration and/or renegotiation of certain higher-priced long-term contracts in addition to a significant increase in lower price export tons shipped from our Illinois Basin mines partially offset by increased higher priced export shipments from our Mettiki mine. There were no export shipments in the 2016 Quarter.  Operating expenses. Operating expenses decreased 0.3% to $262.8 million for the 2017 Quarter from $263.6 million for the 2016 Quarter primarily as a result of the previously discussed favorable production cost mix. On a per ton  Table of Contents  basis, operating expenses decreased 22.6% to $27.35 per ton sold from $35.35 per ton sold in the 2016 Quarter, due primarily to the lower-cost production mix and increased sales and production volumes. The most significant impacts on operating expenses are discussed below:  � Labor and benefit expenses per ton produced, excluding workers' compensation, decreased 25.3% to $8.70 per ton in the 2017 Quarter from $11.65 per ton in the 2016 Quarter. This decrease of $2.95 per ton was primarily attributable to the increased mix of lower-cost production discussed above;  � Material and supplies expenses per ton produced decreased 12.3% to $8.81 per ton in the 2017 Quarter from $10.05 per ton in the 2016 Quarter. The decrease of $1.24 per ton produced resulted primarily from the increased mix of lower-cost production discussed above and decreases of $0.33 per ton for power and fuel used in the mining process, $0.23 per ton in longwall subsidence expense, $0.20 per ton in outside services used in the mining process, $0.19 per ton for roof support and $0.17 per ton for certain ventilation expenses;  � Maintenance expenses per ton produced decreased 9.9% to $3.17 per ton in the 2017 Quarter from $3.52 per ton in the 2016 Quarter. The decrease of $0.35 per ton produced was primarily due to the increased mix of lower-cost production discussed above; and  � Production taxes and royalties expenses incurred as a percentage of coal sales prices and volumes decreased $0.95 per produced ton sold in the 2017 Quarter compared to the 2016 Quarter primarily as a result of lower excise taxes per ton resulting from a favorable state production mix and lower average coal sales prices as discussed above.  Other sales and operating revenues. Other sales and operating revenues were principally comprised of Mt. Vernon transloading revenues, Matrix Design sales, other outside services and administrative services revenue from affiliates. Other sales and operating revenues increased to $12.7 million in the 2017 Quarter from $5.0 million in the 2016 Quarter. The increase of $7.7 million was primarily due to increased mining technology product sales by Matrix Design and increased transloading revenues from Mt. Vernon.  Depreciation, depletion and amortization. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense decreased to $65.1 million in the 2017 Quarter from $70.6 million in the 2016 Quarter. The decrease of $5.5 million resulted primarily from the depletion of reserves at our Elk Creek mine in the 2016 Quarter and closure of the Pattiki mine in the fourth quarter of 2016, offset in part by an increase in coal sales volumes at the Hamilton and Tunnel Ridge mines in the 2017 Quarter.  Equity in income (loss) of affiliates. Equity in earnings of affiliates increased $3.7 million in the 2017 Quarter compared to the 2016 Quarter due to increased earnings from our investments in the AllDale Partnerships.  Transportation revenues and expenses. Transportation revenues and expenses were $9.6 million and $6.6 million for the 2017 and 2016 Quarters, respectively. The increase of $3.0 million was primarily attributable to increased tonnage for which we arranged transportation at certain mines, partially offset by a decrease in average transportation rates in the 2017 Quarter. The cost of transportation services are passed through to our customers. Consequently, we do not realize any gain or loss on transportation revenues.  Table of Contents  Segment Adjusted EBITDA. Our 2017 Quarter Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased $50.9 million, or 35.7%, to $193.7 million from the 2016 Quarter Segment Adjusted EBITDA of $142.8 million. Segment Adjusted EBITDA, tons sold, coal sales, other sales and operating revenues and Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense by segment are:   Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 2016 Increase (Decrease) (in thousands) Segment Adjusted EBITDA Illinois Basin $ 106,263 $ 104,772 $ 1,491 1.4 % Appalachia 73,187 36,669 36,518 99.6 % Other and Corporate 16,461 4,229 12,232 (1) Elimination (2,221) (2,914) 693 23.8 % Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA (2) $ 193,690 $ 142,756 $ 50,934 35.7 % Tons sold Illinois Basin 6,665 5,530 1,135 20.5 % Appalachia 2,930 1,926 1,004 52.1 % Other and Corporate 342 367 (25) (6.8) % Elimination (327) (367) 40 10.9 % Total tons sold 9,610 7,456 2,154 28.9 % Coal sales Illinois Basin $ 266,928 $ 282,689 $ (15,761) (5.6) % Appalachia 167,773 115,344 52,429 45.5 % Other and Corporate 15,248 17,298 (2,050) (11.9) % Elimination (11,205) (14,039) 2,834 20.2 % Total coal sales $ 438,744 $ 401,292 $ 37,452 9.3 % Other sales and operating revenues Illinois Basin $ 772 $ 726 $ 46 6.3 % Appalachia 730 1,054 (324) (30.7) % Other and Corporate 15,351 7,704 7,647 99.3 % Elimination (4,113) (4,505) 392 8.7 % Total other sales and operating revenues $ 12,740 $ 4,979 $ 7,761 (1) Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense Illinois Basin $ 161,437 $ 178,643 $ (17,206) (9.6) % Appalachia 95,317 79,729 15,588 19.6 % Other and Corporate 17,838 20,746 (2,908) (14.0) % Elimination (13,098) (15,630) 2,532 16.2 % Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense (2) $ 261,494 $ 263,488 $ (1,994) (0.8) %  (2) For a definition of Segment Adjusted EBITDA and Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense and related reconciliations to comparable generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") financial measures, please see below under "-Reconciliation of non-GAAP "Segment Adjusted EBITDA" to GAAP "net income" and reconciliation of non-GAAP "Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense" to GAAP "Operating Expenses." Results presented for Segment Adjusted EBITDA and Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense for the three months ended March 31, 2016 have been recast to reflect a reclassification of depreciation and depletion capitalized into coal inventory as adjustments to depreciation, depletion and amortization rather than operating expenses.  Illinois Basin - Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased 1.4% to $106.3 million in the 2017 Quarter from $104.8 million in the 2016 Quarter. The increase of $1.5 million was primarily attributable to decreased expenses per ton resulting from a favorable production mix, partially offset by lower coal sales, which decreased 5.6% to $266.9 million in the 2017  Table of Contents  Quarter from $282.7 million in the 2016 Quarter. The decrease of $15.8 million in coal sales primarily reflects lower average coal sales prices of $40.05 in the 2017 Quarter compared to $51.12 in the 2016 Quarter resulting from the expiration and/or renegotiation of certain higher-priced long-term contracts and 1.9 million tons of lower price export sales volumes, both in the 2017 Quarter. No export tons were sold in the 2016 Quarter. The lower sales prices were partially offset by increased tons sold, which increased 20.5% to 6.7 million tons in the 2017 Quarter compared to 5.5 million tons in the 2016 Quarter. Higher coal sales volumes resulted from increased sales from our River View, Gibson South and Hamilton operations, in addition to the increased export volumes mentioned above, offset in part by the previously mentioned depletion of reserves at our Elk Creek mine in the 2016 Quarter and the closure of the Pattiki mine in the fourth quarter of 2016. Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense decreased 9.6% to $161.4 million in the 2017 Quarter from $178.6 million in the 2016 Quarter due to reduced per ton expenses. Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense per ton decreased $8.08 per ton sold to $24.22 from $32.30 per ton sold in the 2016 Quarter, primarily due to reduced selling expenses, a significant increase in low-cost longwall production and improved recoveries at the Hamilton mine, and increased production and improved recoveries at our River View and Gibson South operations, as well as certain cost decreases described above under "-Operating expenses."  Appalachia - Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased 99.6% to $73.2 million for the 2017 Quarter from $36.7 million in the 2016 Quarter. The increase of $36.5 million was primarily attributable to increased tons sold, which rose 52.1% to 2.9 million tons sold in the 2017 Quarter compared to 1.9 million tons sold in the 2016 Quarter and lower Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense per ton, offset in part by lower average coal sales prices. Coal sales increased 45.5% to $167.8 million compared to $115.3 million in the 2016 Quarter. The increase of $52.5 million primarily resulted from increased sales volumes from our Tunnel Ridge longwall operation in addition to increased export sales from our Mettiki and MC Mining mines offset in part by lower average coal sales prices, which decreased 4.4% to $57.26 per ton sold compared to $59.89 per ton sold in the 2016 Quarter primarily reflecting lower Tunnel Ridge price realizations. Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense increased 19.6% to $95.3 million in the 2017 Quarter from $79.7 million in the 2016 Quarter due to increased sales volumes. However, Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense per ton decreased $8.87 per ton sold to $32.53 compared to $41.40 per ton sold in the 2016 Quarter, as a result of increased production and sales volumes at our Tunnel Ridge mine resulting from improved recoveries and additional longwall production days due in part to no longwall move days during the 2017 Quarter, as well as certain other cost decreases described above under "-Operating expenses."  Other and Corporate - In the 2017 Quarter, Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased $12.2 million compared to the 2016 Quarter primarily as a result of increased mining technology product sales by Matrix Design, increased transloading revenues from Mt. Vernon, as well as an increase in equity earnings from the AllDale Partnerships. Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense decreased to $17.8 million for the 2017 Quarter compared to $20.7 million for the 2016 Quarter primarily as a result of reduced intercompany coal brokerage activity.  Elimination - Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense eliminations decreased in the 2017 Quarter to $13.1 million from $15.6 million in the 2016 Quarter and coal sales eliminations decreased to $11.2 million from $14.0 million, reflecting reduced intercompany coal brokerage activity.  Reconciliation of non-GAAP "Segment Adjusted EBITDA" to GAAP "net income" and reconciliation of non-GAAP "Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense" to GAAP "Operating Expenses"  Segment Adjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP financial measure) is defined as net income (prior to the allocation of noncontrolling interest) before net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization and general and administrative expenses. Segment Adjusted EBITDA is a key component of consolidated EBITDA, which is used as a supplemental financial measure by management and by external users of our financial statements such as investors, commercial banks, research analysts and others. We believe that the presentation of EBITDA provides useful information to investors regarding our performance and results of operations because EBITDA, when used in conjunction with related GAAP financial measures, (i) provides additional information about our core operating performance and ability to generate and distribute cash flow, (ii) provides investors with the financial analytical framework upon which we base financial, operational, compensation and planning decisions and (iii) presents a measurement that investors, rating agencies and debt holders have indicated is useful in assessing us and our results of operations.  Segment Adjusted EBITDA is also used as a supplemental financial measure by our management for reasons similar to those stated in the previous explanation of EBITDA. In addition, the exclusion of corporate general and administrative expenses from consolidated Segment Adjusted EBITDA allows management to focus solely on the evaluation of segment operating profitability as it relates to our revenues and operating expenses, which are primarily  Table of Contents  controlled by our segments. Results presented for Segment Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended March 31, 2016 have been recast to reflect a reclassification of depreciation and depletion capitalized into coal inventory as adjustments to depreciation, depletion and amortization rather than operating expenses.  The following is a reconciliation of consolidated Segment Adjusted EBITDA to net income, the most comparable GAAP financial measure:   Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 2016 (in thousands) Consolidated Segment Adjusted EBITDA $ 193,690 $ 142,756 General and administrative (16,033) (17,238) Depreciation, depletion and amortization (65,127) (70,607) Interest expense, net (7,492) (7,612) Income tax benefit 12 9 Net income $ 105,050 $ 47,308  Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense (a non-GAAP financial measure) includes operating expenses, coal purchases and other income. Transportation expenses are excluded as these expenses are passed through to our customers and, consequently, we do not realize any gain or loss on transportation revenues. Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense is used as a supplemental financial measure by our management to assess the operating performance of our segments. Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense is a key component of Segment Adjusted EBITDA in addition to coal sales and other sales and operating revenues. The exclusion of corporate general and administrative expenses from Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense allows management to focus solely on the evaluation of segment operating performance as it primarily relates to our operating expenses. Results presented for Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense for the three months ended March 31, 2016 have been recast to reflect a reclassification of depreciation and depletion capitalized into coal inventory as adjustments to depreciation, depletion and amortization rather than operating expenses.  The following is a reconciliation of consolidated Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense to operating expense, the most comparable GAAP financial measure:   Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 2016 (in thousands) Segment Adjusted EBITDA Expense $ 261,494 $ 263,488 Other income 1,298 91 Operating expenses (excluding depreciation, depletion and amortization) $ 262,792 $ 263,579  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Liquidity  We have historically satisfied our working capital requirements and funded our capital expenditures, equity investments and debt service obligations with cash generated from operations, cash provided by the issuance of debt or equity, borrowings under credit and securitization facilities and sale-leaseback transactions. We believe that existing cash balances, future cash flows from operations, borrowings under credit facilities, sale-leaseback transactions and cash provided from the issuance of debt or equity will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements, capital expenditures and additional equity investments, debt payments, commitments and distribution payments. Nevertheless, our ability to satisfy our working capital requirements, to fund planned capital expenditures and equity investments, to service our debt obligations or to pay . . .
