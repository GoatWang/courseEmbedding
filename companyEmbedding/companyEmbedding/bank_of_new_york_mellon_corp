History[edit]




Bank of New York at 48 Wall St.


The Bank of New York was founded on June 9, 1784,[2] making it the second-oldest bank in the United States behind the Bank of North America. Alexander Hamilton wrote the new bank's constitution, and became the individual most actively involved in the organization of The Bank of New York, guiding it through its early stages. The bank opened for business at the Walton House in Lower Manhattan only a few months after the departure of British troops from American soil. It opened with a capitalization of $500,000.[2] William Seton, future father-in-law of Saint Elizabeth Seton, was named director in 1786.[3]
To commemorate its 225th anniversary, BNY Mellon created a 5-part video series entitled "Looking Forward : The 225th Anniversary of The Bank of New York Mellon" which was narrated by historian Richard Brookhiser and recaps the company’s history from its founding in 1784. The segments are entitled:
Part 1 : New Beginnings[4] Part 2 : A Company of Visionaries[5] Part 3 : A Catalyst for Success[6] Part 4 : A Focus on Clients[7] Part 5 : A Commitment to Help[8]
Timeline[edit]

1968: The Bank formed its holding company, The Bank of New York Company, Inc.
1982: Bruce Rappaport purchases a 7.5% stake in The Bank of New York [9]
1988: The Bank of New York acquired the Irving Bank Corporation[10] and moved its headquarters to One Wall Street, now known as the Bank of New York Building.
1990s: The Bank acquired the National Community Banks in New Jersey and the Putnam Trust Company in Connecticut.
2003: The Bank of New York acquired Pershing LLC,[11] a provider of correspondent clearing and outsourcing services for broker dealers, asset managers. and financial intermediaries. That same year, the Bank integrated Lockwood Financial Services, Inc.[12] into Pershing, creating one of the largest providers of managed account programs with client assets totaling nearly US$18 billion.
Late 2005: The Bank of New York settled with federal regulators for US$38 million regarding a money laundering scandal that began in 1996. The illegal operation involved two Russian emigres—one of whom was a Vice President of the bank—moving over US$7 billion via hundreds of wires, and ended in the prosecution of at least nine individuals.
April 7, 2006: J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. announced they would swap their corporate trust unit for Bank of New York Co.'s retail and small business banking network. The swap valued the Bank of New York business at US$3.1 billion, and JPMorgan's trust unit at US$2.8 billion and gave Chase access to 338 additional branches and 700,000 new customers in the New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut Tri-State area.
December 4, 2006: The Bank of New York and Mellon Financial Corporation announced a merger, in which the name would be changed to The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation, or BNY Mellon, creating the world's largest securities servicing provider and a top asset management firm globally.
May 2007: Russia filed a US$22.5 billion lawsuit against the bank for money laundering.[13] The suit was subsequently settled for $14 million.[14]

Merger with Mellon[edit]




Madison Avenue branch


Talks of a merger began when Tom Renyi approached Robert Kelly about a possible amalgamation between the Bank of New York and Mellon Financial Corporation.[15] The US$16.5 billion deal was finalized on July 1, 2007, with Kelly as the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the new company, and Renyi as Executive Chairman.[15][16] Per the deal, the new Board of Directors is composed of ten directors appointed by the Bank of New York, and eight by Mellon.[17] The Bank of New York Mellon launched its new brand identity as on October 1, 2007.
Currency trading lawsuit[edit]
In October, 2011, the Justice Department and New York's attorney general filed civil lawsuits against the Bank of New York, alleging foreign currency fraud. The suits hold that the bank deceived pension-fund clients by manipulating the prices assigned to them for foreign currency transactions. Allegedly, the bank selected the day's lowest rates for currency sales and highest rates for purchases, appropriating the difference as corporate profit. The scheme is said to have generated $2 billion for the bank, at the expense of millions of Americans' retirement funds, and to have transpired over more than a decade. Purportedly, the bank would offer secret pricing deals to clients who raised concerns, in order to avoid discovery. Bank of New York has defended itself vigorously, maintaining the fraud accusations are "flat out wrong" and warning that as the bank employs 8,700 employees in New York, any damage to the bank would have negative repercussions for the state of New York.[18][19]

History[edit]




Bank of New York at 48 Wall St.


The Bank of New York was founded on June 9, 1784,[2] making it the second-oldest bank in the United States behind the Bank of North America. Alexander Hamilton wrote the new bank's constitution, and became the individual most actively involved in the organization of The Bank of New York, guiding it through its early stages. The bank opened for business at the Walton House in Lower Manhattan only a few months after the departure of British troops from American soil. It opened with a capitalization of $500,000.[2] William Seton, future father-in-law of Saint Elizabeth Seton, was named director in 1786.[3]
To commemorate its 225th anniversary, BNY Mellon created a 5-part video series entitled "Looking Forward : The 225th Anniversary of The Bank of New York Mellon" which was narrated by historian Richard Brookhiser and recaps the company’s history from its founding in 1784. The segments are entitled:
Part 1 : New Beginnings[4] Part 2 : A Company of Visionaries[5] Part 3 : A Catalyst for Success[6] Part 4 : A Focus on Clients[7] Part 5 : A Commitment to Help[8]
Timeline[edit]

1784: The Bank of New York is founded on June 9, 1784 by Alexander Hamilton.
1792: The Bank of New York was the first corporate stock to be traded on the New York Stock Exchange.
1922: The Bank merged with the New York Life Insurance & Trust Company.
1948: The Bank acquired The Fifth Avenue Bank.





Older Bank of New York logo



1966: The Bank acquired the Empire Trust Company.
1968: The Bank formed its holding company, The Bank of New York Company, Inc.
1982: Bruce Rappaport purchases a 7.5% stake in The Bank of New York [9]
1988: The Bank of New York acquired the Irving Bank Corporation[10] and moved its headquarters to One Wall Street, now known as the Bank of New York Building.
1990s: The Bank acquired the National Community Banks in New Jersey and the Putnam Trust Company in Connecticut.
2003: The Bank of New York acquired Pershing LLC,[11] a provider of correspondent clearing and outsourcing services for broker dealers, asset managers. and financial intermediaries. That same year, the Bank integrated Lockwood Financial Services, Inc.[12] into Pershing, creating one of the largest providers of managed account programs with client assets totaling nearly US$18 billion.
Late 2005: The Bank of New York settled with federal regulators for US$38 million regarding a money laundering scandal that began in 1996. The illegal operation involved two Russian emigres—one of whom was a Vice President of the bank—moving over US$7 billion via hundreds of wires, and ended in the prosecution of at least nine individuals.
April 7, 2006: J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. announced they would swap their corporate trust unit for Bank of New York Co.'s retail and small business banking network. The swap valued the Bank of New York business at US$3.1 billion, and JPMorgan's trust unit at US$2.8 billion and gave Chase access to 338 additional branches and 700,000 new customers in the New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut Tri-State area.
December 4, 2006: The Bank of New York and Mellon Financial Corporation announced a merger, in which the name would be changed to The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation, or BNY Mellon, creating the world's largest securities servicing provider and a top asset management firm globally.
May 2007: Russia filed a US$22.5 billion lawsuit against the bank for money laundering.[13] The suit was subsequently settled for $14 million.[14]

Merger with Mellon[edit]




Madison Avenue branch


Talks of a merger began when Tom Renyi approached Robert Kelly about a possible amalgamation between the Bank of New York and Mellon Financial Corporation.[15] The US$16.5 billion deal was finalized on July 1, 2007, with Kelly as the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the new company, and Renyi as Executive Chairman.[15][16] Per the deal, the new Board of Directors is composed of ten directors appointed by the Bank of New York, and eight by Mellon.[17] The Bank of New York Mellon launched its new brand identity as on October 1, 2007.
Currency trading lawsuit[edit]
In October, 2011, the Justice Department and New York's attorney general filed civil lawsuits against the Bank of New York, alleging foreign currency fraud. The suits hold that the bank deceived pension-fund clients by manipulating the prices assigned to them for foreign currency transactions. Allegedly, the bank selected the day's lowest rates for currency sales and highest rates for purchases, appropriating the difference as corporate profit. The scheme is said to have generated $2 billion for the bank, at the expense of millions of Americans' retirement funds, and to have transpired over more than a decade. Purportedly, the bank would offer secret pricing deals to clients who raised concerns, in order to avoid discovery. Bank of New York has defended itself vigorously, maintaining the fraud accusations are "flat out wrong" and warning that as the bank employs 8,700 employees in New York, any damage to the bank would have negative repercussions for the state of New York.[18][19]

History[edit]




Bank of New York at 48 Wall St.


The Bank of New York was founded on June 9, 1784,[2] making it the second-oldest bank in the United States behind the Bank of North America. Alexander Hamilton wrote the new bank's constitution, and became the individual most actively involved in the organization of The Bank of New York, guiding it through its early stages. The bank opened for business at the Walton House in Lower Manhattan only a few months after the departure of British troops from American soil. It opened with a capitalization of $500,000.[2] William Seton, future father-in-law of Saint Elizabeth Seton, was named director in 1786.[3]
To commemorate its 225th anniversary, BNY Mellon created a 5-part video series entitled "Looking Forward : The 225th Anniversary of The Bank of New York Mellon" which was narrated by historian Richard Brookhiser and recaps the company’s history from its founding in 1784. The segments are entitled:
Part 1 : New Beginnings[4] Part 2 : A Company of Visionaries[5] Part 3 : A Catalyst for Success[6] Part 4 : A Focus on Clients[7] Part 5 : A Commitment to Help[8]
Timeline[edit]

1784: The Bank of New York is founded on June 9, 1784 by Alexander Hamilton.
1792: The Bank of New York was the first corporate stock to be traded on the New York Stock Exchange.
1922: The Bank merged with the New York Life Insurance & Trust Company.
1948: The Bank acquired The Fifth Avenue Bank.

1966: The Bank acquired the Empire Trust Company.
1968: The Bank formed its holding company, The Bank of New York Company, Inc.
1982: Bruce Rappaport purchases a 7.5% stake in The Bank of New York [9]
1988: The Bank of New York acquired the Irving Bank Corporation[10] and moved its headquarters to One Wall Street, now known as the Bank of New York Building.
1990s: The Bank acquired the National Community Banks in New Jersey and the Putnam Trust Company in Connecticut.
2003: The Bank of New York acquired Pershing LLC,[11] a provider of correspondent clearing and outsourcing services for broker dealers, asset managers. and financial intermediaries. That same year, the Bank integrated Lockwood Financial Services, Inc.[12] into Pershing, creating one of the largest providers of managed account programs with client assets totaling nearly US$18 billion.
Late 2005: The Bank of New York settled with federal regulators for US$38 million regarding a money laundering scandal that began in 1996. The illegal operation involved two Russian emigres—one of whom was a Vice President of the bank—moving over US$7 billion via hundreds of wires, and ended in the prosecution of at least nine individuals.
April 7, 2006: J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. announced they would swap their corporate trust unit for Bank of New York Co.'s retail and small business banking network. The swap valued the Bank of New York business at US$3.1 billion, and JPMorgan's trust unit at US$2.8 billion and gave Chase access to 338 additional branches and 700,000 new customers in the New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut Tri-State area.
December 4, 2006: The Bank of New York and Mellon Financial Corporation announced a merger, in which the name would be changed to The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation, or BNY Mellon, creating the world's largest securities servicing provider and a top asset management firm globally.
May 2007: Russia filed a US$22.5 billion lawsuit against the bank for money laundering.[13] The suit was subsequently settled for $14 million.[14]

Merger with Mellon[edit]




Madison Avenue branch


Talks of a merger began when Tom Renyi approached Robert Kelly about a possible amalgamation between the Bank of New York and Mellon Financial Corporation.[15] The US$16.5 billion deal was finalized on July 1, 2007, with Kelly as the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the new company, and Renyi as Executive Chairman.[15][16] Per the deal, the new Board of Directors is composed of ten directors appointed by the Bank of New York, and eight by Mellon.[17] The Bank of New York Mellon launched its new brand identity as on October 1, 2007.
Currency trading lawsuit[edit]
In October, 2011, the Justice Department and New York's attorney general filed civil lawsuits against the Bank of New York, alleging foreign currency fraud. The suits hold that the bank deceived pension-fund clients by manipulating the prices assigned to them for foreign currency transactions. Allegedly, the bank selected the day's lowest rates for currency sales and highest rates for purchases, appropriating the difference as corporate profit. The scheme is said to have generated $2 billion for the bank, at the expense of millions of Americans' retirement funds, and to have transpired over more than a decade. Purportedly, the bank would offer secret pricing deals to clients who raised concerns, in order to avoid discovery. Bank of New York has defended itself vigorously, maintaining the fraud accusations are "flat out wrong" and warning that as the bank employs 8,700 employees in New York, any damage to the bank would have negative repercussions for the state of New York.[18][19]

Looking at the universe of stocks we cover at Dividend Channel , on 7/28/17, Beneficial Bancorp Inc (Symbol: BNCL), Tompkins Financial Corp (Symbol: TMP), and Bank of New York Mellon Corp (Symbol: BK) will all trade ex-dividend for their respective upcoming dividends. Beneficial Bancorp Inc will pay its quarterly dividend of $0.06 on 8/11/17, Tompkins Financial Corp will pay its quarterly dividend of $0.45 on 8/15/17, and Bank of New York Mellon Corp will pay its quarterly dividend of $0.24 on 8/11/17. As a percentage of BNCL's recent stock price of $15.91, this dividend works out to approximately 0.38%, so look for shares of Beneficial Bancorp Inc to trade 0.38% lower - all else being equal - when BNCL shares open for trading on 7/28/17. Similarly, investors should look for TMP to open 0.55% lower in price and for BK to open 0.45% lower, all else being equal.

Below are dividend history charts for BNCL, TMP, and BK, showing historical dividends prior to the most recent ones declared. 

Beneficial Bancorp Inc (Symbol: BNCL) : Tompkins Financial Corp (Symbol: TMP) : Bank of New York Mellon Corp (Symbol: BK) : 

In general, dividends are not always predictable, following the ups and downs of company profits over time. Therefore, a good first due diligence step in forming an expectation of annual yield going forward, is looking at the history above, for a sense of stability over time. This can help in judging whether the most recent dividends from these companies are likely to continue. If they do continue, the current estimated yields on annualized basis would be 1.51% for Beneficial Bancorp Inc, 2.19% for Tompkins Financial Corp, and 1.78% for Bank of New York Mellon Corp. 



In Wednesday trading, Beneficial Bancorp Inc shares are currently off about 0.3%, Tompkins Financial Corp shares are up about 0.2%, and Bank of New York Mellon Corp shares are up about 0.2% on the day.

History[edit]
Bank of New York[edit]




The Walton Mansion housed the Bank of New York from 1784 to 1787.






Alexander Hamilton.


The Bank of New York was founded by Alexander Hamilton on June 9, 1784, in the old Walton Mansion in New York City.[8][9] Due to local politics, it wasn't able to procure a charter until 1791.[9] The President of the new bank was former Major General Alexander McDougall[10] and the Cashier was William Seton.[11]
The bank provided the United States government its first loan in 1789. The loan was orchestrated by Hamilton, then Secretary of the Treasury, and it paid the salaries of United States Congress members and President George Washington.[12] The Bank of New York was the first company to be traded on the New York Stock Exchange when it first opened in 1792.[13]
During the 1800s, the bank was known for its conservative lending practices that allowed it to weather financial crises. It was involved in the funding of the Morris and Erie canals, and steamboat companies.[14][15] The bank helped finance both the War of 1812 and the Union Army during the American Civil War.[16][17] Following the Civil War, the bank loaned money to many major infrastructure projects, including utilities, railroads, and the New York City Subway.[14]
Through the early 1900s, the Bank of New York continued to expand and prosper.[15][17] In July 1922, the bank merged with the New York Life Insurance and Trust Company.[18] The bank continued to profit and pay dividends throughout the Great Depression, and its total deposits increased during the decade.[15][17] In 1948, the Bank again merged, this time with the Fifth Avenue Bank, which was followed by a merger in 1966 with the Empire Trust Company.[14][17] The bank's holding company was created in 1969.[14]
In 1988, the Bank of New York merged with Irving Bank Corporation.[19] From 1993 to 1998, the bank made 33 acquisitions, including acquiring JP Morgan’s Global Custody Business in 1995.[17] Ivy Asset Management was acquired in 2000, and the bank acquired Pershing LLC, the United States' second-largest trade clearinghouse, in 2003.[17][20] In 2006, the Bank of New York traded its retail banking and regional middle-market businesses for J.P. Morgan Chase's corporate trust assets. The deal signaled the bank's exit from retail banking.[21]
Mellon Financial[edit]




Andrew W. Mellon


Mellon Financial was founded as T. Mellon & Sons' Bank in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1869 by retired judge Thomas Mellon and his sons Andrew W. Mellon and Richard B. Mellon.[22] The bank invested in and helped found numerous industrial firms in the late 1800s and early 1900s including Alcoa, Westinghouse, Gulf Oil, General Motors and Bethlehem Steel.[23][24] Both Gulf Oil and Alcoa are, according to the financial media, considered to be T. Mellon & Sons' most successful financial investments.[23][24]
In 1902, T. Mellon & Sons' name was changed to the Mellon National Bank.[23] The firm merged with the Union Trust Company, a business founded by Andrew Mellon, in 1946. The newly formed organization resulting from the merger was named the Mellon National Bank and Trust Company, and was Pittsburgh's first US$1 billion bank.[25]
The bank formed the first dedicated family office in the United States in 1971.[26] A reorganization in 1972 led to the bank's name changing to Mellon Bank, N.A. and the formation of a holding company, Mellon National Corporation.[22][23]
Mellon Bank acquired multiple banks and financial institutions in Pennsylvania during the 1980s and 1990s.[27] In 1992, Mellon acquired 54 branch offices of Philadelphia Savings Fund Society, the first savings bank in the United States, founded in 1819.[28]
In 1993, Mellon acquired The Boston Company from American Express and AFCO Credit Corporation from The Continental Corporation. The following year, Mellon merged with the Dreyfus Corporation, bringing its mutual funds under its umbrella.[23] In 1999, Mellon Bank Corporation became Mellon Financial Corporation. Two years later, it exited the retail banking business by selling its assets and retail bank branches to Citizens Financial Group.[23]
Merger[edit]
On December 4, 2006, the Bank of New York and Mellon Financial Corporation announced they would merge.[29] The merger created the world's largest securities servicing company and one of the largest asset management firms by combining Mellon’s wealth-management business and the Bank of New York’s asset-servicing and short-term-lending specialties.[8][29]
The deal was valued at $16.5 billion and under its terms, the Bank of New York's shareholders received 0.9434 shares in the new company for each share of the Bank of New York that they owned, while Mellon Financial shareholders received 1 share in the new company for each Mellon share they owned.[16] The Bank of New York and Mellon Financial entered into mutual stock option agreements for 19.9 percent of the issuer's outstanding common stock.[29] The merger was finalized on July 1, 2007.[30] The company's principal office of business at the One Wall Street office previously held by the Bank of New York.[31] The full name of the company became The Bank of New York Mellon Corp., with the BNY Mellon brand name being used for most lines of business.[30][31]
Recent history[edit]
In October 2008, the U.S. Treasury named BNY Mellon the master custodian of the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) bailout fund during the financial crisis of 2007 to 2010. BNY Mellon won the assignment, which included handling accounting and record-keeping for the program, through a bidding process.[32] In November 2008, the company announced that it would lay-off 1,800 employees, or 4 percent of its global workforce, due to the financial crisis.[33] According to the results of a February 2009 stress test conducted by federal regulators, BNY Mellon was one of only three banks that could withstand a worsening economic situation.[34] The company received $3 billion from TARP, which it paid back in full in June 2009, along with US$136 million to buy back warrants from the Treasury in August 2009.[35][36]
In August 2009, BNY Mellon purchased Insight Investment, a management business for external funds, from Lloyds Banking Group.[37] The company acquired PNC Financial Services' Global Investment Servicing Inc. in July 2010 and Talon Asset Management's wealth management business in 2011.[38][39]
By 2013, the company's capital had steadily risen from the financial crisis. In the results of the Federal Reserve's Dodd-Frank stress test in 2013, the bank was least affected by hypothetical extreme economic scenarios among banks tested.[40] It was also a top performer on the same test in 2014.[41]
BNY Mellon began a major branding campaign in 2013 to increase awareness of the company.[42] It adopted the slogan "The Investments Company for the World" and changed its logo.[42][43]
In May 2014, BNY Mellon agreed to sell the building housing its headquarters to increase efficiency. The company announced plans to move its headquarters to lower Manhattan in 2015, leasing space at Brookfield Place.[44] In June 2014, the company combined its global markets, global collateral services and prime services to create the new Markets Group,[45] also known as BNY Markets Mellon.[46] The company expanded its Hong Kong office in October 2014 as part of the company's plans to grow its wealth management business.[47] It opened the BNY Mellon Innovation Center, an office focused on emerging technologies, big data, digital and cloud-based projects, in Palo Alto in November 2014.[48][49]
Between 2014 and 2016, BNY Mellon opened innovation centers focused on emerging technologies, big data, digital and cloud-based projects in Silicon Valley, Jersey City, London, Pune, Chennai, Pittsburgh, Singapore, and Central New York.[48][49][50][51][52]
Since 2013, BNY Mellon has been building NEXEN, its next-generation technology platform.[53][54] NEXEN uses open source technology and includes components such as an API store, data analytics, and a cloud computing environment.[55][56] BNY Mellon plans to include third parties on the NEXEN platform via an app store.[54][57]
Controversy[edit]
In March 2015, the company admitted to facts concerning the misrepresentation of foreign exchange pricing and execution. BNY Mellon's alleged misconduct in this area includes representing pricing as best rates to its clients, when in fact they were providing clients with bad prices while retaining larger margins. In addition to letting go key executives, the company will pay a total of US$714 million to settle related lawsuits.[58]

Investment Services[edit]

BNY Mellon's subsidiary Pershing LLC handles securities services, including execution, settlement, and clearing. It also provides back office support to financial advisors.[71][72]
In 2014, the company formed a new Markets Group, which offers collateral management, securities finance, foreign exchange and capital markets.[45] The group is now known as BNY Mellon Markets.[46]
Investment Management[edit]
BNY Mellon's Investment Management business generates 28 percent of the company's revenue[70] and had US$1.7 trillion (Q4 2016) in assets under management.[73][74][3]
The Investment Management business operates 13 asset management boutiques and is the largest multi-boutique investment manager in the world.[67][75] These asset management companies include Alcentra,[76] BNY Mellon ARX, BNY Mellon Cash Investment Strategies, The Boston Company Asset Management, EACM Advisors,[77] Insight Investment, Mellon Capital,[78] Newton Investment Management, Siguler Guff, Standish, Center Square, the Dreyfus Corporation, and Walter Scott.[65][67] Investment strategies offered by the boutique firms include equity, fixed income, cash, and alternative investments.[62]
BNY Mellon's Wealth Management unit handles the private banking, estate planning, family office services, and investment servicing and management of high-net-worth individuals and families.[62][79] As of 2014, it ranks 7th among wealth management businesses in the United States. Starting in 2013, the unit began expansion efforts, including opening eight new banking offices, increasing salespeople, bankers, and portfolio managers on staff, and launching an awareness campaign for wealth management services through television ads.[79]
Leadership[edit]
BNY Mellon is led by Gerald Hassell who has been Chairman and CEO since 2011, after serving as BNY Mellon's president from 2007 to 2012[80] and the president of the Bank of New York Mellon from 1998 until its merger.[81] Karen Peetz is president and has served in the position since 2013.[82] Thomas Gibbons has been CFO since 2008 and also serves as vice chairman.[83] BNY Mellon's Investment Management business is run by CEO Mitchell Harris,[84] and the company's Investment Services business is led by CEO Brian Shea.[85]

Hassell, John M. Hinshaw, Edmund F. "Ted" Kelly, Richard J. Kogan, Michael J. Kowalski, John A. Luke, Jr., Mark Nordenberg, Catherine A. Rein, William C. Richardson, Samuel C. Scott III, and Wesley W. von Schack.[88]
Company culture[edit]
In 2008, BNY Mellon formed a Board of Directors corporate social responsibility committee to set sustainability goals for the company.[86][89] The company's corporate social responsibility activities include philanthropy, social finance in the communities the bank is located in, and protecting financial markets globally.[90]
BNY Mellon's philanthropic activities include financial donations and volunteerism.[91] The company matches employee volunteer hours and donations with financial contributions through its Community Partnership program.[92] Between 2010 and 2012, the company and its employees donated approximately $100 million to charity.[91] In 2014, the company worked with the Forbes Fund to create a platform that connects nonprofit organizations with private businesses to solve social challenges.[93]
The company received a 100 A rating in 2013, 2014 and 2015 by the CDP, which measures corporate greenhouse gas emissions and disclosures.[89][94][95] BNY Mellon was named on the Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index in 2013,[96] 2014 and 2015, and the World Index in 2014,[97] 2015[98] and 2016.[99] Another one of the company's focuses has been building efficiency. As of 2014, the company has saved $48 million due to building efficiency. Five of its buildings have achieved Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED-EB) certification and 23 have interiors that are LEED certified.[89]
BNY Mellon also has business resource groups for employees that are focused on diversity and inclusion.[90][100] In 2009, current president Karen Peetz co-founded the BNY Mellon Women’s Initiative Network (WIN), a resource group for female employees' professional development. As of 2013, WIN has 50 chapters.[101] Other groups include PRISM for LGBT employees, IMPACT, which serves multicultural employees and HEART for employees with disabilities.[100] BNY Mellon also has services for returning military, including a tool to help veterans align military skills and training with jobs at the company.[102] In 2014, BNY Mellon was recognized for its diversity practices by the National Business Inclusion Consortium, which named it Financial Services Diversity Corporation of the Year.[103]

History[edit]
Bank of New York[edit]




The Walton Mansion housed the Bank of New York from 1784 to 1787.






Alexander Hamilton.


The Bank of New York was founded by Alexander Hamilton on June 9, 1784, in the old Walton Mansion in New York City.[8][9] Due to local politics, it wasn't able to procure a charter until 1791.[9] The President of the new bank was former Major General Alexander McDougall[10] and the Cashier was William Seton.[11]
The bank provided the United States government its first loan in 1789. The loan was orchestrated by Hamilton, then Secretary of the Treasury, and it paid the salaries of United States Congress members and President George Washington.[12] The Bank of New York was the first company to be traded on the New York Stock Exchange when it first opened in 1792.[13]
During the 1800s, the bank was known for its conservative lending practices that allowed it to weather financial crises. It was involved in the funding of the Morris and Erie canals, and steamboat companies.[14][15] The bank helped finance both the War of 1812 and the Union Army during the American Civil War.[16][17] Following the Civil War, the bank loaned money to many major infrastructure projects, including utilities, railroads, and the New York City Subway.[14]
Through the early 1900s, the Bank of New York continued to expand and prosper.[15][17] In July 1922, the bank merged with the New York Life Insurance and Trust Company.[18] The bank continued to profit and pay dividends throughout the Great Depression, and its total deposits increased during the decade.[15][17] In 1948, the Bank again merged, this time with the Fifth Avenue Bank, which was followed by a merger in 1966 with the Empire Trust Company.[14][17] The bank's holding company was created in 1969.[14]
In 1988, the Bank of New York merged with Irving Bank Corporation.[19] From 1993 to 1998, the bank made 33 acquisitions, including acquiring JP Morgan’s Global Custody Business in 1995.[17] Ivy Asset Management was acquired in 2000, and the bank acquired Pershing LLC, the United States' second-largest trade clearinghouse, in 2003.[17][20] In 2006, the Bank of New York traded its retail banking and regional middle-market businesses for J.P. Morgan Chase's corporate trust assets. The deal signaled the bank's exit from retail banking.[21]
Mellon Financial[edit]




Andrew W. Mellon


Mellon Financial was founded as T. Mellon & Sons' Bank in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1869 by retired judge Thomas Mellon and his sons Andrew W. Mellon and Richard B. Mellon.[22] The bank invested in and helped found numerous industrial firms in the late 1800s and early 1900s including Alcoa, Westinghouse, Gulf Oil, General Motors and Bethlehem Steel.[23][24] Both Gulf Oil and Alcoa are, according to the financial media, considered to be T. Mellon & Sons' most successful financial investments.[23][24]
In 1902, T. Mellon & Sons' name was changed to the Mellon National Bank.[23] The firm merged with the Union Trust Company, a business founded by Andrew Mellon, in 1946. The newly formed organization resulting from the merger was named the Mellon National Bank and Trust Company, and was Pittsburgh's first US$1 billion bank.[25]
The bank formed the first dedicated family office in the United States in 1971.[26] A reorganization in 1972 led to the bank's name changing to Mellon Bank, N.A. and the formation of a holding company, Mellon National Corporation.[22][23]
Mellon Bank acquired multiple banks and financial institutions in Pennsylvania during the 1980s and 1990s.[27] In 1992, Mellon acquired 54 branch offices of Philadelphia Savings Fund Society, the first savings bank in the United States, founded in 1819.[28]
In 1993, Mellon acquired The Boston Company from American Express and AFCO Credit Corporation from The Continental Corporation. The following year, Mellon merged with the Dreyfus Corporation, bringing its mutual funds under its umbrella.[23] In 1999, Mellon Bank Corporation became Mellon Financial Corporation. Two years later, it exited the retail banking business by selling its assets and retail bank branches to Citizens Financial Group.[23]
Merger[edit]
On December 4, 2006, the Bank of New York and Mellon Financial Corporation announced they would merge.[29] The merger created the world's largest securities servicing company and one of the largest asset management firms by combining Mellon’s wealth-management business and the Bank of New York’s asset-servicing and short-term-lending specialties.[8][29]
The deal was valued at $16.5 billion and under its terms, the Bank of New York's shareholders received 0.9434 shares in the new company for each share of the Bank of New York that they owned, while Mellon Financial shareholders received 1 share in the new company for each Mellon share they owned.[16] The Bank of New York and Mellon Financial entered into mutual stock option agreements for 19.9 percent of the issuer's outstanding common stock.[29] The merger was finalized on July 1, 2007.[30] The company's principal office of business at the One Wall Street office previously held by the Bank of New York.[31] The full name of the company became The Bank of New York Mellon Corp., with the BNY Mellon brand name being used for most lines of business.[30][31]
Recent history[edit]
In October 2008, the U.S. Treasury named BNY Mellon the master custodian of the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) bailout fund during the financial crisis of 2007 to 2010. BNY Mellon won the assignment, which included handling accounting and record-keeping for the program, through a bidding process.[32] In November 2008, the company announced that it would lay-off 1,800 employees, or 4 percent of its global workforce, due to the financial crisis.[33] According to the results of a February 2009 stress test conducted by federal regulators, BNY Mellon was one of only three banks that could withstand a worsening economic situation.[34] The company received $3 billion from TARP, which it paid back in full in June 2009, along with US$136 million to buy back warrants from the Treasury in August 2009.[35][36]
In August 2009, BNY Mellon purchased Insight Investment, a management business for external funds, from Lloyds Banking Group.[37] The company acquired PNC Financial Services' Global Investment Servicing Inc. in July 2010 and Talon Asset Management's wealth management business in 2011.[38][39]
By 2013, the company's capital had steadily risen from the financial crisis. In the results of the Federal Reserve's Dodd-Frank stress test in 2013, the bank was least affected by hypothetical extreme economic scenarios among banks tested.[40] It was also a top performer on the same test in 2014.[41]
BNY Mellon began a major branding campaign in 2013 to increase awareness of the company.[42] It adopted the slogan "The Investments Company for the World" and changed its logo.[42][43]
In May 2014, BNY Mellon agreed to sell the building housing its headquarters to increase efficiency. The company announced plans to move its headquarters to lower Manhattan in 2015, leasing space at Brookfield Place.[44] In June 2014, the company combined its global markets, global collateral services and prime services to create the new Markets Group,[45] also known as BNY Markets Mellon.[46] The company expanded its Hong Kong office in October 2014 as part of the company's plans to grow its wealth management business.[47] It opened the BNY Mellon Innovation Center, an office focused on emerging technologies, big data, digital and cloud-based projects, in Palo Alto in November 2014.[48][49]
Between 2014 and 2016, BNY Mellon opened innovation centers focused on emerging technologies, big data, digital and cloud-based projects in Silicon Valley, Jersey City, London, Pune, Chennai, Pittsburgh, Singapore, and Central New York.[48][49][50][51][52]
Since 2013, BNY Mellon has been building NEXEN, its next-generation technology platform.[53][54] NEXEN uses open source technology and includes components such as an API store, data analytics, and a cloud computing environment.[55][56] BNY Mellon plans to include third parties on the NEXEN platform via an app store.[54][57]
Controversy[edit]
In March 2015, the company admitted to facts concerning the misrepresentation of foreign exchange pricing and execution. BNY Mellon's alleged misconduct in this area includes representing pricing as best rates to its clients, when in fact they were providing clients with bad prices while retaining larger margins. In addition to letting go key executives, the company will pay a total of US$714 million to settle related lawsuits.[58]

History[edit]
Bank of New York[edit]




The Walton Mansion housed the Bank of New York from 1784 to 1787.






Alexander Hamilton.


The Bank of New York was founded by Alexander Hamilton on June 9, 1784, in the old Walton Mansion in New York City.[8][9] Due to local politics, it wasn't able to procure a charter until 1791.[9] The President of the new bank was former Major General Alexander McDougall[10] and the Cashier was William Seton.[11]
The bank provided the United States government its first loan in 1789. The loan was orchestrated by Hamilton, then Secretary of the Treasury, and it paid the salaries of United States Congress members and President George Washington.[12] The Bank of New York was the first company to be traded on the New York Stock Exchange when it first opened in 1792.[13]
During the 1800s, the bank was known for its conservative lending practices that allowed it to weather financial crises. It was involved in the funding of the Morris and Erie canals, and steamboat companies.[14][15] The bank helped finance both the War of 1812 and the Union Army during the American Civil War.[16][17] Following the Civil War, the bank loaned money to many major infrastructure projects, including utilities, railroads, and the New York City Subway.[14]
Through the early 1900s, the Bank of New York continued to expand and prosper.[15][17] In July 1922, the bank merged with the New York Life Insurance and Trust Company.[18] The bank continued to profit and pay dividends throughout the Great Depression, and its total deposits increased during the decade.[15][17] In 1948, the Bank again merged, this time with the Fifth Avenue Bank, which was followed by a merger in 1966 with the Empire Trust Company.[14][17] The bank's holding company was created in 1969.[14]
In 1988, the Bank of New York merged with Irving Bank Corporation.[19] From 1993 to 1998, the bank made 33 acquisitions, including acquiring JP Morgan’s Global Custody Business in 1995.[17] Ivy Asset Management was acquired in 2000, and the bank acquired Pershing LLC, the United States' second-largest trade clearinghouse, in 2003.[17][20] In 2006, the Bank of New York traded its retail banking and regional middle-market businesses for J.P. Morgan Chase's corporate trust assets. The deal signaled the bank's exit from retail banking.[21]
Mellon Financial[edit]




Andrew W. Mellon


Mellon Financial was founded as T. Mellon & Sons' Bank in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1869 by retired judge Thomas Mellon and his sons Andrew W. Mellon and Richard B. Mellon.[22] The bank invested in and helped found numerous industrial firms in the late 1800s and early 1900s including Alcoa, Westinghouse, Gulf Oil, General Motors and Bethlehem Steel.[23][24] Both Gulf Oil and Alcoa are, according to the financial media, considered to be T. Mellon & Sons' most successful financial investments.[23][24]
In 1902, T. Mellon & Sons' name was changed to the Mellon National Bank.[23] The firm merged with the Union Trust Company, a business founded by Andrew Mellon, in 1946. The newly formed organization resulting from the merger was named the Mellon National Bank and Trust Company, and was Pittsburgh's first US$1 billion bank.[25]
The bank formed the first dedicated family office in the United States in 1971.[26] A reorganization in 1972 led to the bank's name changing to Mellon Bank, N.A. and the formation of a holding company, Mellon National Corporation.[22][23]
Mellon Bank acquired multiple banks and financial institutions in Pennsylvania during the 1980s and 1990s.[27] In 1992, Mellon acquired 54 branch offices of Philadelphia Savings Fund Society, the first savings bank in the United States, founded in 1819.[28]
In 1993, Mellon acquired The Boston Company from American Express and AFCO Credit Corporation from The Continental Corporation. The following year, Mellon merged with the Dreyfus Corporation, bringing its mutual funds under its umbrella.[23] In 1999, Mellon Bank Corporation became Mellon Financial Corporation. Two years later, it exited the retail banking business by selling its assets and retail bank branches to Citizens Financial Group.[23]
Merger[edit]
On December 4, 2006, the Bank of New York and Mellon Financial Corporation announced they would merge.[29] The merger created the world's largest securities servicing company and one of the largest asset management firms by combining Mellon’s wealth-management business and the Bank of New York’s asset-servicing and short-term-lending specialties.[8][29]
The deal was valued at $16.5 billion and under its terms, the Bank of New York's shareholders received 0.9434 shares in the new company for each share of the Bank of New York that they owned, while Mellon Financial shareholders received 1 share in the new company for each Mellon share they owned.[16] The Bank of New York and Mellon Financial entered into mutual stock option agreements for 19.9 percent of the issuer's outstanding common stock.[29] The merger was finalized on July 1, 2007.[30] The company's principal office of business at the One Wall Street office previously held by the Bank of New York.[31] The full name of the company became The Bank of New York Mellon Corp., with the BNY Mellon brand name being used for most lines of business.[30][31]
Recent history[edit]
In October 2008, the U.S. Treasury named BNY Mellon the master custodian of the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) bailout fund during the financial crisis of 2007 to 2010. BNY Mellon won the assignment, which included handling accounting and record-keeping for the program, through a bidding process.[32] In November 2008, the company announced that it would lay-off 1,800 employees, or 4 percent of its global workforce, due to the financial crisis.[33] According to the results of a February 2009 stress test conducted by federal regulators, BNY Mellon was one of only three banks that could withstand a worsening economic situation.[34] The company received $3 billion from TARP, which it paid back in full in June 2009, along with US$136 million to buy back warrants from the Treasury in August 2009.[35][36]
In August 2009, BNY Mellon purchased Insight Investment, a management business for external funds, from Lloyds Banking Group.[37] The company acquired PNC Financial Services' Global Investment Servicing Inc. in July 2010 and Talon Asset Management's wealth management business in 2011.[38][39]
By 2013, the company's capital had steadily risen from the financial crisis. In the results of the Federal Reserve's Dodd-Frank stress test in 2013, the bank was least affected by hypothetical extreme economic scenarios among banks tested.[40] It was also a top performer on the same test in 2014.[41]
BNY Mellon began a major branding campaign in 2013 to increase awareness of the company.[42] It adopted the slogan "The Investments Company for the World" and changed its logo.[42][43]
In May 2014, BNY Mellon agreed to sell the building housing its headquarters to increase efficiency. The company announced plans to move its headquarters to lower Manhattan in 2015, leasing space at Brookfield Place.[44] In June 2014, the company combined its global markets, global collateral services and prime services to create the new Markets Group,[45] also known as BNY Markets Mellon.[46] The company expanded its Hong Kong office in October 2014 as part of the company's plans to grow its wealth management business.[47] It opened the BNY Mellon Innovation Center, an office focused on emerging technologies, big data, digital and cloud-based projects, in Palo Alto in November 2014.[48][49]
Between 2014 and 2016, BNY Mellon opened innovation centers focused on emerging technologies, big data, digital and cloud-based projects in Silicon Valley, Jersey City, London, Pune, Chennai, Pittsburgh, Singapore, and Central New York.[48][49][50][51][52]
Since 2013, BNY Mellon has been building NEXEN, its next-generation technology platform.[53][54] NEXEN uses open source technology and includes components such as an API store, data analytics, and a cloud computing environment.[55][56] BNY Mellon plans to include third parties on the NEXEN platform via an app store.[54][57]
Controversy[edit]
In March 2015, the company admitted to facts concerning the misrepresentation of foreign exchange pricing and execution. BNY Mellon's alleged misconduct in this area includes representing pricing as best rates to its clients, when in fact they were providing clients with bad prices while retaining larger margins. In addition to letting go key executives, the company will pay a total of US$714 million to settle related lawsuits.[58]

In 2009, the company began an innovation program for employees to suggest ideas for large-scale projects and company improvement.

History[edit]
Bank of New York[edit]




The Walton Mansion housed the Bank of New York from 1784 to 1787.






Alexander Hamilton.


The Bank of New York was founded by Alexander Hamilton on June 9, 1784, in the old Walton Mansion in New York City.[8][9] Due to local politics, it wasn't able to procure a charter until 1791.[9] The President of the new bank was former Major General Alexander McDougall[10] and the Cashier was William Seton.[11]
The bank provided the United States government its first loan in 1789. The loan was orchestrated by Hamilton, then Secretary of the Treasury, and it paid the salaries of United States Congress members and President George Washington.[12] The Bank of New York was the first company to be traded on the New York Stock Exchange when it first opened in 1792.[13]
During the 1800s, the bank was known for its conservative lending practices that allowed it to weather financial crises. It was involved in the funding of the Morris and Erie canals, and steamboat companies.[14][15] The bank helped finance both the War of 1812 and the Union Army during the American Civil War.[16][17] Following the Civil War, the bank loaned money to many major infrastructure projects, including utilities, railroads, and the New York City Subway.[14]
Through the early 1900s, the Bank of New York continued to expand and prosper.[15][17] In July 1922, the bank merged with the New York Life Insurance and Trust Company.[18] The bank continued to profit and pay dividends throughout the Great Depression, and its total deposits increased during the decade.[15][17] In 1948, the Bank again merged, this time with the Fifth Avenue Bank, which was followed by a merger in 1966 with the Empire Trust Company.[14][17] The bank's holding company was created in 1969.[14]
In 1988, the Bank of New York merged with Irving Bank Corporation.[19] From 1993 to 1998, the bank made 33 acquisitions, including acquiring JP Morgan’s Global Custody Business in 1995.[17] Ivy Asset Management was acquired in 2000, and the bank acquired Pershing LLC, the United States' second-largest trade clearinghouse, in 2003.[17][20] In 2006, the Bank of New York traded its retail banking and regional middle-market businesses for J.P. Morgan Chase's corporate trust assets. The deal signaled the bank's exit from retail banking.[21]
Mellon Financial[edit]




Andrew W. Mellon


Mellon Financial was founded as T. Mellon & Sons' Bank in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1869 by retired judge Thomas Mellon and his sons Andrew W. Mellon and Richard B. Mellon.[22] The bank invested in and helped found numerous industrial firms in the late 1800s and early 1900s including Alcoa, Westinghouse, Gulf Oil, General Motors and Bethlehem Steel.[23][24] Both Gulf Oil and Alcoa are, according to the financial media, considered to be T. Mellon & Sons' most successful financial investments.[23][24]
In 1902, T. Mellon & Sons' name was changed to the Mellon National Bank.[23] The firm merged with the Union Trust Company, a business founded by Andrew Mellon, in 1946. The newly formed organization resulting from the merger was named the Mellon National Bank and Trust Company, and was Pittsburgh's first US$1 billion bank.[25]
The bank formed the first dedicated family office in the United States in 1971.[26] A reorganization in 1972 led to the bank's name changing to Mellon Bank, N.A. and the formation of a holding company, Mellon National Corporation.[22][23]
Mellon Bank acquired multiple banks and financial institutions in Pennsylvania during the 1980s and 1990s.[27] In 1992, Mellon acquired 54 branch offices of Philadelphia Savings Fund Society, the first savings bank in the United States, founded in 1819.[28]
In 1993, Mellon acquired The Boston Company from American Express and AFCO Credit Corporation from The Continental Corporation. The following year, Mellon merged with the Dreyfus Corporation, bringing its mutual funds under its umbrella.[23] In 1999, Mellon Bank Corporation became Mellon Financial Corporation. Two years later, it exited the retail banking business by selling its assets and retail bank branches to Citizens Financial Group.[23]
Merger[edit]
On December 4, 2006, the Bank of New York and Mellon Financial Corporation announced they would merge.[29] The merger created the world's largest securities servicing company and one of the largest asset management firms by combining Mellon’s wealth-management business and the Bank of New York’s asset-servicing and short-term-lending specialties.[8][29]
The deal was valued at $16.5 billion and under its terms, the Bank of New York's shareholders received 0.9434 shares in the new company for each share of the Bank of New York that they owned, while Mellon Financial shareholders received 1 share in the new company for each Mellon share they owned.[16] The Bank of New York and Mellon Financial entered into mutual stock option agreements for 19.9 percent of the issuer's outstanding common stock.[29] The merger was finalized on July 1, 2007.[30] The company's principal office of business at the One Wall Street office previously held by the Bank of New York.[31] The full name of the company became The Bank of New York Mellon Corp., with the BNY Mellon brand name being used for most lines of business.[30][31]
Recent history[edit]
In October 2008, the U.S. Treasury named BNY Mellon the master custodian of the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) bailout fund during the financial crisis of 2007 to 2010. BNY Mellon won the assignment, which included handling accounting and record-keeping for the program, through a bidding process.[32] In November 2008, the company announced that it would lay-off 1,800 employees, or 4 percent of its global workforce, due to the financial crisis.[33] According to the results of a February 2009 stress test conducted by federal regulators, BNY Mellon was one of only three banks that could withstand a worsening economic situation.[34] The company received $3 billion from TARP, which it paid back in full in June 2009, along with US$136 million to buy back warrants from the Treasury in August 2009.[35][36]
In August 2009, BNY Mellon purchased Insight Investment, a management business for external funds, from Lloyds Banking Group.[37] The company acquired PNC Financial Services' Global Investment Servicing Inc. in July 2010 and Talon Asset Management's wealth management business in 2011.[38][39]
By 2013, the company's capital had steadily risen from the financial crisis. In the results of the Federal Reserve's Dodd-Frank stress test in 2013, the bank was least affected by hypothetical extreme economic scenarios among banks tested.[40] It was also a top performer on the same test in 2014.[41]
BNY Mellon began a major branding campaign in 2013 to increase awareness of the company.[42] It adopted the slogan "The Investments Company for the World" and changed its logo.[42][43]
In May 2014, BNY Mellon agreed to sell the building housing its headquarters to increase efficiency. The company announced plans to move its headquarters to lower Manhattan in 2015, leasing space at Brookfield Place.[44] In June 2014, the company combined its global markets, global collateral services and prime services to create the new Markets Group,[45] also known as BNY Markets Mellon.[46] The company expanded its Hong Kong office in October 2014 as part of the company's plans to grow its wealth management business.[47] It opened the BNY Mellon Innovation Center, an office focused on emerging technologies, big data, digital and cloud-based projects, in Palo Alto in November 2014.[48][49]
Between 2014 and 2016, BNY Mellon opened innovation centers focused on emerging technologies, big data, digital and cloud-based projects in Silicon Valley, Jersey City, London, Pune, Chennai, Pittsburgh, Singapore, and Central New York.[48][49][50][51][52]
Since 2013, BNY Mellon has been building NEXEN, its next-generation technology platform.[53][54] NEXEN uses open source technology and includes components such as an API store, data analytics, and a cloud computing environment.[55][56] BNY Mellon plans to include third parties on the NEXEN platform via an app store.[54][57]
Controversy[edit]
In March 2015, the company admitted to facts concerning the misrepresentation of foreign exchange pricing and execution. BNY Mellon's alleged misconduct in this area includes representing pricing as best rates to its clients, when in fact they were providing clients with bad prices while retaining larger margins. In addition to letting go key executives, the company will pay a total of US$714 million to settle related lawsuits.[58]

History[edit]
Bank of New York[edit]




The Walton Mansion housed the Bank of New York from 1784 to 1787.






Alexander Hamilton.


The Bank of New York was founded by Alexander Hamilton on June 9, 1784, in the old Walton Mansion in New York City.[8][9] Due to local politics, it wasn't able to procure a charter until 1791.[9] The President of the new bank was former Major General Alexander McDougall[10] and the Cashier was William Seton.[11]
The bank provided the United States government its first loan in 1789. The loan was orchestrated by Hamilton, then Secretary of the Treasury, and it paid the salaries of United States Congress members and President George Washington.[12] The Bank of New York was the first company to be traded on the New York Stock Exchange when it first opened in 1792.[13]
During the 1800s, the bank was known for its conservative lending practices that allowed it to weather financial crises. It was involved in the funding of the Morris and Erie canals, and steamboat companies.[14][15] The bank helped finance both the War of 1812 and the Union Army during the American Civil War.[16][17] Following the Civil War, the bank loaned money to many major infrastructure projects, including utilities, railroads, and the New York City Subway.[14]
Through the early 1900s, the Bank of New York continued to expand and prosper.[15][17] In July 1922, the bank merged with the New York Life Insurance and Trust Company.[18] The bank continued to profit and pay dividends throughout the Great Depression, and its total deposits increased during the decade.[15][17] In 1948, the Bank again merged, this time with the Fifth Avenue Bank, which was followed by a merger in 1966 with the Empire Trust Company.[14][17] The bank's holding company was created in 1969.[14]
In 1988, the Bank of New York merged with Irving Bank Corporation.[19] From 1993 to 1998, the bank made 33 acquisitions, including acquiring JP Morgan’s Global Custody Business in 1995.[17] Ivy Asset Management was acquired in 2000, and the bank acquired Pershing LLC, the United States' second-largest trade clearinghouse, in 2003.[17][20] In 2006, the Bank of New York traded its retail banking and regional middle-market businesses for J.P. Morgan Chase's corporate trust assets. The deal signaled the bank's exit from retail banking.[21]
Mellon Financial[edit]




Andrew W. Mellon


Mellon Financial was founded as T. Mellon & Sons' Bank in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1869 by retired judge Thomas Mellon and his sons Andrew W. Mellon and Richard B. Mellon.[22] The bank invested in and helped found numerous industrial firms in the late 1800s and early 1900s including Alcoa, Westinghouse, Gulf Oil, General Motors and Bethlehem Steel.[23][24] Both Gulf Oil and Alcoa are, according to the financial media, considered to be T. Mellon & Sons' most successful financial investments.[23][24]
In 1902, T. Mellon & Sons' name was changed to the Mellon National Bank.[23] The firm merged with the Union Trust Company, a business founded by Andrew Mellon, in 1946. The newly formed organization resulting from the merger was named the Mellon National Bank and Trust Company, and was Pittsburgh's first US$1 billion bank.[25]
The bank formed the first dedicated family office in the United States in 1971.[26] A reorganization in 1972 led to the bank's name changing to Mellon Bank, N.A. and the formation of a holding company, Mellon National Corporation.[22][23]
Mellon Bank acquired multiple banks and financial institutions in Pennsylvania during the 1980s and 1990s.[27] In 1992, Mellon acquired 54 branch offices of Philadelphia Savings Fund Society, the first savings bank in the United States, founded in 1819.[28]
In 1993, Mellon acquired The Boston Company from American Express and AFCO Credit Corporation from The Continental Corporation. The following year, Mellon merged with the Dreyfus Corporation, bringing its mutual funds under its umbrella.[23] In 1999, Mellon Bank Corporation became Mellon Financial Corporation. Two years later, it exited the retail banking business by selling its assets and retail bank branches to Citizens Financial Group.[23]
Merger[edit]
On December 4, 2006, the Bank of New York and Mellon Financial Corporation announced they would merge.[29] The merger created the world's largest securities servicing company and one of the largest asset management firms by combining Mellon’s wealth-management business and the Bank of New York’s asset-servicing and short-term-lending specialties.[8][29]
The deal was valued at $16.5 billion and under its terms, the Bank of New York's shareholders received 0.9434 shares in the new company for each share of the Bank of New York that they owned, while Mellon Financial shareholders received 1 share in the new company for each Mellon share they owned.[16] The Bank of New York and Mellon Financial entered into mutual stock option agreements for 19.9 percent of the issuer's outstanding common stock.[29] The merger was finalized on July 1, 2007.[30] The company's principal office of business at the One Wall Street office previously held by the Bank of New York.[31] The full name of the company became The Bank of New York Mellon Corp., with the BNY Mellon brand name being used for most lines of business.[30][31]
Recent history[edit]
In October 2008, the U.S. Treasury named BNY Mellon the master custodian of the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) bailout fund during the financial crisis of 2007 to 2010. BNY Mellon won the assignment, which included handling accounting and record-keeping for the program, through a bidding process.[32] In November 2008, the company announced that it would lay-off 1,800 employees, or 4 percent of its global workforce, due to the financial crisis.[33] According to the results of a February 2009 stress test conducted by federal regulators, BNY Mellon was one of only three banks that could withstand a worsening economic situation.[34] The company received $3 billion from TARP, which it paid back in full in June 2009, along with US$136 million to buy back warrants from the Treasury in August 2009.[35][36]
In August 2009, BNY Mellon purchased Insight Investment, a management business for external funds, from Lloyds Banking Group.[37] The company acquired PNC Financial Services' Global Investment Servicing Inc. in July 2010 and Talon Asset Management's wealth management business in 2011.[38][39]
By 2013, the company's capital had steadily risen from the financial crisis. In the results of the Federal Reserve's Dodd-Frank stress test in 2013, the bank was least affected by hypothetical extreme economic scenarios among banks tested.[40] It was also a top performer on the same test in 2014.[41]
BNY Mellon began a major branding campaign in 2013 to increase awareness of the company.[42] It adopted the slogan "The Investments Company for the World" and changed its logo.[42][43]
In May 2014, BNY Mellon agreed to sell the building housing its headquarters to increase efficiency. The company announced plans to move its headquarters to lower Manhattan in 2015, leasing space at Brookfield Place.[44] In June 2014, the company combined its global markets, global collateral services and prime services to create the new Markets Group,[45] also known as BNY Markets Mellon.[46] The company expanded its Hong Kong office in October 2014 as part of the company's plans to grow its wealth management business.[47] It opened the BNY Mellon Innovation Center, an office focused on emerging technologies, big data, digital and cloud-based projects, in Palo Alto in November 2014.[48][49]
Between 2014 and 2016, BNY Mellon opened innovation centers focused on emerging technologies, big data, digital and cloud-based projects in Silicon Valley, Jersey City, London, Pune, Chennai, Pittsburgh, Singapore, and Central New York.[48][49][50][51][52]
Since 2013, BNY Mellon has been building NEXEN, its next-generation technology platform.[53][54] NEXEN uses open source technology and includes components such as an API store, data analytics, and a cloud computing environment.[55][56] BNY Mellon plans to include third parties on the NEXEN platform via an app store.[54][57]
Controversy[edit]
In March 2015, the company admitted to facts concerning the misrepresentation of foreign exchange pricing and execution. BNY Mellon's alleged misconduct in this area includes representing pricing as best rates to its clients, when in fact they were providing clients with bad prices while retaining larger margins. In addition to letting go key executives, the company will pay a total of US$714 million to settle related lawsuits.[58]

History[edit]
Bank of New York[edit]




The Walton Mansion housed the Bank of New York from 1784 to 1787.






Alexander Hamilton.


The Bank of New York was founded by Alexander Hamilton on June 9, 1784, in the old Walton Mansion in New York City.[8][9] Due to local politics, it wasn't able to procure a charter until 1791.[9] The President of the new bank was former Major General Alexander McDougall[10] and the Cashier was William Seton.[11]
The bank provided the United States government its first loan in 1789. The loan was orchestrated by Hamilton, then Secretary of the Treasury, and it paid the salaries of United States Congress members and President George Washington.[12] The Bank of New York was the first company to be traded on the New York Stock Exchange when it first opened in 1792.[13]
During the 1800s, the bank was known for its conservative lending practices that allowed it to weather financial crises. It was involved in the funding of the Morris and Erie canals, and steamboat companies.[14][15] The bank helped finance both the War of 1812 and the Union Army during the American Civil War.[16][17] Following the Civil War, the bank loaned money to many major infrastructure projects, including utilities, railroads, and the New York City Subway.[14]
Through the early 1900s, the Bank of New York continued to expand and prosper.[15][17] In July 1922, the bank merged with the New York Life Insurance and Trust Company.[18] The bank continued to profit and pay dividends throughout the Great Depression, and its total deposits increased during the decade.[15][17] In 1948, the Bank again merged, this time with the Fifth Avenue Bank, which was followed by a merger in 1966 with the Empire Trust Company.[14][17] The bank's holding company was created in 1969.[14]
In 1988, the Bank of New York merged with Irving Bank Corporation.[19] From 1993 to 1998, the bank made 33 acquisitions, including acquiring JP Morgan’s Global Custody Business in 1995.[17] Ivy Asset Management was acquired in 2000, and the bank acquired Pershing LLC, the United States' second-largest trade clearinghouse, in 2003.[17][20] In 2006, the Bank of New York traded its retail banking and regional middle-market businesses for J.P. Morgan Chase's corporate trust assets. The deal signaled the bank's exit from retail banking.[21]
Mellon Financial[edit]




Andrew W. Mellon


Mellon Financial was founded as T. Mellon & Sons' Bank in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1869 by retired judge Thomas Mellon and his sons Andrew W. Mellon and Richard B. Mellon.[22] The bank invested in and helped found numerous industrial firms in the late 1800s and early 1900s including Alcoa, Westinghouse, Gulf Oil, General Motors and Bethlehem Steel.[23][24] Both Gulf Oil and Alcoa are, according to the financial media, considered to be T. Mellon & Sons' most successful financial investments.[23][24]
In 1902, T. Mellon & Sons' name was changed to the Mellon National Bank.[23] The firm merged with the Union Trust Company, a business founded by Andrew Mellon, in 1946. The newly formed organization resulting from the merger was named the Mellon National Bank and Trust Company, and was Pittsburgh's first US$1 billion bank.[25]
The bank formed the first dedicated family office in the United States in 1971.[26] A reorganization in 1972 led to the bank's name changing to Mellon Bank, N.A. and the formation of a holding company, Mellon National Corporation.[22][23]
Mellon Bank acquired multiple banks and financial institutions in Pennsylvania during the 1980s and 1990s.[27] In 1992, Mellon acquired 54 branch offices of Philadelphia Savings Fund Society, the first savings bank in the United States, founded in 1819.[28]
In 1993, Mellon acquired The Boston Company from American Express and AFCO Credit Corporation from The Continental Corporation. The following year, Mellon merged with the Dreyfus Corporation, bringing its mutual funds under its umbrella.[23] In 1999, Mellon Bank Corporation became Mellon Financial Corporation. Two years later, it exited the retail banking business by selling its assets and retail bank branches to Citizens Financial Group.[23]
Merger[edit]
On December 4, 2006, the Bank of New York and Mellon Financial Corporation announced they would merge.[29] The merger created the world's largest securities servicing company and one of the largest asset management firms by combining Mellon’s wealth-management business and the Bank of New York’s asset-servicing and short-term-lending specialties.[8][29]
The deal was valued at $16.5 billion and under its terms, the Bank of New York's shareholders received 0.9434 shares in the new company for each share of the Bank of New York that they owned, while Mellon Financial shareholders received 1 share in the new company for each Mellon share they owned.[16] The Bank of New York and Mellon Financial entered into mutual stock option agreements for 19.9 percent of the issuer's outstanding common stock.[29] The merger was finalized on July 1, 2007.[30] The company's principal office of business at the One Wall Street office previously held by the Bank of New York.[31] The full name of the company became The Bank of New York Mellon Corp., with the BNY Mellon brand name being used for most lines of business.[30][31]
Recent history[edit]
In October 2008, the U.S. Treasury named BNY Mellon the master custodian of the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) bailout fund during the financial crisis of 2007 to 2010. BNY Mellon won the assignment, which included handling accounting and record-keeping for the program, through a bidding process.[32] In November 2008, the company announced that it would lay-off 1,800 employees, or 4 percent of its global workforce, due to the financial crisis.[33] According to the results of a February 2009 stress test conducted by federal regulators, BNY Mellon was one of only three banks that could withstand a worsening economic situation.[34] The company received $3 billion from TARP, which it paid back in full in June 2009, along with US$136 million to buy back warrants from the Treasury in August 2009.[35][36]
In August 2009, BNY Mellon purchased Insight Investment, a management business for external funds, from Lloyds Banking Group.[37] The company acquired PNC Financial Services' Global Investment Servicing Inc. in July 2010 and Talon Asset Management's wealth management business in 2011.[38][39]
By 2013, the company's capital had steadily risen from the financial crisis. In the results of the Federal Reserve's Dodd-Frank stress test in 2013, the bank was least affected by hypothetical extreme economic scenarios among banks tested.[40] It was also a top performer on the same test in 2014.[41]
BNY Mellon began a major branding campaign in 2013 to increase awareness of the company.[42] It adopted the slogan "The Investments Company for the World" and changed its logo.[42][43]
In May 2014, BNY Mellon agreed to sell the building housing its headquarters to increase efficiency. The company announced plans to move its headquarters to lower Manhattan in 2015, leasing space at Brookfield Place.[44] In June 2014, the company combined its global markets, global collateral services and prime services to create the new Markets Group,[45] also known as BNY Markets Mellon.[46] The company expanded its Hong Kong office in October 2014 as part of the company's plans to grow its wealth management business.[47] It opened the BNY Mellon Innovation Center, an office focused on emerging technologies, big data, digital and cloud-based projects, in Palo Alto in November 2014.[48][49]
Between 2014 and 2016, BNY Mellon opened innovation centers focused on emerging technologies, big data, digital and cloud-based projects in Silicon Valley, Jersey City, London, Pune, Chennai, Pittsburgh, Singapore, and Central New York.[48][49][50][51][52]
Since 2013, BNY Mellon has been building NEXEN, its next-generation technology platform.[53][54] NEXEN uses open source technology and includes components such as an API store, data analytics, and a cloud computing environment.[55][56] BNY Mellon plans to include third parties on the NEXEN platform via an app store.[54][57]
Controversy[edit]
In March 2015, the company admitted to facts concerning the misrepresentation of foreign exchange pricing and execution. BNY Mellon's alleged misconduct in this area includes representing pricing as best rates to its clients, when in fact they were providing clients with bad prices while retaining larger margins. In addition to letting go key executives, the company will pay a total of US$714 million to settle related lawsuits.[58]

Starting in 2013, the unit began expansion efforts, including opening eight new banking offices, increasing salespeople, bankers, and portfolio managers on staff, and launching an awareness campaign for wealth management services through television ads.[79]
Leadership[edit]
BNY Mellon is led by Gerald Hassell who has been Chairman and CEO since 2011, after serving as BNY Mellon's president from 2007 to 2012[80] and the president of the Bank of New York Mellon from 1998 until its merger.[81] Karen Peetz is president and has served in the position since 2013.[82] Thomas Gibbons has been CFO since 2008 and also serves as vice chairman.[83] BNY Mellon's Investment Management business is run by CEO Mitchell Harris,[84] and the company's Investment Services business is led by CEO Brian Shea.[85]

In 2008, BNY Mellon formed a Board of Directors corporate social responsibility committee to set sustainability goals for the company.[86][89] The company's corporate social responsibility activities include philanthropy, social finance in the communities the bank is located in, and protecting financial markets globally.[90]
BNY Mellon's philanthropic activities include financial donations and volunteerism.[91] The company matches employee volunteer hours and donations with financial contributions through its Community Partnership program.[92] Between 2010 and 2012, the company and its employees donated approximately $100 million to charity.[91] In 2014, the company worked with the Forbes Fund to create a platform that connects nonprofit organizations with private businesses to solve social challenges.[93]
The company received a 100 A rating in 2013, 2014 and 2015 by the CDP, which measures corporate greenhouse gas emissions and disclosures.[89][94][95] BNY Mellon was named on the Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index in 2013,[96] 2014 and 2015, and the World Index in 2014,[97] 2015[98] and 2016.[99] Another one of the company's focuses has been building efficiency. As of 2014, the company has saved $48 million due to building efficiency. Five of its buildings have achieved Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED-EB) certification and 23 have interiors that are LEED certified.[89]
BNY Mellon also has business resource groups for employees that are focused on diversity and inclusion.[90][100] In 2009, current president Karen Peetz co-founded the BNY Mellon Women’s Initiative Network (WIN), a resource group for female employees' professional development. As of 2013, WIN has 50 chapters.[101] Other groups include PRISM for LGBT employees, IMPACT, which serves multicultural employees and HEART for employees with disabilities.[100] BNY Mellon also has services for returning military, including a tool to help veterans align military skills and training with jobs at the company.[102] In 2014, BNY Mellon was recognized for its diversity practices by the National Business Inclusion Consortium, which named it Financial Services Diversity Corporation of the Year.[103]
In 2009, the company began an innovation program for employees to suggest ideas for large-scale projects and company improvement.
