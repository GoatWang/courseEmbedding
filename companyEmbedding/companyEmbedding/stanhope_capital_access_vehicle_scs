At Stanhope, partners and founding families invest alongside clients.
All clients can expect the same high levels of service.
Access to the same managers is also assured across our clients, with capacity being shared pro-rata between them.

About us




 




































 


 
Stanhope Capital is a global investment office overseeing over $9.5 billion on behalf of wealthy families, charities and other institutions around the world. The firm was founded in 2004 by Daniel Pinto and Julien Sevaux, and has since grown to consist of over 75 staff including 14 partners operating from offices in London, Geneva and Jersey. Stanhope’s Advisory Board is chaired by Lord Browne of Madingley, formerly Group Chief Executive of BP.
The Stanhope Difference
Stanhope is neither a bank, nor just a family office. Instead, we bring together the best of both worlds: the high service standards and transparency expected of a private family office, combined with the quality of investment expertise and operational excellence typically associated with a major global financial institution.
Our clients
Stanhope originated as a manager of discretionary investment portfolios with the support of a number of prominent UK and European families who were seeking to entrust their assets to a firm closely aligned with their own interests. In addition to private clients, we also advise charities on their endowments and internal pension funds, and oversee investments for institutions in the areas of higher education and healthcare, as well as religious bodies and livery companies.
Our principles
We believe that being independently owned is vital to being able to serve clients without conflict of interest. The client’s requirements are paramount. Portfolios are customised for each individual client and implemented within a genuine open architecture framework with a clear focus on selecting the best externally managed funds for our clients in all asset classes. We do not retain commissions on any third party products. We are therefore objective and unbiased in the services we provide our clients.
We believe in aligning our interests with those of our clients which means that partners invest alongside clients. All our clients receive the same high level of service and access to fund managers. As an owner-managed firm, we believe we are better placed to attract and retain the best investment talent as well as to take a long-term view of the needs of our clients.
Our Team
Our senior team comprises seasoned investment professionals who have been directly responsible for the management of significant pools of assets within some of the world’s most respected fund management houses. In addition, our Investment Committee draws on the expertise of Lord Lamont (former Chancellor of the Exchequer), Richard Oldfield (chairman of the Oxford University Investment Committee, formerly head of the Rausing family office) and James Ferguson (Founding Partner of The MacroStrategy Partnership LLP).
