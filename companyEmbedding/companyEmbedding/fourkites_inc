We Are FourKites





FourKites was founded in 2014 with a simple idea – build software to modernize information sharing in the $900 Billion (and growing!) logistics industry. A simple idea perhaps. But no small feat to do and do it well.
With a team of 90+ (and growing) inspired professionals, we’re now enabling the exchange of high-quality, real-time data between Shippers, Carriers, and 3rd Party Logistics providers.
And we believe this is just the beginning.  We are firmly committed to building a platform, tools, and applications that help companies gain true visibility into their supply chains. Visibility that can be put into real, meaningful action for the mutual benefit of both the supplier and end customers.
This endeavor, we believe, gives us confidence to say – FourKites is supply chain visibility, redefined.






Visibility + Action = Time to Value
Technology & Partners – Power in the Sum of our Alliances

“Utilizing FourKites’ ability to provide real-time, continuous location tracking, predictive analytics, interactive mapping and other features will allow JDA to continue to deliver unmatched transportation planning and execution capabilities for our customers.”

 -
Fabrizio Brasca – JDA



“With its unprecedented growth and an overwhelming amount of industry recognition, FourKites is leading the movement for supply chain visibility.

There’s great potential to leverage my skills to help FourKites continue growing and reach its goal of enhancing the enterprise supply chain experience.”

Jeff Kanterman – NFI

Your goods are the beating heart of your business. Why not keep an eye on them all the way from A to B?





FourKites works with top-tier shippers across all major industries, helping them make sure their freight gets where it’s going without a hitch. Whether you’re tracking inbound, outbound, or intra-DC, FourKites lets you see all your loads in one place, and our partnerships with more than 60 major GPS providers and over 15 TMS setups means that you’ll be getting the most up-to-date information from your carries in a layout that’s customized to your preexisting setup. And even when things do go wrong — let’s be realistic, it happens —  with FourKites, you’ll know about it as soon as it happens.






Manage your freight by exception to reduce man-hours dedicated to track and trace.
Build carrier KPIs to better manage your carrier network.
Schedule email notifications to let your customers know about activity on their loads as soon as it occurs.
Keep tabs on your loads in the office or on the go with the FourKites mobile management app.

“With its unprecedented growth and an overwhelming amount of industry recognition, FourKites is leading the movement for supply chain visibility. The company has already achieved so much in such a short amount of time and shows no signs of slowing down. There’s great potential to leverage my skills to help FourKites continue growing and reach its goal of enhancing the enterprise supply chain experience.”

 -
Jai Shekhawat, founder and former CEO of Fieldglass



“After carefully evaluating many freight visibility platforms, it became abundantly clear that FourKites provides the most robust capabilities for Ryder’s NaviShare solution.  FourKites has emerged as the leader in real-time freight visibility that will  ultimately help our customers lower costs and improve supply chain efficiencies.”

 -
Gary R. Allen – Ryder



“FourKites has effectively differentiated itself from competitors by moving from ‘dots on a map’ to a fully actionable supply chain visibility solution. FourKites fills the blind spots in freight visibility, and provides orchestration tools that put the company miles ahead of its competition.”

 -
Silpa Paul – Frost & Sullivan



“Freight visibility and true, actionable visibility has long been a priority for us. We chose FourKites because they’ve proven to provide the breadth and depth of capabilities that give us a ‘control tower’ view we need for our customers and our business.”

 -
Jeff Kanterman – NFI



“We are very excited to announce the integration of the FourKites shipment tracking services. The service adds a new option to the existing methods currently available to MercuryGate clients to obtain the reliable status of their shipments down to the SKU level.”

Is BrokerConnect the full version of the FourKites platform?


BrokerConnect takes the elements of the powerful FourKites platform that are most applicable to brokers and delivers them at a standardized per-load price. If you're interested in seeing the full suite of FourKites platform offerings, please contact sales@fourkites.com.





As a broker, how would I use BrokerConnect in my daily workflow?


If you already have a dedicated check call team, they can focus their efforts on contacting drivers only when they are behind schedule. What's more, you can see all of your active and historical loads in a single, visual interface and quickly determine which ones are on-time, which ones are delayed, and which ones are running ahead of schedule. 




How is FourKites BrokerConnect different from other tracking and visibility solutions?


Unlike tracking providers that rely exclusively on cell phone data, FourKites uses GPS-ELD data pulled every 15 minutes to deliver the most accurate ETAs in the industry. FourKites is also the most affordable solution -- the same price no matter how many stops you have.
 Additionally, FourKites is built for mobile, with an app for viewing your own loads, and an app for your drivers. For loads without integrated GPS-ELD access, FourKites enables you to track cell phones using a cell phone's own native GPS, cell tower triangulation, or a combination of the two. Of course, we also offer app-less tracking to make sure that drivers without smartphones are still able to track without a hitch. 





How is per-load pricing different from per-ping pricing?


When you pay per-ping, you get charged every time a driver's cell phone relays location information. On a cross-country trip, that can add up quickly, and your costs can fluctuate significantly. With FourKites, you pay the same amount regardless of the distance or number of stops.
