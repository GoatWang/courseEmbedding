A MEASURED APPROACH TO GROWTH.
THL Credit was formed in 2007 as a credit affiliate of Thomas H. Lee Partners L.P., one of the world’s oldest and most experienced private equity firms.
In April 2010, we took THL Credit, Inc. (NASDAQ: TCRD) public as a separate direct lending fund, structured as a BDC. In January 2011, we raised our first private direct lending fund, THL Credit Greenway Fund LLC (Fund I). Fund I is an investment fund that invested alongside TCRD with $150 million of capital committed by affiliates of a single institutional investor.
In June 2012, we diversified our credit platform by acquiring Chicago-based McDonnell Investment Management, LLC’s Alternative Credit Strategies group, now run as THL Credit Senior Loan Strategies LLC (Tradable Credit). Our Tradable Credit investment strategy includes THL Credit Senior Loan Fund (NYSE: TSLF), a non-diversified, closed-end management investment company.
In October 2013, we raised our second private direct lending fund, THL Credit Greenway Fund II LLC (Fund II) and a related separate account, which closed with $187 million in capital commitments in the aggregate. Fund II is an investment vehicle that also invested alongside TCRD, with capital committed primarily by institutional investors.
Since our inception in 2007, we have grown to $9.5 billion1 of assets under management. In 2015, we continued to expand our direct lending strategy in new fund vehicle formats and our Tradable Credit investment strategy raised 2 new CLOs and SMA assets totaling $1.5 billion.
(1) As of March 31, 2017 and includes AUM of THL Credit Advisors LLC and its consolidated subsidiary, THL Credit Senior Loan Strategies LLC as well as the assets under management of its affiliate, THL Credit, Inc., and its related funds and separate account. 




LEADERSHIP
