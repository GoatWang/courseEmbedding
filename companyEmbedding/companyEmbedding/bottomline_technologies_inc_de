(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Selected Consolidated Financial Data and the financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. The statements contained in this Annual Report that are not purely historical are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act). Without limiting the foregoing, the words may, will, should, could, expects, plans, intends, anticipates, believes, estimates, predicts, potential and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are based on information available to us up to and including the date of this report, and we assume no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including those set forth in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Form 10-K. You should carefully review those factors and also carefully review the risks outlined in other documents that we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  In the management discussion that follows we have highlighted those changes and operating factors that were the primary factors affecting period to period fluctuations. The remainder of the change in period to period fluctuations from that which is specifically discussed is arising from various individually insignificant items.  Overview  We help businesses pay and get paid. We make complex business payments simple, secure and seamless by providing a trusted and easy-to-use set of cloud-based business payment, digital banking, fraud prevention, payment and financial document solutions. We offer hosted or Software as a Service (SaaS) solutions, as well as software designed to run on-site at the customer's location. The majority of our revenues are derived from offerings sold as SaaS-based solutions and paid for on a subscription and transaction basis.  We operate a cloud-based network that facilitates the exchange of electronic payments between businesses and their vendors. We offer hosted and on-premise solutions that banks use to provide payment, cash management and treasury capabilities to their business customers, as well as solutions that banks and credit unions use to facilitate customer acquisition and growth. We offer financial messaging solutions for banks and corporations around the world, via solutions that leverage the SWIFT global messaging network. We also offer legal spend management solutions that help manage and determine the right amount to pay for legal services and claims vendor expenditures for insurance companies and other large corporate consumers of outside legal services. Our corporate customers rely on our solutions to automate their payment and accounts payable  Table of Contents  processes and to streamline and manage the production and retention of electronic documents. Our healthcare customers use our solutions to streamline financial processes, particularly the patient enrollment process. Our document automation solutions are used by organizations to automate paper-intensive processes for the generation of transactional and supply chain documents. We also offer comprehensive cyber fraud and risk management solutions that are designed to non-invasively monitor and analyze user behavior to flag behavioral and data anomalies and other suspicious activity.  Our solutions are designed to complement, leverage and extend our customers' existing information systems, accounting applications and banking relationships so that they can be deployed quickly and efficiently. To help our customers realize the maximum value from our products and meet their specific business requirements, we also provide professional services for installation, training, consulting and product enhancement.  Financial Highlights  For fiscal year 2016, our revenue increased to $343.3 million from $330.9 million in the prior year. This revenue increase was attributable to revenue increases in our Hosted Solutions segment ($12.5 million) and Other segment ($7.8 million), partially offset by revenue decreases in our Digital Banking segment ($6.4 million) and our Payments and Transactional Documents segment ($1.5 million). The revenue increase in our Hosted Solutions segment was primarily due to increased revenue from our Paymode-X solutions and to a lesser extent, increased revenue from our legal spend management and financial messaging solutions. The revenue increase in our Other segment is due to a full year's revenue contribution from Intellinx, which we acquired in January 2015. The revenue decrease in our Digital Banking segment was the result of the intentional de-emphasis of large, highly customized banking projects in lieu of standard product deployments and our cloud-based solutions. The transition of our delivery model in our Digital Banking segment has had the near term impact of delaying revenue recognition but, over the longer term, we believe will result in significantly greater revenue contribution. The revenue decrease in our Payments and Transactional Documents segment occurred as a result of lower North American revenue from our payment and document automation products. Our revenue for fiscal year 2016 was unfavorably impacted by $8.1 million due to the impact of foreign currency exchange rates primarily related to the British Pound Sterling which depreciated against the US Dollar as compared to the prior year.  We had a net loss of $19.6 million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 compared to a net loss of $34.7 million in the prior year. Our fiscal year 2016 net loss reflects the impact of increased operating expenses of $7.5 million, partially offset by increased gross margins of $4.7 million. The increases in our operating expenses were due primarily to increased employee related costs, as we continued to grow our business, the operating impact of our recent acquisitions and global ERP implementation costs of $4.3 million. The increase in our gross margin was driven primarily by increases in our subscription and transaction revenues. Our fiscal year 2015 net loss included the impact of income tax expense of $16.0 million to establish a reserve against certain US-based deferred tax assets.  In fiscal year 2016, we derived approximately 42% of our revenue from customers located outside of North America, principally in the United Kingdom, continental Europe and the Asia-Pacific and Middle East regions. Our customers operate in many different industries, a diversification that we believe helps us in a challenging economic climate. Additionally, we believe that our recurring and subscription revenue base helps position us defensively against any short term economic downturn. While we believe that we continue to compete favorably in all of the markets we serve, ongoing or worsening economic stresses could negatively impact our business in the future.  Over the past several years we have made strategic investments in innovative new technology offerings that we believe will extend our leadership position, help us win new business, drive accelerated subscription revenue growth and expand our operating margins. We believe that these initiatives have positioned us effectively for accelerated revenue growth in future years.  Table of Contents  Revenue Sources  Our revenues are derived from multiple sources and are reported under the following classifications:   Subscriptions and Transactions Fees. We derive subscription and transaction fees from a number of sources, principally our SaaS offerings. Subscription revenues are typically recognized on a ratable basis over the subscription period. Transaction revenues are typically recorded at the time transactions are processed. Some of our SaaS products require customers to pay non-refundable set up or installation fees. In these cases, since the up-front fees do not represent a separate revenue earnings process, these fees are deferred and recognized as revenue over the estimated life of the customer relationship, which is generally between five and ten years. A significant part of our focus remains on growing the revenue contribution from our SaaS offerings and subscriptions and transactions based revenue streams.   Software License Fees. Software license revenues, which we derive from our software applications, are generally based on the number of software applications and user licenses purchased. Fees from the sale of perpetual software licenses are generally recognized upon delivery of the software to the customer, assuming that payment from the customer is probable and there are no extended payment terms. However, certain of our software arrangements, particularly those related to financial institution customers, are recognized on a percentage of completion basis over the life of the project because they require significant customization and modification and involve extended implementation periods. Recently however, the number of percentage of completion arrangements we enter into has declined as we have continued to de-emphasize large, highly customized projects in lieu of standard product deployments and our cloud-based solutions.   Service and Maintenance Fees. Our service and maintenance revenues consist of professional services fees and customer support and maintenance fees. Revenues relating to professional services not associated with highly customized software solutions are normally recognized at the time services are rendered. Professional services revenues associated with software license arrangements that include significant customization and modification are generally recognized on a percentage of completion basis over the life of the project. Software maintenance fees are recognized as revenue ratably over the respective maintenance period, which is typically one year.   Other Revenues. We derive other revenues from the sale of printers, check paper and magnetic ink character recognition toners. These revenues are normally recognized at the time of delivery.  Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates  We believe that several accounting policies are important to understanding our historical and future performance. We refer to these policies as critical because these specific areas generally require us to make judgments and estimates about matters that are uncertain at the time we make the estimate, and different estimates-which also would have been reasonable-could have been used. These critical accounting policies and estimates relate to revenue recognition, the valuation of goodwill and intangible assets, the valuation of acquired deferred revenue and income taxes. These critical policies and our procedures related to these policies are discussed below. In addition, refer to Note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a discussion of all of our significant accounting policies.  Revenue Recognition  Software Arrangements  We recognize revenue on our software license arrangements when four basic criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery of the product has occurred, the fee is fixed and determinable and collectability is probable. We consider a fully executed agreement or a customer purchase order to be persuasive evidence of an arrangement. Delivery is deemed to have occurred upon transfer of the product to the customer or  Table of Contents  the completion of services rendered. We consider the arrangement fee to be fixed and determinable if it is not subject to adjustment and if the customer has not been granted extended payment terms. Excluding our long term contract arrangements for which revenue is recorded on a percentage of completion basis, extended payment terms are deemed to be present when any portion of the software license fee is due in excess of 90 days after the date of product delivery. In arrangements that contain extended payment terms, software revenue is recorded as customer payments become contractually due, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. We consider the arrangement fee to be probable of collection if our internal credit analysis indicates that the customer will be able to pay contractual amounts as they become due.  Our software arrangements often contain multiple revenue elements, such as software licenses, professional services and post-contract customer support. For multiple element software arrangements which qualify for separate element treatment, revenue is recognized for each element when each of the four basic criteria is met which, excluding post-contract customer support, is typically upon delivery. Revenue for post-contract customer support agreements is recognized ratably over the term of the agreement, which is generally one year. Revenue is allocated to each element, excluding the software license, based on vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE). VSOE is limited to the price charged when the element is sold separately or, for an element not yet being sold separately, the price established by management having the relevant authority. We do not have VSOE for our software licenses since they are seldom sold separately. Accordingly, revenue is allocated to the software license using the residual value method. Under the residual value method, revenue equal to VSOE of each undelivered element is recognized upon delivery of that element. Any remaining arrangement fee is then allocated to the software license. This has the effect of allocating any sales discount inherent in the arrangement to the software license fee.  Certain of our software arrangements require significant customization and modification and involve extended implementation periods. These arrangements do not qualify for separate element revenue recognition treatment as described above, and instead must be accounted for under contract accounting. Under contract accounting, companies must select from two generally accepted methods of accounting: the completed contract method and the percentage of completion method. The completed contract method recognizes revenue and costs upon contract completion, and all project costs and revenues are reported as deferred items in the balance sheet until that time. The percentage of completion method recognizes revenue and costs on a contract over time, as the work progresses.  We use the percentage of completion method of accounting for our long-term contracts, as we believe that we can make reasonably reliable estimates of progress toward completion. Progress is measured based on labor hours, as measured at the end of each reporting period, as a percentage of total expected labor hours. Accordingly, the revenue we record in any reporting period for arrangements accounted for on a percentage of completion basis is dependent upon our estimates of the remaining labor hours that will be incurred in fulfilling our contractual obligations. Our estimates at the end of any reporting period could prove to be materially different from final project results, as determined only at subsequent stages of project completion. To mitigate this risk, we solicit the input of our project professional staff on a monthly basis, as well as at the end of each financial reporting period, for purposes of evaluating cumulative labor hours incurred and verifying the estimated remaining effort to completion; this ensures that our estimates are always based on the most current projections available.  Non-Software Arrangements  For arrangements governed by general revenue recognition literature, such as with our SaaS offerings or equipment and supplies only sales, we recognize revenue when four basic criteria are met. These criteria are similar to those governing software transactions: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the arrangement fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. For our SaaS offerings, revenue is generally recognized on a subscription or transaction basis over the period of performance.  Table of Contents  For arrangements consisting of multiple elements, revenue is allocated to each element based on a selling price hierarchy. The selling price of each element is based on VSOE if available, third-party evidence (TPE) if VSOE is not available or estimated selling price (ESP) if neither VSOE nor TPE are available. The residual method of allocation in a non-software arrangement is not permitted and, instead, arrangement consideration is allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method. The relative selling price method allocates any discount in the arrangement proportionately to each deliverable based on the proportion of each deliverable's selling price to the total arrangement fee. We are typically unable to establish TPE, which is based on the selling price charged by unrelated third-party vendors for similar deliverables when they are sold separately, as we are generally unable to obtain sufficient information on actual vendor selling prices to substantiate TPE. The objective of ESP is to estimate the price at which we would transact if the deliverable were sold separately rather than as part of a multiple element arrangement. Our determination of ESP considers several factors including actual selling prices for similar transactions, gross margin expectations and our ongoing pricing strategy. We formally analyze our ESP determinations on at least an annual basis.  Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets  Goodwill and acquired intangible assets are initially recorded at fair value and measured periodically for impairment. We performed our annual impairment test of the carrying value of our goodwill for fiscal year 2016 during our fourth quarter, which is consistent with the historic timing of our annual goodwill impairment review. Our analysis of goodwill impairment was performed at the reporting unit level, which requires an estimate of the fair value of each reporting unit.  Coming in to our fourth quarter, we had identified our Intellinx reporting unit as being at a heightened risk of impairment, as preliminary estimates of fiscal year 2017 revenues were below the revenue estimates we made at the time of the acquisition (January 2015). Based on our impairment review, the excess of fair value over the carrying value of goodwill for the Intellinx reporting unit was 14%.  Based on the results of our review, we concluded that there was no goodwill impairment in any of our reporting units. However, there can be no assurance that there will not be impairment charges in subsequent periods as a result of our future impairment reviews. To the extent that future impairment charges occur, it would have a material impact on our financial results. At June 30, 2016, the carrying value of goodwill for all of our reporting units was approximately $202.0 million.  In addition to our annual goodwill impairment review, we also perform periodic reviews of the carrying value and amortization periods of our other acquired intangible assets. These acquired intangible assets consist primarily of acquired customer related assets and acquired core technology. In evaluating potential impairment of these assets we specifically consider whether any indicators of impairment are present, including:   whether there has been a significant adverse change in the business climate that affects the value of an asset;   whether there has been a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used; and   whether there is an expectation that the asset will be sold or disposed of before the end of its originally estimated useful life.  If indicators of impairment are present, an estimate of the undiscounted cash flows that the specific asset is expected to generate must be made to ensure that the carrying value of the asset can be recovered. These estimates involve significant subjectivity. At June 30, 2016, the carrying value of our acquired intangible assets, excluding goodwill, was approximately $153.2 million. As a result of our fiscal year 2016 impairment review, we concluded that none of these assets were impaired.  Valuation of Acquired Intangible Assets and Acquired Deferred Revenue  In connection with our acquisitions, we have recorded acquired intangible assets relating principally to customer related assets, acquired technology and acquired contractual rights that include favorable economic terms as compared to overall market rates at the date of acquisition. The valuation process used to calculate the  Table of Contents  values assigned to these acquired intangible assets is complex and involves significant estimation relative to our financial projections. The principal component of the valuation process is the determination of discounted future cash flows, and there are a number of variables that we consider for purposes of projecting these future cash flows. There is inherent uncertainty involved with this estimation process and, while our estimates are consistent with our internal planning assumptions, the ultimate accuracy of these estimates is only verifiable over time. Further, the projections required for the valuation process generally utilize at least a ten-year forecast, which exceeds our normal internal planning and forecasting timeline. The particularly sensitive components of these estimates include, but are not limited to:   the selection of an appropriate discount rate;   the required return on all assets employed by the valued asset to generate future income streams;   our projected overall revenue growth and mix of revenue;   our gross margin estimates (which are highly dependent on our mix of revenue);   our technology and product life cycles;   the attrition rate of our customers, particularly those who contribute to our recurring revenue streams, such as software maintenance;   the determination of third party market rates for leases or other contractual rights we acquire, for purposes of assessing whether we have acquired a favorable, unfavorable or at-market contract;   our planned level of operating expenses; and   our effective tax rate.  Additionally, we are required to estimate the acquisition date fair value of acquired deferred revenue that we assume as part of any acquisition. The acquisition date fair value of deferred revenue is estimated based on the costs we expect to incur in fulfilling the obligations, plus a normal profit margin. These cost estimates exclude amounts relating to any selling effort, since those costs would have been incurred by the predecessor company rather than by us. In the case of acquired software maintenance contracts, the cost estimates also exclude any ongoing research and development expenses associated with product upgrades since these amounts typically do not represent a legal obligation that we assume at the time of acquisition.  Income Taxes  We are subject to the income tax laws of the United States (including its states and municipalities) as well as the tax laws of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. Our annual tax rate is determined based on our income, statutory tax rates and the tax impact of items treated differently for tax purposes than for financial statement purposes. The income tax expense we record in any interim period is based on our estimated tax rate for the full fiscal year, which requires us to estimate our annual pretax income and tax expense by jurisdiction. This process is inherently subjective and requires us to make estimates relative to our business plans, tax planning opportunities and operating results. An interim tax rate is subject to adjustment if, in later periods, there are changes to our estimate of total tax expense or pretax income, including income by jurisdiction. We update these estimates on a quarterly basis, so that our interim financial statements reflect our most current projections for the full fiscal year.  Our income tax expense consists of two components: current and deferred. Current tax expense represents our estimate of taxes to be paid for the current period, including income tax expense arising from uncertain tax positions. Deferred tax expense results from changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities between periods. Deferred tax assets and liabilities arise due to differences between when certain transactions are reflected in our financial statements and when those same items are included in a tax return. Deferred tax assets generally reflect the impact of a tax deduction, tax credit or operating loss carryforward that we have available for use in future year tax returns. Deferred tax liabilities generally reflect the impact of a deduction or expenditure that we have already taken in a tax return but that we have not yet reflected in our financial statements.  Table of Contents  We record a deferred tax asset if we believe that it is more likely than not that we will realize a future tax benefit. Ultimate realization of any deferred tax asset is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in the appropriate tax jurisdiction before the expiration of carryforward periods, if any. Our assessment of deferred tax asset recoverability considers many different factors including historical and projected operating results, the reversal of existing deferred tax liabilities that provide a source of future taxable income, the impact of current tax planning strategies and the availability of future tax planning strategies. We establish a valuation allowance against any deferred tax asset for which we are unable to conclude that recoverability is more likely than not. This is inherently judgmental, since we are required to assess many different factors and evaluate as much objective evidence as we can in reaching an overall conclusion. The particularly sensitive component of our evaluation is our projection of future operating results since this relies heavily on our estimates of future revenue and expense levels by tax jurisdiction.  In making our assessment of US deferred tax asset recoverability at June 30, 2015, we concluded that it was more likely than not that a portion of our US deferred tax assets may not be recovered. As a result, we increased our valuation allowance in fiscal year 2015 and recorded income tax expense in the amount of $16.0 million. The recognition of a valuation allowance has no effect on our ability to use the underlying deferred tax assets to reduce cash tax payments in the future to the extent that we generate US taxable income.  We establish reserves to remove some or all of the tax benefit we would have otherwise recorded if a tax position is uncertain. In evaluating whether a tax position is uncertain, we base our assessment on existing tax legislation, case law and legal statute. We also presume that the tax position will be examined by the relevant taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. We recognize tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions at the largest amount deemed more likely than not will be realized upon tax examination. We review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as . . .  Aug 29, 2016  (c) 1995-2016 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc. All Rights Reserved
