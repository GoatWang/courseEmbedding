            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.source> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11x1gf2m6>  .

<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.rate> 4.5 .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage>  .


If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million
Updated: June 9, 2013
Data Format: CSV

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

The Leaders Strategy™




“Partnering with exceptional leaders gives GTCR a differentiated perspective on investment opportunities"
Craig Bondy
Managing DirectorGTCR







Identifying the Right Leader Is the Critical Difference in Building Market-Leading Companies
As a leading private equity firm, GTCR pioneered The Leaders Strategy™—finding and partnering with management leaders in core domains to identify, acquire and build market-leading companies through transformational acquisitions and organic growth. This differentiated approach has stood at the core of GTCR’s investment strategy for more than 35 years.










Partnering with Leaders »
Leveraging Domain Expertise »
Executing Transformation »


Partnering with Leaders
Sourcing and creating partnerships with exceptional leaders is the foundation of The Leaders Strategy™. Frequently, these partnerships are started solely on the basis of a strong investment thesis, even before an initial platform acquisition is identified. In other instances, we partner with strong incumbent management teams to provide them capital to execute transformational opportunities, like acquiring a significant competitor.
Partnering with proven leaders can provide distinct and proprietary advantages in the investment process and can mitigate risk. Our Leaders Strategy™ teams are experienced, established leaders in their domains. We believe these leaders’ industry insights can provide informational advantages in the acquisition due-diligence process, and that their execution track record and reputation can facilitate improved acquisition financing execution. In addition, our Leaders Strategy™ teams can become preferred buyers within their domains, which can lead to attractive follow-on acquisition opportunities.
Importantly, our Leaders Strategy™ teams are positioned to recruit the most talented people in their industries. This creates the opportunity to drive strong sales effectiveness while optimizing costs, the combined effect of which can be significant improvements in operating profits.  All of these elements can come together to create marketing-leading companies with strategic significance, which can result in attractive strategic or public exit opportunities.



Leveraging Domain Expertise
As a result of focused efforts over our 35-year history, GTCR’s highly resourceful, results-driven teams have developed deep domain expertise within Financial Services & Technology, Healthcare, Technology, Media & Telecommunications and Growth Business Services. Because we’ve focused on these areas for multiple decades, we have developed critical industry knowledge, credibility and strong networks of relationships that can help us identify unique investment opportunities.
GTCR investment teams consistently leverage this experience and insight to develop specific, actionable investment ideas within these domains. At the same time, our history and reputation in these areas allow us to continually meet with and evaluate both seasoned and up-and-coming management leaders.
The essence of GTCR’s Leaders Strategy™ is to bring together these two activities—research-based investment thesis development and proactive executive networking. Through thesis development within our four areas of domain expertise, we find and develop actionable investment ideas. We seek to identify emerging inflection points and trends that can lead us to under-appreciated or under-performing businesses. At the same time, we seek to position ourselves to better evaluate both the risks and the potential in new investment opportunities. Through rigorous executive networking and recruiting in our domains, we strive to identify and partner with the very best leadership teams—the teams capable of driving the execution of the transformation opportunities that we identify through the thesis development process.
When these two efforts come together, we have an opportunity to execute truly transformational investments and build important, durable, market and industry-leading companies that have strategic value.


Executing Transformation
GTCR’s Leaders Strategy™ brings together proactive investment thesis development and proactive executive networking with the objective of identifying opportunities to execute transformational investments.
The leadership teams we seek to partner with drive operational transformation in under-managed or under-optimized businesses by upgrading human capital and rigorously developing and focusing on sales execution and resource allocation through the use of key performance indicators. Through this process, successful Leaders Strategy™ teams are able to improve operating efficiency and, importantly, accelerate revenue growth.
The Leaders Strategy™ also helps position GTCR to invest in complex corporate carve-outs, which tend to be extremely management-intensive to execute. In these situations, Leaders Strategy™ teams need to recreate critical functions for the acquired company on a standalone basis. We believe creating a company with a singular strategy and focus helps to accelerate financial performance and enhance value.
Our leadership teams are skilled at identifying, executing and integrating acquisitions. Acquisitions can help drive transformation by increasing both the scale and scope of a company. They can also accelerate geographic, customer and product expansion while facilitating fixed-cost leverage. And critically, acquisitions can often be executed at accretive valuations. The increased scope and scale that acquisitions can accelerate facilitate more efficient capital structures and, ultimately, value creation.

History[edit]




GTCR logo in use prior to 1998 separation


The company was founded in 1980 as Golder Thoma & Co. by Stanley Golder and Carl Thoma. In the 1970s, Golder built the private equity program at First Chicago Corp.[4] where he is noted primarily for backing Federal Express and for efforts as chairman of the National Venture Capital Association and the National Association of Small Business Investment Companies to change federal laws allowing pensions to invest in private equity.[5][6] Golder Thoma received much of its initial funding from William M. Blair and upon leaving First Chicago, Golder was replaced by John A. Canning, Jr. who would go on to found rival Chicago private equity firm Madison Dearborn.

In 1984, after recruiting Bryan Cressey to join the firm from First Chicago, the firm's name was changed to Golder Thoma Cressey and with the promotion of Bruce Rauner to partner the firm would come to be known as Golder, Thoma, Cressey, Rauner, Inc. (GTCR), although it would still often be referred to as Golder Thoma.[7]
In 1998, disagreements between the senior partners led Golder, Thoma, Cressey, Rauner, Inc. split into two private equity firms. Both firms continue to invest primarily through consolidations of specific industries, referred to as roll-ups:

GTCR Golder Rauner, (Stanley Golder and Bruce Rauner), the $11 billion private equity firm, based in Chicago, now known as GTCR. GTCR founder Stanley Golder died in 2000 and lead partner Bruce Rauner retired in 2012. Today the firm is led by several senior partners, including Phil Canfield, Collin Roche and David Donnini.[8]
Thoma Cressey, (Carl Thoma and Bryan Cressey) based in Chicago and San Francisco. Thoma Cressey would be renamed Thoma Cressey Bravo to reflect the growing role of partner Orlando Bravo. In 2008, Bryan Cressey left Thoma Cressey Bravo with several investment professionals to form Cressey & Co. a small healthcare focused private equity firm.[9][10] Thoma Cressey Bravo became Thoma Bravo after Cressey’s departure, led by managing partners Carl Thoma, Orlando Bravo, Lee Mitchell and Scott Crabill. The firm closed its 9th fund in March 2009 with $822.5 million.[11]

Investment funds[edit]
GTCR invests through a series of private limited partnerships and its investors include a variety of pension funds (e.g., Washington State Investment Board,[12] Pennsylvania State Employee's Retirement System[13]) endowments and other institutional investors.
Following its separation from Thoma Cressey (discussed above), GTCR has raised six private equity funds:

1998 - Fund VI, ($870 million)
2000 - Fund VII ($2.0 billion)
2003 - Fund VIII ($1.8 billion)
2006 - Fund IX ($2.75 billion)
2011 - Fund X ($3.25 billion)[14]
2014 - Fund XI ($3.85 billion)[15]

GTCR Acquires Onvoy - Wed., Jan. 6, 2016
















































GTCR Acquires Onvoy
Wed., Jan. 6, 2016By Jon Gingerich











Tweet












GTCR, the private equity firm that owns PR services and software giant Cision, announced today that it has inked an agreement to acquire telecommunications provider company Onvoy, LLC.
The deal is expected to close during the year’s first quarter.
Minneapolis-based Onvoy provides wholesale voice and messaging communications services for national telecom service providers and carriers. It was founded in 1991 and is a subsidiary of Communications Infrastructure Investments, LLC.
GTCR currently holds a minority share in Onvoy and has a representative on its board. In a statement, Onvoy CEO Fritz Hendricks said GTCR has “played a leadership role in support of Onvoy’s vision to expand network reach and enable communications for the evolving voice, messaging, and wireless market.”
"Fritz and his team have built a platform that is well-positioned to power the next generation of telecommunications providers," GTCR principal Lawrence Fey said in a statement.  "We believe a streamlined ownership structure will help the team continue to pursue product innovation and strategic acquisitions."
Chicago-based GTCR has invested more than $12 billion in more than 200 companies specializing in finance, technology, healthcare, media and telecommunications since its founding in 1980. After taking PR software firm Vocus private last year in a $447 million cash transaction through affiliate GTCR Canyon Holdings, the private equity firm two months later oversaw the merger of Vocus with powerhouse PR services property Cision. Cision in December purchased PR Newswire for $841 million.

GTCR Announces Acquisition of Onvoy
January 6, 2016

Chicago, IL
GTCR to support growth of leading provider of wholesale telecommunication services.
GTCR, a leading private equity firm, announced today that it has signed a definitive agreement to acquire Onvoy, LLC (“Onvoy” or the “Company”) from Communications Infrastructure Investments. Onvoy, headquartered in Minneapolis, Minnesota, is a leading provider of wholesale voice-enabling services nationwide.
Onvoy provides easy-to-use voice and text functionality to carriers and integrators that choose to focus on customer-facing applications and service rather than infrastructure management. The Company combines an intuitive software interface with its nationwide network of physical switches and dedicated transport to offer leading wholesale telecommunication services. Onvoy’s customers include major wireless carriers, rural telephone companies, high-growth voice over IP (VoIP) and over-the-top (OTT) communications companies.
As part of the transaction, GTCR will partner with CEO Fritz Hendricks and the Onvoy management team as they continue to grow and develop the company’s service offerings and geographic breadth. GTCR combined its long history of investment in the telecommunications industry with its recent experience working directly with Onvoy to identify the company’s unique position in the marketplace. GTCR is currently a minority shareholder in Onvoy and has a representative on the board. This unique position allowed GTCR to better understand the strong value proposition that Onvoy offers its customers.
“GTCR has played a leadership role in support of Onvoy’s vision to expand network reach and enable communications for the evolving voice, messaging and wireless market,” said Mr. Hendricks. “I look forward to GTCR’s expanded ownership and greater level of participation as we accelerate our growth objectives.”
”Fritz and his team have built a platform that is well-positioned to power the next generation of telecommunications providers,” added GTCR Principal Lawrence Fey. “We believe a streamlined ownership structure will help the team continue to pursue product innovation and strategic acquisitions.”
The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2016.
Stephens Inc. served as financial advisor to GTCR, and Latham & Watkins LLP provided legal counsel. Gibson Dunn & Crutcher LLP provided legal counsel to Onvoy.

Actient Pharmaceuticals: Building a Diversified Portfolio Through Proprietary Acquisitions
Ed Fiorentino  |  Actient Pharmaceuticals
Actient Pharmaceuticals was a management partnership formed with Ed Fiorentino, a former senior executive at Abbott Laboratories, to acquire specialty pharmaceutical companies and products as part of GTCR’s Leaders Strategy™. In less than three years, Actient completed five proprietary acquisitions and built a unique, diversified portfolio of commercial products and pipeline assets focused on the treatment of urological indications.
Actient was formed in 2009 based on GTCR’s thesis that the pharmaceutical industry was an attractive area for investment given several positive trends, including an aging population, increasing availability of drugs for new indications and increasing prescription drug coverage. In addition, near-term growth challenges among mid- and large-cap pharmaceutical companies resulted in significant industry consolidation, leading to product divestitures as these companies attempted to re-prioritize their portfolios and shed non-core assets.
Based on Mr. Fiorentino’s industry experience at Abbott, we believed Actient was well positioned to evaluate these attractive divestiture opportunities and ultimately build a leading specialty business through acquisitions of marketed products and companies. The Actient strategy focused on acquiring undermanaged products, thereby creating an opportunity to grow and preserve these assets through targeted promotion strategies and life cycle management programs.
In July 2010, Actient closed its first proprietary transaction, a corporate carve-out of six on-market products from UCB Pharma. The transaction provided Actient with a strategic asset in the urology space and an opportunity to establish a commercial platform with stable cash flows that could be leveraged through additional acquisitions.
In January 2011, Actient acquired Timm Medical Technologies, a leader in urology medical devices. The acquisition of Timm enabled Actient to expand its urology presence by offering both pharmaceutical and medical device solutions.
In April 2011, Actient followed up the Timm deal with the acquisition of the product Striant (testosterone buccal system), a small but strategic deal consistent with Actient’s focus in urology.
In December 2011, Actient completed the transformative acquisition of Slate Pharmaceuticals, adding the product Testopel (testosterone pellets for implantation), one of the fastest-growing products in one of the fastest-growing segments of the pharmaceutical industry. The acquisition complemented Actient’s strategic focus, broadening the portfolio of leading products marketed to urologists.
Six months later, in June 2012, Actient acquired Bartor Pharmacal. The Bartor acquisition helped to secure the manufacturing of Testopel and reduce cost of goods sold.
In less than three years, through five proprietary acquisitions and organic growth, we believe Actient became one of the fastest-growing pharmaceutical companies. The management team faced a number of challenges in building the company, ranging from sourcing and completing acquisitions to manufacturing and growing sales of its products. The team proved to be highly effective in building the business, hiring key managers and building a sales force.
Actient was acquired by Auxilium Pharmaceuticals in April 2013.

Cord Blood Registry: Investing in Life Sciences
Geoff Crouse  |  Cord Blood Registry
In the late 2000’s, in an effort to expand the firm’s domain expertise in the healthcare industry, GTCR began to dedicate significant time and resources towards evaluating investment opportunities in the life sciences sector.  Much like the pharmaceutical sector, GTCR identified life sciences as an attractive area for investment given its significant market size, compelling industry dynamics and strong growth outlook.  The firm’s proactive effort eventually led to a relationship with Geoff Crouse, a life sciences industry veteran with prior experience at Roche, Millipore and Immucor.  GTCR began formally working with Mr. Crouse in 2011, evaluating numerous potential investment opportunities before identifying stem cell cryopreservation and storage as an attractive, niche sub-segment within life sciences.  As a result, in October of 2011, we began to engage in discussions with the founder and CEO of Cord Blood Registry (“CBR”) on a proprietary basis about a potential transaction.  Nearly one year later, in September of 2012, GTCR acquired CBR.  As part of the transaction, Mr. Crouse assumed the role of CEO and the founder transitioned to a Board role.
Founded in 1992, CBR is a market leader in the collection, processing and storage of umbilical cord blood and tissue stem cells, enabling families to preserve these cells for potential future use by a child or a related family member.  Cord blood stem cells have well-established medical applications in a range of diseases, including blood cancers that required regenerating healthy blood and immune cells after chemotherapy.  In addition, stem cells derived from cord blood and cord tissue have demonstrated therapeutic potential in experimental treatments for regenerative medicine applications, such as brain injury, cerebral palsy and hearing loss.  CBR is dedicated to supporting the clinical application of cord blood and cord tissue stem cells by partnering with institutions to establish FDA-regulated clinical trials for conditions that had no known cure.
CBR’s attractive commercial model – comprised of an upfront processing fee and long-term annual storage fees – provides strong revenue visibility and recurring cash flow, with minimal customer attrition.  The investment thesis in CBR was based on GTCR’s belief that the company was well positioned to drive continued profitable growth of the installed base and benefit from the compounding of long-term storage revenue.
During GTCR’s ownership, the firm worked with Mr. Crouse to recruit a senior management team, transform the digital marketing strategy and build upon CBR’s commercial leadership position. By further refining CBR’s sales and marketing infrastructure, CBR enabled more effective communication with expecting families and OB/GYN physicians, thereby enhancing the consumer health and maternal health brands.
GTCR and Mr. Crouse grew the CBR installed base to over 600,000 units, and reached an important milestone – helping more than 300 families use their cord blood stem cells for established and experimental medical treatments.  In addition, CBR invested resources to expand the potential scope of newborn stem cell therapies for availability to patients and their families through FDA regulated clinical trials.
In July of 2015, CBR entered into an agreement to be acquired by AMAG Pharmaceuticals, a publicly-traded specialty pharmaceutical company, as part of a strategy to build its maternal health business.

Devicor: Building A Global Med Tech Business to Advance Women’s Health
Tom Daulton  |  Devicor Medical Products
Devicor Medical Products was a Leaders Strategy™ partnership formed with Tom Daulton, a former executive at Cardinal Health (NYSE: CAH), to acquire medical device companies and products. Over the course of four years, Devicor orchestrated a complex carve-out from Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) and executed several strategic add-ons to build a global med tech business focused on women’s health. The company’s commitment toward advancing technology to help clinicians accurately diagnose breast cancer through minimally invasive procedures ultimately generated strategic interest, which led to its sale to Danaher in December 2014.
Devicor was formed in 2008 after closely collaborating with Mr. Daulton around a thesis to pursue acquisitions in the medical devices industry segment, with a particular strategy to target interventional hospital procedures. Mr. Daulton was previously a member of Cardinal’s Global Leadership Team, and was responsible for the Interventional Specialties and MedSystems divisions, both fast-growing interventional product businesses. Together, GTCR and Mr. Daulton saw an opportunity to pursue acquisition opportunities and build a scale med tech player in this attractive industry segment. In developing the Devicor investment thesis, GTCR was able to leverage its healthcare domain expertise established over the past 30 years.
In 2010, Devicor completed its initial platform acquisition with the successful corporate carve-out of the Mammotome breast care business from Johnson & Johnson. Through the complex, two-year carve-out, Devicor built dedicated manufacturing, transitioned the commercial business in more than 50 countries, secured new regulatory permits in several geographies and reinvested heavily in new product research and development. As a result, Devicor was able to create a standalone, fully integrated, global medical device business and was able to leverage its commercial platform to complete several complementary add-on acquisitions.
In October 2014, Devicor announced an agreement to sell to Danaher Corporation’s (NYSE: DHR) Leica Biosystems, a leading provider of anatomical pathology solutions and automation used to advance cancer diagnostics.

HealthSpring: Seeing Advantage in Medicare Advantage
Herbert Fritch  |  HealthSpring
In 2003, Congress enacted the Medicare Modernization Act (“MMA”), the first significant piece of healthcare legislation since the Balanced Budget Amendment of 1997 (“BBA”). Looking to leverage GTCR’s deep experience in managed healthcare services, we targeted healthcare industry niches that would benefit from the MMA legislation and identified privately sponsored Medicare Advantage (“MA”) plans as one such area. While the BBA had significantly cut reimbursement to these plans in 1997, the MMA restored reimbursement in a number of ways that encouraged private plans to provide attractive options to seniors. At that time, officials at CMS, the federal healthcare regulatory agency, were supporting the continued privatization of Medicare, and we believed well-managed healthcare companies in the MA industry would enjoy strong growth and profitability over the ensuing years.
During 2004, GTCR searched for an industry leader with whom to capitalize on this attractive growth opportunity. Our work led us to Herbert Fritch, the founder and CEO of HealthSpring (formerly NewQuest), a private, rapidly growing MA and commercial health plan company. GTCR believed that Mr. Fritch was one of the most talented and knowledgeable executives in the MA industry and that HealthSpring was a strong industry platform, managing higher-quality patient care at lower costs.
In addition to Mr. Fritch’s strong leadership and the quality of his team, we found the HealthSpring platform to be attractive for several other reasons. First, HealthSpring’s presence in four states provided both a diversified membership base and the opportunity to expand into adjacent markets. Second, HealthSpring’s strong focus on healthcare physician partnerships aligned economic incentives and helped drive high-quality patient care. Finally, HealthSpring’s evidence-based disease-management programs enabled the company to provide better healthcare on a more cost-effective basis.
In March 2005, GTCR partnered with Mr. Fritch to recapitalize HealthSpring, acquiring a majority stake in the company. We worked closely with Mr. Fritch to transform the business operationally, adding key senior managers to the team (including Kevin McNamara as CFO), helping to identify geographic expansion opportunities and winding down the company’s commercial health plan business. Collectively, these efforts enabled Mr. Fritch and his team to manage the rapid MA membership growth more smoothly and to prepare for a potential public offering.
Within GTCR’s first year of ownership, HealthSpring’s MA membership had increased by nearly 60%. GTCR worked closely with management to evaluate strategic alternatives and determined that a public offering would facilitate the company’s acquisition-related growth plans. HealthSpring completed an IPO in February 2006.

Ovation Pharmaceuticals: Finding Healthy Profits in Healthcare
Wilbur (Bill) Gantz and Jeff Aronin  |  Ovation Pharmaceuticals
Building on the firm’s expertise and track record of success in the healthcare sector, GTCR focused on the specialty pharmaceutical industry in the late 1990s. GTCR strongly believed the specialty pharmaceutical industry was poised for significant secular growth and offered an opportunity to establish an attractive, recurring revenue business through the acquisition of products with FDA market exclusivity, intellectual property protection and other attractive attributes. At this time, M&A activity in the pharmaceutical industry was robust. After a wave of large pharmaceutical mergers in the 1990s, many large diversified pharmaceutical companies were rationalizing their drug portfolios, selling small, non-core drugs servicing niche markets. This trend increased acquisition and in-licensing opportunities for smaller specialty pharmaceutical companies. At the same time, many mid-sized and large pharmaceutical companies had significant cash balances and were willing to pay full value for mid-sized specialty pharmaceutical businesses. Of particular interest were those businesses well positioned in key therapeutic focus areas, possessing both attractive on-market and development-stage drugs to drive future growth.
GTCR knew that building deep domain expertise and partnering with talented management leaders were critical to investing successfully in the pharmaceutical industry. We spent several years proactively researching and networking within the pharmaceutical industry. Two exceptional leaders rose to the top: Wilbur (Bill) Gantz and Jeff Aronin. In 2002, GTCR partnered with these leaders to build Ovation Pharmaceuticals, a specialty pharmaceutical company based in Deerfield, Illinois. Mr. Gantz (Chairman of Ovation) was previously the President of Baxter International Inc. and Chairman and CEO of PathoGenesis Corporation, a company he founded, built and successfully sold. Mr. Aronin (founder, CEO and President of Ovation) was previously CEO of two successful venture-backed healthcare companies and a Sales and Marketing Executive with American Health Products and Carter-Wallace.
Ovation and GTCR focused primarily on acquiring on-market and development-stage drugs in the therapeutic areas of neurology, hematology and oncology. Many of these products targeted orphan indications, i.e., small patient populations with a high unmet medical need. Ovation made eight acquisitions from 2002 to 2006, largely carving out products from major pharmaceutical companies. Mr. Gantz and Mr. Aronin strategically transformed the compounds purchased into a standalone, fully functional specialty pharmaceutical company with a dedicated sales force targeting specific prescribers, a strong product development group and a regulatory function that worked very effectively with the FDA. One of the acquisitions included the purchase of the North American rights to two development-stage neurology drugs, Sabril and Frisium, in 2004. The subsequent development and FDA approval of Sabril in 2009 was a substantial value driver for Ovation in its eventual sale.
Ovation made several additional neurology acquisitions, further transforming the company. Most importantly, Ovation acquired the U.S. commercial rights to Xenazine, the first drug approved in the U.S. for the treatment of chorea, a debilitating movement disorder associated with Huntington’s disease. Ovation successfully leveraged its neurology sales force to launch Xenazine in the U.S. and further establish its credibility and critical mass as a neurology specialty company.
Overall from 2002 to 2009, GTCR and its management partners at Ovation strategically transformed 10 separate acquisitions of pharmaceutical assets into a neurology-focused biopharmaceutical company with an excellent commercial platform and a portfolio of clinically unique drugs targeting largely unmet medical needs. In February 2009, after a robust sale process, Ovation announced an agreement to sell the company to Lundbeck, an international pharmaceutical company.

Province Healthcare/Capella Healthcare: Providing Success Through Providing Healthcare
Martin Rash  |  Province Healthcare/Capella Healthcare
In the mid-1990s, GTCR’s research in the acute-care hospital sector led us to the view that non-urban hospital owners (particularly municipalities and not-for-profit organizations) would struggle with the rapid changes in the healthcare industry. We developed the thesis that an operationally focused management team could create significant value by driving revenues and profitability at undermanaged hospitals. Our private equity firm’s extensive search for an acute-care hospital executive with whom to partner led us to Martin Rash, the COO of Community Health Systems. During Mr. Rash’s 10 years with Community Health Systems, the company had grown to 40 hospitals. In 1996, GTCR and Mr. Rash agreed to form Province Healthcare, a management start-up targeting the non-urban hospital sector.
Over the following two years, our private equity firm worked closely with Mr. Rash and his team to identify and acquire undermanaged hospitals. Together, GTCR and management transformed the operations of the acquired healthcare facilities by reducing costs, driving revenue growth and integrating eight hospitals into a centrally managed, high-performing company. In 1998, Province Healthcare completed an IPO.
During the ensuing six years, GTCR remained active on the board of directors of Province Healthcare. In particular, our private equity firm worked closely with Mr. Rash to recruit Dan Slipkovich to Province Healthcare as its COO and Mr. Rash’s likely successor. Together, Mr. Rash and Mr. Slipkovich continued to build value at Province Healthcare, acquiring 13 additional hospitals and continuing to improve operating performance. In 2005, LifePoint Hospitals, another publicly traded acute-care hospital company, acquired Province Healthcare.
Following the sale, our private equity firm explored the possibility of re-entering the industry. The opportunity to drive revenue growth and increase profitability at undermanaged hospitals continued to exist, and we committed to a second effort in the sector. GTCR chose to partner with Mr. Slipkovich, who had played a prominent role in the success of Province Healthcare. In late 2005, GTCR and Mr. Slipkovich agreed to formalize a new management start-up called Capella Healthcare, again targeting the non-urban acute-care hospital sector. Several of the senior members of Mr. Slipkovich’s team from Province Healthcare joined the Capella Healthcare management team.
Capella Healthcare, a GTCR portfolio company, acquired its first four hospitals in late 2005. Capella Healthcare has since grown to 13 hospitals, making Capella Healthcare the ninth-largest for-profit hospital operator in the country.

Sterigenics:  Transformation Through Organic Growth and Strategic Acquisitions
Michael Mulhern  |  Sterigenics International
As a result of GTCR’s history of investing in outsourced business services, combined with the firm’s proactive efforts and domain expertise in the medical device industry, GTCR has pursued businesses that provide specialized services essential to the manufacture and marketing of healthcare products.  GTCR identified contract sterilization as an attractive industry that exhibited a range of favorable attributes, including a market structure with underlying volume and pricing growth and attractive margins.
In 2011, the firm pursued and eventually acquired Sterigenics, the leading global provider of contract sterilization services to the medical device industry, operating 38 facilities across North America, Europe and Asia. Sterigenics offered all three major sterilization modalities and a full suite of value-add services across its broad network of strategically-located facilities. Sterigenics also had a strong reputation for providing high-quality, cost-effective and customized solutions.  Based on extensive diligence, GTCR believed that Sterigenics was well positioned to capitalize on consistent industry growth fueled by increasing med tech procedure volumes and continued outsourced sterilization trends.
As part of the Sterigenics transaction, GTCR partnered with Michael Mulhern, who joined as CEO shortly after closing.  Together, GTCR and Mr. Mulhern identified several initiatives to improve Sterigenics’ operational and growth initiatives, enhance its market leadership and drive incremental earnings growth.  Michael added key management, upgraded systems and SOPs and methodically optimized customer contracting and facility utilization to expand capacity, unit economics and quality standards.
In addition to organic initiatives, GTCR and management also strategically repositioned the business through three acquisitions, including two sterilization facility add-ons and the transformative acquisition of Nordion, a key supplier to Sterigenics.  Nordion was a global science company providing radioactive cobalt used for gamma sterilization of medical devices and a portfolio of medical isotopes for clinical use in healthcare facilities. The vertical integration of Nordion secured the supply of a critical raw material to Sterigenics sterilization services, and the facility acquisitions broadened the Company’s geographic footprint.
After completing the acquisition and integration of Nordion, GTCR began to assess various strategic alternatives.  In May 2015, the firm completed a recapitalization of the business with Warburg Pincus, a global private equity firm.   GTCR is excited to remain in partnership with Michael Mulhern and the senior management team to execute against the Company’s future initiatives.

PRESS RELEASE
Chicago, IL – January 6, 2016
GTCR, a leading private equity firm, announced today that it has signed a definitive agreement to acquire Onvoy, LLC (“Onvoy” or the “Company”) from Communications Infrastructure Investments. Onvoy, headquartered in Minneapolis, Minnesota, is a leading provider of wholesale voice-enabling services nationwide.
Onvoy provides easy-to-use voice and text functionality to carriers and integrators that choose to focus on customer-facing applications and service rather than infrastructure management. The Company combines an intuitive software interface with its nationwide network of physical switches and dedicated transport to offer leading wholesale telecommunication services. Onvoy’s customers include major wireless carriers, rural telephone companies, high-growth Voice over IP (VoIP) and Over-The-Top (OTT) communications companies.
As part of the transaction, GTCR will partner with CEO Fritz Hendricks and the Onvoy management team as they continue to grow and develop the company’s service offerings and geographic breadth. GTCR combined its long history of investment in the Telecommunications industry with its recent experience working directly with Onvoy to identify the company’s unique position in the marketplace. 





GTCR is currently a minority shareholder in Onvoy and has a representative on the board. This unique position allowed GTCR to better understand the strong value proposition that Onvoy offers its customers.
“GTCR has played a leadership role in support of Onvoy’s vision to expand network reach and enable communications for the evolving voice, messaging, and wireless market,” said Mr. Hendricks. “I look forward to GTCR’s expanded ownership and greater level of participation as we accelerate our growth objectives.”
”Fritz and his team have built a platform that is well-positioned to power the next generation of telecommunications providers,” added GTCR Principal Lawrence Fey. “We believe a streamlined ownership structure will help the team continue to pursue product innovation and strategic acquisitions.”
The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2016.
Stephens Inc. served as financial advisor to GTCR and Latham & Watkins LLP provided legal counsel. Gibson Dunn & Crutcher LLP provided legal counsel to Onvoy.
