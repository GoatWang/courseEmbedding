					Qui Tam Specialist Eric H. Jaso Joins Seeger Weiss As Partner				

					By:					Seeger Weiss					on
					May 30, 2012				

Seeger Weiss LLP, regularly named by the National Law Journal and other legal authorities as one of the nation’s leading plaintiffs’ law firms, proudly announces the arrival of Eric H. Jaso as a partner of the firm.










 






(New York, NY) Seeger Weiss LLP, regularly named by the National Law Journal and other legal authorities as one of the nation’s leading plaintiffs’ law firms, proudly announces the arrival of Eric H. Jaso as a partner of the firm. Mr. Jaso will be resident in Seeger Weiss’s New York City and Newark, New Jersey offices.
A former federal prosecutor and official of the U.S. Departments of Justice and Education, Mr. Jaso will draw on his extensive experience in government and private practice to represent whistleblowers who report fraud against the government. He has participated in cases that have recovered billions of dollars of taxpayer money to the federal and state governments. Mr. Jaso’s expertise includes the federal False Claims Act (“qui tam” cases), and claims brought under the Securities and Exchange Commission, Internal Revenue Service, and state and local whistleblower provisions. Eric also handles white collar criminal matters, as well as a variety of complex litigation and appeals.
Managing Partner Stephen A. Weiss welcomed Mr. Jaso to the firm, stating: “Eric brings a deep well of experience to our active whistleblower practice. His lengthy governmental tenures, combined with his seasoned ability to investigate, develop and prosecute complex fraud cases, will strongly complement our existing practice areas in representing aggrieved and injured individuals victimized by corporate misconduct.”
Prior to joining Seeger Weiss LLP, Mr. Jaso, who graduated Harvard College, cum laude, and obtained a J.D. from the University of Chicago, was a counsel at Boies, Schiller & Flexner LLP, and subsequently a partner at Stone & Magnanini LLP in New Jersey. In both, he handled numerous whistleblower cases as well as complex commercial and criminal matters. His work included successful settlements in qui tam cases against McKesson Corp. ($190 million) and Forest Labs ($313 million). Mr. Jaso successfully appealed a federal criminal conviction in United States v. Curley, 639 F.3d 50 (2d Cir. 2011), and the defendant went on to win acquittal at his retrial. Eric additionally represented 15 proposed amici curiae in Abbott v. Burke, a controversial school funding case before the New Jersey Supreme Court, among other notable representations.
From 2003 to 2008, Mr. Jaso worked as an Assistant United States Attorney for the District of New Jersey within the U.S. Department of Justice, serving in the Securities & Health Care Fraud Unit as well as the Appeals Division. Among his most notable cases were U.S. v. Cocchiola & Venechanos, a securities and bank fraud jury trial in which both defendants (the CEO and CFO of a publicly-traded company) were convicted, and U.S. v. Newbury, in which he obtained the conviction of a person who had defrauded the 9/11 victim compensation fund. During the first term of President George W. Bush, Mr. Jaso was appointed Counselor to Assistant Attorney General Michael Chertoff at the U.S. Department of Justice’s Criminal Division, where he was responsible for policy and legislation, and as a Deputy General Counsel at the U.S. Department of Education, where he advised in the areas of postsecondary education and regulatory affairs. During the mid-nineties, Mr. Jaso served as an Associate Independent Counsel in the “Whitewater” investigation under Kenneth W. Starr.
Mr. Jaso was nominated by New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, and confirmed by the State Senate, as a Public Member of the New Jersey Urban Enterprise Zone Authority, and was appointed by the late Assemblyman Alex DeCroce as a member of the New Jersey Congressional Redistricting Commission. He also serves in the leadership of the Hispanic National Bar Association and the Hispanic Bar Association of New Jersey, the New Jersey Lawyers’ Chapter of the Federalist Society, and the John C. Lifland American Inn of Court. He has taught Appellate Advocacy as an Adjunct Professor at Seton Hall University Law School, and has appeared as a commentator on legal affairs on television, radio and in print media.
With offices in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and California, Seeger Weiss LLP is home to a widely-praised team of attorneys. In addition to its qui tam practice, the Firm represents plaintiffs in a wide array of legal disciplines in the mass tort and class action fields, as well as in catastrophic personal injury and mesothelioma injury cases and in all manner of individual commercial litigation.

What a bike! Eric is cruising around Trophy Club, Texas on his Harley.  Eric installed our chopper kit with 10" over tubes, really bringing the bike together.  Eric said "Thanks Seeger Cycle, for making a great chopper kit.  Everything went together just like it was suppose to.  It's a great feeling riding this bike down the road.  People turn their heads, point, stare, complement and give the thumbs up."
