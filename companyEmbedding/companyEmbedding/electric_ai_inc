Save with Remanufactured Air Suspension Products
Monday, November 07, 2011

 Arnott is the worldwide leader in providing the automotive aftermarket with quality, affordable, completely rebuilt, remanufactured original equipment (OE) air suspension parts for many vehicles. Arnott's remanufactured air components -- such as the aftermarket 2002-2006 Cadillac Escalade air shock (Arnott Part AS-2708) -- feature new rubber air spring bladders manufactured exclusively by Goodyear. Comparable new air shocks at your local dealership cost a small fortune. But the AS-2708 recycled or remanufactured part from Arnott sells for only $204.95 plus a refundable $25.00 core charge (prepaid return label included). The Arnott design is not only more efficient, it’s also much more affordable!
 Arnott aftermarket shocks for the Escalade plug directly into the vehicle's electronic dampening system. These are not passive replacements, but will continue to use the factory dampening. Plus, many of Arnott's aftermarket products are backed by the company's exclusive Limited Lifetime Warranty.

Air Suspension Coil Spring Conversion Kits
Friday, February 19, 2016

 

Air Suspension Coil Spring Conversion Kits are a low-cost alternative to air ride suspension system replacements. Aftermarket Air Suspension Conversion Kits work by replacing your air ride parts, including your air springs, with traditional steel coil springs and passive shocks that do not use the electronic load leveling or auto damping systems in the vehicle. Converting your air suspension system with an Arnott Aftermarket Coil Spring Conversion Kit enables you to enjoy an excellent ride at an affordable price. Arnott Inc. offers a wide variety of kits. 
Coil Spring conversion kits are designed to replace the air ride in your vehicle. Coil springs specifically designed to fit the vehicle's suspension replace the air spring bags. Cars, trucks and SUVs that are converted with coil spring systems no longer need an air compressor. The solenoids, height sensors, and the control module will all be inactive, although they may still be needed to support other electronic functions.  Some of the reasons for converting to a coil spring kit include:You have an older vehicle and you don't want to continue to replacing air suspension componentsThe price of converting to coil springs is less than installing multiple new air suspension componentsYou don't tow (large trailers) or haul heavy loads and don't need the auto leveling feature of air suspensionYour air suspension has continued to be problematic and you want to end the repairsYou don't want to be stranded away from home with a faulty air ride system 
 
Arnott's coil spring conversion kits are exclusively designed for your vehicle. Arnott replacement air suspension conversion kits convert the entire vehicle to a reliable coil spring/strut suspension system. To ensure your vehicle's handling and safety, Arnott rear spring seats are CNC-machined from solid 6061-T6 aluminum alloy. No special tools are required to complete the installation. Each kit is backed by Arnott's Limited Lifetime Warranty. A detailed Installation Manual is available for download to help ensure a successful 'remove and replace' experience and Arnott also has a growing list of Installation Videos. Many Arnott Coil Conversion Kits feature Arnott's Patents-Pending exclusive Electronic Bypass Module (EBM) which installs quickly to turn off the dashboard air suspension warning lights.

Warranty Information: Arnott offers a Limited Lifetime Warranty on all coil conversion kits for customers in North  America and in the European Union. Orders outside of these regions come  with a Limited Two-Year Warranty. Arnott's Warranty is non-transferable. If a part is defective, Arnott will either replace or repair that part,  as long as it is within the Warranty period and proof of purchase is  provided. Arnott offers a Limited 30-Day Warranty on parts used in  commercial vehicles. Improper use or installation is not a  manufacturer's defect.

James Eriksen says:

After I purchased a  spring conversion kit for my 96 Lincoln Continental I am totally satisfied.  A certified mechanic charged around $300.00 labor to completely replace the air ride. I believe the labor was not to difficult,it is just that I am not allowed to work on a car because of the rules of my condominium association. The car rides perfect and I have no problems carrying extra weight including towing a motorcycle trailer. I highly recommend the Arnott coil spring conversion.

Air Suspension Coil Spring Conversion Kits
Friday, February 19, 2016

 

Air Suspension Coil Spring Conversion Kits are a low-cost alternative to air ride suspension system replacements. Aftermarket Air Suspension Conversion Kits work by replacing your air ride parts, including your air springs, with traditional steel coil springs and passive shocks that do not use the electronic load leveling or auto damping systems in the vehicle. Converting your air suspension system with an Arnott Aftermarket Coil Spring Conversion Kit enables you to enjoy an excellent ride at an affordable price. Arnott Inc. offers a wide variety of kits. 
Coil Spring conversion kits are designed to replace the air ride in your vehicle. Coil springs specifically designed to fit the vehicle's suspension replace the air spring bags. Cars, trucks and SUVs that are converted with coil spring systems no longer need an air compressor. The solenoids, height sensors, and the control module will all be inactive, although they may still be needed to support other electronic functions.  Some of the reasons for converting to a coil spring kit include:You have an older vehicle and you don't want to continue to replacing air suspension componentsThe price of converting to coil springs is less than installing multiple new air suspension componentsYou don't tow (large trailers) or haul heavy loads and don't need the auto leveling feature of air suspensionYour air suspension has continued to be problematic and you want to end the repairsYou don't want to be stranded away from home with a faulty air ride system 
 
Arnott's coil spring conversion kits are exclusively designed for your vehicle. Arnott replacement air suspension conversion kits convert the entire vehicle to a reliable coil spring/strut suspension system. To ensure your vehicle's handling and safety, Arnott rear spring seats are CNC-machined from solid 6061-T6 aluminum alloy. No special tools are required to complete the installation. Each kit is backed by Arnott's Limited Lifetime Warranty. A detailed Installation Manual is available for download to help ensure a successful 'remove and replace' experience and Arnott also has a growing list of Installation Videos. Many Arnott Coil Conversion Kits feature Arnott's Patents-Pending exclusive Electronic Bypass Module (EBM) which installs quickly to turn off the dashboard air suspension warning lights.

James Eriksen says:

After I purchased a  spring conversion kit for my 96 Lincoln Continental I am totally satisfied.  A certified mechanic charged around $300.00 labor to completely replace the air ride. I believe the labor was not to difficult,it is just that I am not allowed to work on a car because of the rules of my condominium association. The car rides perfect and I have no problems carrying extra weight including towing a motorcycle trailer. I highly recommend the Arnott coil spring conversion.

All in all, we are very pleased with the compactors.”

“We would like to thank the great service of Compactors Inc. We currently have on board the Vertical Trash Compactor model 4500SS. It has been a tremendous help with the recycling of our trash. The machine works great and is very friendly to use. We have been using this equipment for about four of five years now. When we need parts due to this machine being used over 30 times on a daily basis, Compactors Inc. is there for logistic support and they even give credit back for certain parts. My experience working with Compactors Inc. is a very reliable company to do business with. So thank you again for the great service from the USNS Laramie (T-AO 203) crew!”

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

Mitsubishi Electric is a world leader in air conditioning systems for residential, commercial and industrial use. Challenged to create air conditioning systems that provide exemplary performance in the wide-ranging climatic conditions found throughout Japan, our engineers develop amazingly sophisticated yet durable units and systems capable of constant use under virtually any natural climatic condition on earth. Each product is an amazing feat in its own, delivering years of quiet operation, energy-efficient performance and minimum impact on the environment.







Product Lineup







Room Air Conditioners
A wide variety of indoor unit designs and outdoor unit capacities ensures the flexibility to meet the most challenging of air conditioning needs. From aesthetic wall-mounted and floor-standing designs to ceiling-recessed cassettes, abundant options are available to match virtually any interior design. Many systems are equipped with the "l-see sensor", an original Mitsubishi Electric technology that realizes better air conditioning control. This is combined with other industry-leading energy-saving and silencing technologies to produce air conditioners that provide optimum performance and room comfort wherever they are installed.













Package Air Conditioners - Mr Slim
The Mr. Slim Series of small- to medium-sized split-type room air conditioners offers the convenience of being compact yet powerful; a combination ensuring excellent performance and easy installation. Available in a variety of capacity and design combinations, the Series is ideal for creating a "best match" system for your air conditioning requirements. Inverter-based units promise industry-leading quiet operation and a high coefficient of performance (COP).













Variable Refrigerant Flow (VRF) Systems - City Multi
Mitsubishi Electric's VRF air conditioning systems offer the luxury of distributed airflow and the independent control of indoor units. Installation flexibility and a wide selection of indoor unit designs and outdoor unit capacities ensure "best match" solutions for air conditioning needs, even for the most diversified requirements. Consideration for the environment during development has led to the manufacture of powerful, compact units that consume minimal energy, have a high coefficient of performance (COP) and contribute to maximum room comfort.













Heat Pumps
Heat pump systems are capturing attention as a decisive catalyst in efforts to conserve energy. Maximizing on innovative Mitsubishi Electric technologies, it is now possible to harness atmospheric heat collected from the air and use it to provide highly efficient heating, even in cold climates. Mitsubishi Electric is expanding its capabilities in this area and currently offers a heat pump with a coefficient of performance (COP) of 4.0: 1kW of electrical energy output and 3kW of heat energy transferred from outside-air give the heat pump an impressive final heat output of 4kW.













Ventilators - Lossnay
The unique Lossnay heat-exchange technologies developed by Mitsubishi Electric help refresh a room's air while leaving temperature and humidity largely unchanged. The Lossnay core is comprised of a diaphragm constructed of specially processed paper configured into a cross-flow, plate-fin structure. The advanced heat-transfer and moisture permeability properties of the paper help maximize the recovery of heat as air is circulated through the element. The result is substantial energy savings and a more comfortable indoor environment. Lossnay ventilators can be used alone or in combination with other air conditioning/ventilation systems.













Air Curtains
To meet the needs of open-front stores and shops in shopping malls, building complexes and street-level businesses, Mitsubishi Electric developed a line-up of high-performance air curtains. These systems create a wall of air that protects the interior space from climatic temperature swings, polluted air, etc. Both quiet and powerful, our systems are an energy-efficient solution for providing enjoyable indoor environments that are clean and comfortable.













Compressors
Mitsubishi Electric manufactures a line-up of powerful rotary compressors designed to suit a variety of applications and operate smoothly even in harsh environments. Our advanced scroll compressors utilize a "Frame Compliance Mechanism (FCM)," a state-of-the-art technology that maximizes energy usage and reduces friction, thereby ensuring less vibration, higher durability and low-noise operation. Offering superlative performance and long service life, these compressors are suitable for a wide range of uses including air conditioning and heating systems.
