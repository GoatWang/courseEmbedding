            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

History[edit]
Beginning[edit]
Founded by Lee Eldas "L.E." Phillips and Frank Phillips of Bartlesville, Oklahoma, Phillips Petroleum Co. was incorporated on June 13, 1917. The new company had assets of $3 million, 27 employees and land throughout Oklahoma and Kansas. After discovery of Texas's huge Panhandle gas field in 1918 and the Hugoton Field to its north in Kansas, Phillips became increasingly involved in the rapidly developing natural gas industry. In particular, the company specialized in extracting liquids from natural gas and by 1925 was the nation's largest producer of natural gas liquids. In 1927, the company's gasoline was being tested on U.S. Highway 66 in Oklahoma, and when it turned out that the car was going 66 mph (106 km/h), which was fast at the time, the company decided to name the new fuel Phillips 66.[5]
The first Phillips 66 service station opened November 19, 1927 at 805 E. Central in Wichita, Kansas.[6] This station has been preserved by the local historical society.
Logo[edit]
The Phillips 66 shield logo, created for its link to the famous highway of the same number, was introduced in 1930 in a black and orange color scheme that would last nearly 30 years. In 1959, Phillips introduced a revised version of the shield in red, white and black, a color scheme still used by Phillips 66 Co. for the brand.

From the late 1930s until the 1960s, Phillips employed registered nurses as "highway hostesses," who made periodic and random visits to Phillips 66 stations within their regions. The women inspected station restroom facilities to ensure they were well cleaned and stocked. The highway hostesses also served as ambassadors for the company by directing motorists to suitable dining and lodging facilities. Union 76 employed similar hostesses, called the "Sparkle Corps."
Motor oil[edit]
Phillips was among the first oil companies to introduce a multi-grade motor oil, TropArtic, in 1954. Such motor oils were designed to be used year-round in automobile engines, as opposed to single grades for which different grades of motor oils were recommended to meet weather variances.
Gas stations[edit]
Phillips also had gasoline stations in Canada's western provinces of Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan under the name Pacific 66 until the late 1970s. In 1932, the 76 brand, long familiar in the western U.S., was created by Union Oil Company of California (later Unocal). In 1946, Phillips purchased the Utah-based Wasatch Oil Co., bringing the Phillips 66 brand to the northern Rocky Mountain states and the far eastern portions of Oregon and Washington. In 1966, Phillips entered the West Coast market by purchasing Tidewater Oil Co.'s refining and marketing properties in that region and rebranding all Flying A distributorships and service stations to Phillips 66.
In 1967, Phillips became the nation's second oil company, after Texaco, to sell and market gasoline in all 50 states, by opening a Phillips 66 station in Anchorage, Alaska. However, Phillips' experiment in 50-state marketing was short-lived. The company withdrew from gasoline marketing in the northeastern U.S. in 1972 (although it has been returning; for example, there is a Phillips 66 in Westport, Connecticut, Newington, Connecticut, Hadley, Massachusetts, and Exeter, New Hampshire, and the Phillips 66 owned 76 gas brand appearing in New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania), and sold the former Tidewater properties on the West Coast to The Oil & Shale Corporation (Tosco) in 1976. Today, Phillips 66 primarily operates in the Midwest and Southwest.
Mergers[edit]
Phillips 66 created a joint venture with Chevron Corporation's chemicals and plastics division in 2000, as well as, acquired ARCO Alaska Inc. from British Petroleum. It purchased Tosco, which included Circle K convenience stores and Union 76 gasoline, in 2001. The 76 brand, long familiar in the western and southern U.S., was created by Union Oil Company of California (later Unocal) in 1932.
In 2002, Phillips 66 merged with Conoco to form ConocoPhillips. The merged company continued marketing gasoline and other products under the Phillips 66, Conoco, and 76 brands. However, Phillips 66 Co. licenses the Phillips 66 brand to Suncor Energy for its Phillips 66 branded stations in Colorado.[7]
Marketing[edit]

The advertising slogan from circa 1973 until the ConocoPhillips merger was "The Performance Company," promoting not only the performance of Phillips 66 gasoline and other petroleum products, but also innovations with asphaltic materials, fertilizers and other non-automotive products. Other slogans through the years have included: "Go first-class... go Phillips 66", "The gasoline that won the West", "Good things for cars and the people who drive them", "Hard working gas", and "At Phillips 66, it's performance that counts". Their current slogan (July 2015) is "Proud To Be Here". The 2016 slogan will be "The Power of 2" after consolidation of the family of brands to just Phillips 66 and Kendall.
Phillips 66 also was a long-time supporter of PBS programming for most of the 1980s. It provided funding for shows such as A.M. Weather, The Search for Solutions, and Onstage with Judith Somogi.
Spin-off[edit]
In 2012, Phillips 66 was spun off from ConocoPhillips.
Berkshire Hathaway trade[edit]
On December 30, 2013, it was announced that Berkshire Hathaway would trade more than 19 million of its 27.2 million shares in Phillips 66 to acquire a business that makes additives that help crude oil flow through pipelines. The final number of shares will be determined when the deal actually closes.[8]
Spin-off of natural gas pipelines[edit]
On February 17, 2015, Phillips 66 sold two natural gas pipeline systems to its affiliate, Phillips 66 Partners for $1.01 billion in cash and stock.[9]
Operations[edit]
In the United States, the company operates Conoco, Phillips 66 and 76 stations. In Europe, Phillips 66 operates Jet filling stations in Austria, Denmark, Germany, Sweden and the United Kingdom. It sold its Jet stations in Belgium, the Czech Republic, Finland, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia to its Russian affiliate, Lukoil. It uses the COOP identity in Switzerland. The company is the fourth largest finished lubricants supplier in the United States.
Phillips 66 owns 15 refineries with a net crude oil capacity of 2.2 million barrels per day (350×10^3 m3/d), 10,000 branded marketing outlets, and 15,000 miles (24,000 km) of pipelines. It has 50 percent stake in DCP Midstream, LLC, a natural gas gatherers and processors with 7.2 billion cubic feet per day (200×10^6 m3/d) of processing capacity. It also owns 50 percent stake in Chevron Phillips Chemical Co.
Phillips 66 also owns a one-quarter share in the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline.[10]

Phillips 66's Los Angeles (CA), Lake Charles (LA), San Francisco (CA), and Sweeney (TX) refineries receive and process crude oil from the Amazon River Basin of South America. In 2015, the Los Angeles refinery was processing 21,512 barrels per day of Amazonian oil.
Corporate affairs[edit]
In 2012, after Phillips 66 split from ConocoPhillips, it moved its operations from the ConocoPhillips headquarters to the Pinnacle Westchase building,[14] a nine-story Class A office building located on 8.4 acres (3.4 ha) of land in Westchase, Houston.[15] This was a temporary headquarters location.[14]
In July 2016, Phillips 66 completed their move to a new permanent headquarters on a 14-acre (5.7 ha) plot of land in Westchase. The new headquarters is between Westheimer Road and Briar Forest, in close proximity to the Sam Houston Tollway. Phillips 66 purchased the land from a subsidiary of Thomas Properties Group. The architect of record is HOK.[16] The official groundbreaking was in November 2013, and the opening was completed on schedule. The 1.1 million square foot headquarters includes conference spaces, medical facilities, food service facilities, outdoor recreational space, a gymnasium with full-size basketball court, and training facilities. Irrigation of the outdoor landscaping is via a reclaimed water system. The new campus houses 2,200 workers who were spread among six different Houston locations, including the ConocoPhillips headquarters, where several hundred Phillips 66 workers had remained post spin-off.[14][17][18]
On 4 August 2015 it was announced that the company had formed a "long-term partnership" with English non-league association football club Leamington F.C.. The deal involved, amongst other things, the renaming of the club's ground from "The New Windmill Ground" to "The Phillips 66 Community Stadium."[19]

On December 30, 2013, it was announced that Berkshire Hathaway would trade more than 19 million of its 27.2 million shares in Phillips 66 to acquire a business that makes additives that help crude oil flow through pipelines. The final number of shares will be determined when the deal actually closes.[8]
Spin-off of natural gas pipelines[edit]
On February 17, 2015, Phillips 66 sold two natural gas pipeline systems to its affiliate, Phillips 66 Partners for $1.01 billion in cash and stock.[9]
Operations[edit]
In the United States, the company operates Conoco, Phillips 66 and 76 stations. In Europe, Phillips 66 operates Jet filling stations in Austria, Denmark, Germany, Sweden and the United Kingdom. It sold its Jet stations in Belgium, the Czech Republic, Finland, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia to its Russian affiliate, Lukoil. It uses the COOP identity in Switzerland. The company is the fourth largest finished lubricants supplier in the United States.
Phillips 66 owns 15 refineries with a net crude oil capacity of 2.2 million barrels per day (350×10^3 m3/d), 10,000 branded marketing outlets, and 15,000 miles (24,000 km) of pipelines. It has 50 percent stake in DCP Midstream, LLC, a natural gas gatherers and processors with 7.2 billion cubic feet per day (200×10^6 m3/d) of processing capacity. It also owns 50 percent stake in Chevron Phillips Chemical Co.
Phillips 66 also owns a one-quarter share in the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline.[10]

Phillips 66's Los Angeles (CA), Lake Charles (LA), San Francisco (CA), and Sweeney (TX) refineries receive and process crude oil from the Amazon River Basin of South America. In 2015, the Los Angeles refinery was processing 21,512 barrels per day of Amazonian oil.
Corporate affairs[edit]
In 2012, after Phillips 66 split from ConocoPhillips, it moved its operations from the ConocoPhillips headquarters to the Pinnacle Westchase building,[14] a nine-story Class A office building located on 8.4 acres (3.4 ha) of land in Westchase, Houston.[15] This was a temporary headquarters location.[14]
In July 2016, Phillips 66 completed their move to a new permanent headquarters on a 14-acre (5.7 ha) plot of land in Westchase. The new headquarters is between Westheimer Road and Briar Forest, in close proximity to the Sam Houston Tollway. Phillips 66 purchased the land from a subsidiary of Thomas Properties Group. The architect of record is HOK.[16] The official groundbreaking was in November 2013, and the opening was completed on schedule. The 1.1 million square foot headquarters includes conference spaces, medical facilities, food service facilities, outdoor recreational space, a gymnasium with full-size basketball court, and training facilities. Irrigation of the outdoor landscaping is via a reclaimed water system. The new campus houses 2,200 workers who were spread among six different Houston locations, including the ConocoPhillips headquarters, where several hundred Phillips 66 workers had remained post spin-off.[14][17][18]
On 4 August 2015 it was announced that the company had formed a "long-term partnership" with English non-league association football club Leamington F.C.. The deal involved, amongst other things, the renaming of the club's ground from "The New Windmill Ground" to "The Phillips 66 Community Stadium."[19]

The Phillips 66 Company (NYSE: PSX) is an American multinational energy company headquartered in Westchase, Houston, Texas. It debuted as an independent energy company when ConocoPhillips executed a spin-off of its downstream and midstream assets. Taking its name from the 1927 "Phillips 66" trademark of ConocoPhillips predecessor Phillips Petroleum Company, Phillips 66 began trading on the New York Stock Exchange on May 1, 2012, under the ticker PSX. The company is engaged in producing natural gas liquids (NGL) and petrochemicals. The company has approximately 14,000 employees worldwide and is active in more than 65 countries.[2] Phillips 66 is ranked No. 30 on the Fortune 500 list and No. 74 on the Fortune Global 500 list as of 2016[update].[3][4]

History[edit]
Beginning[edit]
Founded by Lee Eldas "L.E." Phillips and Frank Phillips of Bartlesville, Oklahoma, Phillips Petroleum Co. was incorporated on June 13, 1917. The new company had assets of $3 million, 27 employees and land throughout Oklahoma and Kansas. After discovery of Texas's huge Panhandle gas field in 1918 and the Hugoton Field to its north in Kansas, Phillips became increasingly involved in the rapidly developing natural gas industry. In particular, the company specialized in extracting liquids from natural gas and by 1925 was the nation's largest producer of natural gas liquids. In 1927, the company's gasoline was being tested on U.S. Highway 66 in Oklahoma, and when it turned out that the car was going 66 mph (106 km/h), which was fast at the time, the company decided to name the new fuel Phillips 66.[5]
The first Phillips 66 service station opened November 19, 1927 at 805 E. Central in Wichita, Kansas.[6] This station has been preserved by the local historical society.
Logo[edit]
The Phillips 66 shield logo, created for its link to the famous highway of the same number, was introduced in 1930 in a black and orange color scheme that would last nearly 30 years. In 1959, Phillips introduced a revised version of the shield in red, white and black, a color scheme still used by Phillips 66 Co. for the brand.

From the late 1930s until the 1960s, Phillips employed registered nurses as "highway hostesses," who made periodic and random visits to Phillips 66 stations within their regions. The women inspected station restroom facilities to ensure they were well cleaned and stocked. The highway hostesses also served as ambassadors for the company by directing motorists to suitable dining and lodging facilities. Union 76 employed similar hostesses, called the "Sparkle Corps."
Motor oil[edit]
Phillips was among the first oil companies to introduce a multi-grade motor oil, TropArtic, in 1954. Such motor oils were designed to be used year-round in automobile engines, as opposed to single grades for which different grades of motor oils were recommended to meet weather variances.
Gas stations[edit]
Phillips also had gasoline stations in Canada's western provinces of Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan under the name Pacific 66 until the late 1970s. In 1932, the 76 brand, long familiar in the western U.S., was created by Union Oil Company of California (later Unocal). In 1946, Phillips purchased the Utah-based Wasatch Oil Co., bringing the Phillips 66 brand to the northern Rocky Mountain states and the far eastern portions of Oregon and Washington. In 1966, Phillips entered the West Coast market by purchasing Tidewater Oil Co.'s refining and marketing properties in that region and rebranding all Flying A distributorships and service stations to Phillips 66.
In 1967, Phillips became the nation's second oil company, after Texaco, to sell and market gasoline in all 50 states, by opening a Phillips 66 station in Anchorage, Alaska. However, Phillips' experiment in 50-state marketing was short-lived. The company withdrew from gasoline marketing in the northeastern U.S. in 1972 (although it has been returning; for example, there is a Phillips 66 in Westport, Connecticut, Newington, Connecticut, Hadley, Massachusetts, and Exeter, New Hampshire, and the Phillips 66 owned 76 gas brand appearing in New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania), and sold the former Tidewater properties on the West Coast to The Oil & Shale Corporation (Tosco) in 1976. Today, Phillips 66 primarily operates in the Midwest and Southwest.
Mergers[edit]
Phillips 66 created a joint venture with Chevron Corporation's chemicals and plastics division in 2000, as well as, acquired ARCO Alaska Inc. from British Petroleum. It purchased Tosco, which included Circle K convenience stores and Union 76 gasoline, in 2001. The 76 brand, long familiar in the western and southern U.S., was created by Union Oil Company of California (later Unocal) in 1932.
In 2002, Phillips 66 merged with Conoco to form ConocoPhillips. The merged company continued marketing gasoline and other products under the Phillips 66, Conoco, and 76 brands. However, Phillips 66 Co. licenses the Phillips 66 brand to Suncor Energy for its Phillips 66 branded stations in Colorado.[7]
Marketing[edit]

The advertising slogan from circa 1973 until the ConocoPhillips merger was "The Performance Company," promoting not only the performance of Phillips 66 gasoline and other petroleum products, but also innovations with asphaltic materials, fertilizers and other non-automotive products. Other slogans through the years have included: "Go first-class... go Phillips 66", "The gasoline that won the West", "Good things for cars and the people who drive them", "Hard working gas", and "At Phillips 66, it's performance that counts". Their current slogan (July 2015) is "Proud To Be Here". The 2016 slogan will be "The Power of 2" after consolidation of the family of brands to just Phillips 66 and Kendall.
Phillips 66 also was a long-time supporter of PBS programming for most of the 1980s. It provided funding for shows such as A.M. Weather, The Search for Solutions, and Onstage with Judith Somogi.
Spin-off[edit]
In 2012, Phillips 66 was spun off from ConocoPhillips.
Berkshire Hathaway trade[edit]
On December 30, 2013, it was announced that Berkshire Hathaway would trade more than 19 million of its 27.2 million shares in Phillips 66 to acquire a business that makes additives that help crude oil flow through pipelines. The final number of shares will be determined when the deal actually closes.[8]
Spin-off of natural gas pipelines[edit]
On February 17, 2015, Phillips 66 sold two natural gas pipeline systems to its affiliate, Phillips 66 Partners for $1.01 billion in cash and stock.[9]
Operations[edit]
In the United States, the company operates Conoco, Phillips 66 and 76 stations. In Europe, Phillips 66 operates Jet filling stations in Austria, Denmark, Germany, Sweden and the United Kingdom. It sold its Jet stations in Belgium, the Czech Republic, Finland, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia to its Russian affiliate, Lukoil. It uses the COOP identity in Switzerland. The company is the fourth largest finished lubricants supplier in the United States.
Phillips 66 owns 15 refineries with a net crude oil capacity of 2.2 million barrels per day (350×10^3 m3/d), 10,000 branded marketing outlets, and 15,000 miles (24,000 km) of pipelines. It has 50 percent stake in DCP Midstream, LLC, a natural gas gatherers and processors with 7.2 billion cubic feet per day (200×10^6 m3/d) of processing capacity. It also owns 50 percent stake in Chevron Phillips Chemical Co.
Phillips 66 also owns a one-quarter share in the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline.[10]

History[edit]
Beginning[edit]
Founded by Lee Eldas "L.E." Phillips and Frank Phillips of Bartlesville, Oklahoma, Phillips Petroleum Co. was incorporated on June 13, 1917. The new company had assets of $3 million, 27 employees and land throughout Oklahoma and Kansas. After discovery of Texas's huge Panhandle gas field in 1918 and the Hugoton Field to its north in Kansas, Phillips became increasingly involved in the rapidly developing natural gas industry. In particular, the company specialized in extracting liquids from natural gas and by 1925 was the nation's largest producer of natural gas liquids. In 1927, the company's gasoline was being tested on U.S. Highway 66 in Oklahoma, and when it turned out that the car was going 66 mph (106 km/h), which was fast at the time, the company decided to name the new fuel Phillips 66.[5]
The first Phillips 66 service station opened November 19, 1927 at 805 E. Central in Wichita, Kansas.[6] This station has been preserved by the local historical society.
Logo[edit]
The Phillips 66 shield logo, created for its link to the famous highway of the same number, was introduced in 1930 in a black and orange color scheme that would last nearly 30 years. In 1959, Phillips introduced a revised version of the shield in red, white and black, a color scheme still used by Phillips 66 Co. for the brand.

From the late 1930s until the 1960s, Phillips employed registered nurses as "highway hostesses," who made periodic and random visits to Phillips 66 stations within their regions. The women inspected station restroom facilities to ensure they were well cleaned and stocked. The highway hostesses also served as ambassadors for the company by directing motorists to suitable dining and lodging facilities. Union 76 employed similar hostesses, called the "Sparkle Corps."
Motor oil[edit]
Phillips was among the first oil companies to introduce a multi-grade motor oil, TropArtic, in 1954. Such motor oils were designed to be used year-round in automobile engines, as opposed to single grades for which different grades of motor oils were recommended to meet weather variances.
Gas stations[edit]
Phillips also had gasoline stations in Canada's western provinces of Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan under the name Pacific 66 until the late 1970s. In 1932, the 76 brand, long familiar in the western U.S., was created by Union Oil Company of California (later Unocal). In 1946, Phillips purchased the Utah-based Wasatch Oil Co., bringing the Phillips 66 brand to the northern Rocky Mountain states and the far eastern portions of Oregon and Washington. In 1966, Phillips entered the West Coast market by purchasing Tidewater Oil Co.'s refining and marketing properties in that region and rebranding all Flying A distributorships and service stations to Phillips 66.
In 1967, Phillips became the nation's second oil company, after Texaco, to sell and market gasoline in all 50 states, by opening a Phillips 66 station in Anchorage, Alaska. However, Phillips' experiment in 50-state marketing was short-lived. The company withdrew from gasoline marketing in the northeastern U.S. in 1972 (although it has been returning; for example, there is a Phillips 66 in Westport, Connecticut, Newington, Connecticut, Hadley, Massachusetts, and Exeter, New Hampshire, and the Phillips 66 owned 76 gas brand appearing in New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania), and sold the former Tidewater properties on the West Coast to The Oil & Shale Corporation (Tosco) in 1976. Today, Phillips 66 primarily operates in the Midwest and Southwest.
Mergers[edit]
Phillips 66 created a joint venture with Chevron Corporation's chemicals and plastics division in 2000, as well as, acquired ARCO Alaska Inc. from British Petroleum. It purchased Tosco, which included Circle K convenience stores and Union 76 gasoline, in 2001. The 76 brand, long familiar in the western and southern U.S., was created by Union Oil Company of California (later Unocal) in 1932.
In 2002, Phillips 66 merged with Conoco to form ConocoPhillips. The merged company continued marketing gasoline and other products under the Phillips 66, Conoco, and 76 brands. However, Phillips 66 Co. licenses the Phillips 66 brand to Suncor Energy for its Phillips 66 branded stations in Colorado.[7]
Marketing[edit]

The advertising slogan from circa 1973 until the ConocoPhillips merger was "The Performance Company," promoting not only the performance of Phillips 66 gasoline and other petroleum products, but also innovations with asphaltic materials, fertilizers and other non-automotive products. Other slogans through the years have included: "Go first-class... go Phillips 66", "The gasoline that won the West", "Good things for cars and the people who drive them", "Hard working gas", and "At Phillips 66, it's performance that counts". Their current slogan (July 2015) is "Proud To Be Here". The 2016 slogan will be "The Power of 2" after consolidation of the family of brands to just Phillips 66 and Kendall.
Phillips 66 also was a long-time supporter of PBS programming for most of the 1980s. It provided funding for shows such as A.M. Weather, The Search for Solutions, and Onstage with Judith Somogi.
Spin-off[edit]
In 2012, Phillips 66 was spun off from ConocoPhillips.
Berkshire Hathaway trade[edit]
On December 30, 2013, it was announced that Berkshire Hathaway would trade more than 19 million of its 27.2 million shares in Phillips 66 to acquire a business that makes additives that help crude oil flow through pipelines. The final number of shares will be determined when the deal actually closes.[8]
Spin-off of natural gas pipelines[edit]
On February 17, 2015, Phillips 66 sold two natural gas pipeline systems to its affiliate, Phillips 66 Partners for $1.01 billion in cash and stock.[9]
Operations[edit]
In the United States, the company operates Conoco, Phillips 66 and 76 stations. In Europe, Phillips 66 operates Jet filling stations in Austria, Denmark, Germany, Sweden and the United Kingdom. It sold its Jet stations in Belgium, the Czech Republic, Finland, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia to its Russian affiliate, Lukoil. It uses the COOP identity in Switzerland. The company is the fourth largest finished lubricants supplier in the United States.
Phillips 66 owns 15 refineries with a net crude oil capacity of 2.2 million barrels per day (350×10^3 m3/d), 10,000 branded marketing outlets, and 15,000 miles (24,000 km) of pipelines. It has 50 percent stake in DCP Midstream, LLC, a natural gas gatherers and processors with 7.2 billion cubic feet per day (200×10^6 m3/d) of processing capacity. It also owns 50 percent stake in Chevron Phillips Chemical Co.
Phillips 66 also owns a one-quarter share in the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline.[10]

Phillips 66's Los Angeles (CA), Lake Charles (LA), San Francisco (CA), and Sweeney (TX) refineries receive and process crude oil from the Amazon River Basin of South America. In 2015, the Los Angeles refinery was processing 21,512 barrels per day of Amazonian oil.
Corporate affairs[edit]
In 2012, after Phillips 66 split from ConocoPhillips, it moved its operations from the ConocoPhillips headquarters to the Pinnacle Westchase building,[14] a nine-story Class A office building located on 8.4 acres (3.4 ha) of land in Westchase, Houston.[15] This was a temporary headquarters location.[14]
In July 2016, Phillips 66 completed their move to a new permanent headquarters on a 14-acre (5.7 ha) plot of land in Westchase. The new headquarters is between Westheimer Road and Briar Forest, in close proximity to the Sam Houston Tollway. Phillips 66 purchased the land from a subsidiary of Thomas Properties Group. The architect of record is HOK.[16] The official groundbreaking was in November 2013, and the opening was completed on schedule. The 1.1 million square foot headquarters includes conference spaces, medical facilities, food service facilities, outdoor recreational space, a gymnasium with full-size basketball court, and training facilities. Irrigation of the outdoor landscaping is via a reclaimed water system. The new campus houses 2,200 workers who were spread among six different Houston locations, including the ConocoPhillips headquarters, where several hundred Phillips 66 workers had remained post spin-off.[14][17][18]
On 4 August 2015 it was announced that the company had formed a "long-term partnership" with English non-league association football club Leamington F.C.. The deal involved, amongst other things, the renaming of the club's ground from "The New Windmill Ground" to "The Phillips 66 Community Stadium."[19]

							Company Overview
Page Content


















Phillips 66 is a diversified energy manufacturing and logistics company with a portfolio of integrated businesses: Midstream, Chemicals, Refining, and Marketing and Specialties. Our company processes, transports, stores and markets fuels and products globally. Phillips 66 Partners LP, our master limited partnership, is an integral part of the portfolio.

A deep understanding of these businesses enables the company to grow and to allocate capital to the best opportunities. Headquartered in Houston, Phillips 66 has 14,800 employees committed to safety and operating excellence. As of Dec. 31, 2016, we had $52 billion in assets. The company’s stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol PSX, while Phillips 66 Partners trades under the ticker symbol PSXP.
Strategic Priorities
The 14,800 employees of Phillips 66 are executing the strategy that has guided the company since its creation in 2012: maintain strong operating excellence, deliver profitable growth, enhance returns on capital, grow shareholder distributions and develop its employees to sustain a high-performing organization.

Maintain Strong Operating ExcellenceFor Phillips 66, operating excellence encompasses personal safety, process safety, reliability, cost efficiency and environmental stewardship. Safety is a core value. The company’s safety record in 2015 tied for its best ever. Phillips 66 is determined to be the safest and most reliable company in its industry.
By maintaining strong operating excellence, we protect each other, contribute to the well-being of the communities that support us, deliver quality products to customers and enhance shareholder value.

Deliver Profitable GrowthWe are reshaping the company’s portfolio by investing capital in higher-valued businesses. We continuously test our capital allocation decisions through a range of economic and market scenarios.
Our 2016 consolidated capital budget is $3.9 billion, consisting of $2.6 billion of growth capital and $1.3 billion of sustaining capital. Most of the growth capital will fund infrastructure projects in our Midstream segment. The sustaining capital will focus on maintaining high levels of safety and reliability in our Refining business. Our 2016 capital budget excludes our portion of planned capital spending by joint ventures DCP Midstream, CPChem and WRB totaling $1.4 billion, all of which are expected to be self-funded.
The Midstream segment is at the core of our growth plans. The segment consists of natural gas liquids (NGL) and transportation businesses, Phillips 66 Partners, and our 50 percent interest in DCP Midstream.
Through our 50-50 joint venture with Chevron, CPChem, we continue to invest in our high-return Chemicals segment. CPChem is one of the world’s leading petrochemical companies, and its U.S. Gulf Coast petrochemicals project is approximately 80 percent complete with startup planned for the second half of 2017.

Enhance Returns on CapitalA disciplined capital allocation process ensures that we focus investments in projects that generate competitive returns throughout the business cycle. Phillips 66’s Refining segment is a significant competitor in the domestic fuels industry, with 11 of its 13 refineries located in the United States.
Through planned operating enhancements, we expect to drive efficiency and improve returns. The majority of the improvement will come from higher product yields and a focus on controllable costs. In early 2015, we sold the Bantry Bay terminal, a storage complex located in Ireland. And in August 2016, we announced the sale of our Whitegate Refinery, located near Cork, Ireland. The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of 2016.

Grow Shareholder DistributionsDuring 2015, we increased the dividend by 12 percent and returned $2.7 billion of capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Phillips 66 is committed to paying a regular dividend that is secure, has a competitive yield and increases annually. In May 2016, Phillips 66 announced a 12.5 percent increase in the quarterly dividend, the sixth increase since the company’s formation. From the company’s 2012 inception to June 30, 2016, we have returned $12.3 billion of capital to shareholders.

Build on Phillips 66's High-Performing OrganizationOur purpose is to provide energy and improve lives, and we are governed by three strongly held values: safety, honor and commitment. Our employees are committed to building capability, pursuing excellence and doing the right thing. We strive to attract, train, develop and retain individuals with the knowledge and skills to implement our business strategy and the character to live our values.

At Phillips 66 Aviation, our dedication to innovation continues today. We remain an industry leader, providing forward-thinking programs and quality fuel for both the flying community and our vast network of high-quality FBOs.This site contains information about Phillips 66 Aviation, its programs and its lubricants, as well as links to additional aviation resources.

The Phillips 66 Company (NYSE: PSX) is an American multinational energy company headquartered in Westchase, Houston, Texas. It debuted as an independent energy company when ConocoPhillips executed a spin-off of its downstream and midstream assets. Taking its name from the 1927 "Phillips 66" trademark of ConocoPhillips predecessor Phillips Petroleum Company, Phillips 66 began trading on the New York Stock Exchange on May 1, 2012, under the ticker PSX. The company is engaged in producing natural gas liquids (NGL) and petrochemicals. The company has approximately 14,000 employees worldwide and is active in more than 65 countries.[2] Phillips 66 is ranked No. 30 on the Fortune 500 list and No. 74 on the Fortune Global 500 list as of 2016[update].[3][4]

History[edit]
Beginning[edit]
Founded by Lee Eldas "L.E." Phillips and Frank Phillips of Bartlesville, Oklahoma, Phillips Petroleum Co. was incorporated on June 13, 1917. The new company had assets of $3 million, 27 employees and land throughout Oklahoma and Kansas. After discovery of Texas's huge Panhandle gas field in 1918 and the Hugoton Field to its north in Kansas, Phillips became increasingly involved in the rapidly developing natural gas industry. In particular, the company specialized in extracting liquids from natural gas and by 1925 was the nation's largest producer of natural gas liquids. In 1927, the company's gasoline was being tested on U.S. Highway 66 in Oklahoma, and when it turned out that the car was going 66 mph (106 km/h), which was fast at the time, the company decided to name the new fuel Phillips 66.[5]
The first Phillips 66 service station opened November 19, 1927 at 805 E. Central in Wichita, Kansas.[6] This station has been preserved by the local historical society.
Logo[edit]
The Phillips 66 shield logo, created for its link to the famous highway of the same number, was introduced in 1930 in a black and orange color scheme that would last nearly 30 years. In 1959, Phillips introduced a revised version of the shield in red, white and black, a color scheme still used by Phillips 66 Co. for the brand.

From the late 1930s until the 1960s, Phillips employed registered nurses as "highway hostesses," who made periodic and random visits to Phillips 66 stations within their regions. The women inspected station restroom facilities to ensure they were well cleaned and stocked. The highway hostesses also served as ambassadors for the company by directing motorists to suitable dining and lodging facilities. Union 76 employed similar hostesses, called the "Sparkle Corps."
Motor oil[edit]
Phillips was among the first oil companies to introduce a multi-grade motor oil, TropArtic, in 1954. Such motor oils were designed to be used year-round in automobile engines, as opposed to single grades for which different grades of motor oils were recommended to meet weather variances.
Gas stations[edit]
Phillips also had gasoline stations in Canada's western provinces of Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan under the name Pacific 66 until the late 1970s. In 1932, the 76 brand, long familiar in the western U.S., was created by Union Oil Company of California (later Unocal). In 1946, Phillips purchased the Utah-based Wasatch Oil Co., bringing the Phillips 66 brand to the northern Rocky Mountain states and the far eastern portions of Oregon and Washington. In 1966, Phillips entered the West Coast market by purchasing Tidewater Oil Co.'s refining and marketing properties in that region and rebranding all Flying A distributorships and service stations to Phillips 66.
In 1967, Phillips became the nation's second oil company, after Texaco, to sell and market gasoline in all 50 states, by opening a Phillips 66 station in Anchorage, Alaska. However, Phillips' experiment in 50-state marketing was short-lived. The company withdrew from gasoline marketing in the northeastern U.S. in 1972 (although it has been returning; for example, there is a Phillips 66 in Westport, Connecticut, Newington, Connecticut, Hadley, Massachusetts, and Exeter, New Hampshire, and the Phillips 66 owned 76 gas brand appearing in New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania), and sold the former Tidewater properties on the West Coast to The Oil & Shale Corporation (Tosco) in 1976. Today, Phillips 66 primarily operates in the Midwest and Southwest.
Mergers[edit]
Phillips 66 created a joint venture with Chevron Corporation's chemicals and plastics division in 2000, as well as, acquired ARCO Alaska Inc. from British Petroleum. It purchased Tosco, which included Circle K convenience stores and Union 76 gasoline, in 2001. The 76 brand, long familiar in the western and southern U.S., was created by Union Oil Company of California (later Unocal) in 1932.
In 2002, Phillips 66 merged with Conoco to form ConocoPhillips. The merged company continued marketing gasoline and other products under the Phillips 66, Conoco, and 76 brands. However, Phillips 66 Co. licenses the Phillips 66 brand to Suncor Energy for its Phillips 66 branded stations in Colorado.[7]
Marketing[edit]

The advertising slogan from circa 1973 until the ConocoPhillips merger was "The Performance Company," promoting not only the performance of Phillips 66 gasoline and other petroleum products, but also innovations with asphaltic materials, fertilizers and other non-automotive products. Other slogans through the years have included: "Go first-class... go Phillips 66", "The gasoline that won the West", "Good things for cars and the people who drive them", "Hard working gas", and "At Phillips 66, it's performance that counts". Their current slogan (July 2015) is "Proud To Be Here". The 2016 slogan will be "The Power of 2" after consolidation of the family of brands to just Phillips 66 and Kendall.
Phillips 66 also was a long-time supporter of PBS programming for most of the 1980s. It provided funding for shows such as A.M. Weather, The Search for Solutions, and Onstage with Judith Somogi.
Spin-off[edit]
In 2012, Phillips 66 was spun off from ConocoPhillips.
Berkshire Hathaway trade[edit]
On December 30, 2013, it was announced that Berkshire Hathaway would trade more than 19 million of its 27.2 million shares in Phillips 66 to acquire a business that makes additives that help crude oil flow through pipelines. The final number of shares will be determined when the deal actually closes.[8]
Spin-off of natural gas pipelines[edit]
On February 17, 2015, Phillips 66 sold two natural gas pipeline systems to its affiliate, Phillips 66 Partners for $1.01 billion in cash and stock.[9]
Operations[edit]
In the United States, the company operates Conoco, Phillips 66 and 76 stations. In Europe, Phillips 66 operates Jet filling stations in Austria, Denmark, Germany, Sweden and the United Kingdom. It sold its Jet stations in Belgium, the Czech Republic, Finland, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia to its Russian affiliate, Lukoil. It uses the COOP identity in Switzerland. The company is the fourth largest finished lubricants supplier in the United States.
Phillips 66 owns 15 refineries with a net crude oil capacity of 2.2 million barrels per day (350×10^3 m3/d), 10,000 branded marketing outlets, and 15,000 miles (24,000 km) of pipelines. It has 50 percent stake in DCP Midstream, LLC, a natural gas gatherers and processors with 7.2 billion cubic feet per day (200×10^6 m3/d) of processing capacity. It also owns 50 percent stake in Chevron Phillips Chemical Co.
Phillips 66 also owns a one-quarter share in the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline.[10]

Phillips 66's Los Angeles (CA), Lake Charles (LA), San Francisco (CA), and Sweeney (TX) refineries receive and process crude oil from the Amazon River Basin of South America. In 2015, the Los Angeles refinery was processing 21,512 barrels per day of Amazonian oil.
Corporate affairs[edit]
In 2012, after Phillips 66 split from ConocoPhillips, it moved its operations from the ConocoPhillips headquarters to the Pinnacle Westchase building,[14] a nine-story Class A office building located on 8.4 acres (3.4 ha) of land in Westchase, Houston.[15] This was a temporary headquarters location.[14]
In July 2016, Phillips 66 completed their move to a new permanent headquarters on a 14-acre (5.7 ha) plot of land in Westchase. The new headquarters is between Westheimer Road and Briar Forest, in close proximity to the Sam Houston Tollway. Phillips 66 purchased the land from a subsidiary of Thomas Properties Group. The architect of record is HOK.[16] The official groundbreaking was in November 2013, and the opening was completed on schedule. The 1.1 million square foot headquarters includes conference spaces, medical facilities, food service facilities, outdoor recreational space, a gymnasium with full-size basketball court, and training facilities. Irrigation of the outdoor landscaping is via a reclaimed water system. The new campus houses 2,200 workers who were spread among six different Houston locations, including the ConocoPhillips headquarters, where several hundred Phillips 66 workers had remained post spin-off.[14][17][18]
On 4 August 2015 it was announced that the company had formed a "long-term partnership" with English non-league association football club Leamington F.C.. The deal involved, amongst other things, the renaming of the club's ground from "The New Windmill Ground" to "The Phillips 66 Community Stadium."[19]

The Phillips 66 Company (NYSE: PSX) is an American multinational energy company headquartered in Westchase, Houston, Texas. It debuted as an independent energy company when ConocoPhillips executed a spin-off of its downstream and midstream assets. Taking its name from the 1927 "Phillips 66" trademark of ConocoPhillips predecessor Phillips Petroleum Company, Phillips 66 began trading on the New York Stock Exchange on May 1, 2012, under the ticker PSX. The company is engaged in producing natural gas liquids (NGL) and petrochemicals. The company has approximately 14,000 employees worldwide and is active in more than 65 countries.[2] Phillips 66 is ranked No. 30 on the Fortune 500 list and No. 74 on the Fortune Global 500 list as of 2016[update].[3][4]

History[edit]
Beginning[edit]
Founded by Lee Eldas "L.E." Phillips and Frank Phillips of Bartlesville, Oklahoma, Phillips Petroleum Co. was incorporated on June 13, 1917. The new company had assets of $3 million, 27 employees and land throughout Oklahoma and Kansas. After discovery of Texas's huge Panhandle gas field in 1918 and the Hugoton Field to its north in Kansas, Phillips became increasingly involved in the rapidly developing natural gas industry. In particular, the company specialized in extracting liquids from natural gas and by 1925 was the nation's largest producer of natural gas liquids. In 1927, the company's gasoline was being tested on U.S. Highway 66 in Oklahoma, and when it turned out that the car was going 66 mph (106 km/h), which was fast at the time, the company decided to name the new fuel Phillips 66.[5]
The first Phillips 66 service station opened November 19, 1927 at 805 E. Central in Wichita, Kansas.[6] This station has been preserved by the local historical society.
Logo[edit]
The Phillips 66 shield logo, created for its link to the famous highway of the same number, was introduced in 1930 in a black and orange color scheme that would last nearly 30 years. In 1959, Phillips introduced a revised version of the shield in red, white and black, a color scheme still used by Phillips 66 Co. for the brand.

From the late 1930s until the 1960s, Phillips employed registered nurses as "highway hostesses," who made periodic and random visits to Phillips 66 stations within their regions. The women inspected station restroom facilities to ensure they were well cleaned and stocked. The highway hostesses also served as ambassadors for the company by directing motorists to suitable dining and lodging facilities. Union 76 employed similar hostesses, called the "Sparkle Corps."
Motor oil[edit]
Phillips was among the first oil companies to introduce a multi-grade motor oil, TropArtic, in 1954. Such motor oils were designed to be used year-round in automobile engines, as opposed to single grades for which different grades of motor oils were recommended to meet weather variances.
Gas stations[edit]
Phillips also had gasoline stations in Canada's western provinces of Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan under the name Pacific 66 until the late 1970s. In 1932, the 76 brand, long familiar in the western U.S., was created by Union Oil Company of California (later Unocal). In 1946, Phillips purchased the Utah-based Wasatch Oil Co., bringing the Phillips 66 brand to the northern Rocky Mountain states and the far eastern portions of Oregon and Washington. In 1966, Phillips entered the West Coast market by purchasing Tidewater Oil Co.'s refining and marketing properties in that region and rebranding all Flying A distributorships and service stations to Phillips 66.
In 1967, Phillips became the nation's second oil company, after Texaco, to sell and market gasoline in all 50 states, by opening a Phillips 66 station in Anchorage, Alaska. However, Phillips' experiment in 50-state marketing was short-lived. The company withdrew from gasoline marketing in the northeastern U.S. in 1972 (although it has been returning; for example, there is a Phillips 66 in Westport, Connecticut, Newington, Connecticut, Hadley, Massachusetts, and Exeter, New Hampshire, and the Phillips 66 owned 76 gas brand appearing in New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania), and sold the former Tidewater properties on the West Coast to The Oil & Shale Corporation (Tosco) in 1976. Today, Phillips 66 primarily operates in the Midwest and Southwest.
Mergers[edit]
Phillips 66 created a joint venture with Chevron Corporation's chemicals and plastics division in 2000, as well as, acquired ARCO Alaska Inc. from British Petroleum. It purchased Tosco, which included Circle K convenience stores and Union 76 gasoline, in 2001. The 76 brand, long familiar in the western and southern U.S., was created by Union Oil Company of California (later Unocal) in 1932.
In 2002, Phillips 66 merged with Conoco to form ConocoPhillips. The merged company continued marketing gasoline and other products under the Phillips 66, Conoco, and 76 brands. However, Phillips 66 Co. licenses the Phillips 66 brand to Suncor Energy for its Phillips 66 branded stations in Colorado.[7]
Marketing[edit]

The advertising slogan from circa 1973 until the ConocoPhillips merger was "The Performance Company," promoting not only the performance of Phillips 66 gasoline and other petroleum products, but also innovations with asphaltic materials, fertilizers and other non-automotive products. Other slogans through the years have included: "Go first-class... go Phillips 66", "The gasoline that won the West", "Good things for cars and the people who drive them", "Hard working gas", and "At Phillips 66, it's performance that counts". Their current slogan (July 2015) is "Proud To Be Here". The 2016 slogan will be "The Power of 2" after consolidation of the family of brands to just Phillips 66 and Kendall.
Phillips 66 also was a long-time supporter of PBS programming for most of the 1980s. It provided funding for shows such as A.M. Weather, The Search for Solutions, and Onstage with Judith Somogi.
Spin-off[edit]
In 2012, Phillips 66 was spun off from ConocoPhillips.
Berkshire Hathaway trade[edit]
On December 30, 2013, it was announced that Berkshire Hathaway would trade more than 19 million of its 27.2 million shares in Phillips 66 to acquire a business that makes additives that help crude oil flow through pipelines. The final number of shares will be determined when the deal actually closes.[8]
Spin-off of natural gas pipelines[edit]
On February 17, 2015, Phillips 66 sold two natural gas pipeline systems to its affiliate, Phillips 66 Partners for $1.01 billion in cash and stock.[9]
Operations[edit]
In the United States, the company operates Conoco, Phillips 66 and 76 stations. In Europe, Phillips 66 operates Jet filling stations in Austria, Denmark, Germany, Sweden and the United Kingdom. It sold its Jet stations in Belgium, the Czech Republic, Finland, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia to its Russian affiliate, Lukoil. It uses the COOP identity in Switzerland. The company is the fourth largest finished lubricants supplier in the United States.
Phillips 66 owns 15 refineries with a net crude oil capacity of 2.2 million barrels per day (350×10^3 m3/d), 10,000 branded marketing outlets, and 15,000 miles (24,000 km) of pipelines. It has 50 percent stake in DCP Midstream, LLC, a natural gas gatherers and processors with 7.2 billion cubic feet per day (200×10^6 m3/d) of processing capacity. It also owns 50 percent stake in Chevron Phillips Chemical Co.
Phillips 66 also owns a one-quarter share in the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline.[10]

Phillips 66's Los Angeles (CA), Lake Charles (LA), San Francisco (CA), and Sweeney (TX) refineries receive and process crude oil from the Amazon River Basin of South America. In 2015, the Los Angeles refinery was processing 21,512 barrels per day of Amazonian oil.
Corporate affairs[edit]
In 2012, after Phillips 66 split from ConocoPhillips, it moved its operations from the ConocoPhillips headquarters to the Pinnacle Westchase building,[14] a nine-story Class A office building located on 8.4 acres (3.4 ha) of land in Westchase, Houston.[15] This was a temporary headquarters location.[14]
In July 2016, Phillips 66 completed their move to a new permanent headquarters on a 14-acre (5.7 ha) plot of land in Westchase. The new headquarters is between Westheimer Road and Briar Forest, in close proximity to the Sam Houston Tollway. Phillips 66 purchased the land from a subsidiary of Thomas Properties Group. The architect of record is HOK.[16] The official groundbreaking was in November 2013, and the opening was completed on schedule. The 1.1 million square foot headquarters includes conference spaces, medical facilities, food service facilities, outdoor recreational space, a gymnasium with full-size basketball court, and training facilities. Irrigation of the outdoor landscaping is via a reclaimed water system. The new campus houses 2,200 workers who were spread among six different Houston locations, including the ConocoPhillips headquarters, where several hundred Phillips 66 workers had remained post spin-off.[14][17][18]
On 4 August 2015 it was announced that the company had formed a "long-term partnership" with English non-league association football club Leamington F.C.. The deal involved, amongst other things, the renaming of the club's ground from "The New Windmill Ground" to "The Phillips 66 Community Stadium."[19]

Product Quality Guarantee




























PRODUCT QUALITY GUARANTEE


Dedicated to fulfilling our promise.












Phillips 66® Commercial Lubricants Division guarantees that its Phillips 66 branded lubricants meet or exceed the specifications stated by Phillips 66 for each product, and that they are free from defects. Therefore, Phillips 66 will pay for parts and labor deemed reasonably necessary to repair damage to engines or other pieces of equipment if it can be demonstrated that the damage was caused solely and directly by a breach of this warranty by Phillips 66.
This warranty protects your equipment against lubricant-related failure as long as:

It is serviced with Phillips 66 branded lubricant, provided the equipment is used under normal operating conditions and maintained according to the manufacturer’s recommendations
The product used is confirmed by Phillips 66 to be a Phillips 66 branded lubricant
The product used is the correct Phillips 66 branded lubricant for your application
The engine or equipment was operated as specified by the engine or equipment manufacturer maintenance schedule
The lubricant was changed as specified by the engine or equipment manufacturer maintenance schedule
Written documentation or maintenance records are provided that show the engine or equipment was serviced and maintained at regular intervals as specified by the manufacturer
The proper lubricant level has been maintained in the engine or equipment through documentation of frequency of oil make-up
A historical record of lubricant brands and types used during the life of the engine or equipment is provided, and the date of last use prior to switching to the Phillips 66 branded lubricant
Phillips 66 is provided with a new and used sample of the Phillips 66 branded lubricant, with the plant fill codes, that are believed to be the cause of the engine or equipment failure, and ConocoPhillips personnel are allowed to inspect the damaged engine or equipment, take samples, and perform lab tests on the samples
Prompt notice of the problem is given to allow Phillips 66 to investigate the problem
This warranty shall be void if: (1) the wrong Phillips 66 branded lubricant is used for the application; (2) the damage is related to use of other competitive lubricants; (3) the damage is related to engine or equipment modification; or (4) the owner/operator has failed to operate or maintain the engine or equipment as required by the manufacturer
PHILLIPS 66 IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR (AND HEREBY DISCLAIMS ALL LIABILITY FOR) SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES. THIS WARRANTY IS IN LIEU OF ALL OTHER WARRANTIES REGARDING Phillips 66 BRANDED LUBRICANTS, EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THOSE OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
To submit a claim under this warranty, please contact your Marketer Sales Representative, Lube Engineer or call a Hotline Consultant @ 1-877-445-9198 to report the problem so we can resolve it promptly.
