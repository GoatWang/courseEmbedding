Directorships: 2–3
Total director compensation, 2008–2014: $6,143,144
Average annual director compensation: $877,592
Average compensation per full year of service as director: $323,323


Lois D. Juliber is the retired Vice Chairman and former COO of Colgate-Palmolive, a consumer products company that makes a variety of household and personal products. Her success at Colgate-Palmolive earned her several appearances on Fortune’s list of 50 Most Powerful Women. Ms. Juliber received a B.A. from Wellesley College, where she is currently a member of the board of trustees. At the beginning of 2015, Ms. Juliber completed her third and final term as Director of the MasterCard Foundation (the world’s fifth largest private charitable foundation), an organization she helped create. In addition to her B.A., she also received an M.B.A. from Harvard University.
Ms. Juliber has served as a director at three companies, Mondelez International, DuPont, and Goldman Sachs. Ms. Juliber joined Mondelez International in 2007, back when it was Kraft Foods Inc, and she joined DuPont in 1995. She is currently still a Director for both of these companies, and chairs the Compensation Committees for both. Ms. Juliber joined the board for Goldman Sachs in 2004, but left the company in 2012. During her time at Goldman Sachs, Ms. Juliber served on all of the company’s standing committees. Between 2008 and 2014, Ms. Juliber made a total of $6,143,144 in director compensation, averaging $877,592 each year. On average each directorship, Ms. Juliber served a full year at paid $323,323 in annual compensation.
As chair of the compensation committees for Mondelez International and DuPont, and a member of the same for Goldman Sachs, Ms. Juliber has played a role in setting compensation for the CEO’s of all three companies. Between 2008 and 2014 the average annual CEO compensation was $21.5 million for Mondelez International and $13.3 million for DuPont. During this same period CEO compensation increased by $2.3 million at Mondelez International and by $5.9 million at DuPont.
Between 2008 and 2012, the CEO of Goldman Sachs averaged $17.1 million in annual compensation. However, this number requires more explanation. In 2008, Goldman’s CEO compensation totaled $40.9 million. The next year it totaled just $1 million. This abrupt change was caused by the fact that in 2009 Goldman Sachs awarded no stock or other options to its executives, which was a condition of getting TARP bailout funds. So the pay for the year represents just the base CEO salary of $600,000 plus some other compensation. To examine the change in CEO compensation during these years a more stable number to look at would be this base salary, which went from $600,000 in 2008 to $2 million in 2012.
Between 2008 and 2014, Mondelez International’s stock prices grew by just 13.35 percent. DuPont’s prices grew by 69.04 percent, which outpaced the S&P 500’s growth of 42.27 percent. Between 2008 and 2012, while still recovering from the financial crisis, Goldman Sach’s stock prices fell by 38.55 percent. This is well below the performance of the S&P 500, which decreased over this period by just 1.45 percent.

 Educational Background



Graduate 
Class of 1971 


Wellesley College

                  Wellesley is known for the excellence of its education, the beauty of its setting, its gifted faculty, and the uniqueness of its campus culture.

But most of all, Wellesley is known for the thousands of accomplished, thoughtful women it has sent out into the world for over 100 years—women who are committed to making a difference. 
A Transformative Educational Experience

Every year, some 2,400 of the world’s top undergraduate women are challenged to exceed their own highest personal and intellectual expectations. The mastery Wellesley graduates demonstrate across the professional and vocational spectrum, and the influence they wield—whether in their own communities or on the world stage—is testament to a singularly empowering undergraduate experience. 

Wellesley’s lively academic community places a high value on rigorous, probing inquiry, and creative, cross-discipline thinking. Its collaborative approach to scholarship encourages students to question, debate, and refine their points of view, not only with each other, but with our world-class faculty—often by working directly with them on groundbreaking projects.

A Wellesley education fosters the highest standard of readiness for the “real world” in its graduates, in terms of ability to think, act, and contribute meaningfully and effectively in their chosen areas of interest.
The “Full-Engagement” Advantage

Wellesley’s full-engagement academic philosophy extends to the running of the College itself. The student voice is central to decision-making here; students serve on major committees of the Board of Trustees, participate in faculty search, and contribute to strategic planning. 

Students participate in a wide range of extracurricular projects: The College and its surrounding community and the greater Boston area offer hundreds of internships, advocacy projects, and the rare advantages of being a vital member of the single largest academic “hotspot” in the country.

Expected to be fully engaged while at Wellesley, students carry this sense of purposeful involvement and personal commitment throughout life. It is the signal mark of a Wellesley woman.
A Widely Envied Campus Environment

The sheer sense of scale of the breathtaking natural environment, in which buildings are thoughtfully sited, distinguish Wellesley’s physical setting in the classically New England town of Wellesley, Massachusetts, just outside of Boston.

Home to leading institutions such as the Albright Institute, the Knapp Social Science Center, the Davis Museum, The Newhouse Center for the Humanities, and the world-renowned Wellesley Centers for Women, Wellesley’s resources are a magnet not only for the surrounding community and metropolitan area; they attract attention—and scholars—from around the world.
Commitment to Women

Everything about Wellesley College bespeaks its commitment to women, and to providing them with an unexcelled educational experience that honors and cultivates not only what is best about each of them, and their own potential, but about what women offer our world.

Member Emeritus, Board of Trustees

Wellesley College

                    Wellesley is known for the excellence of its education, the beauty of its setting, its gifted faculty, and the uniqueness of its campus culture.

But most of all, Wellesley is known for the thousands of accomplished, thoughtful women it has sent out into the world for over 100 years—women who are committed to making a difference. 
A Transformative Educational Experience

Every year, some 2,400 of the world’s top undergraduate women are challenged to exceed their own highest personal and intellectual expectations. The mastery Wellesley graduates demonstrate across the professional and vocational spectrum, and the influence they wield—whether in their own communities or on the world stage—is testament to a singularly empowering undergraduate experience. 

Wellesley’s lively academic community places a high value on rigorous, probing inquiry, and creative, cross-discipline thinking. Its collaborative approach to scholarship encourages students to question, debate, and refine their points of view, not only with each other, but with our world-class faculty—often by working directly with them on groundbreaking projects.

A Wellesley education fosters the highest standard of readiness for the “real world” in its graduates, in terms of ability to think, act, and contribute meaningfully and effectively in their chosen areas of interest.
The “Full-Engagement” Advantage

Wellesley’s full-engagement academic philosophy extends to the running of the College itself. The student voice is central to decision-making here; students serve on major committees of the Board of Trustees, participate in faculty search, and contribute to strategic planning. 

Students participate in a wide range of extracurricular projects: The College and its surrounding community and the greater Boston area offer hundreds of internships, advocacy projects, and the rare advantages of being a vital member of the single largest academic “hotspot” in the country.

Expected to be fully engaged while at Wellesley, students carry this sense of purposeful involvement and personal commitment throughout life. It is the signal mark of a Wellesley woman.
A Widely Envied Campus Environment

The sheer sense of scale of the breathtaking natural environment, in which buildings are thoughtfully sited, distinguish Wellesley’s physical setting in the classically New England town of Wellesley, Massachusetts, just outside of Boston.

Home to leading institutions such as the Albright Institute, the Knapp Social Science Center, the Davis Museum, The Newhouse Center for the Humanities, and the world-renowned Wellesley Centers for Women, Wellesley’s resources are a magnet not only for the surrounding community and metropolitan area; they attract attention—and scholars—from around the world.
Commitment to Women

Everything about Wellesley College bespeaks its commitment to women, and to providing them with an unexcelled educational experience that honors and cultivates not only what is best about each of them, and their own potential, but about what women offer our world.

Toyota unsure how to solve safety issues





Toyota unsure how to solve safety issues By Peter Whoriskey and Frank Ahrens Washington Post Staff WritersWednesday, February 24, 2010     Toyota's top U.S. executive told lawmakers on Tuesday that he is not certain the company has fixed its runaway car problems even though it has recalled millions of vehicles around the world.  Although the automaker has blamed obstructing floor mats and sticky gas pedals for reports of cars accelerating out of control, lawmakers at a hearing on Capitol Hill appeared skeptical about the sometimes-conflicting accounts of what has gone wrong.  "Do you believe that the recall on the carpet changes and the recalls on the sticky pedals will solve the problem of sudden, unintended acceleration?" Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Calif.) asked James E. Lentz III, president of Toyota Motor Sales USA.   "Not totally," Lentz replied.   "What do you need to do?" Waxman asked.   "We need to continue to be vigilant and continue to investigate all of the complaints that we get from consumers -- that we have done a relatively poor job of doing in the past," Lentz said.  The hearing before the House Energy and Commerce Committee was jammed with spectators and news media from the United States and Japan, who heard emotional testimony about terrifying car rides, as well as engineering analysis and a lengthy corporate apology. Lentz at one point fought back tears recalling that he lost his brother in a car crash years ago.   "There's not a day that goes by that I don't think of that," he said, "so I know what these families go through."  In the end, the hearing outlined but did not resolve the controversy that has rocked the world's largest automaker in recent weeks: What exactly has caused Toyota cars, in rare but occasionally fatal instances, to rev and accelerate out of control?  At another hearing Wednesday, Toyota President Akio Toyoda plans to face the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee and attribute the company's troubles to rapid growth. "I regret that this has resulted in the safety issues described in the recalls we face today, and I am deeply sorry for any accidents that Toyota drivers have experienced," he said in prepared remarks released ahead of the event.  On Tuesday, lawmakers first heard testimony from a retired Tennessee social worker whose Toyota 2007 Lexus ES 350 sped up to 100 miles per hour during a wild, six-mile ride in 2006. The car sped on even after the driver applied the emergency brake and shifted into neutral and then reverse."I prayed for God to help me," Rhonda Smith testified tearfully. "I called my husband on the Bluetooth phone system. I knew he could not help me, but I wanted to hear his voice one more time."  For months afterward, the couple tried telling their story to journalists, to Toyota and to federal safety regulators. They said they wanted to warn others of what they viewed as a deadly flaw. They also wanted their money back on a car that had only 2,728 miles on it.   One Knoxville television station, WATE-TV, ran a story.   Toyota looked at the engine but said it seemed fine.  An investigator from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration visited the couple in Tennessee, but he "seemed to arrive with the preconceived idea to sell to us that it was a floor mat problem," Smith testified. She was sure it was not.  It wasn't until the death of a California Highway Patrol officer and his family in August, which was preceded by their fraught 911 call seconds before the crash, that the company and federal regulators seemed to give more credence to consumer complaints.   "Shame on you, Toyota, for being so greedy," Smith said. "And shame on you, NHTSA, for not doing your job."   Lentz, who testified later, reacted to her story.  "Listening to Mrs. Smith, I'm embarrassed for what happened," he said. "You didn't have to have a death to understand the terror she had from that accident."  The Tennessee couple was followed by David Gilbert of Southern Illinois University, a professor who said his interest was "piqued" after seeing news reports about the runaway Toyotas. Based on 30 years teaching and testing automotive technology, Gilbert said he conducted an experiment that showed a Toyota Avalon's onboard computer could be tricked into operating as if nothing was wrong even if the accelerator was stuck and the car was speeding uncontrollably.  "To be quite honest, at the moment I discovered this, I was sick at my stomach," he said.   Gilbert's research was attacked by Rep. Steve Buyer (R-Ind.), who has a Toyota assembly plant in his district. He asked Gilbert whether he had "cut three wires" in the car to rig his test. Gilbert responded that he had not; he tapped into the wires with a monitor for electric current, a procedure within scientific methods. Rep. Diana DeGette (D-Colo.) told Gilbert that Toyota lawyers said they were able to duplicate Gilbert's experiment but that it amounted to "sabotage." She asked Gilbert whether the conditions simulated in his experiment could occur while driving. Yes, Gilbert responded. Then why wasn't Toyota able to find this earlier?   "Maybe they weren't asking the right questions," Gilbert said.   Some lawmakers suggested that Gilbert's research was meant only to make money. Gilbert said he'd been paid $1,800 so far, by safety consultant Sean Kane, who works on behalf of victims' families and trial attorneys.  That Gilbert could so quickly turn up a problem that an entire industry has been looking for seemed "too good to be true," Lentz said.   "It's not in our interest, if a problem exists, to not find it," Lentz reminded lawmakers.   The other key question facing lawmakers is why the NHTSA did not act earlier in response to consumer complaints.  In late-afternoon testimony, Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood told lawmakers, "You have my 100 percent commitment we will get in the weeds on this."  Rep. Jane Harman (D-Calif.), who owns between $116,002 and $315,000 in Toyota stock with her husband, recused herself from participating in Tuesday's hearing.   Harman International Industries, her husband's company, also has held lucrative contracts with Toyota for years, equipping cars with Harman Kardon audio systems.   Staff writers Kimberly Kindy and Dana Hedgpeth contributed to this report.

台灣戴明圈(259)豐田召回事件 再爆內幕  2010-02-23工商時報【記者鍾志恒／綜合外電報導】       　豐田社長豐田章男本周三將出席美國眾議院監督暨政府改革委員會（監改委）舉行的聽證會。外界正議論豐田要為召回事件負責，抑或政府監管不力時，媒體披露 豐田內部文件顯示，豐田早在2007年就曾與美國政府進行談判成功，僅限量召回少數汽車而因此省下1億美元。此一消息使得豐田的形象再受打擊。      　底特律新聞報周日率先披露豐田交付給監改委的文件後，美聯社等多家媒體也陸續取得相關文件，讓外界了解到豐田召回事件的更多內幕。      　這份在去年7月完成的內部份文件指出，豐田在2007年時與政府談判成功，以「設備召回」的名義召回會卡住的油門踏板，讓召回的範圍大縮水，省下逾1億美元費用，同時也迴避了政府的安全問題調查。      　文件顯示2007年8月，美國政府已經針對十多起死亡車禍對豐田展開調查，並且訪問600名Lexus車主後，發現1成反應有暴衝的問 題。但同年9月僅回收5.5萬部因為問題踏板而可能出現暴衝的Camry和Lexus ES350；這些問題跟豐田去年秋天召回約850萬部汽車的狀況是一樣，但時間上已延後了約2年。      　去年9月美國發生Lexus高速失控，導致1名巡警和其3名家人喪生，讓豐田汽車的暴衝問題再次受到關注。      　雖然豐田在內部文件曝光後立即發表聲明強調以客戶的安全為優先考慮，但仍然讓人懷疑豐田是否把商業利益放在首位，和透過遊說來縮少召回的規模，以及政府有否注意到豐田的安全問題。      　美國政府周日表示，已經在調查豐田汽車多起暴衝報告。交通部公布早在2003年12月時，已經調查39起有關豐田在2002年至2003 年出廠的Camry暴衝控訴；其後連2003年至2004年出廠的Lexus ES300，和2002年至2004年出廠的Camry都出現暴衝問題。 トヨタ内部文書「リコール問題で１億ドル以上を節約」【ワシントン＝尾形聡彦、ニューヨーク＝丸石伸一】トヨタ自動車の大規模リコール（回収・無償修理）問題で、米下院の監督・政府改革委員会は２１日、「リコール問題で（当局との）交渉の末、１億ドル（約９２億円）以上を節約できた」とするトヨタの内部文書を明らかにした。２００７年のリコールが大規模になるのを防いだことで、多額の費用が浮いたことをトヨタが社内で強調している文書で、トヨタの豊田章男社長が出席する２４日の同委員会の公聴会で追及が強まるのは必至だ。　文書は、監督・政府改革委が調査過程で入手。０９年７月初めに、現・北米トヨタ社長の稲葉良み（よしみ、みは目へんに見）氏が、同社ワシントン事務所について、米当局や米議会への働きかけで成果をあげていることを強調する内容だ。文書は「機密扱い」とされている。　０９年７月は、同年８月の米西海岸でのレクサス車の暴走・死亡事故、同年９月のトヨタの大規模リコール発表の前に当たる。　文書は、ワシントン事務所の成果として、リコール問題で「（同社にとって）有利な結果」を得たと指摘。特に、「カムリや、レクサスＥＳのリコール問題では１億ドル以上を節約」と明記している。　トヨタは０７年９月に、フロアマットにアクセルが引っかかる恐れがあるとして、主力車種の「カムリ」と高級車「レクサスＥＳ３５０」の一部、計約５万５千台をリコールしている。このリコールが比較的軽く済んだことを指しているものとみられる。　ただ、その後、０９年９月末発表のリコールは、カムリやレクサスＥＳ３５０を含め７車種約３８０万台に上った。　監督・政府改革委の有力者、アイサ議員（共和）の広報担当は２１日、「トヨタと米当局との間でどんなやりとりがあったのか重大な疑問が生じている」と批判。公聴会でも追及する方針だ。　トヨタは同日、「我々は顧客の安全を最優先に考えており、一つの内部文書だけで（安全よりコスト重視などと）結論づけるのは適切ではない」との談話を出した。(258)Peter Drucker used to say that “to focus on weakness is wasteful—a misuse, if not abuse, of the human resource.(257)感謝 John Liu 給我們這一"剪報 "我不同意諸如ETC等機構的成立 可以嚴控台灣品質(想要以"國家"為單位談品質 都是容易過於廣泛)"品質是生命．品牌是責任 2010-02-22 工商時報 【黃茂雄】 　近一年來為了摩斯漢堡和樂雅 樂餐飲服務將在中國成立據點，經常往返大陸考察市場狀況，發現大陸民眾對台灣的食品相當有信心，認為台灣的食品有水準，安全品質也能令人安心。 　基於這種信任和好感，讓國內的食品業在彼岸發展十分快速，從最早的永和豆漿、頂新、旺旺、統一到近期的85度C，都廣受好評。不過，為了 快速展店，很多業者都複製台灣的成功經驗，採取加盟方式，雖然很快的就打響知名度，但大陸的環境是否能像台灣一樣，確立安全性和品質，建置完整的保障體 制，是必要慎重思考的！ 　以最近新聞話題不斷的豐田汽車來看，由於油電混合車（EV）兩用的品質出問題，大大衝擊了豐田汽車王國的神話。 　以織布工廠起家的豐田集團，是在1937年8月由豐田喜一郎成立，並選擇以1938年11月2日搬遷至舉母新廠（現今總社工廠）開工的良 辰吉日為公司創立紀念日。 　擁有7、80年歷史的豐田汽車，是日本企業的象徵、日本國力的表彰，在長期重視品質管理與成本控制下，鼎盛時期的豐田以旗下四大主力品牌 Toyota、Lexus（凌志）、Scion、Hino，外加併購的Daihatsu（大發）和持股的Subaru（速霸陸），橫掃全球170多個國 家，在全球26個國家中，架構了52座生產基地，雇用員工總數高達26.5萬人，而「豐田看板式管理」、「零庫存」，也一直是全球企業界爭相仿效的教戰榜 樣。 　現在卻因危機處理差，打垮了這家在2008年的金融風暴中擠下通用汽車躍居全球第一的汽車製造商，豐田辛苦建置幾十年的品牌形象正面臨嚴 峻考驗。 　豐田這次的問題車，據說是受美國外包零件廠所影響的。儘管也有所謂「陰謀論」的說法，但汽車牽涉到生命的安全性，消費者認同的是品牌。他 不會計較汽車零件或車子是在何處生產？是從那裡供應？以品牌就是責任榮辱的歸屬對象來探討，豐田都難辭其咎。 　因此，在經營事業上，也要了解當地社會的風土民情和風氣，如果覺得有些條件不足，就要加強，俾以降低風險。畢竟在日本、在台灣可以依賴的 生產環境，在美國、在大陸不是全然就會相同的，更何況是在異國外包的協力廠商。 　無獨有偶的，不只是豐田生產的汽車被質疑，1980年代三菱使用的CRT映像管彩色電視機，歷經了30年，現在也還出現問題而被追究而要 回收，足見品質的重要性，稍不留意，就會是企業沈重的負擔，甚至可能是壓垮駱駝的最後一根稻草。 　隨著大環境的改變，2、30年來，國內廠商不斷的把生產基地從台灣向大陸、東南亞等海外地區挪移，廠商如何貫徹生產品質是很嚴重的考驗， 豐田事件是很好的借鏡！ 東元的前任董事長偕林波士、林長城過去即再三的交待，推出產品時，要考慮的優先順序是一、品質。二、交期。三是成本。「顧客至上、保障消費者」的原則是凌 駕在成本利潤之上，一直都是東元堅持的企業信念，東元員工仍時時刻刻要銘記於心的原則。 　以前國內的電線電纜出口，曾經由於品質不佳，容易發生電線走火、漏電等意外事故，而被中東國家嚴重抗議、要求限制出口，當時的經濟部長趙 耀東就下令要求廠商自重，提升品質，因此，後來就成立了ETC（電子檢驗中心）、CED（電機電子產品發展協會）等單位來嚴控品質，也建立了國內電子電機 產品的安全性及形象，並陸續打進國際市場。 　現在不管是線纜，電子、醫療器材、農產品花卉、食品等產品，「MADE IN TAIWAN」已經慢慢成為高檔貨，並建立生產基地的權威地位，創造了優勢的競爭力，而辛苦打下的基業，不管是在何處生產，或者是銷售到何方，「品質」絕 對是企業生命與品牌，也是永續事業的信用。（本文作者為工商協進會理事長、東元集團會長） "(256)Coeur d'amour éprisby Henri MATISSE這標題 請rl 翻譯一下瑞麟: "上午九點出門，《菩提道次第廣論》研討班聯誼兼補課，下午六點才從教室離開。Coeur ＝心d'＝的，相當於英文的ofamour＝愛，愛慕épris＝滿懷的，熱愛的Coeur d'amour épris＝滿懷愛慕的心 "(255)鍾老師、陳教授：新年快樂!今年新春假期春雨綿綿，讓春遊雖不致於寸步難行，但總少些放開懷的舒暢。還好，昨天(2/21)與今天，太陽露了臉，讓心情可以曬曬太陽。倒是，悶在家裡時，帶著小孩做親子共讀，培養他閱讀的興趣，及試著回饋心得(一句話)，說著說著我就想把它記錄到Blog裡，畢竟知道要寫些東西，但一直不知道怎麼下筆(Keyin)。網路世界博學大眾，各家爭鳴，自己又有什麼立足點呢?http://photo.xuite.net/eric.jhang ==>拍照比較容易，記錄319鄉鎮(天下文化)http://blog.xuite.net/eric.jhang/happylink ==>這個念頭，一直到開始記錄小孩的閱讀心得，有了變化，或許心態的調整，慢慢可以把渾沌的腦袋，整理出什麼來。最近，看到豐田汽車的社長，為北美市場的油電汽車煞車系統瑕疵釀禍而數次道歉，我心裡很感傷，因為再好的工廠管理，如果品質出問題，那多年建立的信用，絕對蕩然無存。而品質要出問題，最容易地，就是在績效管理下，將賺錢與品質放在天平上去秤，並忽視時間這個因素。豐田汽車是獲利的公司，應該有更大空間可以將品質放在更高順位，同時，油電汽車是明星產品，有更從容的姿態來回應市場需求，怎麼會出這樣的問題?張智翔 敬上(254)Sent: Sat,20 Feb 2010 13:55:08 Asia/TaipeiSubject: 新生讀書會 2010我 最近至少有2 場聚會 公開蘇錦坤 (Ken)先生提一問 相當有意思百年之後 我們的plogs 跑 (藏)到那我當時是想 天上人間 網路之空間不會煙沒 (老兵不死 只下地獄)Peter Drucker has written that "we are currently living through" one of the "transformations" that occurs "every few hundred years" in which "society rearranges itself -- its worldview; its basic values; it's social and political structure; its arts; its key institutions," so much so that "fifty years later, ... the people born then cannot even imagine the world in which their grandparents lived and into which their own parents were born."Ken 極力鼓吹 "讀書會"(為什麼取新生讀書會 2010 諸位 近日翻王雲五的八十自述)我就想 乾脆2010 就將過去幾組的讀者會朋友"強行組合"成一每次來"新生讀書會"的 都採用ppt 與問答方式原則上周末 (配合rl)現在 每次 Ken都可插入他淵博之佛典與漢字等3月中 有Kevin Lin主持的 "從Toyota recalls" 說起4月上中旬 有張華先生主持挖開兔子洞：深入解讀愛麗絲漫遊奇境(為什麼不在下旬 因為我經常去泉州遙想 "晚晴老人"弘一大師)(253)Another Toyota Recall Coming? By any measure, it has not been a good year for Toyota. The auto giant has recalled millions of vehicles due to sticking accelerator pedals and faulty braking systems—and that's after more than 4 million cars were recalled in the last quarter of 2009. Now, it is expected that the United States is going to announce a new investigation today that will focus on complaints of steering problems in the Corolla. "The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) says it has received more than 150 complaints about possible steering problems in the 2009-2010 Corolla," the BBC reported. "Toyota said on Wednesday that it was looking into complaints of power steering problems with the Corolla." The investigation will involve approximately 500,000 vehicles.(252)"據知情人士說﹐《紐約時報》(New York Times)的財經記者考韋(Zachery Kouwe)週二辭職﹐該報此前的一次內部調查發現﹐此人過去一年中有過多次剽竊行為。考韋的辭職給始於上週晚些時候的一個小插曲劃上了句號。當時《華爾街日報》致信《紐約時報》﹐提請它關注《華爾街日報》網站2月5日所刊登一篇文章與《紐約時報》印刷版和網絡版隨後所刊一些文章存在的眾多相似之處。在調查了此事後﹐《紐約時報》週一在報紙上刊登的一則編輯聲明說﹐主要為《紐約時報》網站博客DealBook撰寫文章的考韋似乎不適當地盜用了其他新聞媒體所刊登的詞語和段落。這些媒體包括《華爾街日報》和路透社(Reuters)。《紐約時報》在這則編輯聲明中保證說﹐會採取符合其一貫標準的適當行動以保護該報採編工作的誠實可靠。"(251)News about ASQAPPLYING FOR OTT Applications for the 2010-2011 Ellis R.

Safety Agency Scrutinized as Toyota Recall Grows





 Safety Agency Scrutinized as Toyota Recall GrowsBy ERIC LICHTBLAU   and BILL VLASIC  Published: February 9, 2010   In November, top auto safety officials made an unusual request of Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood. After reviewing  complaints about Toyota vehicles, the regulators said they believed the automaker was stalling their inquiries and wanted to go to Japan to stress just how serious their concerns had become.   Skip to next paragraph  Enlarge This Image    Associated Press  In Japan, 2010 Prius models waited on Tuesday for shipment. More than 400,000 of Toyota's hybrid and other gas-electric models worldwide are being recalled.    Related  A Slow Reaction to Toyota Illustrates Gaps in Europe   (February 10, 2010)   In Toyota Mess, Lesson for Japan   (February 9, 2010)  Times Topics: Toyota Motor Corporation    Add to Portfolio Toyota Motor Corp Go to your Portfolio »   Enlarge This Image    Lauren Victoria Burke/Associated Press  Ray LaHood defended the national traffic safety agency on Tuesday.      Enlarge This Image    Toru Hanai/Reuters  Akio Toyoda, left, of Toyota, met with Japan's transportation minister, Seiji Maehara, on Tuesday about the recalls.                 Executives at Toyota “were dragging things out, and we’d had it,” a senior American transportation official said in recounting new details of the talks. “We were getting excuses that didn’t make sense anymore.”Mr. LaHood approved the unprecedented trip, but it would be a month before his top safety aides met with Toyota executives, and another month before Toyota disclosed to Washington that it had found problems with some sticking accelerators. Not once in more than six years of reviews of Toyota’s problems did officials at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which regulates automakers, use their power to subpoena Toyota’s records, even though they said they believed the automaker was withholding critical information. Now, with the recalls of some eight million Toyota vehicles since late last year, including more than 400,000 models of the 2010 Prius and other hybrid models this week, the traffic safety agency promises to be scrutinized as much as Toyota itself. Members of Congress, independent experts on auto experts and others say they want to know why the agency did not act more aggressively in investigating Toyota’s problems.“This is the most extensive vehicle recall in history, and we want to know, what did Toyota know about its defects and when did they know it, and what did N.H.T.S.A. know and did it act quickly enough?” Representative Henry A. Waxman, the California Democrat who leads the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said  on Tuesday.  Some Congressional officials and outside experts say they believe the safety agency has become too close to the industry it is charged with regulating, as a number of agency employees have gone to work for Toyota. Among other issues that need to be addressed, they also cite the agency’s limited use of fines or subpoenas against auto manufacturers, a dearth of technical expertise in areas like electronic throttle problems and frequent turnover in its leadership. Joan Claybrook, who was the director of the agency in the Carter administration, said that it “should be the government cop on the auto regulatory beat,” but too often it was not.  “It has enormous authority to do its job,” she said, “but it doesn’t always have the staff or money. And in this particular case, they took the road of least resistance.”Mr. Waxman’s committee has sought documents from the safety agency and scheduled a hearing this month on the problems. A second group, the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, postponed a hearing until Feb. 24. In recent days, Toyota has begun taking out full-page newspaper advertisements to repair its reputation and has brought on new lobbyists to make its case in Washington, where many lawmakers have benefited from the campaign contributions and jobs at home provided by the company. And transportation officials have begun pushing back as well. “The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has the most active defect investigation program in the world,” Mr. LaHood said on Tuesday in a statement to The New York Times. “Its safety experts are dedicated to finding and fixing safety problems, and they review 30,000 consumer complaints every year. Over just the last three years, N.H.T.S.A.’s investigations have resulted in 524 recalls involving 23.5 million vehicles — a stellar record.”But internal agency documents and interviews with auto safety experts demonstrate that the safety agency and the auto giant it regulated engaged in a Kabuki dance of sorts in the months and years before tensions coalesced. Drivers would file complaints by the dozens about mysterious accelerations and other hazards, federal regulators would open official reviews, Toyota would promise answers, the regulators would complain about not receiving the information they needed, and in the end, almost nothing would come of any of it. Six times since 2003 in fact, the safety agency opened inquiries into possible Toyota safety problems, and six times it closed them without any significant action.In 2008, for instance, the agency examined a request from the owner of a Toyota Tacoma pickup to investigate “sudden and uncontrolled acceleration.” After a preliminary review, the safety agency concluded in a memorandum given to House investigators that: “In view of the need to allocate and prioritize N.H.T.S.A.’s limited resources to best accomplish the agency’s safety mission, the petition is denied.” In recent years, the agency has dealt with financing and staff cuts in some areas. The Transportation Department announced last week that the administration was seeking money for 66 new positions.The agency also has had a revolving door of leaders, with about a half-dozen directors since 2005. The current administrator, David Strickland, was confirmed only in December.  The agency was stymied by Toyota’s centralized decision-making, but did not act aggressively in its dealings with the company’s leaders. Over its six defect investigations, agency investigators never met with Japanese executives, only Toyota officials in the United States. Christopher Santucci, a manager of safety affairs for Toyota in Washington, testified in a deposition in a lawsuit that all decisions on defects and vehicle recalls were made in Japan. Federal regulators were routinely told during investigations that requests for safety data or vehicle testing must be relayed to Japan for answers. By the fall of last year, N.H.T.S.A. officials had become frustrated by delays in receiving information. Even though the agency was not getting all the information it wanted from Japan, it did receive data about possible defects from State Farm, the insurance firm, beginning in 2007. The agency said that information was incorporated into its continuing investigations, but Congressional officials say it should have set off louder warnings at the agency. Congressional investigators have indicated that they are looking into the agency’s ability to investigate possible defects in Toyota’s computerized, electronic throttle-control systems. The agency is expected to hire outside experts to assist in its inquiry, said a federal official with knowledge of the decision.But the Transportation Department said the move was not a sign of any shortcomings in its level of in-house expertise. Since 1980, the agency has conducted 141 investigations into throttle controls, both mechanical and electronic versions, the department said. The Toyota recalls occurred a decade after N.H.T.S.A. withstood heavy criticism from Congress over its failure to detect a pattern of rollovers in Ford S.U.V.’s with Firestone tires. In that case, State Farm had given the agency documents warning of safety failures, but Congressional investigators said the agency was slow to realize the significance. “This is history repeating itself,” said Clarence Ditlow, who runs the Center for Auto Safety and is scheduled to appear as a witness at the House oversight hearing. “Where were they before this?” he asked of the safety agency. “The whole relationship is really too cozy. They view their constituency as the auto industry and not the consumer. It’s a classic case of a regulatory agency that over time becomes captured by the industry it regulates.”

召回: 普銳斯(Prius)油電混合動力車





據日本共同社(Kyodo)報導﹐知情人士透露﹐豐田汽車公司(Toyota Motor Co.)計劃在美國和日本兩地申請因剎車問題召回最新的普銳斯(Prius)油電混合動力車﹐此舉可能影響到超過27萬輛汽車。知情人士表示﹐豐田汽車計劃最早週二向日本國土交通省(Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism Ministry)上報召回一事﹐並盡快向美國提交類似文件。知情人士稱﹐豐田汽車還在考慮提交其他油電混合動力車型的召回申請﹐例如豪華車雷克薩斯(Lexus) HS250h以及混合動力專用的Sai緊湊轎車﹐這些車型也使用了與普銳斯油電混合動力車類似的剎車系統。*****本田汽車(Honda Motor Co.)首席財務長Yoichi Hojo警告稱﹐豐田汽車公司(Toyota Motor Co.)的大規模召回事件可能會給整個汽車行業帶來連鎖反應﹐挫傷消費者對汽車質量和安全的信心。他還表示﹐為降低某些車型的過多庫存﹐本田汽車將通過提高促銷力度來加強在美國市場的競爭。他同時表示﹐儘管美國汽車廠商已經針對豐田汽車消費者推出特定促銷方案﹐但本田汽車不會這麼做。****豐田汽車公司(Toyota Motor Co.)週二表示﹐該公司向全球銷售的40萬輛汽車因剎車系統問題被歸入召回之列。豐田汽車表示﹐將盡快在美國、歐洲和其他地區採取補救措施。豐田汽車總裁豐田章男(Akio Toyoda)稱﹐對於公司給諸多消費者帶來的問題和困擾﹐公司再次表示歉意。週二早些時候﹐豐田汽車表示將在日本召回223,068輛混合動力車﹐其中包括新款普銳斯(Prius)、Sai緊湊轎車、雷克薩斯(Lexus) HS250h及普銳斯插電式混動車。豐田章男表示﹐將盡快通過經銷商告知國內客戶召回事宜。---   Toyota Prius Recall 2010: Company Begins Worldwide Brake Recall On Flagship Hybrid                                   YURI KAGEYAMA |  02/ 9/10 03:06 AM |                   Toyota has begun a Prius recall.           TOKYO — Toyota says it is recalling about 437,000 Prius and other hybrid vehicles worldwide to fix brake problems – the latest in a string of embarrassing safety lapses at the world's largest automaker. "I apologize for causing trouble and worries for many customers over the quality and safety of Toyota," President Akio Toyoda said at a press conference Tuesday in Tokyo. "We sincerely acknowledge safety concerns from our customers," he said. "We have decided to recall as we regard safety for our customers as our foremost priority." The recall is the latest blow to Toyota Motor Corp., which is in the midst of recalling more than 7 million vehicles worldwide because of problems with floor mats, which can trap gas pedals, and faulty gas pedals that are slow to return to the idle position. The 2010 Prius wasn't part of those recalls. There have been about 200 complaints in Japan and the U.S. about a delay when the brakes in the Prius were pressed in cold conditions and on some bumpy roads. The delay doesn't indicate a brake failure. The company says the problem can be fixed in 40 minutes with new software that oversees the controls of the antilock brakes. Toyota officials went to Japan's Transport Ministry earlier Tuesday to formally notify officials the company is recalling the 2010 Prius gas-electric hybrid – the world's top-selling hybrid car. The automaker is also recalling two other hybrid models in Japan, the Lexus HS250h sedan, sold in the U.S. and Japan, and the Sai, which is sold only in Japan. The 223,000 cars being recalled in Japan include nearly 200,000 Priuses sold from April last year through Monday, according to papers the automaker filed with the ministry. The Prius is Japan's top-selling car. In the U.S., Toyota will recall 133,000 Prius cars and 14,500 Lexus HS250h vehicles. Nearly 53,000 Priuses are also being recalled in Europe. Owners in Japan of the 2010 Prius can get their cars fixed starting Wednesday, said Ryusuke Itazaki, chief of the recall department at the Transport Ministry.He said Toyota would suspend production of the Sai and Lexus HS250h in Japan as the company doesn't have the updated software for those models yet. If drivers experience any delayed reaction when depressing the brakes in any of these models, they should keep pressing, he said. Itazaki said complaints about the brakes started coming in as the weather got colder, particularly from northern Japan. He also said Toyota should have taken action sooner. "If the company had paid more attention to consumers' viewpoint, it could have realized that there was a safety problem." Toyoda, the president, has been criticized for being largely invisible during the two weeks after the company announced Jan. 21 the gas pedal recall in the U.S., Europe and China. He apologized at his first public press conference last Friday, but was criticized by the Japanese media for failing to outline concrete steps to tackle the safety crisis and reassure customers around the world. In contrast to his halting English in response to questions from foreign reporters at last week's news conference, Toyoda seemed much better prepared Tuesday, reading from an English statement after doing so in Japanese. "We will redouble our commitment to quality as a lifeline of our company," he said in English. "We will do everything in our power to regain the confidence of our customers." U.S. safety officials have launched an investigation into problems with the brakes. The problem is suspected in four crashes resulting in two minor injuries, according to data gathered by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which is investigating the matter. Toyota says it's cooperating with NHTSA's investigation. Problems with hybrid braking systems haven't been limited to Toyota. Ford Motor Co. said last week it plans to fix 17,600 Mercury Milan and Ford Fusion gas-electric hybrids because of a software problem that can give drivers the impression that the brakes have failed. The automaker says the problem occurs in transition between two braking systems and at no time are drivers without brakes. Toyota's plug-in hybrid is also being recalled in Japan – a largely experimental model for rental and government use, with 159 sold. The Prius holds a cherished spot in Toyota's vehicle lineup and is symbolic of its leadership in the "green" car market. Toyota was one of the first companies to mass-market a hybrid that combines an electric motor with a gas engine, introducing the Prius in Japan in 1997. Its high gas mileage made it popular among environmentally conscious drivers, especially when gas prices spiked two years ago. But the complexity of the Prius, a highly computerized car, has led to problems in the past. In 2005, the company repaired 75,000 of them to fix software glitches that caused the engine to stall. It has also had trouble with headlights going out. ___ Associated Press Writers Mari Yamaguchi, Shino Yuasa and Malcolm Foster in Tokyo, Aoife White in Brussels, Tom Krisher and Dee-Ann Durbin in Detroit and Ken Thomas in Washington contributed to this report.

The bronze is titled "Nuclear Energy," and it commemorates the creation of the first sustained nuclear chain reaction, which was realized by a team of University of Chicago scientists led by Enrico Fermi.

'Let's try common sense," President Obama said in the State of the Union address, provoking a spontaneous burst of laughter in the House of Representatives chamber. The unintended humor exposes an important truth about Washington: Everyone knows that won't happen.   More troubling, however, was that the president's speech revealed why common sense is nonexistent. Mr. Obama wants new laws to tell us how to do things better—when the need is to overhaul old laws to restore freedom of choice and individual responsibility.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
