Webcast


Market Insights Q3 2017 Markets seem to be telling us conflicting stories. On one hand, stocks have continued to climb on seemingly unabated investor optimism this year. On the other, bond yields have reversed course and fallen, indicating investor pessimism over future growth and inflation. Which story is right? Forward indicators suggest we may see a mini down cycle soon, which suggests caution.
Jon Hubbard from the MFS Investment Solutions team will moderate a discussion with MFS Chief Investment Strategist James Swanson and MFS Chief Economist Erik Weisman as they discuss how to decipher the conflicting narratives being told by the current market landscape.

WATCH NOW

















DEMONSTRATING
CONVICTION

We develop unique insights and give them time to pay off. Strong fundamentals and good entry points for investment matter. Short-term market "noise" and price moves do not. We stay true to our convictions because that can help us outperform in the long run.
WATCH NOW

















NAVIGATING
VOLATILE MARKETS

It's better to act, than react. In volatile markets, we avoid risks that lack clear rewards and take others that show potential value. Risk is part of every decision. Because it's as important to curtail losses as it is to capture gains.
WATCH NOW

















COLLABORATING AND
INTEGRATING RESEARCH

Sharing information and debating diverse views helps us look through market complexity to find global opportunities. Our culture rewards teamwork and lets us play to our strengths. That means better investment decisions for clients.

The Power Of Active ManagementSM
Clients count on us to help them navigate an increasingly complex global investment landscape. Here's what the value of our expertise brings to them:








Performance
We seek to outperform through active security selection, focusing as much on minimizing risk to capital and limiting volatility as we do on delivering excess returns..








Risk Management
Risk management isn't part of our investment process; it is our process. We won't add a security to our portfolios until we fully understand its return stream, liquidity and potential for long-term value.









Long-term value
Through our commitment to patient investing and flexibility to tap a broader opportunity set, we deliver greater long-term value to clients.








Stewardship
Our equity, fixed income, and quantitative teams work collectively, examining opportunities and actively debating the best ways to invest client capital.
