George T. Welch Scholarship:



Application

George T. Welch Scholarship Information
General Requirements for Scholarships from the George T. Welch Trust
Applications must be completed and received no later than April 1. The College Scholarship Service applications are due to CSS by March 1. A link to download the application is included in the instructions below.





All applicants are required, on an annual basis, to submit the Financial Aid Form to the College Scholarship Service via their Internet address or toll-free phone number and list George T. Welch Trust, Baker Boyer Bank, P.O. Box 1796, Walla Walla, WA 99362 (CSS Code #0254). This part needs to be completed by March 1st. It is vital that we receive this information in our office to assist us in determining your eligibility for a grant. CSS has a registration fee for their service.
Financial need is the primary requirement for a scholarship from the Welch Trust.
Applicant must be a graduate of a Walla Walla County high school.
Grants are available for any three of four years of undergraduate work.
The student’s budget is to be based on school catalog figures. If the student plans to attend a college where the costs run higher than this, the difference is offset by any of the following items: (1) scholarships granted by the school; (2) a work grant from the school; (3) a loan from or sponsored by the school.
The total grant will be paid in August before the school year begins. We will send the grant directly to the college or university after proper documentation is received. However, the college or university will be instructed to return funds if any grading period or subsequent grading period falls below 2.5 GPA.
No grant in excess of $4,000 will be made, except in an unusual or exceptional case.
Grants will be made to married students on an exception basis only.
First-year students will generally be notified of the awarding of grants before graduation from high school.
Grants are made with the understanding that the student will attend school for the full year, as a full-time student, (a minimum of 12 hours). The applicant will be required to sign a statement that a proportionate part of the grant may need to be refunded by the school if he/she drops out of school for any reason or reduces hours to less than 12. The student must contact the Investment Management & Trust Services Division immediately if either situation occurs.
If the student changes his/her plans to attend school or changes schools, the student must notify the Investment Management & Trust Services Division. We have a long waiting list of students who may not be able to attend school without a grant. If the student will not be using his/her grant, he/she should give another student the opportunity.





Complete applications must be made each year!
Important
We urge the student and parents to read this material carefully. It is provided to answer your questions. The General Requirements are especially important. In addition, the following should assist you in making proper plans for the coming school year:





In preparing your final “Statement of Estimated Expenses and Resources” form (enclosed) we encourage you to use your school catalog and common sense. Example: If you attend Walla Walla Community College, use the cost of a nine-month bus pass for transportation rather than the amount listed in the student catalog. Recognize that tuition listed in the school catalog is a firm figure but all other figures are simply estimates. Catalog figures may or may not apply to you and they are simply a guide. The Statement of Estimated Expenses and Resources must be completed and cover the entire school year.
We recognize that you may not have absolute answers for every question when you complete the Statement of Estimated Expenses and Resources but you should be in a position to make reasonable estimates. The purpose of this exercise is for the student to be knowledgeable about his/her own budget and in a position to devote his/her full attention to school having already resolved his/her budget.
If you change your plan about attending school or change schools please notify Baker Boyer Bank. We have a long waiting list of students who may not be able to attend school without a grant. If you will not be using your grant, please give another student the opportunity.
If you must submit your application prior to the date grades are available, the application must include the date grades will be received by the Scholarship Committee (“soon” is not an acceptable date).

The Budget Form must be completed and cover the entire school year.
We recognize that you may not have absolute answers for every question when you complete the Budget Form but you should be in a position to make reasonable estimates. The purpose of this exercise is for the student to be knowledgeable about his or her own budget and in a position to devote their full attention to school having already resolved their budget.
If you change your plan about attending school or change schools please notify Baker Boyer, Trust Department. We have a long waiting list of students who may not be able to attend school without a grant. If you will not be using your grant, please give another student the opportunity.
If you must make a special request for the grant prior to the date grades are available, the written request must include the date grades will be received by the Trust (“soon” is not an acceptable date!)





General Requirements for Scholarships
Applications must be completed and returned prior to April 13th.





Financial need is the primary requirement for a scholarship grant.
Grants are available for all four years of undergraduate work. Applications must be made each year. Postgraduate request for advanced degrees are also available.
Scholarship Requirement: Entering Freshman – 2.5 for junior and senior years of high school(senior grade point to be based on first semester and third quarter grades). All Students: Grades for each grading period must be 2.0 or above. Funds will be withheld for any period or subsequent period that falls below 2.0. Applicant must be from the Milton-Freewater, OR area.
Budget is to be based on school catalog figures. If you are planning on attending a college where the costs run higher than this, the difference is offset by any of the following items:

scholarship granted by the school;
work grant from the school;
a loan from or sponsored by the school.


First-year students will be notified of the awarding of grants at high school graduation
The total grant may be paid at the beginning of the school year directly to the college or university after proper documentation is received. However, the college or university will be instructed to prorate funds equally over a quarter or semester basis.
Grants are made with the understanding that applicant will attend school for the full year as a full-time student. The applicant will be required to sign a statement to the effect that proportionate part of grant will be refunded if student drops out of school for any reason or reduces hours to less than full-time.

D.S. BAKER ADVISORS



 


 







COUNSELOR
We have proven wisdom that creates, grows and secures multi-generational success.

WHO WAS D.S. BAKER?
Dorsey Syng Baker was a visionary young doctor who moved to Walla Walla in 1861 and quickly set to work helping the town prosper. A wise sage who saw possibilities where others might not, he became an early architect of Eastern Washington by bringing in railroads, education, a mercantile and a bank that propelled the region forward.
Today, his entrepreneurial zeal and love of community still serves as the bedrock of Baker Boyer, the bank he co-founded to help grow, protect and secure family legacies for generations.

 WHO WE CAN HELP
D.S. Baker Advisors serve:

Business owners, professionals and families that need complex solutions to their most pressing financial needs
Attorneys, accountants and other professionals looking to partner with the D.S. Baker Advisor team to augment the services provided to their clients

WHAT IS A D.S. BAKER ADVISOR?
D.S. Baker Advisors is a team with diverse expertise who are all focused on one goal: to help local families manage assets to build local legacies. We simplify the wealth journey by bringing together a full panel of wealth management experts—each with a deep knowledge in various aspects of financial planning.

Unethical and irresponsible mortgage department
This is Baker Boyer's Mission Statement and yet nothing could be further from the truth "You are the most important part of Our day. We strive to build a relationship that leads to your financial success. We're always with youÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½whether your goal is to package your financial obligations in a way that allows you to plan for the future, or your focus is on your child's educationÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½we're here to help. We listen. We find solutions. You are the focus of everything we do." 
My families experience with the home loan department has been a catastrophe. This bank has acted unethically and potentially illegally, to the extent, Freddie Mac, the largest Mortgage lender in the U.S. is now investigating their home loan practices and specifically, their mortgage department. Consequently, I encourage you to look elsewhere for your home loan needs. Contrary to their statement "we're here to help," they are not. Should you run into trouble, as in our case, I developed Stage 3 cancer and missed a payment, they were not "there" as they claim. On the contrary, they quickly initiated foreclosure and throughout the 10 month process, routinely lied to us as we struggled to get current and retain our home. They neither "listened" nor did they attempt to "find solutions", despite repeated attempts by government agencies and lawyers to intervene on our behalf. The solutions that we proposed fell on deaf ears.
I once again would recommend that you choose a bank that you can trust. Do your research, ask the right questions. Sadly, we bought into their above mission statement and now we are paying the price.

Excellent service - in person and online
Our initial business with Baker Boyer Bank was opening a mortgage account for a first time home purchase.  As we shopped for a mortgage, we found Baker Boyer's rates to be competitive.  In contrast to the loan center we had also contacted, Bayer Boyer's answers to our questions were clear, and their practices and fees were understandable and consistent with what our research indicated as signs of a reliable lender. Moreover, Baker Boyer Bank indicated that they do not re-sell mortgages to another company -- and this has been true of our home loan.
When we inquired about refinancing a few years later, Baker Boyer offered the best interest rate available, and charged minimal fees for the transaction.  
Since this time, we have migrated most of our banking to Baker Boyer Bank and have been very happy with their service.  
Their online service is and modern and full featured. Features include:
- Records available for a long time (e.g. every transaction for our mortgage account is visible, since the refinance over 15 months ago).  
- Viewable images of cashed checks (front and back) 
- Electronic download of records to Quicken, MS Money, etc.
- A mobile device app exists
- Electronic bill-pay (free)
The only area where I find this bank limiting at times is that they are a local/regional bank, and they have a limited number of ATM's
