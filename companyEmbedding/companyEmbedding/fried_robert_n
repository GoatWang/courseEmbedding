The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

by Julyne Derrick


    	updated November 08, 2016 
		


So you've fried your hair. You got a little crazy with the curling iron, you stayed out in the sun for days on end or your colorist went overboard dying your black hair platinum. Maybe you put a perm atop a coloring job and fried your hair that way. In any case, if your hair feels like straw, it's fried. But the good news is: there's relief.First of all, you need to lay off the hot tools (flat irons and curling irons) as much as possible and then you need to get your ends trimmed every 3 weeks.







 Then you need to follow these fried hair fixes to repair the damage.Option #1: The simple fixYou need a deep conditioner, stat. Look for a product that contains keratin and is labeled for dry, damaged hair. Run product throughout hair and leave on for several minutes. The product will absorb into your hair shaft and soften your hay-like strands.The time it takes: About 10 minutes, not including the shower. I suggest deep conditioning twice a week the first couple weeks, then continue once a week.Try not to wash your hair every day, water is very drying to hair (not the shampoo). If you take a shower but opt not to wash your hair, protect your hair with a shower cap.Deep conditioners we recommend:Moroccanoil Restorative Hair MaskNeutrogena Clean Replenishing Deep Recovery Hair MaskAmika Obliphica Nourishing MaskMarula Deep Moisture Hair MaskOption #2: Bring in the blowdryerFor this fix, you need a conditioner with cetyl alcohol, according to colorist Robert Ramos in InStyle Magazine.


 "It's an ultrarich fatty acid that helps hair retain moisture," says Ramos. A great conditioner is Kerastase Masquintense. Comb conditioner through hair then blast it with a hair dryer for 15 minutes. Rinse.Option #3: The complicated (but sure) fixWe love this recipe shared by celebrity stylist Chris McMillan outlined in Allure magazine.







 (You may know McMillan as Jennifer Aniston's hairstylist).Step 1: Mix in a bowl 2 tablespoons each of rinse-out conditioner, a leave-in conditioner, a deep conditioner and a hair mask.Step 2: Comb the mixture through clean, damp hair making sure to focus most of the product on mid-shaft down to the ends.Step 3: Wet 2 large towels, wring them out and heat one in a microwave for 1-2 minutes (depending on how hot your microwave gets the towel, you want it tolerable to touch, but steamy warm).Step 4: Wrap hair up in the hot towel while you heat the second towel in microwave.Step 5: Alternate wrapping hair in towels about 2-3 times.This ultra-deep conditioner should be repeated once a week.For more amazing recipes, see Hair Mask Recipes: Homemade Hair Rinses & Hair Masks.Option #4: Cut it offIt may sound crazy, but cutting off damaged hair is the only way to truly repair it. To keep hair in great shape, get a trim every 3 weeks (yes, 3 initially) and swear off razor cuts and styling tools including curling irons, blow dryers and flatirons.Also stay away from any processing, which will only weaken hair further. According to Allure, relaxers are the harshest on hair, followed by bleach, permanent color, demi-permanent dye and then rinses or glazes.
 If you have damaged hair, opt for highlights instead of all-over color and ask your stylist to use a glaze instead of dye if you are going darker. For camouflaging gray hair, stick with demi-permanent formulas.More fixes for fried hair:Hair Mask Recipes for Damaged HairTop Products for Dry, Damaged HairCan You Fix Split Ends?
