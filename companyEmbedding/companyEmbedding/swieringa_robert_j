Saxe Lectures (1996): Swieringa R.J. FASB in My Rear View Mirror

FASB IN MY REAR VIEW MIRROR 
by
            Robert J. Swieringa (1)
            Dean,
            Johnson School of Management, 
            Cornell University
            April 22, 1996 
[Introductory note: Robert J. Swieringa 
            was appointed to the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) in 
            1986 and remained a member for 10 years. He is currently the dean 
            of the Johnson School of Management at Cornell University.



Dr. Swieringa was a recipient of the Justice Foundation 
              Award for outstanding teaching at Cornell, where he was a professor 
              of accounting for 11 years. Prior to teaching at Cornell, he was 
              on the faculty at the Stanford University Graduate School of Business. 
              He has been an active consultant and member of the board of directors 
              of two closely-held corporations.
Dr. Swieringa earned his A.B. degree at Augustana 
              College in Rock Island, Illinois, an M.B.A. at the University of 
              Denver, and a Ph.D. at the University of Illinois. He received the 
              1989 Outstanding Achievement Award of the Augustana College Alumni 
              Association and the 1994 University of Denver School of Accountancy 
              Alumnus of the Year Award. He has been a member of numerous committees 
              of the American Accounting Association.
He is the co-author of four books: Essentials 
              of Financial Analysis (with Robert T. Sprouse); Some Effects 
              of Participative Budgeting on Managerial Behavior (with Robert 
              H. Moncur); Cases in Financial Accounting (with Thomas R. 
              Dyckman); and Financial Accounting: An Introduction (with 
              Harold Bierman, Jr.). He has also authored or co-authored more than 
              50 articles in scholarly journals, has published several book reviews 
              and technical reports, and has been on the editorial boards of several 
              scholarly journals.]

It is a great honor for me to be here this evening. 
            Baruch College has been blessed with a long tradition of outstanding 
            scholars in accounting. This lecture honors Emanuel Saxe, who, during 
            his 40 years at Baruch, was a professor, chairman of the Accountancy 
            Department, Dean, Morton Wollman Distinguished Professor of Accountancy, 
            and University Distinguished Professor.
One of his students was Abraham Briloff, who was a member of the 
            accounting faculty for 43 years and was the Emanuel Saxe Distinguished 
            Professor of Accountancy. I have been an avid reader of Professor 
            Briloff's articles and used them extensively in my classes over the 
            years.
The title of my lecture this evening is "FASB in My Rear View 
            Mirror." (2) 
            In two months, I will be leaving the FASB after ten and a half years 
            as a member of the Board. Rather than exiting the Merritt Parkway 
            at Exit 40B, I will continue to New Haven, and, quite literally, I 
            will see the FASB (at 401 Merritt 7) in my rear view mirror -- those 
            of you from Connecticut will add the qualifier not exactly."
But tonight, I want to talk figuratively about FASB in my rear view 
            mirror. As I leave the FASB, I look back on accomplishments, disappointments, 
            frustrations, and continuing challenges during those ten years, and 
            I would like to try to put them in perspective.
PERSPECTIVES
I joined the Board in January 1986, following in the footsteps of 
            Robert Sprouse, who was one of the original seven Board members in 
            1973. This was the second time that I tried to follow in his footsteps. 
            The first time was when I inherited his Business 311 Corporate Reporting 
            course at the Stanford Business School in 1973 when he joined the 
            FASB. Robert Sprouse was not an easy professor to follow. He was an 
            outstanding professor. He was also an outstanding Board member.
Arthur Northrop and I were the seventeenth and eighteenth individuals 
            to join the FASB. We joined a very strong Board that included Victor 
            Brown, Donald Kirk, Raymond Lauver, David Mosso, and Arthur Wyatt. 
            (3) At this point, all of those individuals 
            have left the Board. (4)
Agenda Projects
Recently, there has been increased interest in the productivity and 
            efficiency of the FASB. Concerns have been expressed about how long 
            it takes to resolve important issues. My term on the Board provides 
            a perspective about what was and was not achieved during the last 
            ten years.
The Board issued FASB Concepts Statement 6 on elements of financial 
            statements and Statements 87 and 88 about employers' accounting for 
            pensions in December 1985. Nine items were included on the technical 
            agenda at January 1, 1986 (see Table 1). The project on postemployment 
            benefits other than pensions was added in 1979, the projects on accounting 
            for income taxes and consolidations were added in 1982, the projects 
            on financial reporting and changing prices and on nonrefundable loan 
            fees and costs were added in 1984, and the projects on regulated enterprises, 
            insurance company issues, and cash flow statements were added in 1985. 
            Exposure Drafts were issued in December 1985 for the projects on nonrefundable 
            loan fees and costs and on regulated enterprises.
From January 1, 1986, through December 31, 1995, the Board considered 
            80 possible agenda items and added 29 of those items to its technical 
            agenda. Of the 51 items that were not added to the technical agenda, 
            nine items resulted in Technical Bulletins, two items resulted in 
            AICPA pronouncements, and four items were deferred. During that period, 
            the Board completed eight of the initial nine projects, completed 
            21 of the 29 projects added during that period, and removed two items 
            from the agenda. In other words, 31 items (or 82 percent) of the 38 
            available projects were resolved during that period.
At January 1, 1996, the Board had seven items on its technical agenda 
            (see Table 1). The project on consolidations that was added in 1982 
            was not completed during the ten-year period. The other six projects 
            were added during that period, including the financial instruments 
            project that was added in 1986, the present-value-based measurements 
            project that was added in 1988, the earnings per share and liabilities 
            for closure or removal of long-lived assets projects that were added 
            in 1994, and the not-for-profit organizations project about intermediaries 
            and the comprehensive income project that were added in 1995. Exposure 
            Drafts were issued in 1995 for projects on consolidations, transfers 
            of assets and extinguishments of liabilities, and not-for-profit organizations. 
            Exposure Drafts were issued in 1996 on earnings per share, disaggregated 
            disclosures, liabilities related to closure or removal of long-term 
            assets, comprehensive income, and derivatives and hedging activities.
Some Demographics
The 36 standards issued from January 1, 1986, to December 31, 1995, 
            are listed in Table 2. Three observations help to put those standards 
            in perspective. First, the standards differ dramatically in the amount 
            of time and effort that it took to complete them. On average, it took 
            about three years to complete a standard. But, like many averages, 
            that average is somewhat misleading. The range was from four months 
            to almost twelve years, and the median was two years. Ten standards 
            took less than a year to complete. Statements 99, 100, 103, and 108 
            reflected deferrals of effective dates; Statements 102, 104, 111, 
            and 118 were amendments to existing standards; and Statements 112 
            and 119 were narrow-scope standards. Statements 106, 109, and 123 
            took more than ten years to complete. Statements 94, 96, 116, and 
            117 took more than five years to complete.
If the four deferred effective date standards (Statements 99, 100, 
            103, and 108), one technical correction standard (Statement 111), 
            and three narrow amendments (Statements 102, 104, and 118) are eliminated 
            from the analysis, the average becomes about three years and nine 
            months. However, if the three standards that took the longest to complete 
            (Statements 106, 109, and 123) are adjusted from the agenda date to 
            the date when serious work began on the development of a standard, 
            the average again becomes about three years.
Second, the standards were not equally distributed across years. 
            Given that 36 standards were issued in ten years, the average per 
            year was 3.6 standards. But that average also is somewhat misleading. 
            Six standards were issued in 1987 and five standards were issued in 
            1992 and 1995. Four standards were issued in 1988 and 1993, three 
            standards were issued in 1986 and 1989, and two standards were issued 
            in 1990, 1991, and 1994.
Third, the standards were not equally distributed across topics. 
            Eighteen standards focused on three topics -- financial instruments 
            (eight standards), not-for-profit organizations (five standards), 
            and income taxes (five standards). Nine standards focused on three 
            topics -- rate-regulated enterprises (three standards), insurance 
            company issues (three standards), and cash flow statements (three 
            standards). The remaining nine standards focused on nine different 
            topics.
THE STANDARDS
I would like to put the 36 FASB Statements that were issued from 
            1986 through 1995 in context.
1986-1987
 The year 1986 was very hectic. Public hearings were held on nonrefundable 
            loan fees and on regulated enterprises. Projects on accounting for 
            not-for-profit organizations and on financial instruments were added 
            to the technical agenda. Six Exposure Drafts were issued on financial 
            reporting and changing prices, accounting for income taxes, cash flow 
            reporting, universal life insurance contracts, consolidations, and 
            depreciation accounting by not-for-profit organizations. Late in 1986, 
            the Board issued Statement 89 on financial reporting and changing 
            prices, Statement 90 on abandonments and disallowances, and Statement 
            91 on nonrefundable loan fees and costs.
 The hectic pace carried over into 1987. Public hearings were held 
            on income taxes and on consolidations. Statement 92 on accounting 
            for phase-in plans by regulated enterprises, Statement 93 on depreciation 
            accounting by not-for-profit organizations, and an Exposure Draft 
            on sale and leaseback transactions were issued in August 1987. Statement 
            94 on consolidation of majority-owned subsidiaries was issued in October 
            1987; Statement 95 on cash flow statements and an Exposure Draft on 
            disclosures about financial instruments were issued in November 1987, 
            Statement 96 on accounting for income taxes and Statement 97 on universal 
            life insurance contracts were issued in December 1987. Deliberations 
            continued on postemployment benefits other than pensions, stock compensation, 
            rate-regulated enterprises, and contributions to not-for-profit organizations.
1988-1991
 Relatively few standards were issued during 1988-1991. The Board 
            issued four narrow standards in 1988: Statement 98 focused on sale 
            and leaseback transactions, Statements 99 and 100 merely deferred 
            the effective dates of two standards that were issued in 1987, and 
            Statement 101 focused on how to discontinue application of Statement 
            71.
 The Board focused on implementation problems for applying Statement 
            96, reconsidered the direction of the financial instruments project 
            based on comments on the 1987 Exposure Draft, and merged the stock 
            compensation project into the liability and equity phase of the financial 
            instruments project. The Board developed tentative conclusions on 
            the postretirement benefits other than pensions project. Projects 
            on interest methods and on impairment of long-lived assets were added 
            to the technical agenda in 1988.
In 1989, the Board issued Statements 102 and 104, which amended Statement 
            95 on cash flow statements, and issued Statement 103 to defer the 
            effective date of Statement 96. Exposure Drafts on postretirement 
            benefits other than pensions and on disclosures about financial instruments 
            also were issued in 1989. The Board continued to deliberate possible 
            amendments to Statement 96 on income taxes.
The Board issued Statement 105 on disclosures about financial instruments 
            and Statement 106 on postretirement benefits other than pensions in 
            1990. Exposure Drafts on disclosures about the market value of financial 
            instruments and on contributions to not-for-profit organizations were 
            issued in 1990, as well as Discussion Memorandums on impairment of 
            long-lived assets, present-value-based measurements, and distinguishing 
            between debt and equity financial instruments. The Board continued 
            to focus on financial instruments, accounting issues of not-for-profit 
            organizations, and a possible replacement for Statement 96 on income 
            taxes. The Board issued Statement 107 on disclosures about market 
            value of financial instruments and Statement 108 to delay the effective 
            date of Statement 96 on income taxes in 1991. The long-awaited Exposure 
            Draft on accounting for income taxes was issued in 1991, as well as 
            Exposure Drafts on accounting for investments with prepayment risk 
            and Discussion Memorandums on consolidations, financial instruments, 
            and new basis accounting.
1992-1993
The pace quickened again in 1992 and 1993. The Board issued five 
            standards in 1992, including Statement 109 on accounting for income 
            taxes, and four relatively narrow standards: Statement 110 on investment 
            contracts, Statement 111 on technical corrections, Statement 112 on 
            postemployment benefits, and Statement 113 on reinsurance contracts. 
            Also in 1992, the Board added projects on loan impairments and marketable 
            securities to its technical agenda, and issued Interpretation 39 on 
            offsetting and Exposure Drafts on loan impairments, marketable securities, 
            accounting by mutual life insurance companies, financial statements 
            of not-for-profit organizations, and contributions.
In 1993, the Board issued Statement 114 on loan impairments, Statement 
            115 on accounting for marketable securities, Statement 116 on accounting 
            for contributions, and Statement 117 on financial statements of not-for-profit 
            organizations. Exposure Drafts were issued on accounting for stock-based 
            compensation and on impairment of assets, and Interpretation 40 was 
            issued on mutual life insurance and other enterprises. The Board's 
            deliberations focused on derivative financial instruments.
1994-1995
In 1994, the Board issued two narrowly focused standards: Statement 
            118 amended Statement 114, and Statement 119 focused on disclosure 
            about derivative financial instruments. The Board continued to deliberate 
            issues about stock-based compensation, derivatives and hedging, asset 
            impairment, and consolidation policy. The Board issued Exposure Drafts 
            on accounting by mutual life insurance enterprises and on accounting 
            for mortgage servicing rights, and Interpretation 41 on offsetting.
In 1995, the Board issued five standards: Statement 120 on accounting 
            for certain insurance contracts, Statement 121 on impairment of long-lived 
            assets, Statement 122 on mortgage servicing rights, Statement 123 
            on stock-based compensation, and Statement 124 on certain investments 
            held by not-for-profit organizations. The Board also issued Exposure 
            Drafts on consolidated financial statements on transfers of assets 
            and extinguishments of liabilities, and on a proposed interpretation 
            of certain terms in Statement 116. Board deliberations continued on 
            derivatives and hedging, and Exposure Drafts were developed on reporting 
            disaggregated information, earnings per share, and accounting for 
            closure or removal of long-term assets.
The Board is working hard to issue standards on consolidation policy 
            and procedures and on transfers of assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
            before 1996. (5) 
            The Board is also trying to develop Exposure Drafts on derivatives 
            and hedging activities and on comprehensive income. 
            (6)
Accomplishments
I believe that the most significant accomplishment during my time 
            on the Board was Statement 106. It required new information about 
            the obligation and related costs of postretirement health benefits 
            and changed the way people viewed the obligation and related costs. 
            There are various reasons why that standard was successful.


 Statement 87 paved the way for Statement 106. The important 
                battles took place over the extended period to develop and issue 
                Statement 87. Statement 106 was based on the terminology, measures, 
                and approach in Statement 87. Many people were comfortable with 
                the measures and disclosures required by Statement 87. The Board 
                and others expected that over time, postretirement health and 
                other benefits plans would evolve to be like pension benefits 
                plans, and therefore a Statement 87 approach was appropriate. 
              
 Entities were experiencing escalating health care costs, and 
                those increased costs made this issue more important, even in 
                a pay-as-you-go world. 
 Entities were considering amendments to their postretirement 
                health benefit plans and arrangements. The consideration of amendments 
                made some of the arguments for eligibility date more plausible 
                than otherwise. 
 The basic issues of recognition and measurement of a post-retirement 
                health benefit obligation were appealing to matching and measurement 
                advocates. 
 The field test was important in the development of Statement 
                106 because it demonstrated that the obligation could be measured 
                and it revealed how large the numbers were. 
 Six seminars were held from April 1989 through June 1989 to 
                describe and discuss the Exposure Draft. 
 The process used to develop Statement 106 worked reasonably 
                well. At a crucial point in that process, the question changed 
                from whether to recognize and measure the obligation and 
                related cost of postretirement health benefits to how to 
                recognize and measure that obligation and cost.


The second most important accomplishment was the project on not-for-profit 
            accounting. Statements 93, 116, 117, and 124 are having a major impact 
            on the financial reporting of not-for-profit organizations. Members 
            of governing boards and others are finding the new financial statements 
            more understandable and useful because the statements focus on the 
            organization as a whole and on measures of performance and because 
            they will provide a basis for comparing the organization's performance 
            with that of other organizations.
The third most important accomplishment was maintaining the credibility 
            of accounting for rate-regulated enterprises under Statement 71. Statement 
            71 reflected the environment of cost-plus regulation that existed 
            when it was developed. In the mid-1980s, that environment began to 
            change. The costs of new capacity increased dramatically because of 
            double-digit inflation, construction delays, and more stringent nuclear 
            construction requirements after the accident at Three Mile Island. 
            The costs of existing capacity, some of it excess capacity, were also 
            increasing. The large rate increases required to cover those costs 
            focused public attention on electric rates and galvanized opposition 
            to rate increases.
Statements 90 and 92 were responses to those developments and the 
            changing tone of regulation. Discussions that took place during the 
            development of Statement 92 on phase-in plans led to Statement 101 
            about how to discontinue the application of Statement 71. Deregulation 
            of certain industries and changes in the method of regulating others 
            caused several enterprises to discontinue application of Statement 
            71 for all or some of their operations.
In recent years, the natural gas industry and telecommunications 
            industries have been deregulated and restructured. The eight largest 
            telecommunications companies reported restructuring charges in excess 
            of $10 billion and have written off regulatory assets in excess of 
            $30 billion. It is expected that electric utilities also will be deregulated 
            and restructured in the years ahead, resulting in over $100 billion 
            of regulatory and other assets being written off.
Disappointments
The most disappointing standards have dealt with financial instruments. 
            We are in the midst of a sea change in finance. Fundamental changes 
            in global financial markets have transformed the financial activities 
            of all entities. Increased volatility in foreign exchange and interest 
            rates and other market prices have greatly increased market, credit, 
            and liquidity risks. Efforts to manage those financial risks, competition, 
            and government deregulation of financial markets and services, structural 
            changes in the economies and taxation of different countries, and 
            technological advances in computers and information services have 
            stimulated financial innovation.
The FASB was ahead of the curve when it added the project on financial 
            instruments and off-balance-sheet financing to its technical agenda 
            in May 1986. But the FASB has fallen behind the curve in the 1990s. 
            After ten years of effort, we have yet to come to grips with financial 
            instruments. Instead of developing broad standards, the Board has 
            issued a patchwork of inconsistent standards for marketable securities, 
            loan impairment, and other issues.


 Financial instruments include a broad class of items. Some 
                items can be readily valued; other items are difficult to value. 
              
 Financial instruments are held by financial institutions, so 
                trying to deal with those instruments necessarily requires that 
                the Board try to deal with accounting and operating issues that 
                arise in those institutions. 
 Practices for financial instruments have become well established. 
                It is more difficult to change accounting practices when they 
                are well established. 
 Financial instruments are used in a variety of ways. It is 
                difficult to understand their varied uses in setting accounting 
                standards.


Another disappointing project has been consolidations and related 
            matters. Several issues papers from the AICPA provided the impetus 
            for adding this project to the agenda in 1982. Even though the project 
            was added in 1982, it was inactive for a couple of years, and the 
            first staff paper was discussed early in 1986. The Board disagreed 
            with several important details about the economic unit approach advocated 
            in that paper. But, instead of pursuing those details, the Board decided 
            to issue Statement 94 about majority-owned subsidiaries. At this point, 
            in 1996, the Board is still grappling with those details. The fundamental 
            issue in this project is the objective of financial reporting.
A third disappointing item has been the present-value-based measurement 
            project. That project initially was linked with the project on impairment 
            of assets. The interest methods and impairment of assets projects 
            were on a parallel track, with Discussion Memorandums being issued 
            and public hearings being held at about the same times. But the Discussion 
            Memorandum for this project was not successful in defining the issues 
            and alternatives. In addition, deliberations on this project were 
            usurped by projects on loan impairment and asset impairment, and even 
            the example of the warranty obligation used to stimulate discussion 
            drew fire because of ongoing debates about how to measure financial 
            liabilities.
Frustrations
The most frustrating standard was accounting for income taxes. Statement 
            96 was fashioned in a net deferred tax liability world. Discussions 
            about criteria for deferred tax assets shifted from a probability 
            assessment approach to an events approach that reflected very restrictive 
            criteria for recognition. The prospects of tax legislation that would 
            reduce corporate tax rates put considerable pressure on the Board 
            to develop and issue a standard that would make measurement of deferred 
            tax assets and liabilities more responsive to changes in tax rates.
But then, the tax world changed dramatically with the Tax Reform 
            Act of 1986. That Act reduced corporate rates, but it also made the 
            most significant changes in corporate income taxes in history. The 
            Act enlarged the tax base by eliminating many items that had created 
            deferred tax liabilities and added an alternative minimum tax that 
            tied income tax calculations to book income measures, among other 
            provisions. That Act changed interperiod tax allocation from a world 
            of tax credits to, eventually, a world of tax debits. The likely effects 
            of that Act were not well understood in 1986 and 1987.
Then, the Board began serious consideration of postretirement health 
            benefits, and corporate America began its restructuring process. The 
            recognition of liabilities for those benefits and restructuring provisions 
            accelerated the movement to a net tax debit world.
The Board encountered continuing difficulties in dealing with an 
            increasing list of implementation issues, some of which were new and 
            others that were carried over from the debates before the standard 
            was issued. Changes in Board membership and continuing pressures to 
            reconsider decisions in Statement 96 made it even more difficult to 
            reconsider and rethink a recently issued standard. That reconsideration 
            process also exposed a very real limitation of the Board's process 
            -- it focuses on one possible solution at a time. Rejection of that 
            solution often results in a fresh start.
Another very frustrating standard was Statement 123 on stock-based 
            compensation. We could spend the rest of the evening talking about 
            this standard. The development of other standards has reflected political 
            behavior. However, the focus of the stock-based compensation project 
            increasingly was on Washington as the project progressed. People decided 
            to go around the Board's due process. They were told by people in 
            Washington and elsewhere to participate in our process, but their 
            hearts were not in it. In addition, other political agendas were being 
            pursued by various parties that affected the stock-based compensation 
            project.
But we learned many things during that project:


 Valuation of stock-based compensation is widespread among consultants 
                and academics. 
 Some companies trade off salaries and bonuses for stock-based 
                compensation. 
 Some executives choose between bonuses and stock-based compensation. 
              
 Some directors choose between fees and stock-based compensation. 
              
 Some employees receive annual total compensation reports that 
                include the fair value of stock-based compensation. 
 Some companies routinely value stock-based arrangements with 
                professional golfers (Calaway) and with college coaches (shoe 
                companies).


 An analyst from Boston said that the "jack was now out of the 
            box," but AT&T Chairman Robert Allen's remarks last week 
            that at-the-money options have no value at grant date suggest that 
            some senior executives should have participated in the debates on 
            this project. (7) 
            With hindsight, the Board could have proposed a disclosure solution 
            ten years ago.
CHALLENGES
 Controversy has surrounded many of those 36 standards. I would like 
            to conclude by focusing on several challenges we faced in resolving 
            financial reporting issues.
Fair Values
One challenge is whether to expand the use of fair values or market 
            values in financial reporting. The current accounting model is a mixed-attribute, 
            transaction-based model. That model has worked reasonably well over 
            the years, but some believe that this model should be replaced with 
            a fair value model. Fair value is the price that would be obtained 
            under normal conditions between a willing buyer and a willing seller.
The Public Oversight Board of the SEC Practice Section of the AICPA 
            has urged the FASB to study comprehensively the possibility of fair 
            value accounting. The General Accounting Office has recommended that 
            the FASB consider the development of a market value rule for all financial 
            instruments. However, a top-level government working group on financial 
            markets that included Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bensten, Federal Reserve 
            Chairman Alan Greenspan, and SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt urged the 
            FASB to go slow on market value rules for financial instruments, and 
            the AICPA Special Reporting Committee recommended that the FASB not 
            devote attention to value-based accounting at this time.
The debate at the FASB has not been about changing to a different 
            model; rather, it has been about changing the mix of the attributes 
            in the current model. The debate has focused on four areas.
First, we have debated whether fair value should be used to initially 
            measure certain assets. That debate has taken place in the context 
            of contributions (Statement 116), mortgage servicing rights (Statement 
            122), and stock-based compensation (Statement 123). Contributions 
            and stock-based compensation recognized under Statement 123 are required 
            to be measured at fair value, but mortgage servicing rights are required 
            to be measured at carryover basis.
Second, we have debated whether fair value should be used to remeasure 
            certain assets when recorded amounts are not likely to be recovered. 
            That debate has taken place in the context of loan impairment (Statement 
            114) and asset impairment (Statement 121). An assumption inherent 
            in an enterprise's statement of financial position prepared in accordance 
            with generally accepted accounting principles is that recorded amounts 
            for assets will be recovered. If that condition does not hold, recorded 
            amounts should be adjusted. Impaired loans may be recognized at fair 
            value, but impaired assets are required to be recognized at fair value.
Third, we have debated whether fair value should be used to account 
            for certain assets that are readily marketable. That debate has taken 
            place in the context of marketable debt securities (Statement 115). 
            During an extended period of reduced interest rates, financial institutions 
            reported significant amounts of realized gains while concurrently 
            having underwater investment portfolios. That behavior was described 
            as gains trading, "cherry picking," or "snacking." 
            Statement 115 retains amortized cost for some held-to-maturity debt 
            securities. Statement 124 requires that all debt securities held by 
            not-for-profit organizations be accounted for at fair value.
Fourth, we have debated whether fair value should be used to account 
            for certain assets when underlying rights are unbundled. Loans or 
            receivables can be pooled or packaged into homogeneous portfolios 
            and transferred to a trust or special-purpose entity. The trust or 
            entity can then issue debt or equity securities that are securitized 
            by those receivables. Through the securitization process, receivables 
            have been unbundled into rights and obligations. An Exposure Draft 
            that was issued in October 1995 proposed that some of those rights 
            and obligations should be recorded at fair value and some should be 
            recorded at carryover basis.
The debate about fair value currently is taking place in discussions 
            about accounting for derivatives. We have been told by the SEC chairman 
            that the three most important issues in financial reporting are derivatives, 
            derivatives, and derivatives. Statement 119 improved disclosures about 
            the way entities use derivatives. But, until recently, the Board has 
            been at an impasse about how to account for derivatives and hedges.
The challenge of whether to expand the use of fair values in financial 
            reporting is being driven by the ongoing development of markets and 
            the development of methods to approximate prices in those markets. 
            The sweep of the sea change in finance has raised questions about 
            the continued use of amortized cost for many financial instruments.
Present Values
A second challenge is whether to expand the use of present-value-based 
            measurements in financial reporting. APB Opinion 21, which was issued 
            in August 1971, requires the use of present values for receivables 
            and payables. Yet, a close reading of Opinion 21 reveals that the 
            use of that method is limited to contractual rights to receive or 
            pay money on fixed or determinable dates. Moreover, trade receivables, 
            purchase deposits, security deposits, lending activities, intercompany 
            transactions, and certain other tax-related or restricted receivables 
            and payables are excluded from the requirements of Opinion 21. Recent 
            debates have focused on whether present-value-based measurements should 
            be used in accounting for loan impairment (Statement 114), asset impairment 
            (Statement 121), provisions for credit losses, and certain environmental 
            liabilities.
The Board issued an Exposure Draft in February 1996 that focuses 
            on accounting for obligations for certain closure or removal costs 
            of long-lived assets such as nuclear power plants. Measuring those 
            obligations requires estimates of uncertain future events. The amounts 
            and timing of expected future payments for closure or removal activities 
            have to be projected over periods ranging from 40 to 60 years, those 
            payments have to be discounted back to their present value at an assumed 
            interest or discount rate to reflect the time value of money, and 
            the discounted amounts have to be allocated between current and future 
            accounting periods. Between now and then, laws and technologies may 
            change. Actual payments may differ dramatically from expected amounts.
The challenge of whether to expand the use of present values in financial 
            reporting is being driven by assets and liabilities that are far removed 
            from contractual rights to receive or pay money on fixed or determinable 
            dates. The focus is on risky assets and risky liabilities for which 
            actual cash flows may differ dramatically from expected amounts.
Use of Estimates
A third challenge is whether to expand the use of estimates in financial 
            reporting. The use of fair values and present values reflects the 
            use of estimates of cash flows and of other factors in valuation.
Accounting tends to be viewed as objective and precise and as reflecting 
            measures of past transactions and events. Yet, those measures are 
            based on assumptions or estimates about future events.
Estimates are becoming more prevalent because contract relations 
            are increasingly prevalent. Accounting for contracts is easy if they 
            are simple, discrete, and of short duration; if they reflect limited 
            relations among the parties; and if precise measures exist for objects 
            of exchange, no further cooperation is anticipated, and no sharing 
            relations exist.
Accounting for contracts is difficult if contractual relations are 
            complex and of long duration; if they reflect close relations among 
            the parties; and if some objects of exchange cannot be measured currently, 
            some future cooperation is anticipated, sharing relations exist, some 
            troubles are anticipated, and interactions are assumed. Complex contractual 
            relations exist for parent and subsidiary relations, financial instruments, 
            contributions, postretirement benefit arrangements, compensation plans, 
            insurance arrangements, warranty and service arrangements, regulated 
            enterprises, software contracts, and so forth.
Accounting for objects of exchange that cannot be measured currently 
            makes extraordinary demands on accountants as measurers. Consider 
            postretirement health benefits -- arrangements that may cover up to 
            80 years. The benefits are in kind and indexed rather than fixed; 
            the contracts are not well-defined, like pension contracts; and the 
            contracts are changing as arrangements evolve.
Also consider reclamation costs that can cover up to 90 years, decommissioning 
            costs for nuclear power plants, and the costs of significant extended 
            warrantees. All of those costs rely heavily on estimates of uncertain 
            future events to make initial and subsequent measurements. Accountants 
            are increasingly making interim measures of unfolding events. Estimates 
            are difficult; changes in estimates are prevalent.
Recent debates have focused on accounting for restructurings. A restructuring 
            occurs when an entity makes a fundamental change in its business strategy, 
            operations, or structure in hope of achieving improved results of 
            operations in future periods, often as a result of reduced costs. 
            Companies in industries that have been deregulated have reported significant 
            restructuring charges.
Restructuring charges have included costs of employee benefits, such 
            as costs of severance and termination benefits; costs associated with 
            the elimination and reduction of product lines; costs to consolidate 
            or relocate plant facilities; costs for new system development or 
            acquisition; costs to retrain employees to use newly deployed systems; 
            and losses on asset impairments and disposals of assets.
In 1994, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) discussed and reached 
            several consensuses in Issue 94-3 about when an entity should recognize 
            a liability and an expense for costs associated with a restructuring. 
            In addition, Statement 121 addresses the accounting for the impairment 
            of long-lived assets to be held and used by an entity and for long-lived 
            assets to be disposed of. EITF Issue 94-3 and Statement 121 likely 
            will result in lower restructuring liabilities and charges and in 
            increased visibility of restructuring activities. However, EITF Issue 
            94-3 and Statement 121 now have been added to the tangled web of pronouncements 
            that may apply to restructuring activities. The challenge of whether 
            to expand the use of estimates in financial reporting is being driven 
            by the increased reliance on contractual relations and by the increased 
            uncertainty associated with judgments, assumptions, and estimates.
Distinctions between Organizations
The challenges of whether to expand the use of fair values, present 
            values, and the use of estimates all relate to matters of valuation 
            and measurement. A fourth challenge is whether to distinguish between 
            organizations in financial reporting.
Distinctions between organizations are part of the fabric of generally 
            accepted accounting principles. Those principles developed by industry 
            and their codification became the articulation of generally accepted 
            accounting principles. However, distinctions between organizations 
            are becoming blurred.
Consider the distinction between governmental entities and other 
            entities. That distinction is central to the jurisdiction agreement 
            between the FASB and the GASB. That agreement requires that the FASB 
            and the GASB distinguish between entities.  
            (8) Yet, some organizations are both private 
            and public. Cornell University, where I spent almost twelve years, 
            is both governmental and private. Moreover, governmental and other 
            organizations are increasingly engaging in the same transactions and 
            competing in the same markets. Health care organizations provide both 
            immediate and real examples.
A distinction is also made between not-for-profit organizations and 
            other entities. But, increasingly, not-for-profit organizations and 
            for-profit entities are operating in the same markets. Not-for-profit 
            organizations have frequently moved into service areas previously 
            dominated by for-profit entities (e.g., vocational rehabilitation, 
            job placement, family, and other human services), and for-profit entities 
            have moved into service areas previously dominated by not-for-profit 
            organizations (e.g., health clubs and health care providers).
Distinctions are also made between financial and other entities. 
            Specialized accounting exists for financial institutions and different 
            requirements exist for savings and loans, banks, finance companies, 
            insurance companies, and credit unions. But some financial institutions 
            have all of those entities. A company like Citicorp has savings and 
            loans, banks, finance companies, and insurance companies. And some 
            nonfinancial institutions have savings and loans, banks, finance companies, 
            and insurance companies. Those entities engage in the same transactions 
            and compete in the same markets. It is not desirable to have different 
            accounting treatments that depend on which entity engages in a transaction.
And, distinctions are made between U.S. and other organizations. 
            We tend to accept the view that because different practices, legal 
            systems, capital markets, tax systems, technical methods, social norms, 
            and so forth exist across countries, different accounting treatments 
            are appropriate. Yet, increasingly, entities in different countries 
            are engaging in the same transactions and competing in the same markets. 
            In particular, those entities are seeking capital in the same capital 
            markets.
International Accounting Standards
A fifth challenge is international accounting standards. The FASB 
            has become more active with standard-setting organizations around 
            the world as the market for accounting standards has become global. 
            The Board has worked closely with standard setters in other countries 
            and with the International Accounting Standards Committee (IASC).
In January 1996 the FASB issued Exposure Drafts on segment reporting 
            and on earnings per share calculations. The segments Exposure Draft 
            was a joint effort between the FASB and the Accounting Standards Board 
            of the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants, which simultaneously 
            issued an identical exposure draft. The EPS Exposure Draft is very 
            similar to one issued by the IASC, with which we coordinated our efforts. 
            Other publications that have resulted from joint efforts include special 
            reports on financial reporting in North America (with Canada and Mexico) 
            and on future events, hedge accounting, and provisioning (with Australia, 
            Canada, the United Kingdom, and the IASC).
During 1995, the FASB formed an "American Free Trade Agreement 
            Committee for Cooperation on Financial Reporting" with representatives 
            of Canada, Mexico, and Chile to explore areas in which the four countries 
            could more fully cooperate on minimizing differences in their accounting 
            standards.
The Board has become more active in IASC activities. A member of 
            the FASB is a member of the IASC Consultative Group and responds to 
            IASC proposals and attends IASC meetings.
The Board has exchanged staff members with the Australian Accounting 
            Research Foundation, has had an intern from Japan, and an accountant 
            from China will join the staff. An FASB staff member is working with 
            the U.K. Accounting Standards Board, and a former FASB staff member 
            and consultant is an international accounting fellow at the IASC. 
            The Board has encouraged visits with standard setters and staff from 
            other countries, has shared its work product with other countries, 
            and has focused on international standards in discussing financial 
            reporting issues.
The FASB is committed to promoting the development and acceptance 
            of superior international accounting standards. The Board will work 
            with other standard-setting organizations to reduce differences in 
            national accounting standards, promote cooperative relations and communication 
            between the FASB and other standard-setting organizations, and strengthen 
            and formalize its internal policies and procedures for international 
            activities. The FASB also will complete an IASC-U.S. accounting standards 
            comparison study that analyzes similarities and differences and assesses 
            their significance and implications. The results of that study will 
            be disseminated broadly.
However, the FASB must decide soon how to respond to the potential 
            acceptance of IASC standards in U.S. capital markets. Foreign issuers 
            and others are pushing for acceptance of IASC standards by the SEC. 
            U.S. companies want a level playing field vis-a-vis foreign issuers. 
            Emerging markets need accounting standards as a basis for financial 
            reporting. How the FASB responds to these developments may be the 
            most significant and critical actions it takes in the 1990s.
CONCLUSION
Congressman Henry Hyde of Illinois has said that when he came to 
            Washington he wanted to change the world. Now he feels lucky if he 
            can leave the room with dignity.
I didn't come to the Board to change the world, but I have had an 
            extraordinary opportunity to help shape 36 standards, or about 30 
            percent of the FASB's 124 Statements of Financial Accounting Standards. 
            (9)
The great American philosopher Ann Landers has said that there are 
            three types of people in the world: Those who make things happen, 
            those who watch things happen, and those who ask, "What happened?" 
            I have had a very special opportunity to make things happen in financial 
            reporting.
When I was at Stanford and Cornell, happiness was teaching and research 
            about accounting issues. Then I thought that joining the FASB would 
            be happiness. For someone who has a keen interest in financial reporting, 
            the FASB has been a wonderful opportunity to learn about accounting 
            issues that are swirling anywhere in the world. I have been enthralled 
            by those issues and by the judgments that I have been asked to make. 
            And I have enjoyed working with the people of the FASB and others 
            who participate in the various social networks and organizations of 
            standard setting. Standard setting is inherently a social activity, 
            and I have worked with and developed friendships with some terrific 
            people.
But, now, happiness is returning to teaching and research and the 
            world of academe, and seeing FASB in my rear view mirror.

Abstract:
The accounting model used today is one developed during the Industrial
Age. The debate
at the FASB has not been whether to use fair value, but when to use
fair value. Estimates
for uncertainties have become increasingly complex and difficult as
exemplified by the
accounting for postretirement health-care benefits and for obligations
for certain closure
or removal costs of long-lived assets such as nuclear plants. The current
accounting
model will be challenged by more flexible and fluid organizational
arrangements, increased
investments in intangible assets, more extensive use of financial instruments
to manage
various risks, and changes in information technology.

[Headnote]
Some profound and thoughtFul observations for the next 100 years
We come to an age of technology, information, and global competition
with a financial accounting
model that was fashioned almost 100 years ago. In the early twentieth
century, the balance sheet was
the most important financial statement. Cost was viewed as a practical
and satisfactory basis of
valuation for assets held for use or sale, except that fixed assets
were depreciated and inventories
sometimes were written down to amounts that were below cost.
The historical cost, transaction-based model that emerged in the early
1900s generally has served us
well over the years. But several areas are unclear and continue to
present challenges.
Fair Value
The current accounting model is a mixed- attribute, transaction-based
model. It is often described as
based on historical costs; but the attributes are not limited to historical
costs-current market values, net
realizable values, and present values are used too.
That mixed-attribute model has worked reasonably well over the years.
But some believe the
mixed-attribute model should be replaced with a fair-value model. Fair
value is the price that would be
obtained under normal conditions between a willing buyer and a willing
seller.
The Public Oversight Board of the SEC Practice Section of the AICPA
urged the FASB to study
comprehensively the possibility of fair value accounting. The GAO recommended
the FASB consider
the development of a market value rule for all financial instruments.
However, a top-level government
working group on financial markets that included former Treasury Secretary
Lloyd Benston, Federal
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, and SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt, urged
the FASB to go slow on
market value rules for financial instruments, and the AICPA Special
Reporting Committee
recommended that the FASB not devote attention to value-based accounting
at this time. The
Association for Investment Management and Research (AIMR) has authorized
a comprehensive study
and report of the opinions of the entire AIMR membership on the role
of market values in financial
reporting.
Most recently, the GAO, in its report, The Accounting Profession's Major
Issues: Progress and
Concerns, stated its concerns about the mixed model and made a pitch
for financial instruments at fair
value and more forward-looking information about opportunities and
risks.
The debate at the FASB has not been about changing to a different model.
Rather, the debate has
been about changing the mix of the attributes in the current model.
The debate has not been whether to
use fair values, but when to use fair values. The debate has focused
on four questions.
Should Fair Value Be Used to Initially Measure Certain Assets? That
debate has taken place in the
context of contributions (FASB Statement No. 116, Accounting for Contributions
Received and
Contributions Made), mortgage servicing rights (FASB Statement No.
122, Accounting for Mortgage
Servicing Rights), and stockbased compensation (FASB Statement No.
123, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation). Contributions and stock-based compensation
are required to be
recognized at fair value, but mortgage servicing rights are required
to be recognized at carryover basis.
Should Fair Value Be Used to Re Remeasure Certain Assets if Recorded
Amounts Are Not Likely to
Be Recovered? That debate has taken place in the context of loan impairment
(FASB Statement No.
114, Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan) and asset impairment
(FASB Statement No.
121, Accounting for the Impairment of LongLived Assets and for Long-Lived
Assets to Be Disposed
of). An assumption inherent in an enterprise's statement of financial
position prepared in accordance
with GAAP is that recorded amounts for assets will be recovered. If
that condition does not hold,
recorded amounts generally are adjusted. But, should those amounts
be adjusted to fair value?
Impaired loans may be measured at fair value, but impaired long-lived
assets are required to be
measured at fair value.
Should Fair Value Be Used to Account for Certain Assets that Are Readily
Marketable? That debate
has taken place in the context of marketable debt securities (FASB
Statements No.115, Accounting
for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, and No. 124,
Accounting for Certain
Investments Held by Not-for-Profit Organizations). During an extended
period of reduced interest
rates, financial institutions reported significant amounts of realized
gains while concurrently having
underwater investment portfolios. That behavior was described as gains
trading, cherry picking, or
snacking. Statement No. 115 retains amortized cost for some held-tomaturity
debt securities, but
Statement No. 124 requires that not-for-profit organizations account
for all debt securities at fair
value.
Should Fair Value Be Used to Account for Certain Assets When Underlying
Rights Are Changed or
Unbundled? Loans or receivables can be pooled or packaged into homogeneous
portfolios and
transferred to a trust or special-purpose entity that then issues debt
or equity securities. Through the
securitization process, receivables are changed or unbundled into new
rights and obligations. Should
those rights and obligations be recorded at fair value? FASB Statement
No. 125, Accounting for
Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of
Liabilities, requires that some of
those rights and obligations be recorded at fair value and that some
be recorded at carryover basis.
Uncertainties
Another unclear area under the traditional model is how to deal with
uncertainties. Uncertainties about
valuations are largely avoided by relying on amounts established in
bargained exchange transactions.
Yet, the results of transactions must be classified, and assets and
liabilities represent future benefits or
sacrifices. Some wish to minimize uncertainty by expensing all costs
when incurred, unless there is
clear evidence of future benefit, by requiring a rigorous association
of costs and revenues, or by
minimizing the use of estimates and allocations by sticking as close
to cash accounting as possible.
Accounting tends to be viewed as objective and precise and as reflecting
measures of past
transactions and events. Yet, those measures are based on assumptions
or estimates about future
events. All balance-sheet accounts reflect estimates and assumptions.
Estimates are becoming more prevalent because contractual relationships
are becoming more
prevalent. Accounting for contracts is easy if they are simple, discrete,
and of short duration; if they
reflect limited relations between the parties; if precise measures
exist for objects of exchange; if no
future cooperation is anticipated, and if no sharing relations exist.
Accounting for contracts is difficult if contractual relationships are
complex and of long duration, if they
reflect close relations between the parties, if some objects of exchange
cannot be measured currently,
if some future cooperation is anticipated, if sharing relations exist,
if some troubles are anticipated, and
if interactions are assumed.
Complex contractual relationships exist for parent and subsidiary affiliations,
financial instruments,
contributions, postretirement benefit arrangements, compensation plans,
insurance arrangements,
warranty and service arrangements, regulated enterprises, software
contracts, and so forth.
Accounting for objects of exchange that cannot be measured currently
makes extraordinary demands
on accountants as measurers. Consider postretirement health-care benefits-arrangements
that may
cover up to 80 years. Those benefits are in kind and indexed rather
than fixed, the contracts are not as
well defined as pension contracts are, and contracts are changing as
arrangements evolve.
But, also consider reclamation costs that can cover up to 90 years,
decommissioning costs, and the
costs of significant extended warranties. All of those costs rely heavily
on estimates of uncertain future
events to make initial and subsequent measurements. Accountants are
increasingly making interim
measures of unfolding events. Estimates are diffcult; changes in estimates
are prevalent.
Consider the February 1996 FASB Exposure Draft-Accounting for Certain
Liabilities for Closure or
Removal Costs of Long-Lived Assets. Measuring those liabilities for
long-lived assets such as nuclear
power plants requires estimates of uncertain future events. The amounts
and timing of expected future
payments for closure or removal activities have to be projected over
periods ranging from 40 to 60
years. The payments have to be discounted back to their present value
at an assumed interest or
discount rate to reflect the time value of money, and the discounted
amounts have to be allocated
between current and future accounting periods. Between now and then,
laws and technologies may
change. Actual payments may differ dramatically from expected amounts.
The expanded use of estimates in financial reporting is being driven
by the increased reliance on
contractual relationships and by the increased uncertainty associated
with judgments, assumptions, and
estimates.
A New World
The financial accounting model we bring to the new era was shaped by
the existing corporate
arrangements for large, complex, and more or less permanent business
enterprises that invested
heavily in tangible assets. That model will be challenged by more flexible
and fluid organizational
arrangements, increased investments in intangible or "soft" assets,
more extensive use of financial
instruments to manage various risks, and changes in information technology.
Alliances and Partnerships. There is an increased use of alliances and
partnerships between
telecommunications, entertainment, and information services companies;
between pharmaceutical
companies; between software companies; and between technology companies.
The term "merger lite"
has been used to describe arrangements in which talent and resources
are combined, but each partner
retains the right to link with others and retains its financial and
other resources.
Where some alliances and partnerships reflect well-defined legal boundaries
that are supported by
contractual agreements, others reflect organizational arrangements
that transcend legal boundaries by
using the talent, resources, or governance structure of more than one
entity. A "virtual entity" is formed
to emphasize functional considerations. Highly specific assets are
committed to the new arrangements,
and those assets are integrated to develop and deliver products and
services to the market, but the
ownership of those assets is retained by the partner entities.
Alliances and partnerships essentially decouple decision rights from
access to talent, resources, and
sharing relations. Generally, the equity method is used to account
for investments in alliances and
partnerships, but those investments may represent only one of the many
features of the arrangements.
Other companies are spinning off single-product or single-function companies.
A technology company
(Thermo Electron) that testified at the public hearing about the October
1995 FASB Exposure Draft,
Consolidated Financial Statements: Policy and Procedures, has multiple
public subsidiaries, each with
joint ventures, licensing arrangements, and other links that form and
dissolve in just months or even
weeks. The company spins out certain of its businesses into separate
subsidiaries that then sell a
minority interest to outside investors. As a result of those sales
and similar transactions, the company
records gains in income that represent the company's increased net
investment in its subsidiaries.
Those gains have represented a substantial portion of the net income
reported by the company in
recent years. That company has brought the decoupling of decision rights
and residual claims and the
reporting of those gains to a new art form. Other companies are following
the example of Thermo
Electron.
Intangible or "Soft" Assets. Attention is shifting away from tangible
assets to intangible assets.
Companies that are building soft assets are now among the fastest growing
segments of our economy.
Service companies are investing significant amounts in employee and
other training, technology
companies are making significant investments in intellectual capital
and research and development, and
retailers and others are investing in internallydeveloped brands, customer
loyalty, and satisfaction
levels.
The SEC held a symposium on intangible assets in April 1996. The objective
of the symposium was to
identify specific financial reporting problems and to explore potential
improvements to the financial
reporting model.
The accounting issues about intangible assets are not new. In the late
196Os and early 1970s, there
was a great deal of interest in recognizing investments in research
and development and in human
resources. A subfield called human resource accounting emerged and
flourished. However, a
watershed event was the issuance of FASB Statement No. 2, Accounting
for Research and Develop
ment Costs, in 1974. That statement required that all research and
development costs as defined be
charged to expense when incurred.
In issuing Statement No. 2, the Board expressed concerns about the high
degree of uncertainty about
future benefits of individual research and development projects at
the time the costs are incurred and
the lack of a direct causal relationship between expenditures and benefits.
The Board concluded that
although future benefits from a particular research and development
project could be foreseen, they
generally could not be measured with a reasonable degree of certainty
and therefore failed to satisfy
the suggested measurability test for accounting recognition as an asset.
In March 1996, the FASB received a letter from the Software Publishers
Association that requested
that the Board reconsider FASB Statement No. 86, Accounting for the
Costs of Computer Software
to Be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed. The letter noted that where
Statement No. 86 was
based on an inventory model approach, sales of software have become
more analogous to services or
subscriptions than to inventoried goods.
The letter observed that the product cycle has shortened from several
years in the mid-1980s to
18-24 months in the mid-1990s to less than 12 months today. Software
development is increasingly
funded by periodic maintenance fees, database software often is updated
on a daily basis, and some
online services charge on a number-of-images-used basis. Software companies
find it increasingly
difficult to meet the "technological feasibility" criteria of Statement
No. 86.
The Software Publishers Association believes realization of software
assets has become increasingly
uncertain because of ever increasing volatility in the software marketplace,
compressed product
cycles, increased competition, and diverging technology platforms.
It further believes that capitalized
costs no longer are relevant to most users of financial statements
and that the cost and effort to
develop the information required by Statement No. 86 do not justify
the benefit from recording an
asset. Given the high degree of uncertainty in the product development
cycle of most software, the
association believes that software development costs should be classified
as research and
development expenses and charged to expense when incurred.
Financial Instruments. In the past 20 to 25 years there has been an
increased use of financial
instruments. We have experienced a sea change in finance. Fundamental
changes in global financial
markets have transformed the financial activities of all entities.
Increased volatility in foreign exchange
and interest rates and other market prices have greatly increased market,
credit, and liquidity risks.
Efforts to manage those financial risks, competition, and government
deregulation in financial markets
and services; structural changes in the economies and taxation of different
countries; and technological
advances in computers and information services have stimulated financial
innovation.
The Board's decision to add the project on financial instruments and
off-balancesheet financing to its
technical agenda in May 1986 was, in part, a response to that sea change
in finance. That project was
expected to develop broad standards for resolving accounting issues
raised by financial instruments as
well as those raised by the inconsistent accounting guidance and practice
that had developed for those
instruments over the years.
Where the FASB may have been somewhat ahead of the curve in 198(, it
has fallen behind in the
1990s. After 10 years of effort, the Board has yet to come to grips
with financial instruments. Instead
of developing broad standards, the Board has issued a patchwork of
inconsistent standards for
marketable securities, loan impairment, and other issues. Those standards
have been contentious
because they have raised questions about the continued reliance on
bargained exchanges and
amortized cost.
The debate about financial instruments currently is focusing on derivatives.
There is limited guidance
about how to account for derivatives. The authoritative literature
does not specifically cover many
derivatives, so accounting for them is based on analogy to existing
literature or on what has been done
elsewhere in similar circumstances. Often the accounting depends on
the intended use of the derivative
and what is said to be the economics of the transaction. Derivatives
are accounted for differently
depending on whether they are intended to be used as a hedging instrument.
Some derivatives that
receive hedge accounting treatment may actually increase the enterprise's
exposure to risk.
FASB Statement No. 119, Disclosure About Derivative Financial Instruments
and Fair Value of
Financial Instruments, improved disclosures of information about the
way entities use derivatives. But,
improved disclosures are not likely to be sufficient. The value of
some derivatives can change many
times faster and many times more than that of most traditional assets
and liabilities.
The FASB has been at an impasse about how to account for derivatives
and hedges. The hedge
accounting model currently used for derivatives is the deferral method.
That method, which dates back
to the early 1900s and was developed for simple hedging arrangements,
links changes in the values of
the derivative to a balance or transaction with exposure to market
risk and defers certain unrealized
and realized gains and losses in the interest of "matching." The method
is complex and its effects are
not readily apparent to users of financial statements. The authoritative
literature has limited the use of
that method to specific circumstances. A fundamental issue is whether
that method should be applied
more generally. The FASB Exposure Draft on Accounting for Derivative
and Similar Financial
Instruments and for Hedging Activities was issued in June 1996. While
proposing that all derivatives
be measured at fair value, it maintains many of the concepts of the
historic hedge accounting model.
Crossroads
The existing mixed-attribute, transaction-based financial reporting
model has exhibited incredible
staying power over the years. That model made the transition from farm
to factory, and survived the
challenges of the inflationary 1970s and the financial-institution
crisis of the 1980s. It also is important
to recognize that many of the challenges are at the margin and are
not central to the model.
However, I believe financial reporting faces an important crossroads.
A crossroads is defined as a
place where two or more roads meet, as a place where different cultures
meet, or as a crucial point or
place.
Two very different paths are being advocated at this crucial point.
One path is to delimit financial
reporting. Some believe financial reporting has strayed too far from
the reporting model that emerged
in the early 1900s. Some believe more reliance should be placed on
price aggregates that result from
bargained exchanges and on matching revenues and expenses to measure
income. Concerns have
been expressed about the increased use of fair values, present values,
and estimates in financial
reporting.
Some are concerned that smaller entities are no longer preparing and
issuing general-purpose financial
statements based on generally accepted accounting principles. Some
also are concerned about the
costs of developing those financial statements and the extensive disclosures
that are included.
Concerns also have been expressed about the usefulness and cost effectiveness
of existing disclosures
and about the increasing volume of disclosures in financial statements.
Some have called for the
elimination of less useful disclosures and for elimination of redundant
requirements that result in
essentially the same information being repeated in various sections
of a financial report.
The other path is to expand financial reporting. Some believe too much
reliance continues to be placed
on bargained exchanges and on matching revenues and expenses to measure
income. Some believe
that value added by productive activity, discovery values, and gains
and losses from price changes and
other changes should be recognized in financial statements.
Some believe financial reports should provide more information about
plans, opportunities, risks, and
uncertainties; should focus more on the factors that create longer-term
value; and should better align
information reported externally with the information reported internally.
I don't know which path will be taken. But the outcome of two recent
initiatives may provide some
indication about the future path of financial reporting.
The first initiative is the February 1996 FASB Invitation to Comment,
Recommendations of the
AICPA Special Committee on Financial Reporting and the Association
for Investment Management
and Research, that solicits views on the recommendations made in the
December 1994 report of the
AICPA Special Committee on Financial Reporting. That report recommended
the development of a
comprehensive model of business reporting that would include financial
and nonfinancial data,
management's analysis of those data, forward-looking information, information
about management and
shareholders, and background about the company.
The Invitation to Comment also solicits views on the recommendations
expressed in the November
1993 position paper of the AIMR. That report describes financial analysis
and discusses globalization
of capital markets, accessibility of computing power, and the increase
in economic activities that do
not "fit" within the historic cost accounting model. That report discusses
the qualitative characteristics
of financial reporting and recommends improvements for financial reporting
issues that the AIMR
believes will be significant during the 1990s and beyond.
The second initiative is the June 1996 FASB Exposure Draft on Reporting
Comprehensive Income.
That proposal can be viewed as a relatively insignificant effort to
tidy up the reporting of certain items
that bypass the income statement and are reported directly in equity.
But that view does not
adequately reflect the potential of reporting comprehensive income.
Many people have strongly resisted attempts to include gains and losses
from price and other changes
in reported earnings. Reporting comprehensive income provides a way
to recognize those gains and
losses outside of earnings. Reported earnings can continue to be transactionbased
and cost-based,
and gains and losses from price and other changes can be recognized
as a component of
comprehensive income and reported in statements of income or financial
performance. Reporting
comprehensive income would
facilitate articulation of financial statements and would make nonowner
changes in equity distinct and
transparent. be consistent with the United Kingdom's "statement of
total recognized gains and losses"
that was introduced as a supplement to the "profit and loss account."
be consistent with the comprehensive statement of activities that is
required by FASB Statement No.
117, Financial Statements of Not-for-Profit Organizations.
be consistent with a growing literature about accounting-based valuation
and comprehensive income.
Discussions on these two initiatives will play an important role in
determining the future path of financial
reporting. All the items on the FASB's technical agenda will be completed
or very near completion in a
short period of time. Important decisions will be made in the months
ahead.
[Sidebar]
In Brief
At the Crossroads
The accounting model used today is one developed during the Industrial
Age. It has served us well over the
years, but several areas are unclear and continue to present challenges.
The debate at the FASB has not been whether to use fair value, but
when to use fair value.
Estimates for uncertainties have become increasingly complex and difficult
as exemplified by the accounting
for postretirement health-care benefits and for obligations for certain
closure or removal costs of long-lived
assets such as nuclear power plants.
The current accounting model will be challenged by more flexible and
fluid organizational arrangements,
increased investments in intangible or soft assets, more extensive
use of financial instruments to manage
various risks, and changes in information technology.
Former FASB member Robert Swierenga's observations clearly and thoughtfully
present the challenges for the
next generation of standard setting. As he states, we are indeed at
the crossroads in financial reporting.

in the practice of accounting at

   Interview with Dr. Robert J. Swieringa | Daniels College of Business                                    Select Page     Choose CategoryBlogNewsEvents Choose DepartmentAccountancyBusiness AnalyticsDaniels Career ServicesDenver MBAEntrepreneurshipEthicsExecutive EducationExecutive MBAFinanceHospitality ManagementManagementMarketingProfessional MBAReal Estate and Construction ManagementUndergraduate Programs    Interview with Dr. Robert J. Swieringa by Daniels College of Business | Aug 10, 2011 | Accountancy, Blog | 0 commentsThis afternoon, I was humbled to speak with one of the leaders in the world of accounting, Dr. Robert J. Swieringa. Dr. Swieringa is a Daniels alumnus with a jaw-dropping resume. To name just a few of his many accomplishments, he was the Dean of the Johnson Graduate School of Management at Cornell University, a Board Member at the Financial Accounting Standards Board, and the Chair of the Board of Directors of the Graduate Management Admissions Council (the organization which creates the GMAT). Currently, he is a Professor of Accounting at Cornell, a member of the Board of Trustees of Augustana College, a member of the Board of Managers of the Partners Group Private Equity Fund, and a member of the Board of Directors of General Electric. Dr. Swieringa kindly took half an hour out of his busy schedule to enlighten me with his wisdom. Here are some of the things I learned from our conversation.Forgive. When I called Dr. Swieringa, I thought I was completely prepared for our interview. The plan was to interview him on a landline set to speaker phone, and to record the conversation using a colleague’s cell phone. Unfortunately, as soon as I dialed Dr. Swieringa’s number and prepared to press “Record” on the cell phone, I realized that the cell phone had timed out and was password protected. Dr. Swieringa was incredibly gracious when I asked if I could call him back in a moment so that I could get the password for the cell phone. I felt terrible for my mistake and could not have been more grateful for Dr. Swieringa’s kindness.Daniels has been a leader in the business world for generations. Dr. Swieringa graduated from Augustana College with his AB in Economics. A motivated and brilliant student, he took classes over his summers, and graduated in the middle of the academic year. The flexibility of the Daniels program meant that Dr. Swieringa could begin his MBA program in the spring rather than having to wait for a traditional fall start. In addition, accounting students from Daniels were known for achieving high scores on the examinations they had to take after graduation, and the school came highly recommended by one of Dr. Swieringa’s professors, who was a Daniels alumnus. A passion for Daniels runs in the Swieringa family. Four decades after Dr. Swieringa graduated, his son, John, earned an EMBA at the College.The faculty at Daniels is one of its greatest assets. Dr. Swieringa said that the faculty at Daniels was one of the most valuable parts of his MBA experience, and he even recalled three of his favorite professors by name. Later on, when he became a professor himself, he incorporated some of their teaching techniques to help illustrate concepts to his own students. Dr. Swieringa expressed his support of our current Dean, Dr. Chris Riordan, and praised the innovative changes she is making for the students of Daniels.When struggling with periods of difficulty and self-doubt, remember that everything moves in cycles. I asked Dr. Swieringa how he has dealt with periods of self-doubt on his path to success. He explained that he had developed the perspective that dark times do not last forever. Difficulties will arise, but it’s important to remember that life is cyclical, and hard times will end eventually.Persistence is a key to success. Dr. Swieringa was friends with Charles Schultz, the creator of Peanuts. Often, Mr. Schultz would be working on fifteen different strips at once. Occasionally, he would have to scrap one, but that did not stop him from making the other fourteen into masterpieces, and from becoming one of the most successful cartoonists of all time. Achieving this success meant developing the abilities to face hard work head on and to handle many projects at once.Reach out to others. When Dr. Swieringa was a student at Daniels, he was part of a group of students who met for lunch or coffee every day. If someone needed help with something, he would write his question or problem on the blackboard, and the entire group would help him solve it. Whether you’re an MBA student or a businessperson (or both), you don’t live in a self-contained bubble. It’s tempting to think that you can solve every problem on your own, but this kind of thinking can box you in and impede progress. Reaching out to others is an invaluable way to break through challenges. You don’t have to do everything alone, and you will be more successful if you learn to ask for help.Do well, but also do good. In your path to success, it’s essential to remember to give back to others. Dr. Swieringa has been involved with a wide variety of charitable organizations over the years, and as a proud alumnus of Daniels he is committed to giving back to his alma mater.  In fact, Study Room 343 is named after Dr. Swieringa and his son, John.  Finding altruistic passions and remembering those who contributed to your success are just as important as doing well for yourself.Surround yourself with intelligent people. While working as an Assistant Professor of Accounting at Stanford, Dr. Swieringa met Dr. Robert T. Sprouse, who was one of the founders of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). Because Dr. Swieringa knew Dr. Sprouse, he was able to be a direct participant in this Board during an exciting and monumental time in the world of accounting, and had the opportunity to share knowledge with some of the most brilliant minds in the country in settings both formal (at FASB meetings) and informal (over coffee or lunch).Work to develop an interdisciplinary perspective. Dr. Swieringa had taken courses in psychology and sociology while earning his AB in Economics, and he wanted to continue his studies in the behavioral sciences while earning his Ph.D. in Accounting at the University of Illinois. Unfortunately, the head of the program to which he was applying did not understand why an accounting student wanted to study organizational behavior, and grilled Dr. Swieringa for four hours about his intentions. In the end, Dr. Swieringa’s earnestness convinced the program director to admit him, and he earned a Ph.D. in Accounting and Complex Organizations. The classes offered in the Daniels MBA program expose students to many different disciplines. Daniels is an excellent place to develop what Dr. Swieringa calls “a high tolerance for ambiguity”, and to learn how to consider diverse and multiple perspectives while solving problems and making decisions. Student should take advantage of the unique opportunity Daniels provides to learn to view the world (and the challenges they face) through a wide variety of lenses.Appreciate accounting textbooks based on real-world case studies: they haven’t been around forever. Today, we take for granted the fact that accounting textbooks are based on real-world case studies. When Dr. Swieringa was studying accounting, this wasn’t the case. Many textbook problems were disconnected from the way accounting worked in the real world. In his teaching, and later on when writing his textbooks, Dr. Swieringa challenged students by presenting them with real-world problems which didn’t have straightforward answers. Rather than performing simple calculations to figure out the solutions, students had to go deeper to figure out the thought processes behind the numbers on the page.The Daniels Values of Community, Excellence, and Ethics were reflected in every one of Dr. Swieringa’s responses.  One of his closing remarks was that he was proud to have earned his MBA from Daniels.  I am honored to stand on the shoulders of giants like Dr. Swieringa, and I am deeply grateful for the time he took to share his knowledge and wisdom with the Daniels community.Submit a Comment Cancel replyYour email address will not be published.
