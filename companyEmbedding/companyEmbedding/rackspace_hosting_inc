What are Website Hosting Services and Which is Right for You?Website hosting services are basically the plot of internet land that your website storefront sits on. If you have a website, it needs to be on the web, and these hosting services are the landlords that put up your site and keep it running so your customers can access and see it when they type in your URL.There are different types of hosting services that cater to the varying types of businesses. Some web hosting services will build your entire website, while others will just give you the plot of land and the shovel and leave you to it. Depending on your business model and size, you’ll choose a service based on the factors explained below. Once you understand the terminology, you can weigh features and select the service that works best for your company’s needs.How to Choose the Best Web Hosting Provider?Without the best web hosting, your ability to run a successful website is going to be seriously hindered. There is a dizzying array of web hosting providers competing for your business. How can you pinpoint the best one? Start by keeping the following points in mind:BandwidthThe first thing you need to do when shopping for a web host is to evaluate your disk space and bandwidth needs. If your site features lots of graphics, dozens of pages, and large amounts of traffic, you're going to need decent bandwidth and disk space. Unlimited plans are available, and they make life easier. If your site is going to be simple and not generate a huge amount of traffic, you should be able to get away with less disk space and bandwidth.CompatibilityKeep compatibility in mind, too. In the excitement of looking for a website hosting provider, you might overlook one critical thing: the type of operating systems that are supported. You're not going to want to switch operating systems, so double-check this point before settling for a provider.ReliabilityReliability and availability are critical characteristics to consider when shopping around for web hosting. The best web hosting providers offer availability rates of 98 and 99 percent, frequently referred to as “Uptime.” It's easy to make such claims, though, so make sure to see if they make good on their promises.SecuritySecurity is also an essential concern. Choosing a web hosting provider without learning about its available security features is a big mistake. Things like firewalls, daily backups, and user authentication should all be included. It's also nice to receive notifications whenever changes are made because they can alert you to suspicious activity.Take a look at how we choose the best web hosting sites in the industry in order to make a better decision about which is right for you.  Hosting Packages and What They Mean to YouThe larger or more complex a website, the more comprehensive a configuration package it's going to need. The main ones are broken down as follows:SharedShared web hosting is the basic package that services offer. Your website sits on the same server along with many other websites, so you're sharing the server, and any other resources, such as memory or CPU. These are good for basic website needs such as email sending, file sharing, and base level ecommerce sites. Shared hosting is the cheapest and therefore smartest option for smaller or startup businesses.VPSA virtual private server is designated for your direct purposes, more than a shared server. You still may be sharing an actual server, but the service creates a virtual server of your very own. That means all the resources are yours alone, from memory storage to processing power and beyond. This is a safer and much more reliable option that keeps your site separate from the others while still maintaining affordability.DedicatedDedicated hosting is already another level. In addition to getting your own server, dedicated hosting lets you take full control over your server. That means you have full administrative access and can set things up the way you like it. This type of package comes with a royal suite of features that may not be necessary for all types of businesses.WordPressWordPress is a shared hosting service that caters to a more specialized clientele. The servers themselves are optimized differently, and have features that are particularly attractive to WordPress performance such as faster load time, pre-installation, security features that work specifically with WordPress, and WordPress updates. This is useful for businesses that have websites created on WordPress.Some Top Features When it Comes to Top Hosting QualityHosting quality is affected by several factors that are important to weigh during your decision making process. Some of the most significant ones include:Uptime guaranteeWe mention this in more detail below, and really it’s one of the most important factors to consider, so don’t skimp on uptime. HostGator​ has one of the best uptime guarantees at 99.98%.Load timeLoad time is also really important. Recent studies show that the average attention span has shrunk over the years to smaller than that of a goldfish! So, if your website takes even a drop too long to load a page, your business is dead before it’s even started. To keep yourself in the running, be sure your hosting service has a fast load time. A2Hosting​ will deliver a 360ml load time for pages, the fastest in the industry.Customer supportBecause having an issue with your website is nothing to take lightly, you want to make sure customer service is available, knowledgeable, and easy to work with. More on this below.LocationThe number of servers and location plays a huge part in the speed of your website loading and service. Obviously, the more servers available, the faster the service, but where those servers are found in the world will also affect the quality. Look for servers in substantial locations close to you such as the UK, US, or Israel depending on your location.The Low Down on UptimesIf you’re looking into web hosting, you’ll hear the term uptime guarantee a lot. That makes a lot of sense considering it is one of the most important factors when choosing a service. Uptime, which is the percentage of time that a hosting service is up and running, will be guaranteed by various companies with a certain percentage of time to be up. That doesn't mean they will definitely go down for the other percentage of the time, but they can say without fail that they will be up for at least that amount of time.The reason this is important is because you don’t want your site constantly being unavailable or unreachable to your customers. Otherwise, why have a website at all? A high uptime percentage ensures that your audience can see and interact with your website more often. Quality brands like HostGator and Bluehost​ offer a more than 99% uptime guarantee, and that’s really good for your business.Top FAQs From Our ReadersWe come across a lot of the same questions from our readers. Here are some of the most commonly asked questions along with quick answers for your reference:About how much does web hosting cost?The package and type of service you get will determine how much you pay. Prices range anywhere from $2.99/month to around $10/month. For a more in-depth answer, check out the pricing and value section below.How can I learn more about hosting services?Review sites like these have done all the work for you and condensed the information you need into short, concise reviews on each brand. Browse these reviews to get the most data in the least amount of time/effort, in order to make a well-informed decision.Web Hosting Pricing & ValueSome choose web hosting providers based solely on price. While that's not a great strategy, you should certainly take pricing into consideration. The best providers offer plans for every budget and in some cases, signing up for longer subscriptions will qualify for extra discounts.Also, leave some room to grow. Choosing a web hosting plan that meets your website's current needs is great. But, with any luck, your site will grow and expand over time, and your needs may change. Since switching to a new web hosting provider is a major hassle, consider one that offers scalable plans. Meaning, you should be able to upgrade to another plan easily once necessary. Low prices are always nice, but if the low price comes with a limit on space or bandwidth, you need to be sure the deal is really worth it.Along the same lines, you may want to pay attention to how many email accounts are provided. Whether or not you believe you'll need dozens of email addresses, it's nice to have the option to create as many as possible down the line. In most cases, a larger numbers of email addresses are included in more expensive plans. This feature, while not very important to some, is critical to others.Investigate Hosting Providers' Customer Service and SupportEven if you're a natural at setting up websites, it's nice to know that help is available if you need it. Confirm that the web hosting provider you choose has 24/7 support and make sure that there are several ways in which to get support, too. The most reliable providers will provide support through email, phone, and online chat, giving you the choice of convenience.The best support includes customer freedom. Review the providers' policies to ensure that there is a clear, money-back guarantee if you're not satisfied with the product. After narrowing down the search to just a few candidates, search for online reviews about each of them. Ideally, the reviews should come from actual customers on review sites and not a list of published testimonials on the web hosting providers' own websites. It should be pretty easy to get a feel for how a web hosting provider treats its customers from the word on the street.What Extras Are Available Beyond Web HostingWhile providing the basics like bandwidth and disk space are a given, a good web hosting plan will also have at least a few extras. If you're running an online store, keep an eye out for providers that supply ecommerce solutions. If you want to be able to implement quick and easy updates, find a provider that offers content management systems. Make sure that they'll give you access to statistics about your site, as well.As tempting as it may be to choose a web hosting provider quickly and just get on with your life, it's undeniably better to take your time. In doing so, you'll be able to find a provider you can stick with for the long haul.Check out some of the top names in the industry:HostGatorOne of the fastest load times you will find anywhere. It’s also got a 99.98% uptime guarantee (they’re often running at 100%). Not only that, HostGator’s packages are competitively priced, offer great customer support, and deliver an overall terrific user experience. Learn more about HostGator.BluehostOnly a close second to HostGator, Bluehost’s cloud service offers a 99.96% uptime guarantee and lags only a fraction of milliseconds behind. If you aren’t very up to speed on computer technologies, you’re going to appreciate Bluehost’s easy to use format that’s been designed to be user-friendly and intuitive. Check out Bluehost’s full review.A2 HostingA2 Hosting boasts the fastest load time in the industry, clocking in at 361ms on average. They also have a 99.96% uptime guarantee and 24/7 US local customer support that’s available via phone or live chat, so you can reach them anytime, and you won't have to break your teeth to get an answer.

About Rackspace: The number one Managed Cloud company

Hi. How can we help you?





I have a general question.


I have a support question.












Rackspace the #1 managed cloud company



















  About Rackspace














  We Manage Your Cloud, So You Can Manage Your Business 




Lots of companies will rent you access to their raw computing infrastructure. But your cloud doesn't operate on infrastructure alone. It takes a wide variety of specialized engineering skills to architect and manage not only the infrastructure, but also the many complex tools and applications that run on top of it, including the latest data engines and ecommerce platforms. With other providers, that's your responsibility. But we do things differently at Rackspace.
We are the number one managed cloud company. Everything we offer is managed. That's because we believe:

Uptime and redundancy are shared responsibilities, rather than a burden for the customer alone.
Economies of scale are nice—but economies of expertise are even more valuable. The highest performance and cost-efficiency come when you combine infrastructure with specialized expertise and the exceptional customer service that we call Fanatical Support®.
Every customer should have easy access to engineers—by phone, chat, or email, 24x7x365—to help with planning, architecting, building, and operations.

Most big providers offer only multi-tenant public cloud. They argue that one size fits all. We disagree. We think you deserve the best fit for your unique IT needs, across multi-tenant and single-tenant platforms, in your data center or ours. That’s what you get from Rackspace, a leader in hybrid cloud solutions.
We back our managed cloud with an industry-leading 100% Network Uptime Guarantee. Our approach is designed to keep you up and running fast and lean—so you can focus on hiring only the engineers who will differentiate your business.


Industry Leadership & Expertise
Our leadership in the managed cloud has been recognized by industry analysts and some of the biggest, most demanding customers on the planet. Our accolades include:

#1 hosting provider for the Internet Retailer Top 1,000 ecommerce websites (for the third consecutive year)
#1 in hosting Magento® Enterprise Edition
#1 in hosted Microsoft® SharePoint® deployments
#1 in hosting OpenStack® private clouds
The leader in hybrid cloud solutions, creating best-fit, specialized solutions
Founder, alongside NASA, of OpenStack, and operator of the largest OpenStack public cloud

Gartner Magic Quadrant
Every year, Gartner evaluates hosting providers according to completeness of vision and ability to execute. We have been positioned as a leader in the 2015 Magic Quadrant for Cloud-Enabled Managed Hosting, North America 3 years in a row. We have also been positioned as a leader in the 2015 Magic Quadrant for Cloud-Enabled Managed Hosting, Europe.

Gartner disclaims all warranties, expressed or implied, with respect to this research, including any warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose.









We're a Leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant

We believe that hosting goes beyond infrastructure to the service level. That's why we offer around-the-clock Fanatical Support® from cloud engineers — included with every cloud account at no additional charge. We truly believe in best-fit, best-value infrastructure and service.

Fanatical Support®
Some cloud vendors provide basic break-fix support. Fanatical Support is different. It's a results-obsessed, can-do approach to customer service that infuses everything we do. You don’t pay extra for it. It comes as standard equipment.
Fanatical Support means that our engineers and their specialized expertise are always available to you, 24x7x365. We do some of our best work at 3 a.m. Sunday and on Thanksgiving Day.
Our customers think of us as an extension of their teams—and that’s how we think of ourselves. We’re available for everything from guidance on your IT architecture to helping you implement proactive monitoring and DDOS protection solutions for your infrastructure, and offering application-level support for, say, Hadoop and Hybris.
Our industry-leading service level agreements guarantee exceptional reliability and uptime. We’ve delivered 99.999% infrastructure uptime for years. But we regard our SLAs as just the beginning of our commitment. Fanatical Support means that we’re driven to exceed your expectations, to always have your back, and to serve as full partners in your success.

Fanatical Support Isn’t Just a Slogan
It isn’t just expert and friendly service (though that’s part of it). It’s the result of a complex business process that we’ve refined for 15 years.
It starts with the way we hire: for attitude and aptitude. Then we train for technical skills. We do that at scale, in our offices worldwide and through local colleges, constantly enhancing each Racker’s ability to leverage the latest technologies on your behalf.
Fanatical Support is something that we measure carefully by surveying about 1,000 of our 300,000+ customers every day. Support teams are assessed and rewarded based on those surveys and on the proportion of their customers who stay with us, grow with us, and recommend us to their friends.
Fanatical Support flows from our belief that exceptional customer service can’t be commanded. It can only be volunteered by Rackers who are empowered to spend time and resources to serve their customers, without asking anyone’s permission—who get to know their customers and find fulfillment in helping them succeed, grow, invent things, and create jobs.
Fanatical Support flows from the strength of a workplace culture that has helped us become one of the best places to work. Our culture has attracted so many applicants that we accept a smaller percentage than Harvard does. It’s no coincidence that we hire a lot of military veterans. We’re the few, the proud.

620 Folsom StSan Francisco, CA 94105









I've worked with these guys in my day job developing websites at a marketing agency. Always the best tech support, super friendly, helpful when I express confusion about whatever issue we're dealing with. One tech even took the time to write up an email with the exact lines of code I could use to fix a problem on a site if it ever returned, along with an explanation of how to implement it.

It's just nice to deal with a tech company that has real people skills!







Not in a million years. This company continues to send illegal SPAM to my company email address, and does not honor Unsubscribe requests. Violating federal law.  Using a harvested email address.

Let's see, you can't figure out how to stop spamming possible customers, but you want me to send my servers over to you?







**The review for this location is as an event space**

I have attended several tech events here. Each time I've had an excellent experience with the friendly staff and their ability to accommodate large groups.

The space is large, and can divide into a front conference room with doors that can slide open to an area that is perfect for networking or for demo tables.

A kitchen is situated near the open area that can easily accommodate a bar setup.

One small thing, but an important thing, is that the temperature is always comfortable in the space, no matter if there are 50 people or 100 people. 

I cannot tell you how much I appreciate not sweltering while taking notes about speakers on the panels!

Check it out.

History[edit]




The pre-2008 Rackspace Logo


In 1996, Richard Yoo started a small Internet service provider called Cymitar Network Systems out of his garage apartment in San Antonio, Texas. The company began doing application development work in addition to offering basic Internet access and web hosting. In 1997, Yoo brought on Dirk Elmendorf. When the company began to develop Internet applications as its primary business, the company was re-formed as Cymitar Technology Group. As Cymitar Technology Group grew, Patrick Condon was recruited from California and joined the team in 1998. Coincidentally, all three of the company's founders were students at one time at Trinity University in San Antonio.
Although the founders began as application developers for end users, they found that most companies did not either know how or want to host their applications. The founders wanted to focus on application development–not hosting–but they were unable to find an opportunity to outsource the hosting work. Eventually, the founders realized that it would be better to create a product to serve the hosting need and launch it as a company. Rackspace was launched in October 1998 with Richard Yoo as its CEO. Although most hosting companies focused on the technology end of hosting, Rackspace created its "Fanatical Support" offering to focus on service and support.[7] On March 28, 2000, Rackspace received funding through lead investor Norwest Venture Partners and Sequoia Capital. George J. Still, Jr., Managing Partner at Norwest, subsequently joined the Board of Directors.[8]
In 2008, Rackspace moved their headquarters from a building once occupied by Datapoint Corporation to the then-unoccupied Windsor Park Mall in Windcrest, Texas. Rackspace's Chairman, Graham Weston, owned the Montgomery Ward building in the mall until 2006, when it was sold to a developer. The city of Windcrest purchased 111 acres (0.45 km2) south of the mall to create a residential and retail complex.[9] The facility is located next to Roosevelt High School, and many Roosevelt students intern at Rackspace.[citation needed]
The Fortune magazine's "Top 100 Best Companies to Work For 2008" placed Rackspace as #32 the first year that Rackspace applied for consideration. The company was praised for its transparency. Regular "Open Book" meetings are held where the top level leaders share in-depth financial information with all employees.[10] In 2011 and 2013, the company was named as one of the top 100 places to work by Fortune.[11][12]
On August 8, 2008, Rackspace opened for trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol "RAX" after its initial public offering (IPO) in which it raised $187.5 million.[13] The initial public offering included 15,000,000 shares of its common stock at a price of $12.50 per share.[14] The IPO did not do well in the public market and lost about 20% of its initial price almost immediately.[15]
At around 3:45PM CST December 18, 2009, Rackspace experienced an outage for customers using their Dallas-Fort Worth data center – including those of Rackspace Cloud.[16]
On September 8, 2010, Rackspace received national attention when they decided to discontinue providing web hosting service to one of their customers, Dove World Outreach Center.[17] This was in reaction to Dove World's pastor Terry Jones' plan to burn several copies of the Qur'an on the anniversary of the September 11th attacks. Rackspace claims that this violated their company policy. This move came under criticism, notably from Terry Jones himself, who described it as an "indirect attack on our freedom of speech." Others questioned the appropriateness of Rackspace's action, stating that there is "absolutely no reason for web hosts to have an editorial policy, and this only gives Jones more attention, and makes him look more persecuted."[18]
On June 3, 2011, Rackspace intervened in an application by Queensland host Rack Servers to trademark its business name in Australia.[19]
On May 26, 2013, Author Bill Schley's book 'The UnStoppables', which was inspired by the culture at Rackspace, became a New York Times bestseller.[20]
On May 15, 2014, Rackspace hired Morgan Stanley to evaluate strategic options including selling to or merging with other technology companies.[21]
In October, 2014, Rackspace announced that it would sell and support Google Work apps for business customers.[22]
In August 2016, it was confirmed that Apollo Global Management had reached an agreement to buy the company for $4.3 billion.[23] The sale was completed in November 2016 and Rackspace officially ended trading on the New York Stock Exchange on November 3, 2016.[24]
In May 2017, CEO Taylor Rhodes announced he was leaving the company on May 16 to work for a smaller private company in a different city.[25]
Acquisitions[edit]
On May 25, 2017, Rackspace announced an agreement to acquire TriCore Solutions.
On October 22, 2008, Rackspace announced it was purchasing cloud storage provider Jungle Disk and VPS provider SliceHost.
On February 16, 2012, Rackspace acquired SharePoint911, a Microsoft SharePoint consulting company based in Cincinnati, Ohio.[26]
Other acquisitions include Cloudkick, Anso Labs, Mailgun,[27] ObjectRocket,[28] Exceptional Cloud Services, and ZeroVM.[3]
Involvement with other companies[edit]
Rackspace launched ServerBeach in San Antonio in January 2003 as a lower-cost alternative for dedicated servers designed for technology hobbyists who want flexibility and reliability. Richard Yoo was a catalyst in the startup of ServerBeach. A bandwidth and colocation provider, Peer 1 Hosting now known as Cogeco Peer 1, purchased ServerBeach in October 2004 for $7.5 Million.[29] Peer 1 Hosting entered the UK managed hosting market in January 2009 and the ServerBeach brand now competes directly with the UK arm of Rackspace, run by Dominic Monkhouse, former managing director of Rackspace Limited.[30]
In October 2006, Mosso Inc. was launched, which experimented with white-labeling hosting services.[31] Eventually, the division became the foundation for the Rackspace Cloud Computing offering.
On October 1, 2007, Rackspace acquired Webmail.us, a private e-mail hosting firm located in Blacksburg, VA. Originally branded as Mailtrust on May 20, 2009, it became part of the newly formed Email and Apps division of Rackspace.
On October 22, 2008, Rackspace acquired Slicehost, a provider of virtual servers[32] and Jungle Disk, a provider of online backup software and services.[33]
OpenStack[edit]
Main article: OpenStack
In 2010, Rackspace contributed the source code of its Cloud Files product to the OpenStack project under the Apache License to become the OpenStack Object Storage component.[34][35]
In April 2012, Rackspace announced it would implement OpenStack Compute as the underlying technology for their Cloud Servers product. This change introduced a new control panel as well as add-on cloud services offering databases, server monitoring, block storage, and virtual networking.[36] In 2015, two Rackspace executives were elected to the board of the OpenStack Foundation.[37]

History[edit]




The pre-2008 Rackspace Logo


In 1996, Richard Yoo started a small Internet service provider called Cymitar Network Systems out of his garage apartment in San Antonio, Texas. The company began doing application development work in addition to offering basic Internet access and web hosting. In 1997, Yoo brought on Dirk Elmendorf. When the company began to develop Internet applications as its primary business, the company was re-formed as Cymitar Technology Group. As Cymitar Technology Group grew, Patrick Condon was recruited from California and joined the team in 1998. Coincidentally, all three of the company's founders were students at one time at Trinity University in San Antonio.
Although the founders began as application developers for end users, they found that most companies did not either know how or want to host their applications. The founders wanted to focus on application development–not hosting–but they were unable to find an opportunity to outsource the hosting work. Eventually, the founders realized that it would be better to create a product to serve the hosting need and launch it as a company. Rackspace was launched in October 1998 with Richard Yoo as its CEO. Although most hosting companies focused on the technology end of hosting, Rackspace created its "Fanatical Support" offering to focus on service and support.[7] On March 28, 2000, Rackspace received funding through lead investor Norwest Venture Partners and Sequoia Capital. George J. Still, Jr., Managing Partner at Norwest, subsequently joined the Board of Directors.[8]
In 2008, Rackspace moved their headquarters from a building once occupied by Datapoint Corporation to the then-unoccupied Windsor Park Mall in Windcrest, Texas. Rackspace's Chairman, Graham Weston, owned the Montgomery Ward building in the mall until 2006, when it was sold to a developer. The city of Windcrest purchased 111 acres (0.45 km2) south of the mall to create a residential and retail complex.[9] The facility is located next to Roosevelt High School, and many Roosevelt students intern at Rackspace.[citation needed]
The Fortune magazine's "Top 100 Best Companies to Work For 2008" placed Rackspace as #32 the first year that Rackspace applied for consideration. The company was praised for its transparency. Regular "Open Book" meetings are held where the top level leaders share in-depth financial information with all employees.[10] In 2011 and 2013, the company was named as one of the top 100 places to work by Fortune.[11][12]
On August 8, 2008, Rackspace opened for trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol "RAX" after its initial public offering (IPO) in which it raised $187.5 million.[13] The initial public offering included 15,000,000 shares of its common stock at a price of $12.50 per share.[14] The IPO did not do well in the public market and lost about 20% of its initial price almost immediately.[15]
At around 3:45PM CST December 18, 2009, Rackspace experienced an outage for customers using their Dallas-Fort Worth data center – including those of Rackspace Cloud.[16]
On September 8, 2010, Rackspace received national attention when they decided to discontinue providing web hosting service to one of their customers, Dove World Outreach Center.[17] This was in reaction to Dove World's pastor Terry Jones' plan to burn several copies of the Qur'an on the anniversary of the September 11th attacks. Rackspace claims that this violated their company policy. This move came under criticism, notably from Terry Jones himself, who described it as an "indirect attack on our freedom of speech." Others questioned the appropriateness of Rackspace's action, stating that there is "absolutely no reason for web hosts to have an editorial policy, and this only gives Jones more attention, and makes him look more persecuted."[18]
On June 3, 2011, Rackspace intervened in an application by Queensland host Rack Servers to trademark its business name in Australia.[19]
On May 26, 2013, Author Bill Schley's book 'The UnStoppables', which was inspired by the culture at Rackspace, became a New York Times bestseller.[20]
On May 15, 2014, Rackspace hired Morgan Stanley to evaluate strategic options including selling to or merging with other technology companies.[21]
In October, 2014, Rackspace announced that it would sell and support Google Work apps for business customers.[22]
In August 2016, it was confirmed that Apollo Global Management had reached an agreement to buy the company for $4.3 billion.[23] The sale was completed in November 2016 and Rackspace officially ended trading on the New York Stock Exchange on November 3, 2016.[24]
In May 2017, CEO Taylor Rhodes announced he was leaving the company on May 16 to work for a smaller private company in a different city.[25]
Acquisitions[edit]
On May 25, 2017, Rackspace announced an agreement to acquire TriCore Solutions.
On October 22, 2008, Rackspace announced it was purchasing cloud storage provider Jungle Disk and VPS provider SliceHost.
On February 16, 2012, Rackspace acquired SharePoint911, a Microsoft SharePoint consulting company based in Cincinnati, Ohio.[26]
Other acquisitions include Cloudkick, Anso Labs, Mailgun,[27] ObjectRocket,[28] Exceptional Cloud Services, and ZeroVM.[3]
Involvement with other companies[edit]
Rackspace launched ServerBeach in San Antonio in January 2003 as a lower-cost alternative for dedicated servers designed for technology hobbyists who want flexibility and reliability. Richard Yoo was a catalyst in the startup of ServerBeach. A bandwidth and colocation provider, Peer 1 Hosting now known as Cogeco Peer 1, purchased ServerBeach in October 2004 for $7.5 Million.[29] Peer 1 Hosting entered the UK managed hosting market in January 2009 and the ServerBeach brand now competes directly with the UK arm of Rackspace, run by Dominic Monkhouse, former managing director of Rackspace Limited.[30]
In October 2006, Mosso Inc. was launched, which experimented with white-labeling hosting services.[31] Eventually, the division became the foundation for the Rackspace Cloud Computing offering.
On October 1, 2007, Rackspace acquired Webmail.us, a private e-mail hosting firm located in Blacksburg, VA. Originally branded as Mailtrust on May 20, 2009, it became part of the newly formed Email and Apps division of Rackspace.
On October 22, 2008, Rackspace acquired Slicehost, a provider of virtual servers[32] and Jungle Disk, a provider of online backup software and services.[33]
OpenStack[edit]
Main article: OpenStack
In 2010, Rackspace contributed the source code of its Cloud Files product to the OpenStack project under the Apache License to become the OpenStack Object Storage component.[34][35]
In April 2012, Rackspace announced it would implement OpenStack Compute as the underlying technology for their Cloud Servers product. This change introduced a new control panel as well as add-on cloud services offering databases, server monitoring, block storage, and virtual networking.[36] In 2015, two Rackspace executives were elected to the board of the OpenStack Foundation.[37]

The company began doing application development work in addition to offering basic Internet access and web hosting. In 1997, Yoo brought on Dirk Elmendorf. When the company began to develop Internet applications as its primary business, the company was re-formed as Cymitar Technology Group. As Cymitar Technology Group grew, Patrick Condon was recruited from California and joined the team in 1998. Coincidentally, all three of the company's founders were students at one time at Trinity University in San Antonio.
Although the founders began as application developers for end users, they found that most companies did not either know how or want to host their applications. The founders wanted to focus on application development–not hosting–but they were unable to find an opportunity to outsource the hosting work. Eventually, the founders realized that it would be better to create a product to serve the hosting need and launch it as a company. Rackspace was launched in October 1998 with Richard Yoo as its CEO. Although most hosting companies focused on the technology end of hosting, Rackspace created its "Fanatical Support" offering to focus on service and support.[7] On March 28, 2000, Rackspace received funding through lead investor Norwest Venture Partners and Sequoia Capital. George J. Still, Jr., Managing Partner at Norwest, subsequently joined the Board of Directors.[8]
In 2008, Rackspace moved their headquarters from a building once occupied by Datapoint Corporation to the then-unoccupied Windsor Park Mall in Windcrest, Texas. Rackspace's Chairman, Graham Weston, owned the Montgomery Ward building in the mall until 2006, when it was sold to a developer. The city of Windcrest purchased 111 acres (0.45 km2) south of the mall to create a residential and retail complex.[9] The facility is located next to Roosevelt High School, and many Roosevelt students intern at Rackspace.[citation needed]
The Fortune magazine's "Top 100 Best Companies to Work For 2008" placed Rackspace as #32 the first year that Rackspace applied for consideration. The company was praised for its transparency. Regular "Open Book" meetings are held where the top level leaders share in-depth financial information with all employees.[10] In 2011 and 2013, the company was named as one of the top 100 places to work by Fortune.[11][12]
On August 8, 2008, Rackspace opened for trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol "RAX" after its initial public offering (IPO) in which it raised $187.5 million.[13] The initial public offering included 15,000,000 shares of its common stock at a price of $12.50 per share.[14] The IPO did not do well in the public market and lost about 20% of its initial price almost immediately.[15]
At around 3:45PM CST December 18, 2009, Rackspace experienced an outage for customers using their Dallas-Fort Worth data center – including those of Rackspace Cloud.[16]
On September 8, 2010, Rackspace received national attention when they decided to discontinue providing web hosting service to one of their customers, Dove World Outreach Center.[17] This was in reaction to Dove World's pastor Terry Jones' plan to burn several copies of the Qur'an on the anniversary of the September 11th attacks. Rackspace claims that this violated their company policy. This move came under criticism, notably from Terry Jones himself, who described it as an "indirect attack on our freedom of speech." Others questioned the appropriateness of Rackspace's action, stating that there is "absolutely no reason for web hosts to have an editorial policy, and this only gives Jones more attention, and makes him look more persecuted."[18]
On June 3, 2011, Rackspace intervened in an application by Queensland host Rack Servers to trademark its business name in Australia.[19]
On May 26, 2013, Author Bill Schley's book 'The UnStoppables', which was inspired by the culture at Rackspace, became a New York Times bestseller.[20]
On May 15, 2014, Rackspace hired Morgan Stanley to evaluate strategic options including selling to or merging with other technology companies.[21]
In October, 2014, Rackspace announced that it would sell and support Google Work apps for business customers.[22]
In August 2016, it was confirmed that Apollo Global Management had reached an agreement to buy the company for $4.3 billion.[23] The sale was completed in November 2016 and Rackspace officially ended trading on the New York Stock Exchange on November 3, 2016.[24]
In May 2017, CEO Taylor Rhodes announced he was leaving the company on May 16 to work for a smaller private company in a different city.[25]
Acquisitions[edit]
On May 25, 2017, Rackspace announced an agreement to acquire TriCore Solutions.
On October 22, 2008, Rackspace announced it was purchasing cloud storage provider Jungle Disk and VPS provider SliceHost.
On February 16, 2012, Rackspace acquired SharePoint911, a Microsoft SharePoint consulting company based in Cincinnati, Ohio.[26]
Other acquisitions include Cloudkick, Anso Labs, Mailgun,[27] ObjectRocket,[28] Exceptional Cloud Services, and ZeroVM.[3]
Involvement with other companies[edit]
Rackspace launched ServerBeach in San Antonio in January 2003 as a lower-cost alternative for dedicated servers designed for technology hobbyists who want flexibility and reliability. Richard Yoo was a catalyst in the startup of ServerBeach. A bandwidth and colocation provider, Peer 1 Hosting now known as Cogeco Peer 1, purchased ServerBeach in October 2004 for $7.5 Million.[29] Peer 1 Hosting entered the UK managed hosting market in January 2009 and the ServerBeach brand now competes directly with the UK arm of Rackspace, run by Dominic Monkhouse, former managing director of Rackspace Limited.[30]
In October 2006, Mosso Inc. was launched, which experimented with white-labeling hosting services.[31] Eventually, the division became the foundation for the Rackspace Cloud Computing offering.
On October 1, 2007, Rackspace acquired Webmail.us, a private e-mail hosting firm located in Blacksburg, VA. Originally branded as Mailtrust on May 20, 2009, it became part of the newly formed Email and Apps division of Rackspace.
On October 22, 2008, Rackspace acquired Slicehost, a provider of virtual servers[32] and Jungle Disk, a provider of online backup software and services.[33]
OpenStack[edit]
Main article: OpenStack
In 2010, Rackspace contributed the source code of its Cloud Files product to the OpenStack project under the Apache License to become the OpenStack Object Storage component.[34][35]
In April 2012, Rackspace announced it would implement OpenStack Compute as the underlying technology for their Cloud Servers product. This change introduced a new control panel as well as add-on cloud services offering databases, server monitoring, block storage, and virtual networking.[36] In 2015, two Rackspace executives were elected to the board of the OpenStack Foundation.[37]

Rackspace Named a Leader in Forrester Wave for Hosted Private Cloud

By Scott Crenshaw -  June 22, 2017 






Today, Forrester Research released its latest evaluation of the hosted private cloud market – The Forrester Wave™: Hosted Private Cloud Services, North America, Q2 2017. I’m proud to announce that we were recognized as a leader for our Rackspace OpenStack Private Cloud offering.
The report evaluated nine vendors based on 33 criteria, including current offering, strategy and market presence. In addition to being named a leader, our OpenStack private cloud offering ranked above all vendors in the strategy category and automation capabilities criterion.
We were also among the vendors that scored highest for self-service portal and user interface, integration strength, service level agreements (SLAs), storage and contract agreements criteria. In fact, the Forrester report specifically mentions customer references contacted during the evaluation, which called out Rackspace for our “superior self-service control options relative to other evaluated solutions,” and described them as “best-in-class.” Click here to view the Forrester Wave and download the full report.
The Forrester report comes on the heels of a recently released Gartner report, the “2017 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Cloud Infrastructure as a Service, Worldwide,” in which Rackspace was called “the market leader in industrialized private cloud IaaS.”  The Gartner report also noted that our private cloud-as-a-service offerings are “thoughtfully constructed, more automated than most competing offerings, and operated in a fashion that allows Rackspace to deliver reliable, well-supported services at economical prices and at scale.”
We believe our position in the Forrester Wave report and Gartner’s assessment of our private cloud offerings further validate that we are the clear market leader in the OpenStack private cloud space. As a co-founder of OpenStack, we pioneered the OpenStack private cloud as a service delivery model and were the first to deliver an industry-leading 99.99% API uptime SLA.
We help customers of all sizes succeed with private cloud through operational expertise gained from more than one billion server hours managing OpenStack clouds at scale. And we’ll continue to innovate and lead by providing industry-leading SLAs, world-class economics and a revolutionary, utility-based private cloud consumption model.
To learn more and ask questions about whether OpenStack private cloud as a service might be a good fit for your organization, take advantage of a free strategy session with a private cloud expert — no strings attached. SIGN UP NOW.

What are Website Hosting Services and Which is Right for You?Website hosting services are basically the plot of internet land that your website storefront sits on. If you have a website, it needs to be on the web, and these hosting services are the landlords that put up your site and keep it running so your customers can access and see it when they type in your URL.There are different types of hosting services that cater to the varying types of businesses. Some web hosting services will build your entire website, while others will just give you the plot of land and the shovel and leave you to it. Depending on your business model and size, you’ll choose a service based on the factors explained below. Once you understand the terminology, you can weigh features and select the service that works best for your company’s needs.How to Choose the Best Web Hosting Provider?Without the best web hosting, your ability to run a successful website is going to be seriously hindered. There is a dizzying array of web hosting providers competing for your business. How can you pinpoint the best one? Start by keeping the following points in mind:BandwidthThe first thing you need to do when shopping for a web host is to evaluate your disk space and bandwidth needs. If your site features lots of graphics, dozens of pages, and large amounts of traffic, you're going to need decent bandwidth and disk space. Unlimited plans are available, and they make life easier. If your site is going to be simple and not generate a huge amount of traffic, you should be able to get away with less disk space and bandwidth.CompatibilityKeep compatibility in mind, too. In the excitement of looking for a website hosting provider, you might overlook one critical thing: the type of operating systems that are supported. You're not going to want to switch operating systems, so double-check this point before settling for a provider.ReliabilityReliability and availability are critical characteristics to consider when shopping around for web hosting. The best web hosting providers offer availability rates of 98 and 99 percent, frequently referred to as “Uptime.” It's easy to make such claims, though, so make sure to see if they make good on their promises.SecuritySecurity is also an essential concern. Choosing a web hosting provider without learning about its available security features is a big mistake. Things like firewalls, daily backups, and user authentication should all be included. It's also nice to receive notifications whenever changes are made because they can alert you to suspicious activity.Take a look at how we choose the best web hosting sites in the industry in order to make a better decision about which is right for you.  Hosting Packages and What They Mean to YouThe larger or more complex a website, the more comprehensive a configuration package it's going to need. The main ones are broken down as follows:SharedShared web hosting is the basic package that services offer. Your website sits on the same server along with many other websites, so you're sharing the server, and any other resources, such as memory or CPU. These are good for basic website needs such as email sending, file sharing, and base level ecommerce sites. Shared hosting is the cheapest and therefore smartest option for smaller or startup businesses.VPSA virtual private server is designated for your direct purposes, more than a shared server. You still may be sharing an actual server, but the service creates a virtual server of your very own. That means all the resources are yours alone, from memory storage to processing power and beyond. This is a safer and much more reliable option that keeps your site separate from the others while still maintaining affordability.DedicatedDedicated hosting is already another level. In addition to getting your own server, dedicated hosting lets you take full control over your server. That means you have full administrative access and can set things up the way you like it. This type of package comes with a royal suite of features that may not be necessary for all types of businesses.WordPressWordPress is a shared hosting service that caters to a more specialized clientele. The servers themselves are optimized differently, and have features that are particularly attractive to WordPress performance such as faster load time, pre-installation, security features that work specifically with WordPress, and WordPress updates. This is useful for businesses that have websites created on WordPress.Some Top Features When it Comes to Top Hosting QualityHosting quality is affected by several factors that are important to weigh during your decision making process. Some of the most significant ones include:Uptime guaranteeWe mention this in more detail below, and really it’s one of the most important factors to consider, so don’t skimp on uptime. HostGator​ has one of the best uptime guarantees at 99.98%.Load timeLoad time is also really important. Recent studies show that the average attention span has shrunk over the years to smaller than that of a goldfish! So, if your website takes even a drop too long to load a page, your business is dead before it’s even started. To keep yourself in the running, be sure your hosting service has a fast load time. A2Hosting​ will deliver a 360ml load time for pages, the fastest in the industry.Customer supportBecause having an issue with your website is nothing to take lightly, you want to make sure customer service is available, knowledgeable, and easy to work with. More on this below.LocationThe number of servers and location plays a huge part in the speed of your website loading and service. Obviously, the more servers available, the faster the service, but where those servers are found in the world will also affect the quality. Look for servers in substantial locations close to you such as the UK, US, or Israel depending on your location.The Low Down on UptimesIf you’re looking into web hosting, you’ll hear the term uptime guarantee a lot. That makes a lot of sense considering it is one of the most important factors when choosing a service. Uptime, which is the percentage of time that a hosting service is up and running, will be guaranteed by various companies with a certain percentage of time to be up. That doesn't mean they will definitely go down for the other percentage of the time, but they can say without fail that they will be up for at least that amount of time.The reason this is important is because you don’t want your site constantly being unavailable or unreachable to your customers. Otherwise, why have a website at all? A high uptime percentage ensures that your audience can see and interact with your website more often. Quality brands like HostGator and Bluehost​ offer a more than 99% uptime guarantee, and that’s really good for your business.Top FAQs From Our ReadersWe come across a lot of the same questions from our readers. Here are some of the most commonly asked questions along with quick answers for your reference:About how much does web hosting cost?The package and type of service you get will determine how much you pay. Prices range anywhere from $2.99/month to around $10/month. For a more in-depth answer, check out the pricing and value section below.How can I learn more about hosting services?Review sites like these have done all the work for you and condensed the information you need into short, concise reviews on each brand. Browse these reviews to get the most data in the least amount of time/effort, in order to make a well-informed decision.Web Hosting Pricing & ValueSome choose web hosting providers based solely on price. While that's not a great strategy, you should certainly take pricing into consideration. The best providers offer plans for every budget and in some cases, signing up for longer subscriptions will qualify for extra discounts.Also, leave some room to grow. Choosing a web hosting plan that meets your website's current needs is great. But, with any luck, your site will grow and expand over time, and your needs may change. Since switching to a new web hosting provider is a major hassle, consider one that offers scalable plans. Meaning, you should be able to upgrade to another plan easily once necessary. Low prices are always nice, but if the low price comes with a limit on space or bandwidth, you need to be sure the deal is really worth it.Along the same lines, you may want to pay attention to how many email accounts are provided. Whether or not you believe you'll need dozens of email addresses, it's nice to have the option to create as many as possible down the line. In most cases, a larger numbers of email addresses are included in more expensive plans. This feature, while not very important to some, is critical to others.Investigate Hosting Providers' Customer Service and SupportEven if you're a natural at setting up websites, it's nice to know that help is available if you need it. Confirm that the web hosting provider you choose has 24/7 support and make sure that there are several ways in which to get support, too. The most reliable providers will provide support through email, phone, and online chat, giving you the choice of convenience.The best support includes customer freedom. Review the providers' policies to ensure that there is a clear, money-back guarantee if you're not satisfied with the product. After narrowing down the search to just a few candidates, search for online reviews about each of them. Ideally, the reviews should come from actual customers on review sites and not a list of published testimonials on the web hosting providers' own websites. It should be pretty easy to get a feel for how a web hosting provider treats its customers from the word on the street.What Extras Are Available Beyond Web HostingWhile providing the basics like bandwidth and disk space are a given, a good web hosting plan will also have at least a few extras. If you're running an online store, keep an eye out for providers that supply ecommerce solutions. If you want to be able to implement quick and easy updates, find a provider that offers content management systems. Make sure that they'll give you access to statistics about your site, as well.As tempting as it may be to choose a web hosting provider quickly and just get on with your life, it's undeniably better to take your time. In doing so, you'll be able to find a provider you can stick with for the long haul.Check out some of the top names in the industry:HostGatorOne of the fastest load times you will find anywhere. It’s also got a 99.98% uptime guarantee (they’re often running at 100%). Not only that, HostGator’s packages are competitively priced, offer great customer support, and deliver an overall terrific user experience.

If you aren’t very up to speed on computer technologies, you’re going to appreciate Bluehost’s easy to use format that’s been designed to be user-friendly and intuitive.

History[edit]




The pre-2008 Rackspace Logo


In 1996, Richard Yoo started a small Internet service provider called Cymitar Network Systems out of his garage apartment in San Antonio, Texas. The company began doing application development work in addition to offering basic Internet access and web hosting. In 1997, Yoo brought on Dirk Elmendorf. When the company began to develop Internet applications as its primary business, the company was re-formed as Cymitar Technology Group. As Cymitar Technology Group grew, Patrick Condon was recruited from California and joined the team in 1998. Coincidentally, all three of the company's founders were students at one time at Trinity University in San Antonio.
Although the founders began as application developers for end users, they found that most companies did not either know how or want to host their applications. The founders wanted to focus on application development–not hosting–but they were unable to find an opportunity to outsource the hosting work. Eventually, the founders realized that it would be better to create a product to serve the hosting need and launch it as a company. Rackspace was launched in October 1998 with Richard Yoo as its CEO. Although most hosting companies focused on the technology end of hosting, Rackspace created its "Fanatical Support" offering to focus on service and support.[7] On March 28, 2000, Rackspace received funding through lead investor Norwest Venture Partners and Sequoia Capital. George J. Still, Jr., Managing Partner at Norwest, subsequently joined the Board of Directors.[8]
In 2008, Rackspace moved their headquarters from a building once occupied by Datapoint Corporation to the then-unoccupied Windsor Park Mall in Windcrest, Texas. Rackspace's Chairman, Graham Weston, owned the Montgomery Ward building in the mall until 2006, when it was sold to a developer. The city of Windcrest purchased 111 acres (0.45 km2) south of the mall to create a residential and retail complex.[9] The facility is located next to Roosevelt High School, and many Roosevelt students intern at Rackspace.[citation needed]
The Fortune magazine's "Top 100 Best Companies to Work For 2008" placed Rackspace as #32 the first year that Rackspace applied for consideration. The company was praised for its transparency. Regular "Open Book" meetings are held where the top level leaders share in-depth financial information with all employees.[10] In 2011 and 2013, the company was named as one of the top 100 places to work by Fortune.[11][12]
On August 8, 2008, Rackspace opened for trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol "RAX" after its initial public offering (IPO) in which it raised $187.5 million.[13] The initial public offering included 15,000,000 shares of its common stock at a price of $12.50 per share.[14] The IPO did not do well in the public market and lost about 20% of its initial price almost immediately.[15]
At around 3:45PM CST December 18, 2009, Rackspace experienced an outage for customers using their Dallas-Fort Worth data center – including those of Rackspace Cloud.[16]
On September 8, 2010, Rackspace received national attention when they decided to discontinue providing web hosting service to one of their customers, Dove World Outreach Center.[17] This was in reaction to Dove World's pastor Terry Jones' plan to burn several copies of the Qur'an on the anniversary of the September 11th attacks. Rackspace claims that this violated their company policy. This move came under criticism, notably from Terry Jones himself, who described it as an "indirect attack on our freedom of speech." Others questioned the appropriateness of Rackspace's action, stating that there is "absolutely no reason for web hosts to have an editorial policy, and this only gives Jones more attention, and makes him look more persecuted."[18]
On June 3, 2011, Rackspace intervened in an application by Queensland host Rack Servers to trademark its business name in Australia.[19]
On May 26, 2013, Author Bill Schley's book 'The UnStoppables', which was inspired by the culture at Rackspace, became a New York Times bestseller.[20]
On May 15, 2014, Rackspace hired Morgan Stanley to evaluate strategic options including selling to or merging with other technology companies.[21]
In October, 2014, Rackspace announced that it would sell and support Google Work apps for business customers.[22]
In August 2016, it was confirmed that Apollo Global Management had reached an agreement to buy the company for $4.3 billion.[23] The sale was completed in November 2016 and Rackspace officially ended trading on the New York Stock Exchange on November 3, 2016.[24]
In May 2017, CEO Taylor Rhodes announced he was leaving the company on May 16 to work for a smaller private company in a different city.[25]
Acquisitions[edit]
On May 25, 2017, Rackspace announced an agreement to acquire TriCore Solutions.
On October 22, 2008, Rackspace announced it was purchasing cloud storage provider Jungle Disk and VPS provider SliceHost.
On February 16, 2012, Rackspace acquired SharePoint911, a Microsoft SharePoint consulting company based in Cincinnati, Ohio.[26]
Other acquisitions include Cloudkick, Anso Labs, Mailgun,[27] ObjectRocket,[28] Exceptional Cloud Services, and ZeroVM.[3]
Involvement with other companies[edit]
Rackspace launched ServerBeach in San Antonio in January 2003 as a lower-cost alternative for dedicated servers designed for technology hobbyists who want flexibility and reliability. Richard Yoo was a catalyst in the startup of ServerBeach. A bandwidth and colocation provider, Peer 1 Hosting now known as Cogeco Peer 1, purchased ServerBeach in October 2004 for $7.5 Million.[29] Peer 1 Hosting entered the UK managed hosting market in January 2009 and the ServerBeach brand now competes directly with the UK arm of Rackspace, run by Dominic Monkhouse, former managing director of Rackspace Limited.[30]
In October 2006, Mosso Inc. was launched, which experimented with white-labeling hosting services.[31] Eventually, the division became the foundation for the Rackspace Cloud Computing offering.
On October 1, 2007, Rackspace acquired Webmail.us, a private e-mail hosting firm located in Blacksburg, VA. Originally branded as Mailtrust on May 20, 2009, it became part of the newly formed Email and Apps division of Rackspace.
On October 22, 2008, Rackspace acquired Slicehost, a provider of virtual servers[32] and Jungle Disk, a provider of online backup software and services.[33]
OpenStack[edit]
Main article: OpenStack
In 2010, Rackspace contributed the source code of its Cloud Files product to the OpenStack project under the Apache License to become the OpenStack Object Storage component.[34][35]
In April 2012, Rackspace announced it would implement OpenStack Compute as the underlying technology for their Cloud Servers product. This change introduced a new control panel as well as add-on cloud services offering databases, server monitoring, block storage, and virtual networking.[36] In 2015, two Rackspace executives were elected to the board of the OpenStack Foundation.[37]

History[edit]




The pre-2008 Rackspace Logo


In 1996, Richard Yoo started a small Internet service provider called Cymitar Network Systems out of his garage apartment in San Antonio, Texas. The company began doing application development work in addition to offering basic Internet access and web hosting. In 1997, Yoo brought on Dirk Elmendorf. When the company began to develop Internet applications as its primary business, the company was re-formed as Cymitar Technology Group. As Cymitar Technology Group grew, Patrick Condon was recruited from California and joined the team in 1998. Coincidentally, all three of the company's founders were students at one time at Trinity University in San Antonio.
Although the founders began as application developers for end users, they found that most companies did not either know how or want to host their applications. The founders wanted to focus on application development–not hosting–but they were unable to find an opportunity to outsource the hosting work. Eventually, the founders realized that it would be better to create a product to serve the hosting need and launch it as a company. Rackspace was launched in October 1998 with Richard Yoo as its CEO. Although most hosting companies focused on the technology end of hosting, Rackspace created its "Fanatical Support" offering to focus on service and support.[7] On March 28, 2000, Rackspace received funding through lead investor Norwest Venture Partners and Sequoia Capital. George J. Still, Jr., Managing Partner at Norwest, subsequently joined the Board of Directors.[8]
In 2008, Rackspace moved their headquarters from a building once occupied by Datapoint Corporation to the then-unoccupied Windsor Park Mall in Windcrest, Texas. Rackspace's Chairman, Graham Weston, owned the Montgomery Ward building in the mall until 2006, when it was sold to a developer. The city of Windcrest purchased 111 acres (0.45 km2) south of the mall to create a residential and retail complex.[9] The facility is located next to Roosevelt High School, and many Roosevelt students intern at Rackspace.[citation needed]
The Fortune magazine's "Top 100 Best Companies to Work For 2008" placed Rackspace as #32 the first year that Rackspace applied for consideration. The company was praised for its transparency. Regular "Open Book" meetings are held where the top level leaders share in-depth financial information with all employees.[10] In 2011 and 2013, the company was named as one of the top 100 places to work by Fortune.[11][12]
On August 8, 2008, Rackspace opened for trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol "RAX" after its initial public offering (IPO) in which it raised $187.5 million.[13] The initial public offering included 15,000,000 shares of its common stock at a price of $12.50 per share.[14] The IPO did not do well in the public market and lost about 20% of its initial price almost immediately.[15]
At around 3:45PM CST December 18, 2009, Rackspace experienced an outage for customers using their Dallas-Fort Worth data center – including those of Rackspace Cloud.[16]
On September 8, 2010, Rackspace received national attention when they decided to discontinue providing web hosting service to one of their customers, Dove World Outreach Center.[17] This was in reaction to Dove World's pastor Terry Jones' plan to burn several copies of the Qur'an on the anniversary of the September 11th attacks. Rackspace claims that this violated their company policy. This move came under criticism, notably from Terry Jones himself, who described it as an "indirect attack on our freedom of speech." Others questioned the appropriateness of Rackspace's action, stating that there is "absolutely no reason for web hosts to have an editorial policy, and this only gives Jones more attention, and makes him look more persecuted."[18]
On June 3, 2011, Rackspace intervened in an application by Queensland host Rack Servers to trademark its business name in Australia.[19]
On May 26, 2013, Author Bill Schley's book 'The UnStoppables', which was inspired by the culture at Rackspace, became a New York Times bestseller.[20]
On May 15, 2014, Rackspace hired Morgan Stanley to evaluate strategic options including selling to or merging with other technology companies.[21]
In October, 2014, Rackspace announced that it would sell and support Google Work apps for business customers.[22]
In August 2016, it was confirmed that Apollo Global Management had reached an agreement to buy the company for $4.3 billion.[23] The sale was completed in November 2016 and Rackspace officially ended trading on the New York Stock Exchange on November 3, 2016.[24]
In May 2017, CEO Taylor Rhodes announced he was leaving the company on May 16 to work for a smaller private company in a different city.[25]
Acquisitions[edit]
On May 25, 2017, Rackspace announced an agreement to acquire TriCore Solutions.
On October 22, 2008, Rackspace announced it was purchasing cloud storage provider Jungle Disk and VPS provider SliceHost.
On February 16, 2012, Rackspace acquired SharePoint911, a Microsoft SharePoint consulting company based in Cincinnati, Ohio.[26]
Other acquisitions include Cloudkick, Anso Labs, Mailgun,[27] ObjectRocket,[28] Exceptional Cloud Services, and ZeroVM.[3]
Involvement with other companies[edit]
Rackspace launched ServerBeach in San Antonio in January 2003 as a lower-cost alternative for dedicated servers designed for technology hobbyists who want flexibility and reliability. Richard Yoo was a catalyst in the startup of ServerBeach. A bandwidth and colocation provider, Peer 1 Hosting now known as Cogeco Peer 1, purchased ServerBeach in October 2004 for $7.5 Million.[29] Peer 1 Hosting entered the UK managed hosting market in January 2009 and the ServerBeach brand now competes directly with the UK arm of Rackspace, run by Dominic Monkhouse, former managing director of Rackspace Limited.[30]
In October 2006, Mosso Inc. was launched, which experimented with white-labeling hosting services.[31] Eventually, the division became the foundation for the Rackspace Cloud Computing offering.
On October 1, 2007, Rackspace acquired Webmail.us, a private e-mail hosting firm located in Blacksburg, VA. Originally branded as Mailtrust on May 20, 2009, it became part of the newly formed Email and Apps division of Rackspace.
On October 22, 2008, Rackspace acquired Slicehost, a provider of virtual servers[32] and Jungle Disk, a provider of online backup software and services.[33]
OpenStack[edit]
Main article: OpenStack
In 2010, Rackspace contributed the source code of its Cloud Files product to the OpenStack project under the Apache License to become the OpenStack Object Storage component.[34][35]
In April 2012, Rackspace announced it would implement OpenStack Compute as the underlying technology for their Cloud Servers product. This change introduced a new control panel as well as add-on cloud services offering databases, server monitoring, block storage, and virtual networking.[36] In 2015, two Rackspace executives were elected to the board of the OpenStack Foundation.[37]

History[edit]




The pre-2008 Rackspace Logo


In 1996, Richard Yoo started a small Internet service provider called Cymitar Network Systems out of his garage apartment in San Antonio, Texas. The company began doing application development work in addition to offering basic Internet access and web hosting. In 1997, Yoo brought on Dirk Elmendorf. When the company began to develop Internet applications as its primary business, the company was re-formed as Cymitar Technology Group. As Cymitar Technology Group grew, Patrick Condon was recruited from California and joined the team in 1998. Coincidentally, all three of the company's founders were students at one time at Trinity University in San Antonio.
Although the founders began as application developers for end users, they found that most companies did not either know how or want to host their applications. The founders wanted to focus on application development–not hosting–but they were unable to find an opportunity to outsource the hosting work. Eventually, the founders realized that it would be better to create a product to serve the hosting need and launch it as a company. Rackspace was launched in October 1998 with Richard Yoo as its CEO. Although most hosting companies focused on the technology end of hosting, Rackspace created its "Fanatical Support" offering to focus on service and support.[7] On March 28, 2000, Rackspace received funding through lead investor Norwest Venture Partners and Sequoia Capital. George J. Still, Jr., Managing Partner at Norwest, subsequently joined the Board of Directors.[8]
In 2008, Rackspace moved their headquarters from a building once occupied by Datapoint Corporation to the then-unoccupied Windsor Park Mall in Windcrest, Texas. Rackspace's Chairman, Graham Weston, owned the Montgomery Ward building in the mall until 2006, when it was sold to a developer. The city of Windcrest purchased 111 acres (0.45 km2) south of the mall to create a residential and retail complex.[9] The facility is located next to Roosevelt High School, and many Roosevelt students intern at Rackspace.[citation needed]
The Fortune magazine's "Top 100 Best Companies to Work For 2008" placed Rackspace as #32 the first year that Rackspace applied for consideration. The company was praised for its transparency. Regular "Open Book" meetings are held where the top level leaders share in-depth financial information with all employees.[10] In 2011 and 2013, the company was named as one of the top 100 places to work by Fortune.[11][12]
On August 8, 2008, Rackspace opened for trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol "RAX" after its initial public offering (IPO) in which it raised $187.5 million.[13] The initial public offering included 15,000,000 shares of its common stock at a price of $12.50 per share.[14] The IPO did not do well in the public market and lost about 20% of its initial price almost immediately.[15]
At around 3:45PM CST December 18, 2009, Rackspace experienced an outage for customers using their Dallas-Fort Worth data center – including those of Rackspace Cloud.[16]
On September 8, 2010, Rackspace received national attention when they decided to discontinue providing web hosting service to one of their customers, Dove World Outreach Center.[17] This was in reaction to Dove World's pastor Terry Jones' plan to burn several copies of the Qur'an on the anniversary of the September 11th attacks. Rackspace claims that this violated their company policy. This move came under criticism, notably from Terry Jones himself, who described it as an "indirect attack on our freedom of speech." Others questioned the appropriateness of Rackspace's action, stating that there is "absolutely no reason for web hosts to have an editorial policy, and this only gives Jones more attention, and makes him look more persecuted."[18]
On June 3, 2011, Rackspace intervened in an application by Queensland host Rack Servers to trademark its business name in Australia.[19]
On May 26, 2013, Author Bill Schley's book 'The UnStoppables', which was inspired by the culture at Rackspace, became a New York Times bestseller.[20]
On May 15, 2014, Rackspace hired Morgan Stanley to evaluate strategic options including selling to or merging with other technology companies.[21]
In October, 2014, Rackspace announced that it would sell and support Google Work apps for business customers.[22]
In August 2016, it was confirmed that Apollo Global Management had reached an agreement to buy the company for $4.3 billion.[23] The sale was completed in November 2016 and Rackspace officially ended trading on the New York Stock Exchange on November 3, 2016.[24]
In May 2017, CEO Taylor Rhodes announced he was leaving the company on May 16 to work for a smaller private company in a different city.[25]
Acquisitions[edit]
On May 25, 2017, Rackspace announced an agreement to acquire TriCore Solutions.
On October 22, 2008, Rackspace announced it was purchasing cloud storage provider Jungle Disk and VPS provider SliceHost.
On February 16, 2012, Rackspace acquired SharePoint911, a Microsoft SharePoint consulting company based in Cincinnati, Ohio.[26]
Other acquisitions include Cloudkick, Anso Labs, Mailgun,[27] ObjectRocket,[28] Exceptional Cloud Services, and ZeroVM.[3]
Involvement with other companies[edit]
Rackspace launched ServerBeach in San Antonio in January 2003 as a lower-cost alternative for dedicated servers designed for technology hobbyists who want flexibility and reliability. Richard Yoo was a catalyst in the startup of ServerBeach. A bandwidth and colocation provider, Peer 1 Hosting now known as Cogeco Peer 1, purchased ServerBeach in October 2004 for $7.5 Million.[29] Peer 1 Hosting entered the UK managed hosting market in January 2009 and the ServerBeach brand now competes directly with the UK arm of Rackspace, run by Dominic Monkhouse, former managing director of Rackspace Limited.[30]
In October 2006, Mosso Inc. was launched, which experimented with white-labeling hosting services.[31] Eventually, the division became the foundation for the Rackspace Cloud Computing offering.
On October 1, 2007, Rackspace acquired Webmail.us, a private e-mail hosting firm located in Blacksburg, VA. Originally branded as Mailtrust on May 20, 2009, it became part of the newly formed Email and Apps division of Rackspace.
On October 22, 2008, Rackspace acquired Slicehost, a provider of virtual servers[32] and Jungle Disk, a provider of online backup software and services.[33]
OpenStack[edit]
Main article: OpenStack
In 2010, Rackspace contributed the source code of its Cloud Files product to the OpenStack project under the Apache License to become the OpenStack Object Storage component.[34][35]
In April 2012, Rackspace announced it would implement OpenStack Compute as the underlying technology for their Cloud Servers product. This change introduced a new control panel as well as add-on cloud services offering databases, server monitoring, block storage, and virtual networking.[36] In 2015, two Rackspace executives were elected to the board of the OpenStack Foundation.[37]

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
