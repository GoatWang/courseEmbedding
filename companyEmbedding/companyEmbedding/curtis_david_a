He was elected to the Royal Society of Marine Artists in 1983 and a member of the Royal Institute of Oil Painters in 1988. He exhibits at the major Societies, has regular one-man exhibitions and is a highly successful author.

David Curtis, a regular exhibitor at the Royal Academy's summer exhibition, also lectures and demonstrates at major art events in the country. He was elected to the board of governors, Federation of British Artists, London 1991-1994 and has work held in collections, both nationally and abroad.

                                            Sun Prairie - Curtis Glenn David

On Friday, April 10th 2015 the LORD unexpectedly called Curtis Glenn David to come home and be at His side.

Curt was born March 9th, 1965 in Milwaukee, WI to parents Glenn E. & Lorraine A. (Hengst) David. He grew up alongside his parents in the family business SR Sales, a vintage parts company. Curt loved to share stories about riding his bike through the warehouse as a young boy, "picking parts" with his Dad. He was especially proud when his father entrusted him with the role of company vice-president at the tender age of only four years old. The lessons Curt learned there during his childhood followed him all his life: a deep loyalty, an unrivaled work ethic, and an inquisitive nature that would never be quelled.

The David family later moved to Brookfield, where in 1984 Curt graduated from Brookfield East High School. He continued his work at SR Sales, always with a keen eye towards technology and new trends in the business world. It was here that he honed his analytical and brilliant mind that so many admire today. Curt was not one for conformity; in a challenge where others may have seen just a closed door, Curt instead saw only endless possibilities.

When Curt was 14 years old, his father took him to his first Lincoln Day Dinner. That one event was all it took; he was hooked. Curt's adventure in the world of politics was legendary. As a Waukesha County Young Republican, he considered it a privilege to volunteer his time and efforts and in his own words, Curt had the "highest honor" of serving as a Wisconsin volunteer to President Ronald Reagan's 1984 re-election. To this day, the letters that Curt received of appreciation from President Reagan remain framed and proudly displayed in his home.

Politics, campaigns and elections remained a lifelong passion for Curt. Over the course of 30 years, he was instrumental in electing dozens of candidates to local, state, and federal office. He served in leadership positions for the Republican Party of Wisconsin and was later employed by the Wisconsin State Legislature, where he found kindred spirits and forged many deep friendships that remain to this day. Curt's tenacity and insight knew no bounds. Whether it was an underdog race for mayor or an effort for a seasoned congressman, Curt brought the same consistent and firm leadership to every battle.

Curt was blessed with two daughters, Rebecca Nicole David (21) and Rachel Marie David (19); they remain the apple of their father's eye.  Dinner time with Dad inevitably led to the favorite family tales of growing up; the laughter was just as loud and the smiles were just as wide no matter how many times the story was retold. Curt leaves behind many memories that are forever etched in our minds. He loved and enjoyed music the way a person is supposed to - from deep within his soul. A special favorite for him was Frank Sinatra; loved ones are encouraged to raise a glass to the classic "My Way". Later in life he discovered a passion and true talent for cooking. Always a humble chef, his legion of friends knows the real truth - Curt's food was the best, and it truly was his love served up on a plate. 

Curt found a special comfort and a definite calling out on the open water. He was proud to have earned his Captain's license, and was a master of his craft whether a vessel big or small. Curt navigated the water in the same manner he lived life; with certainty, enthusiasm, and true direction.

Curt is survived by the love of his life, Emily Grace Loe of Sun Prairie, WI. He is further survived by cherished daughters, Rebecca and Rachel of Brookfield; father, Glenn (Mary) David of Pewaukee; sister, Kathy (Gregg) Francke of Okauchee Lake; brother, Mike (Liz) David of Raleigh, NC; many nieces, nephews, and other extended family. He is reunited with his mother Lorraine (2002) in heaven. Never forgotten and forever in our hearts.

A funeral service will be held at CRESS FUNERAL HOME, 1310 Emerald Terrace, Sun Prairie, on Thursday, April 16, 2015 at 2:30 p.m. A visitation will be held at the funeral home following the service on Thursday, April 16, from 3:30 p.m. to 7:00 p.m.

In lieu of flowers, memorials are preferred to the Young America's Foundation. YAF is committed to ensuring that increasing numbers of young Americans understand and are inspired by conservative principles and individual freedom. The Foundation enhances students' experience through visits to the Reagan Ranch located in Santa Barbara, California. 

A fund will be established in Curt's legacy. Contributions to YAF may be sent c/o:Mr. Tyler August, P.O. Box 572 Delavan, WI 53115. Questions: 262-729-9881

Curt was an early enthusiast of DVDs and had a large library of them.  He gave us a list of his DVDs and we would borrow one whenever we wanted to watch a movie.

Curt and I had many conversations about politics and government.  We shared an admiration for Ronald Reagan and I think it is appropriate to contribute, in Curt's memory, to the Young America's Foundation which overseas the Reagan Ranch in Santa Barbara, CA.  I have visited the Ranch myself and found it a very moving experience.

Curt left us way to soon.  He will be missed.

                                                                    I was shocked and deeply saddened to hear the news of Curt's passing.  I was a good friend of Curt's in high school. During that time, he got me involved with the Young Republicans of Waukesha County for the Ronald Reagan Campaign.  What a great time we had together during this campaign!  Even after high school, we kept in close contact.  In 1987 when I got married, Curt was my best man.  You could not have ask for a better person to hold that honor.  Both Dawn and I enjoyed our time on the boat with him and Kim.  We miss those lazy summer afternoons and still talk about them today.  Curt always had a great story to tell and a laugh that was contagious.  Over the years as our families grew, we saw less of each other. I regret that and always will.  Just recently I discovered an e-mail address for Curt.  I sent Curt an e-mail; a few weeks later he sent a nice response. That was the last time I heard from Curt.
My deepest sympathy go out to his entire family, especially his daughters Rebecca and Rachael.

Thinking back to family reunions and weddings up North and how Curt would always get me out dancing - great times!  So Curt, save a dance for me when we meet again.  My deepest sympathy to Rachael & Rebecca, Emily and his family and friends.

Having not seen him in a few years, I still often look back and those times always put a smile on my face. My condolences to his ex wife Kim and beautiful daughters Rebecca and Rachael.

I also remember that he loved his Caddilac. My deepest condolences to the family and he will be missed.
