Company News  // 

            Dec 5, 2013          











Manchester, NH (December 4, 2013) – Dyn, the worldwide leader in Internet performance solutions, announced the hiring of Timothy O’Toole as the company’s Chief Financial Officer (CFO). In addition, the company has promoted Scott Hilton to the role of Executive Vice President (EVP) of Product.

More On Timothy O’Toole
Timothy O’Toole
O’Toole was most recently CFO of Boston-based Rapid7, Inc, where he led the company’s impressive annual growth, raised a $50 million Series C round, negotiated multiple acquisitions and established and supported international operations during his five years there.
“My time at Rapid7 made me a better CFO,” O’Toole said. “The range and breadth of challenges I have experienced prepared me for this next chapter of my career — one that will be written at Dyn.”
“Dyn is a company with a strong financial past and a limitless future,” O’Toole continued. “I hope to build on their success by sharing my years of strategic financial experience.”
Prior to joining Rapid7, O’Toole was the CFO of Mzinga, LLC, where he helped raise $32 million.
In 2007, then-Vice President of Finance O’Toole helped guide BladeLogic Inc.’s Initial Public Offering (IPO), priced at the high end of the range and resulting in the sale of six million shares for a $100 million raise.
“Timothy is well prepared to be part of a team that is working on something big,” said Jeremy Hitchcock, CEO of Dyn. “He has a proven ability to scale finance for private and public companies, and his financial expertise will be a welcomed addition to our executive team.”
O’Toole is not the only new member to the finance team, as Dyn continues to hire seasoned professionals with proven track records. The company recently hired Brian Hayes as controller. Hayes most recently worked as Corporate Controller at Airvana, a Massachusetts-based company that improves 3G wireless networks.

Scott Hilton
Joining O’Toole on Dyn’s executive team is Scott Hilton, promoted to Executive Vice President (EVP) of Product.
“Scott has come into Dyn and made an impact since day one,” Hitchcock said. “His voice has always been one of the most insightful, so it was an easy decision to make that voice a part of our executive team.”
Hilton has spent more than 15 years in high-ranking roles at various technical companies including SpringTide Networks, Lucent Technologies, 3com and Sycamore Networks. At Sycamore, Scott was VP & GM of Mobile Broadband Solutions, responsible for establishing a new business unit, and development and launch of a new content optimization product into the mobile broadband market.
“The rate of growth and change at Dyn has been astonishing,” said Hilton. “This is not the same company I joined eight months ago, and it will be more different next year. We continue to raise our game in the talent we hire, the products we build, the service we provide, and our commitment to customers and the community.”
O’Toole and Hilton, along with Matt Larson, Chief Architect, and executive team mainstays Jeremy Hitchcock, Chairman & CEO, Gray Chynoweth, COO, Kyle York, Chief Revenue Officer and Cory von Wallenstein, Chief Technologist, will lead Dyn into the future.
The hiring of Chris Brenton as Director of Security and Dave Allen as VP, Legal, showcase Dyn’s commitment to systemize its process for finance, business operations, security and compliance.
“We continue to expand our leadership team with talent focused on the investments we must make to build a solid company that can continue to scale and sustain the growth of the future,” Hitchcock said. “For us to execute on our vision, we must drive innovative products, expanding markets and optimized distribution.”
