Our Brands
What We Do









Every Unifi Brand Name Means Quality.
Unifi develops specialty yarns that provide performance, comfort, aesthetic and other advantages. We have branded the premium tier of our portfolio. Our latest introduction is REPREVE®, made from recycled material.






all-in-one® is a single performance yarn that combines moisture management, stretch, UV protection, antimicrobial control - any of the performance properties you want. The properties you  choose for this custom all-in-one are inherent in the yarn, so they will endure. 









Clothes made with MYNX® UV provide the wearer sun protection against UVA (aging) and UVB (burning) rays. MYNX® UV offers permanent sun protection up to 50+ UPF rating, depending upon fabric 		
    construction and color and maintains a 100% UPF rating in wet and dry fabrics. Mnyx® UV provides fabric with a soft, cool hand and subdued luster and is perfect for lightweight fabrics.









Less bacteria means less odor. Amazing technology embedded in A.M.Y.® permanently inhibits the growth of odor causing bacteria, mold, mildew and algae on fabric. A.M.Y.® extends garment life with less discoloration and degradation. A.M.Y. is environmentally safe.









REPREVE® is more than 100% recycled fiber. It's a reprieve for our planet's resources. And because REPREVE® is made from 100% recycled materials, it offsets the need to use new crude oil, conserving our precious natural resources and energy. Did you know that on average, every pound of REPREVE® yarn conserves the equivalent of half a gallon of gasoline? Now available in staple fiber and filament polyester and filament nylon 6,6. Visit Repreve.com for more information.













INHIBIT® is uniquely designed to regress from fire, melting into a material  aiding in extinguishing existing flames. Offering additional performance characteristics to home furnishings and hospitality décor, INHIBIT® provides extra protection to long-term investments.





SATURA® is a family of solution dyed polyester yarns available in a wide range of colors. SATURA® has superior color consistency, light fastness characteristics and is bleach cleanable. Because SATURA® is solution dyed, additional fabric dyeing processes are eliminated, reducing the product's environmental footprint. For enhanced product performance, SATURA® Max is available.





REFLEXX® offers superior stretch and recovery performance. It is durable, with stretch properties lasting the life of the fabric, and is suitable for commercial laundering. REFLEXX® extends the life of the garment with improved color retention and easy care properties. REFLEXX® is available in a wide array of yarn and fiber types.









Named after its place on the Periodic Table of Elements, 4T7™ is a nylon fiber that has been encapsulated in pure silver, providing permanent multi-functional properties for a variety of end uses. This technical performance fiber can be knit or woven as a single silver yarn, or combined with other fibers for design and engineering flexibility.












SORBTEK® provides permanent moisture management through our proprietary Catch, Move, Release technology. SORBTEK® catches moisture, moves it away and releases it for quick evaporation. The yarn is breathable, which leaves the wearer cool, dry and comfortable. In addition to moisture management, SORBTEK® offers inherent soil release properties to protect against soil such as sweat and grass.	









SULTRA® is an ultra-microdenier yarn that creates easy-care fabrics with a suede-like hand and appearance. Used in "sueded" fabrics for apparel, home furnishings and automotive upholstery, SULTRA® offers both the look and feel of suede.





SOFTEC™ is a patented flat filament polyester yarn with improved product performance benefits vs. conventional flat-drawn or textured polyester yarns.





AUGUSTA® simulates the natural look and hand of spun yarns with performance benefits associated with synthetic filament yarns. AUGUSTA® yarns are "way beyond cotton" and extend garment life thanks to superior color retention, wrinkle resistance and lower pilling than spun yarns.









ECLYSPSE® provides the look and textured hand of blended wool with the easy-care attributes of synthetic yarns. ECLYSPSE® is versatile and functional, offering a range of mélange effects, from subtle heathers to more pronounced striations all in one yarn.





MICROVISTA® is a microdenier or near-micro yarn giving fabrics an ultra-soft hand and appearance. Comfortable and ease of care make MICROVISTA® an  alternative to the beauty and performance of traditional microfibers.





DACRON® polyester sets the standard in high-quality apparel and continues to raise the bar. The DACRON® brand - the first to deliver wash-and-wear properties - has become synonymous with "easy care."

Unifi Announces Online Fabric Certification for Branded Products
For Release: 1/12/2009


GREENSBORO, NC -- 

Unifi, Inc. (UFI) has partnered with TEXbase, Inc. to launch a new online fabric certification program for all Unifi branded products. The new system will automate and expedite the certification of fabrics, streamlining the development process for new and existing customers. Additionally, the new program will provide brands and retailers with a global online fabric library, where they can search for Unifi certified products.

The online certification system and fabric library were designed to simplify the certification process and increase speed to market for Unifi's customers worldwide. The TEXbase software allows Unifi's manufacturing partners to input fabric specifications online, automating the process and eliminating time consuming emails and static spreadsheets. The product specifications are stored in one centralized database, ensuring data consistency and accuracy. The web-based platform enables brands and retailers to search previously certified fabrics by construction, fiber, weight and technical and hangtags.
"Our partners are always interested in ways to shorten the product development cycle," said Roger Berrier, executive vice president for Unifi. "The TEXbase system allows us to provide our partners a direct link into the certification portal and fabric library for realtime data input, searching and collaboration. In response to our customer's needs, we're making it easier for them to develop innovative, quality products more efficiently." The Unifi certification management system and the online fabric library will be launched at the upcoming Outdoor Retailer Winter Market in Salt Lake City, Utah, January 22-25, 2009. For more information or a live demo, stop by the Unifi Booth #62021 or TEXbase Booth #62045 or visit www.repreve.com and www.unifi.com.

What We Do


















Our Capabilities & Services
Our manufacturing processes turn raw materials and fiber into synthetic filament yarns. These yarns are then sold and further processed into fabrics. Outside of our wide range of manufacturing capabilities, we provide many value added services to our customers including onsite technical service and door-to-door delivery through Unifi owned and operated transportation.


POY
The first step in producing synthetic yarn begins with the raw material known as POY (partially-oriented yarn). POY is made from small polymer beads that are melted and extruded through microscopic holes to form a single fiber filament. In addition to producing natural POY, Unifi also has the ability to produce solution dyed polyester for use in color rich fabrics.


Texturing & Air Jet Texturing
We draw, heat and twist the continuous filament yarn to optimize various physical characteristics like bulk, strength, stretch and dyeability. Our advanced air-jet texturing capabilities and innovative texturing methods allow us to produce finished synthetics that look and feel like natural yarns, or provide products with unique and superior performance characteristics.


Package Dyeing
Using the most advanced color-matching applications, we're able to match exact color specifications for even the most color-critical markets, such as home furnishings, automotive and specialized apparel. We dye many substrates including textured and spun polyester, rayon, cotton, acrylic, nylon and various blends of these fibers.


Covering
By wrapping or air-entangling filament or spun yarns around a core yarn, we can significantly enhance a fabric's ability to stretch, recover its original shape and resist wrinkles. We use air covering, single covering and double covering.


Twisting
We combine filaments into yarn by twisting them together for applications such as sewing thread, home furnishings and apparel.


Beaming
We wind polyester and nylon, textured and flat yarn on to beams to be used by customers in warp knitting and weaving applications.
