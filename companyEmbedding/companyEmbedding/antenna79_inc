Pong cases are engineered to protect you and your phone. They are proven to reduce exposure to cell phone radiation. Beyond protecting from radiation, Pong cases provide a 4’-6.6’ drop protection certified to U.S. military specifications. Pong does what no other case can — embedded with a patented, micro thin, gold-plated antenna, it reduces exposure to potentially harmful cell phone radiation while maintaining the phone’s signal. Results from tests in FCC-certified labs show exposure reduced by up to five times below the FCC Specific Absorption Rate (SAR), Pong cases are the only technology that reduce exposure without compromising your device’s performance.
 View Pong Website 















Leveraging proprietary micro-thin antenna architectures and a design featuring an expandable antenna, the R79X case enlarges the area of the phone’s existing antenna system.  Just put the case on the phone and the R79X automatically begins working.  Slide it out to increase the antenna.  With drop-test protection at 6’, the cases exceed military-grade drop standards, and R79X cases are proven in independent CTIA-certifed labs.

Reach Antenna for iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 plus is an attachable antenna that offers advanced antenna technology for optimum performance. The patented, micro-thin, gold, attachable antenna pairs automatically with your iPhone’s antenna and works with your case (as long as your case does not contain metal). Through electromagnetic coupling, the Reach Antenna creates an expanded antenna system that provides up to 1.5x stronger LTE signal and strengthens the possibility for greater coverage, faster data speeds, and better battery life. Independently tested to improved upload and download LTE signal strength by up to 1.5x in handheld use. Increase your chance of having a better all-around mobile experience.
