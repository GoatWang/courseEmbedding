ORDER: The Court is in receipt of a letter from Defendants, dated July 1, 2015, in which Defendants claim that the statements from three confidential witnesses quoted in Plaintiffs' Amended Consolidated Class Action Complaint are "inaccurate, misleading, or lacking a foundation in personal knowledge." In re Millennial Media, Inc. Sec. Litig., No. 14-cv-7293 (PAE), 2015 WL 3443918, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. May 29, 20 15) (Doc. No. 56.)

602015-07-06
MEMO ENDORSEMENT on re: 58 Letter, filed by Michael Bollinger, Eugene Stricker. ENDORSEMENT: Plaintiffs' request is denied. At this time, the Court is not seeking Plaintiffs' "confidential and proprietary information" or any other intelligence that "may arguably waive the work-product protection" accorded by Rule 26. Instead, the Court directs Plaintiffs merely to inform the Court as to whether they deny the assertions in Defendants' letter and whether there is additional authority they wish to bring to the Court's attention regarding the legal arguments set forth in Defendants' July 1, 2015 letter. (Signed by Judge Richard J. Sullivan on 7/6/2015) (mro) (Entered: 07/07/2015)

LETTER addressed to Judge Richard J. Sullivan from Jeffery P. Campisi dated July 7, 2015 re: response to the July 1, 2015 letter by Mr. Mark A. Kirsch to Your Honor and the accompanying Declaration of Lisa H. Rubin (ECF No. 56). Document filed by Michael Bollinger, Eugene Stricker. (Attachments: # 1 Declaration of Jeffrey P. Campisi)(Campisi, Jeffrey) (Entered: 07/07/2015)
622015-07-10
ORDER: In light of these disputed facts, the Court will not go outside the pleadings and, for the purpose of Defendants' motion to dismiss, will presume the truth of the factual assertions set forth in Plaintiffs' Complaint. See ATSI Commc'ns, Inc. v. Shaar Fund, Ltd., 493 F.3d 87, 98 (2d Cir. 2007). To the extent that the Court denies Defendants' motion to dismiss in whole or in part, the parties may pursue Defendants' allegations in discovery. If it turns out that Plaintiffs have in fact mischaracterized the factual allegations in the Complaint, or otherwise arranged for the inclusion of statements that are "inaccurate, misleading, or lacking a foundation in personal knowledge," Defendants may make a motion for summary judgment and/or for sanctions. (As further set forth in this Order.) (Signed by Judge Richard J. Sullivan on 7/10/2015) (kko) (Entered: 07/10/2015)

OPINION AND ORDER re: 44 MOTION to Dismiss the Consolidated Class Action Complaint filed by Sergio Pedreiro, Coty Inc., Jack Stahl, Erhard Schoewel, M. Steven Langman, Peter Harf, James E. Shiah, Robert Singer, Lambertus J.H. Becht, Oliver Goudet, Joachim Faber, Michele Scannavini, Bradley M. Bloom. Plaintiffs' Complaint, as written, constitutes a classic example of Monday morning-quarterbacking whereby Plaintiffs, armed with disappointing fourth quarter results, resort to vague assertions and innuendo to support a "Defendants misled me" theory of liability. Unfortunately for Plaintiffs, Section 11 requires much more than the grab bag of suspicion and speculation contained in Plaintiffs' pleading. Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT Defendants' motion to dismiss the Amended Consolidated Class Action Complaint is GRANTED in its entirety. The Clerk of the Court is respectfully directed to terminate the motion located at docket number 44 and close this case. (As further set forth in this Order.) (Signed by Judge Richard J. Sullivan on 3/29/2016) (kko) (Main Document 63 replaced on 3/29/2016) (kko). Modified on 3/29/2016 (kko). (Entered: 03/29/2016)
642016-03-30
CLERK'S JUDGMENT: It is, ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED: That for the reasons stated in the Court's Opinion and Order dated March 29, 2016, Plaintiffs' Complaint, as written, constitutes a classic example of Monday morning-quarterbacking whereby Plaintiffs, armed with disappointing fourth quarter results, resort to vague assertions and innuendo to support a "Defendants misled me" theory of liability. Unfortunately for Plaintiffs, Section 11 requires much more than the grab bag of suspicion and speculation contained in Plaintiffs' pleading. Accordingly, it is hereby ordered that Defendants' motion to dismiss the Amended Consolidated Class Action Complaint is granted in its entirety; accordingly, the case is closed. (Signed by Clerk of Court Ruby Krajick on 03/30/2016) (Attachments: # 1 Right to Appeal, # 2 Right to Appeal)(km) (Entered: 03/30/2016)
