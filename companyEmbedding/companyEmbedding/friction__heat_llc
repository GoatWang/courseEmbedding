They produce heat because the surfaces on small scales are rough like canyons rather than flat like the ocean. As these rough surfaces come into contact with each other they repel. When two atoms are brought very close together they store potential energy. When they move apart that energy becomes kinetic. However, this kinetic energy generally isn't enough to escape the object they are attached to so the energy becomes randomly distributed as kinetic energy exchanged between the atoms of the object also known as thermal energy. In some cases the energy is enough to break bonds and indeed friction can cause objects to deteriorate and fall apart as in a meteor falling through the sky being torn apart by atmospheric friction.
As for visible light, if you've ever seen a meteor shower then you know that they do produce a lot of visible light due to friction with the atmosphere.

I feel it may be nice to elaborate a bit on the last paragraph, adding some info about energy scales associated to certain frequency ranges of the EM spectrum, and why this explains the comet thing differing from your typical friction.

Molecules are undergoing elastic collisions. For any given substance, the faster its molecules are colliding, the hotter it is. When an object slides along another object, the total kinetic energy plus gravitational potential of its molecules plus gravitational potential energy must be conserved. It can be proven that in Newtonian physics, for any system whose momentum doesn't change, its kinetic energy increases by the same amount in all frames of reference though not necessarily the kinetic energy of each individual object in the system. That means the total kinetic energy of each sliding object can be espressed as the sum of its kinetic energy of movement and the kinetic energy of its molecules. When they slide across each other, kinetic energy of movement is converted to kinetic energy of molecules. Since an object requires such a high speed of molecules like 300 m/s to have room temperature, not very much heat gets created for the amount of kinetic energy lost to friction. That's why it's easy to not notice that friction can produce any heat.

How does friction start a fire?

 Fire is one of the most important forces in human history. 


Jeremy Hoare/Life File/Getty Images






You're probably familiar with friction, the force that resists motion between two surfaces. In everyday life we tend to think of friction as a bad thing. After all, it's what makes it so hard to drag a couch across a room. Even outside the realm of physics, the word has a negative connotation (in terms of interpersonal relationships, it means "disagreement").
However, if you're ever lost in the wilderness and in need of fire for survival, you'll thank your lucky stars for friction. You may have heard that rubbing two sticks together can start a fire, but we're going to investigate the physics of how that really happens.
Laws of Attraction
To understand friction, we have to zoom into the microscopic level of what's going on between surfaces. No surface -- not even slippery ice -- is perfectly smooth. All surfaces have irregularities on the molecular level, and when two touching surfaces move relative to each other, they get caught in each other's little hills and valleys. Not only that, but the molecules from one surface actually start attracting molecules from the other surface, and they form chemical bonds with each other. Breaking these bonds and pushing past the hills and valleys takes considerable work.
Warming Up
When you push a couch across the floor, much of your energy is wasted pushing the surface of the couch along the surface of the floor, but that energy doesn't just disappear. The law of conservation of energy states that it can't be created or destroyed. Friction converts useful kinetic energy (also called ordered energy) into thermal energy (disordered energy), or heat.
Friction gets a bad rap for turning useful energy into useless energy. It's true that a lot of kinetic energy in the world is lost into the atmosphere as heat. But heat isn't always useless. For instance, whenever our hands get cold, we can rub them together and feel the heat from the friction almost immediately. But more importantly, heat is one of the three pillars required for starting a fire.
C'mon Baby, Light My Fire
The ingredients needed to start a fire are traditionally illustrated in the fire triangle. The three legs of the triangle are fuel, oxygen and heat. When enough of these three factors is present, a chemical reaction occurs that results in fire. This is why you can start a fire with two sticks: The fuel is the sticks, the oxygen comes from the air and fiction provides the necessary heat.
But this is far from the only circumstance in which friction starts a fire. Even lighting a match relies on the heat that comes from the friction of striking. And friction can feed on more than just wood -- fuel can take the form of any flammable substance. You might be surprised by what kinds of materials are flammable. For instance, metals, plastics and rubber can all be set afire under the right conditions and temperatures. Such materials are especially prone to catching on fire - and fast - when they are in the form of powdery dust.
So to paraphrase the advice your mom gave you? Don't go playing with friction.

Hide this message.QuoraSign In Heat Transfer Physics Friction Heat Science PhysicsWhy does friction produce heat?UpdateCancelAnswer Wiki8 Answers  Tony Sabu, EntrepreneurAnswered 129w agoWell, I guess the exact reason is not very well understood. But here is my explanation-There is no exact mechanism of heat generation! I think it all depends on the physical and chemical properties of the two sliding objects. That is, the heat generation mechanism may be different for friction between two ductile materials and two brittle materials. Surface roughness, maximum shear stress values, surface hardness, etc. play an important role. Also, the variation of the above said factors with temperature would also matter.Let us consider two objects sliding w.r.t each other. The immediate things that we may observe are sound, vibrations, erosion of material from the sliding surfaces and of course heat.From these observations, we can conclude that repeated local plastic and elstic deformation of the materials may be one reason. Then when material gets eroded or sheared of, if they are not removed from the sliding surfaces, it would aid in the deformation process. Again, it is not just the deformation alone but the shearing off of material itself contribute to heat formation due to breaking of bonds. The above explanation is best suited for friction between two ductile and rough materials!The process maybe be different for some other material interface. Again, friction between non metallic and metallic surface may cause heat through some other mechanism. I have no answer for heat produced due to fluid-solid friction.5.6k Views · 1 UpvotePromoted by BlinkistEver read 4 books in one day?

Savings through the Seasons
Insulation acts as a thermal barrier against heat loss and heat gain. In most buildings insulation is the most practical and effective method to keep structures cool in the summer months and warm during the winter months. Insulation helps to reduce energy use and save money on energy bills. Reflective Insulation fortifies normal insulation by reflecting radiant heat. Properly installed radiant barriers can result in substantial year round savings. Contact Us

As a result, installation is not only easier but the risk of losing product from damage is less likely. Furthermore, our reflective insulation continues to stay strong day in and day out providing durability throughout the entirety of the products use. At International Insulation Products we understand the need for superior product performance. Likewise, we understand the need for a product that can withstand the common hazards of a construction environment while also being easy to ship and handle. Contact Us


  



  












Solar Heat Blocking
International Insulation Product’s reflective insulation and radiant barriers incorporate polished aluminum facing that blocks radiant heat from the sun.






  












Heat Retention
Our reflective insulation utilizes a heat absorbing core that retains heated air during colder weather resulting in lower power bills.






  












Reduce Peak Hours
By using reflective insulation, temperatures are slower to increase from radiant heat throughout the day thereby reducing peak hour energy rates.

NanoProMT - Advanced, Nanotechnology Lubricants

































FOR EXTREME PROTECTION, AND EXTREME PERFORMANCE, UNDER EXTREME CONDITIONS, YOU NEED EXTREME SCIENCE.
                
To go big, you have to go nano meter small.







You have to go to where metal meets metal. Where friction creates heat and causes wear. Where pressure builds and performance lags.



Formulated with specially engineered nanoparticles, NanoProMT’s advanced products penetrate deeper, to lubricate where it counts — at the metal-to-metal interface, at the nano level.
No other lubricants protect as completely because no other lubricants can penetrate to the nano level where friction, heat, wear and corrosion occur.










MILITARY TOUGH, MILITARY-TESTED
Where mission is critical, failure is not an option.


In the heat of combat, machinery must perform under pressure. It must take the heat, literally, and operate at temperatures most machines never reach: from -42° below to 356° F. Equipment failures can cost lives and millions of dollars.
Working in conjunction with the military and with Boeing Phantom Works, NanoProMT is engineering product specifically designed to meet strict requirements and rigorous demands of cutting-edge institutions. And we’ve been put to test, undergoing extensive lab- and field-testing that has led to military-grade formulas being applied  to all NanoProMT products.












FIELD-TESTED, INDUSTRY-APPLIED
NanoProMT performs in the most extreme industries and applications, including heavy-wear machinery and hardware. With extended use over time and prolonged exposure to high heat, standard lubricants break down and stop protecting. But our specially engineered nanoparticles eliminate these problems, delivering superior penetration for complete coverage that protects longer without altering any dimensional surface tolerance.

MILITARY TOUGH, ROAD READY


The average Class 8 highway truck logs 68,000 miles a year. That's kind of milage can cause extreme wear on an engine, wheel bearings, and other essential parts. Like the fifth wheel plate and locks that are too often under-lubricated that can prevent the king pin from securely latching and the trailer from pivoting and cause a serious accident, under normal operating conditions. But when proper lubricated, up to 95% of fifth wheel "on road" failures can be eliminate. NanoProMT protects and lubricate deep reducing friction to extend duty cycles, improve fuel economy, and reduce breakdown and accident. 



NanoProMT oil additive is FIELD-PROVEN on Mack MP7 diesel engines, extending oil change intervals by 3 times for a cost savings of over $1,000 by eliminating replacement oil, filters and labor per vehicle. At just $130 a bottle, that’s a 675% ROI. Let us show you how NanoProMT can drastically eliminate maintenance cost for your fleet.

*Results obtained in third party testing.






MILITARY TOUGH, RACE READY


Race engineers log hundreds of hours and spend millions of dollars on wind-tunnel and track testing to find performance gains measured in fractions of a percent. Running NanoWater in race vehicles can improve heat rejection by 30%, dropping the operating water temperature by up to 5ºF*. In an environment where every bit counts, these types of gains can make the difference between finishing first, and not finishing at all.



NanoWater is field-proven, used in the Rolex Grand-Am sports car series for two seasons for marked thermal gains. This improved performance allowed the team to use less air for the same engine cooling, resulting in less drag for higher straightaway speeds and more downforce for higher corner speeds. Let us show you how NanoProMT can also give your team an edge.

*Results obtained in third-party testing with the RAM & System Assessment Division of the U.S. Army. 






MILITARY TOUGH, FLIGHT READY


Aircraft must perform in the severe temperatures of frozen runways, hot desert airstrips, and everything in between. NanoProMT delivers universal high performance under these extreme operating conditions to protect highly stressed, flight-critical rotating components. Our aviation grease can increase thermal conductivity by 39% and reduce scarring by 28% over standard aviation grease, drastically reducing friction and wear to keep aircraft flight-ready and operating safely, longer.*



NanoProMT Aviation Gear Oil is FIELD-PROVEN and specially formulated for the AH-64 Apache helicopter to reduce the operating temperature of the gearbox by 40-50˚ F. This improved performance allows the military to stay in flight for extended missions, run at higher RPMs, and perform fewer maintenance cycles. Let us show you how NanoProMT can also give your team an edge.

*Results obtained in third-party testing with the RAM & System Assessment Division of the U.S. Army 
 and the ASTM D2266 4-ball testing protocol.

MILITARY TOUGH, WATER READY


Specially created for marine applications, such as wheel bearings, water pumps, hinges, winches, and chain reels, NanoProMT’s water-insoluble formula provides the highest grade (1A*) protection against oxidation and corrosion, even in the harshest marine environments, with maximum stability and load-bearing protection of up to 800 kg (twice that of traditional lubricants)*.



NanoProMT is FIELD-PROVEN in one of America’s largest family indoor water parks, with pumps running 250 gallons of water per minute, year-round to entertain guests. That’s a lot of pressure. Our Marine Grease meets the challenge, reducing bearing loads and amperage, resulting in 67% less annual maintenance, and NO catastrophic failures. Let us show you how NanoProMT can also keep you up and running.

* Results were obtained in compliance with ASTM D2596 4-ball wield load-testing and ASTM 1732 rust-testing protocols.










NanoProMT products undergo rigorous third party testing to guarantee performance under the most extreme conditions.

Nanoparticles convert sliding friction to rolling friction, for reduced wear, less heat, and higher efficiency. Third-party 4 Ball Wear testing proves our superiority in handling pressure and reducing friction for reduced wear.


Extreme Cold to Extreme Heat
NanoProMT has a thermal stability 300 times higher than the standard lubricant, which allows it to perform at operating temperatures most machines will never reach: -42o F to 356o F. All of our products provide superior pump-ability at low temperatures for cold start performance, and maintain their viscosity when heated, with unsurpassed dropping point temperatures.


Extreme Pressure 

NanoProMT protects against spalling, galling, and scarring for superior load bearing and protection against wear, as shown by our oil stabilizers, which reduce scarring by 25%, and our automotive gear oil that improves load- bearing capacity by 20% over standard oils.*


Extreme Environments

By protecting at the atomic level, where air and moisture oxidize and destroy metal, NanoProMT’s Marine Grease received the highest ASTM grade (1A*), proof that it can defend against oxidation and galvanic corrosion, as well as air, moisture, salt, and sand, which cause rust and friction, even under the harshest marine conditions.









NANOPROMT PRODUCTS SHATTER THE LIMITS OF HIGH PERFORMANCE.
We’re redefining high performance in lubricants, greases, and hydraulic fluids. All NanoProMT products deliver universal high performance at temperature- and environmental-operating thresholds 3X greater than standard lubricants to better protect and preserve equipment from friction, heat, pressure, and corrosion at the nano level.
