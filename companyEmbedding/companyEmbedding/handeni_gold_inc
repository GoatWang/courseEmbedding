WELCOME TO



 Handeni Gold Inc 
 Handeni Gold Inc (OTC-QB: HNDI) (the “Company”) is an emerging gold exploration company focused on exploring and developing gold mining opportunities in the Republic of Tanzania. 
The Company’s principle area of focus is the 800 square kilometer Handeni Gold Project located in the Handeni district, within the Tanga region of the Republic of Tanzania. Although gold mineralisation was described in the area since the early 1950’s, it was only recently that artisanal miners focused on the Handeni area following the successful exploration for gold in the Lake Victoria district. These efforts led to the discovery of the Magambazi Hill gold mine. The attention of the exploration community came to focus on the Handeni district by successful drilling projects conducted on Magambazi Hill and its surroundings.

TANZANIA OVERVIEW



  
   

 






 Official Name – United Republic of Tanzania
History
The United Republic of Tanzania was formed in 1964 following the merger of two sovereign states of Tanzania mainland then Tanganyika and the Zanzibar constituting of the islands of Zanzibar and Pemba. Tanganyika was colonized by the Germans at the end of the 19th century. After German defeat in the First World War, the League of Nations designated Tanganyika a British Mandate until December 1961 when the country achieved full independence. Zanzibar achieved independence in 1963. Following a popular revolution which took place in January 1964, Zanzibar merged with Tanganyika in April 1964 to form the United Republic of Tanzania.
Democracy
Tanzania is one of the most stable multi-party democracies in Africa. Elections are held every 5 years to choose the President and Members of Parliament for the Union Government; and the President and Members of the House of Representatives for the Zanzibar Revolutionary Government.
Geography
Tanzania is the largest country in East Africa bordered by the Indian Ocean to the East; Kenya and Uganda to the North; Rwanda, Burundi and Democratic Republic of Congo to the West; and Zambia, Malawi and Mozambique to the South. With an area of 947,300 sq km, Tanzania is slightly larger than the states of Texas and Michigan combined; or about the size of British Columbia. The Country’s notable physical features include, Kilimanjaro Mountain; the highest mountain in Africa, Lake Victoria the second largest lake in the World and Lake Tanganyika the second deepest lake in the world.
Economy
Tanzania’s economy is primarily dependent on agriculture, which employs about 80% of the work force and contributes 27% of GDP and over 80% of export earnings. However the country offers tremendous opportunities for investors as it is endowed with significant natural resources. Major resources include fertile land and abundant water resources for agricultural irrigation, world-class tourist attractions such as Mount Kilimanjaro, Serengeti and Ngorongoro Crater national parks, Selousgame reserve, pristine beaches and Zanzibar. In addition the country has excellent geographical location in the East African region with the Port of Dar es Salaam being the gateway for the land locked African countries of DRC, Uganda, Burundi, Rwanda, Zambia and Malawi.
Mining
Tanzania has abundant mineral resources. The country’s mining industry is driven by gold mining. Since the mid 1990’s, Tanzania has been the major focus of Africa’s gold exploration and development attracting some of the largest mining companies in the World. Major gold mining companies operating in the country include Barrick of Canada, Anglo Gold Ashanti of South Africa and Resolute. Gold output in Tanzania increased from 5 tonnes in 1997 to 50 tonnes in 2007 earning the country third position in Africa after South Africa and Ghana. Tanzania has also substantial reserves of other minerals including nickel, iron ore, copper, uranium, coal, diamond and a wide variety of gemstones such as ruby and sapphire, emerald, alexandrite, green garnet and Tanzanite, which is only found and mined in Tanzania.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

GlobeNewswire



Jun 19, 2017 8:06 AM EDT













 


















































 DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania, June 19, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Handeni Gold Inc. (the "Company" or "Handeni Gold") (OTC Pink:HNDI) is pleased to announce that it has entered into a shares for debt settlement with IPP Ltd. pursuant to which the Company has issued 2,475,000 shares of restricted common stock to IPP Gold Ltd. at a deemed settlement price of $0.12 per share in full and complete satisfaction of outstanding debts of $297,000 owing from the Company to IPP Ltd. The securities issued pursuant to the shares for debt settlement have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "U.S. Securities Act").  Such securities are "restricted securities" as defined under Rule 144(a)(3) of the U.S. Securities Act and contain the appropriate restrictive legends as required under the U.S. Securities Act and under Multilateral Instrument 51-105.  About Handeni Gold Inc. The Company is an emerging mineral exploration company focused on exploring and developing mining opportunities in Tanzania.  For more information, go to www.handenigold.com.  Safe Harbour Statements Except for the statements of historical fact contained herein, the information presented in this news release constitutes "forward-looking statements" as such term is used in applicable United States and Canadian laws. These statements relate to analyses and other information that are based on forecasts of future results, estimates of amounts not yet determinable and assumptions of management. Any statements that express or involve discussions with respect to predictions, expectations, beliefs, plans, projections, objectives, assumptions or future events or performance (often, but not always, using words or phrases such as "expects" or "does not expect", "is expected", "anticipates" or "does not anticipate", "plans", "estimates" or "intends", or stating that certain actions, events or results "may", "could", "would", "might" or "will" be taken, occur or be achieved) are not statements of historical fact and should be viewed as "forward-looking statements". Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of the Company to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Such risks and other factors include, among others, the actual results of exploration activities, the availability of capital to fund programs and the resulting dilution caused by the raising of capital through the sale of shares, accidents, labour disputes and other risks of the mining industry including, without limitation, those associated with the environment, delays in obtaining governmental approvals, permits or financing or in the completion of development or construction activities, title disputes or claims limitations on insurance coverage. Although the Company has attempted to identify important factors that could cause actual actions, events or results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements, there may be other factors that cause actions, events or results not to be as anticipated, estimated or intended.
