We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the Website, to track users’ movements around the Website and to gather analytic information about our user base as a whole. We do not link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information.
Google Analytics

Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues.

In such a case, unless permitted otherwise by applicable law, your information would remain subject to the terms hereof.

Nick Over joined RPAI as the VP, Director of Development in March 2015 to establish RPAI’s re/development team. With 15 years of retail real estate development experience, Nick is an industry leader who can multi-task and do it all. His primary job responsibilities include identifying, evaluating and initiating new real estate development opportunities in the Eastern Division of the U.S.; which includes the master plan development, design, and operation functions related to several large high profile projects. Spending his professional career at The Peterson Companies and Federal Realty Investment Trust supporting some of the largest development projects in the D.C. / Baltimore corridor, Nick has the ability to leverage his local relationships with property owners, developers and municipality officials to identify value enhancement opportunities to serve RPAI’s core customer and local communities.
Nick oversees a redevelopment pipeline that will deploy $30 to $50 million in capital, net of air right sales, on a stabilized annualized basis. Each project’s returns are projected to be in the high single digits to low double digits. To highlight one of Nick’s projects, Towson Circle, is transforming an atypical strip center into a mixed development with double-sided street level retail and 390 residential units above. Nick is overseeing the project and has partnered with our best-in-class residential partner, Avalon Bay. Another transformative project is our Boulevard at the Capital Centre redevelopment in the Washington, D.C. MSA. Nick led our efforts to obtain approval from the county to redevelop approximately 50 acres of land that was previously subject to a long-term ground lease. That coupled with the Certificate of Need that was received from the State of Maryland for their new hospital project, effectively puts a long-term redevelopment plan in motion, positioning RPAI to finalize our densification plans for that asset over the next twelve months.
Mr. Over has a B.S. in Business Administration and Accounting from the University of Louisiana-Lafayette and a J.D from Loyola University College of Law in New Orleans, Louisiana.

OAK BROOK, Ill., May 2, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Retail Properties of America, Inc. (NYSE:    RPAI) (the "Company") today reported financial and operating results for the quarter ended March 31, 2017.


FINANCIAL RESULTSFor the quarter ended March 31, 2017, the Company reported: 

Net (loss) income attributable to common shareholders of $(11.5) million, or $(0.05) per share, compared to $45.1 million, or $0.19 per share, for the same period in 2016; 
Funds from operations (FFO) attributable to common shareholders of $0.5 million, or $0.00 per share, compared to $76.4 million, or $0.32 per share, for the same period in 2016; and 
Operating funds from operations (Operating FFO) attributable to common shareholders of $66.9 million, or $0.28 per share, compared to $65.7 million, or $0.28 per share, for the same period in 2016.

The primary driver of net loss attributable to common shareholders and FFO attributable to common shareholders for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 was approximately $60.2 million, or $0.25 per share, of premium and costs incurred in connection with the defeasance of the IW JV cross-collateralized portfolio of mortgages payable, discussed below.
OPERATING RESULTSFor the quarter ended March 31, 2017, the Company's portfolio results were as follows:

2.0% increase in same store net operating income (NOI) over the comparable period in 2016; 
Total same store portfolio percent leased, including leases signed but not commenced: 95.3% at March 31, 2017, down 30 basis points from 95.6% at December 31, 2016 and up 20 basis points from 95.1% at March 31, 2016; 
Retail portfolio percent leased, including leases signed but not commenced: 94.3% at March 31, 2017, down 70 basis points from 95.0% at December 31, 2016 and down 30 basis points from 94.6% at March 31, 2016; 
Retail portfolio annualized base rent (ABR) per occupied square foot of $17.52 at March 31, 2017, up 5.3% from $16.64 ABR per occupied square foot at March 31, 2016; 
466,000 square feet of retail leasing transactions comprised of 121 new and renewal leases at an ABR per square foot of $27.14; and 
Positive comparable cash leasing spreads of 21.8% on new leases and 8.6% on renewal leases for a blended spread of 10.0%.

"We are pleased to report another solid quarter of financial and operational results, highlighted by our strong blended re-leasing spreads of 10%, representing a record high for RPAI," stated Steve Grimes, president and chief executive officer. "While recent tenant bankruptcies have caused short-term disruption in our same store NOI growth assumption for 2017, we view this as a tremendous opportunity to significantly mark-to-market rents and strengthen our long-term underlying cash flows, which is a direct result of the strong tenant demand to lease space in our high quality portfolio. In addition, we continue to make excellent progress on our 2017 transactional goals with 75% of our targeted retail dispositions closed, under contract or in LOI." 
INVESTMENT ACTIVITYDispositionsTo date in 2017, the Company has completed, is under contract or has Letters of Intent (LOIs) for dispositions totaling $568.8 million. During the quarter, the Company completed $106.0 million of dispositions, which included the sales of three non-target multi-tenant retail assets for $80.0 million, one single-user parcel for $17.5 million and three single-user retail assets for $8.5 million. 
Subsequent to quarter end, the Company completed the sales of four non-target multi-tenant retail assets, three of which were classified as held for sale as of March 31, 2017, for $56.7 million. 
The Company is under contract to sell $201.0 million of dispositions, which includes 10 non-target multi-tenant retail assets for $194.7 million and two single-user retail assets for $6.3 million. In addition, the Company has LOIs to sell $205.1 million of dispositions, which includes nine non-target multi-tenant retail assets for $202.6 million and a single-user retail asset for $2.5 million. These transactions are expected to close throughout 2017, subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions.
Acquisitions To date in 2017, the Company has completed or is under contract for $125.5 million of acquisitions. During the quarter, as previously announced, the Company completed the acquisition of Main Street Promenade, located in the Chicago Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA), for a gross purchase price of $88.0 million. In addition, the Company acquired the fee interest, which was previously subject to a ground lease with a third party, in an existing multi-tenant retail property for a gross purchase price of $2.0 million and an additional phase at our existing One Loudoun Downtown property for a gross purchase price of $4.1 million, both of which are located in the Washington, D.C. MSA. Subsequent to quarter end, the Company acquired an additional phase at One Loudoun Downtown for a gross purchase price of $2.2 million. 
The Company remains under contract for the remaining phases at One Loudoun Downtown, representing an aggregate gross purchase price of up to $29.2 million. These transactions are expected to close during the second and third quarters of 2017 as the seller completes construction on stand-alone buildings at the property.
BALANCE SHEET AND CAPITAL MARKETS ACTIVITYAs of March 31, 2017, the Company had approximately $2.1 billion of consolidated indebtedness, which resulted in a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 5.6x, or a net debt and preferred stock to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 6.0x. Consolidated indebtedness had a weighted average contractual interest rate of 3.49% and a weighted average maturity of 5.3 years.
During the quarter, as previously disclosed, the Company defeased the $379.4 million IW JV cross-collateralized portfolio of mortgages payable that was scheduled to mature in 2019 and had an interest rate of 7.50%. In connection with this transaction, the Company incurred approximately $60.2 million in defeasance costs. The fair value of these mortgages was approximately $45.1 million higher than the outstanding principal balance as of December 31, 2016.  The Company also repaid $19.4 million of mortgage debt, excluding amortization, with an interest rate of 4.25% and incurred a prepayment penalty of $2.1 million.
In addition, during the quarter, the Company drew the full balance of a seven-year $200.0 million senior unsecured term loan (Term Loan Due 2023) with an interest rate of London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a credit spread of between 1.70% and 2.55%, based on the Company's leverage ratio. The Company also entered into two interest rate swap agreements to effectively fix the interest rate on the Term Loan Due 2023 at 1.26% plus a credit spread through November 22, 2018.
GUIDANCEThe Company expects to generate net income attributable to common shareholders of $0.91 to $0.96 per share in 2017. The Company is maintaining its 2017 Operating FFO attributable to common shareholders guidance range of $1.00 to $1.05 per share, based, in part, on the following assumptions, which have not changed since the guidance we provided in our previous earnings release, except for the 2017 same store NOI growth assumption:

Revised 2017 same store NOI growth range of 1.25% to 2.25% from 2.0% to 3.0%; 
2017 acquisitions range of $375 to $475 million; 
2017 dispositions range of $800 to $900 million, including the sale of Schaumburg Towers; and 
2017 general and administrative expenses range of $42 to $44 million.

The Company's revision to its 2017 same store NOI growth assumption is a direct result of recent tenant bankruptcies.
DIVIDENDOn April 25, 2017, the Company declared the second quarter 2017 Series A preferred stock cash dividend of $0.4375 per preferred share, for the period beginning April 1, 2017, which will be paid on June 30, 2017 to preferred shareholders of record on June 19, 2017.
On April 25, 2017, the Company also declared the second quarter 2017 quarterly cash dividend of $0.165625 per share on its outstanding Class A common stock, which will be paid on July 10, 2017 to Class A common shareholders of record on June 26, 2017.

SAFE HARBOR LANGUAGEThe statements and certain other information contained in this press release, which can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as "believes", "expects", "may", "should", "intends", "plans", "estimates", "continue" or "anticipates" and variations of such words or similar expressions or the negative of such words, constitute "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and are subject to the safe harbors created thereby. These forward-looking statements reflect the Company's current views about its plans, intentions, expectations, strategies and prospects, which are based on the information currently available to the Company and on assumptions it has made. Although the Company believes that its plans, intentions, expectations, strategies and prospects as reflected in or suggested by those forward-looking statements are reasonable, the Company can give no assurance that such plans, intentions, expectations or strategies will be attained or achieved. Furthermore, these forward-looking statements should be considered as subject to the many risks and uncertainties that exist in the Company's operations and business environment. Such risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. These uncertainties include, but are not limited to, economic, business and financial conditions, and changes in the Company's industry and changes in the real estate markets in particular, rental rates and/or vacancy rates, frequency and magnitude of defaults on, early terminations of or non-renewal of leases by tenants, bankruptcy or insolvency of a major tenant or a significant number of smaller tenants, interest rates or operating costs, real estate valuations, the availability, terms and deployment of capital, general volatility of the capital and credit markets and the market price of the Company's Class A common stock, risks generally associated with real estate acquisitions and dispositions, including the Company's ability to identify and pursue acquisition and disposition opportunities, risks generally associated with redevelopment, including the impact of construction delays and cost overruns, the Company's ability to lease redeveloped space and the Company's ability to identify and pursue redevelopment opportunities, competitive and cost factors, the Company's ability to enter into new leases or renew leases on favorable terms, the Company's ability to create long-term shareholder value, satisfaction of closing conditions to the pending transactions described herein, the Company's failure to successfully execute its non-target disposition program and capital recycling efforts, regulatory changes and other risk factors, including those detailed in the sections of the Company's most recent Forms 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC titled "Risk Factors". The Company assumes no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURESAs defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT), an industry trade group, Funds From Operations (FFO) means net income (loss) computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of depreciable real estate, plus depreciation and amortization and impairment charges on depreciable real estate. The Company has adopted the NAREIT definition in its computation of FFO attributable to common shareholders. The Company believes that, subject to the following limitations, FFO attributable to common shareholders provides a basis for comparing its performance and operations to those of other real estate investment trusts (REITs). The Company believes that FFO attributable to common shareholders, which is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure, provides an additional and useful means to assess the operating performance of REITs. FFO attributable to common shareholders does not represent an alternative to (i) "Net income" or "Net income attributable to common shareholders" as an indicator of the Company's financial performance, or (ii) "Cash flows from operating activities" in accordance with GAAP as a measure of the Company's capacity to fund cash needs, including the payment of dividends.
The Company also reports Operating FFO attributable to common shareholders, which is defined as FFO attributable to common shareholders excluding the impact of discrete non-operating transactions and other events which the Company does not consider representative of the comparable operating results of its real estate operating portfolio, which is its core business platform. Specific examples of discrete non-operating transactions and other events include, but are not limited to, the financial statement impact of gains or losses associated with the early extinguishment of debt or other liabilities, impairment charges to write down the carrying value of assets other than depreciable real estate, actual or anticipated settlement of litigation involving the Company, including associated legal costs, and executive and realignment separation charges, which are otherwise excluded from the Company's calculation of FFO attributable to common shareholders. The Company believes that Operating FFO attributable to common shareholders, which is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure, provides an additional and useful means to assess the operating performance of REITs. Operating FFO attributable to common shareholders does not represent an alternative to (i) "Net income" or "Net income attributable to common shareholders" as an indicator of the Company's financial performance, or (ii) "Cash flows from operating activities" in accordance with GAAP as a measure of the Company's capacity to fund cash needs, including the payment of dividends. Comparison of the Company's presentation of Operating FFO attributable to common shareholders to similarly titled measures for other REITs may not necessarily be meaningful due to possible differences in definition and application by such REITs.
The Company also reports Net Operating Income (NOI), which it defines as all revenues other than straight-line rental income, amortization of lease inducements, amortization of acquired above and below market lease intangibles and lease termination fee income, less real estate taxes and all operating expenses other than straight-line ground rent expense and amortization of acquired ground lease intangibles, which are non-cash items. NOI consists of Same Store NOI and NOI from Other Investment Properties. Same Store NOI for the three months ended March 31, 2017 represents NOI from the Company's same store portfolio consisting of 140 retail operating properties acquired or placed in service and stabilized prior to January 1, 2016. NOI from Other Investment Properties for the three months ended March 31, 2017 represents NOI primarily from properties acquired during 2016 and 2017, the Company's one remaining office property, three properties where the Company has begun redevelopment and/or activities in anticipation of future redevelopment, the properties that were sold or held for sale in 2016 and 2017, the net income from the Company's wholly-owned captive insurance company and the historical ground rent expense related to an existing same store investment property that was subject to a ground lease with a third party prior to the Company's acquisition of the fee interest on April 29, 2016. The Company believes that NOI, Same Store NOI and NOI from Other Investment Properties, which are supplemental non-GAAP financial measures, provide an additional and useful operating perspective not immediately apparent from "Operating income" or "Net income attributable to common shareholders" in accordance with GAAP. The Company uses these measures to evaluate its performance on a property-by-property basis because they allow management to evaluate the impact that factors such as lease structure, lease rates and tenant base have on the Company's operating results. NOI, Same Store NOI and NOI from Other Investment Properties do not represent alternatives to "Net income" or "Net income attributable to common shareholders" in accordance with GAAP as indicators of the Company's financial performance. Comparison of the Company's presentation of NOI, Same Store NOI and NOI from Other Investment Properties to similarly titled measures for other REITs may not necessarily be meaningful due to possible differences in definition and application by such REITs.
Adjusted EBITDA is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure and represents net income attributable to common shareholders before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, as further adjusted to eliminate the impact of certain items that the Company does not consider indicative of its ongoing performance. The Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA is useful because it allows investors and management to evaluate and compare the Company's performance from period to period in a meaningful and consistent manner in addition to standard financial measurements under GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered an alternative to "Net income attributable to common shareholders" as an indicator of the Company's financial performance. Comparison of the Company's presentation of Adjusted EBITDA to similarly titled measures for other REITs may not necessarily be meaningful due to possible differences in definition and application by such REITs.
Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure and represents (i) the Company's total notional debt, excluding unamortized premium, discount and capitalized loan fees, less cash and cash equivalents and disposition proceeds temporarily restricted related to potential Internal Revenue Code Section 1031 tax-deferred exchanges (1031 Exchanges) divided by (ii) Adjusted EBITDA for the prior three months, annualized. The Company believes that this ratio is useful because it provides investors with information regarding its total notional debt net of cash and cash equivalents and disposition proceeds temporarily restricted related to potential 1031 Exchanges, which could be used to repay debt, compared to its performance as measured using Adjusted EBITDA. Comparison of the Company's presentation of Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA to similarly titled measures for other REITs may not necessarily be meaningful due to possible differences in definition and application by such REITs.
Net Debt and Preferred Stock to Adjusted EBITDA is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure and represents (i) the Company's total notional debt, excluding unamortized premium, discount and capitalized loan fees, plus preferred stock, less cash and cash equivalents and disposition proceeds temporarily restricted related to potential 1031 Exchanges divided by (ii) Adjusted EBITDA for the prior three months, annualized. The Company believes that this ratio is useful because it provides investors with information regarding its total notional debt and preferred stock, net of cash and cash equivalents and disposition proceeds temporarily restricted related to potential 1031 Exchanges, which could be used to repay debt, compared to its performance as measured using Adjusted EBITDA. Comparison of the Company's presentation of Net Debt and Preferred Stock to Adjusted EBITDA to similarly titled measures for other REITs may not necessarily be meaningful due to possible differences in definition and application by such REITs.

Retail Properties of America Inks Lease With Ulta Beauty


May 18, 2017, 09:09:00 AM EDT
By Zacks Equity Research, Zacks.com









































Shutterstock photo


 Oak Brook, IL-based retail real estate investment trust (REIT), Retail Properties of America, Inc. RPAI  , announced that Ulta Beauty, Inc. ULTA  , has inked a new lease at Huebner Oaks. Slated to open in fall 2017, the Bolingbrook, IL-based beauty retailer will occupy 8,000 square feet of retail space in the 287,000 square feet Huebner Oaks.    With the opening of the center, Ulta Beauty, the premier beauty destination for cosmetics, fragrance, skin, hair care products and salon services, will be joining top retailers like Bath & Body Works, Victoria's Secret, Gap Chico's, Old Navy and REI, along with other national retailers.    Huebner Oaks, which is 99% leased, can be easily accessed from I-10 and boasts a strong retail and restaurant lineup. The addition of Ulta Beauty to this center is likely to benefit Retail Properties of America going forward.    Shares of Retail Properties of America underperformed the Zacks categorized REIT and Equity Trust - Retail  industry in the last three months. Shares of the company decreased 16.1%, whereas the industry lost 11%.       Currently, Retail Properties of America carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), whereas Ulta Beauty has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).    Investors interested in the REIT space, may consider stocks like Easterly Government Properties, Inc. DEA  and Gaming and Leisure Properties, Inc. GLPI  , each carrying a Zacks Rank #2. You can see  the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy)   stocks here   .    In the last 30 days, Easterly Government Properties' funds from operations (FFO) per share for second-quarter 2017 remained unchanged at 31 cents.    In the last 30 days, Gaming and Leisure Properties' FFO per share for second-quarter 2017 moved up 1.3% to 77 cents.    Note: FFO, a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs, is obtained after adding depreciation and amortization and other non-cash expenses to net income. All EPS numbers presented in this write up represent FFO per share  .   Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?    Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.    With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.    It's not the one you think.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score
A


Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.
Zacks Style Scores Education - Learn more about the Zacks Style Scores


The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The three scores are based on the trading styles of Growth, Value, and Momentum.


Growth Score
A


Value Score
A


Momentum Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B.

Inland American – SEC Probe – Salas Wang Investigation
May 11, 2012


The Wall Street is reporting that the SEC is investigating Inland American Non-Traded REIT.  Our firm has been investigating shareholder claims against brokers who sold shares to investors for sometime.  This recent SEC action, we believe, is the culmination of years of abuse.  According to the WSJ:
The SEC is looking at activity of Inland American Real Estate Trust to determine if the REIT committed violations related to management fees, the timing and amount of distributions paid to investors, and transactions with affiliates, according to a company filing with the SEC on Monday.
If you own shares of Inland American, please call Jeffrey Salas at 312.803.4963 or fill out the contact form below.
