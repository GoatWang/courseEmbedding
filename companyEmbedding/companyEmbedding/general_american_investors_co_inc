Long-term capital growth focused on equity securities.
The primary investment objective of the Company is long-term capital appreciation with lesser emphasis on current income. We focus on equity securities with growth potential at reasonable valuations.


More specifically, we seek investments worldwide in leading public and private companies with significant long-term opportunities, defensible competitive advantages, prudent and profitable business models, and committed first-class management teams with the vision and energy to succeed.
Our research effort is grounded in a rigorous due diligence process, which has been in place since the inception of the Company. 


Fundamental security analysis is conducted by five members of the research staff who review their findings with the portfolio manager, Jeffrey Priest, our President and CEO. The entire process is carried out under the oversight of the Board of Directors whose members provide the staff with the benefit of their wisdom and guidance gained from many years of experience in business, finance, the sciences and public policy. A listing of our directors and their principal affiliations can be found under Board of Directors.

90 years of fundamental security analysis.
General American Investors Company, Inc. is one of the nation’s oldest closed-end funds. For 90 years, we have internally managed a global portfolio of investments, consisting principally of common stocks of U. S. companies but also including international and private securities.


As a closed-end fund, shares of our Common Stock are listed and traded on the New York Stock Exchange. Thus, our asset base is not as subject to wide fluctuations due to shifts in investor sentiment as is the asset base of an open-end (mutual) fund. This stability has enabled us to diligently pursue our long-term analytical approach and, we believe, has contributed to our superior long-term investment results.
Over the 50 years ended December 31, 2016, the return to our common stockholders (assuming reinvestment of all dividends and distributions) was 11.8% per year and the net asset value return (assuming reinvestment of all dividends and distributions) was 12.0% while the return on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Stock Index (including income) was 10.1% per year. See Annualized Results for further information concerning return data for varying time periods over the last 50 years. These data reflect past performance and may not be indicative of future results.


At the time the Company was established in 1927, Frank Altschul became President and portfolio manager. When the title of Chairman was created in 1948, he served as Chairman followed by his son, Arthur G. Altschul (1961-1995), then Lawrence B. Buttenwieser (1995-2007) and our current Chairman, Spencer Davidson.
During this period, only six  individuals have served as President and/or portfolio manager: Harold F. Linder (1948-1955), Harry G. Friedman (1955-1961), Malcolm B. Smith (1961-1989), William J. Gedale (1989-1995),  Spencer Davidson (1995-January 31, 2012), and Jeffrey Priest (effective February 1, 2012).

Closed-EndFunds






A closed-end fund is a form of investment company that is registered with the SEC under the Investment Company Act of 1940. The assets in closed-end funds are professionally managed pursuant to stated investment objectives. In turn, shares of closed-end funds are traded on securities exchanges and are available to investors through their brokers.


General American Investors Company is an independent organization. We are one of a limited number of closed-end funds in operation today, formed prior to 1940, which is characterized as “internally managed.” This means that we incur directly all costs and expenses associated with the management of our portfolio and the operation of our Company. There is no outside investment advisory company which typically provides these services under a fee-based advisory agreement or management contract.
Some of the advantages attributable to the closed-end structure include:

The opportunity for an investor to purchase shares at a discount (below the underlying net asset value).
The stability of the asset base that permits the portfolio manager to focus on investment decisions without having to be concerned with cash flow factors based on investor sentiment.
The ability of an investor to trade shares of the fund throughout the business day.
The opportunity to use leverage in the form of senior securities (preferred stock or debentures) as a means to improve the return to investors.



The Closed-End Fund Association has published a brochure titled “Understanding the Advantages of Closed-End Funds” that describes in greater detail the nature of CEFs and some of the reasons investors should consider including shares of CEFs in their personal portfolios. The brochure is available at the Association’s website: www.closed-endfunds.com. (Look for the heading on the home page marked Free Booklets, then click on Understanding the Advantages of Closed-End Funds.)

90 years of fundamental security analysis.
General American Investors Company, Inc. is one of the nation’s oldest closed-end funds. For 90 years, we have internally managed a global portfolio of investments, consisting principally of common stocks of U. S. companies but also including international and private securities.


As a closed-end fund, shares of our Common Stock are listed and traded on the New York Stock Exchange. Thus, our asset base is not as subject to wide fluctuations due to shifts in investor sentiment as is the asset base of an open-end (mutual) fund. This stability has enabled us to diligently pursue our long-term analytical approach and, we believe, has contributed to our superior long-term investment results.
Over the 50 years ended December 31, 2016, the return to our common stockholders (assuming reinvestment of all dividends and distributions) was 11.8% per year and the net asset value return (assuming reinvestment of all dividends and distributions) was 12.0% while the return on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Stock Index (including income) was 10.1% per year. See Annualized Results for further information concerning return data for varying time periods over the last 50 years. These data reflect past performance and may not be indicative of future results.


At the time the Company was established in 1927, Frank Altschul became President and portfolio manager. When the title of Chairman was created in 1948, he served as Chairman followed by his son, Arthur G. Altschul (1961-1995), then Lawrence B. Buttenwieser (1995-2007) and our current Chairman, Spencer Davidson.
During this period, only six  individuals have served as President and/or portfolio manager: Harold F. Linder (1948-1955), Harry G. Friedman (1955-1961), Malcolm B. Smith (1961-1989), William J. Gedale (1989-1995),  Spencer Davidson (1995-January 31, 2012), and Jeffrey Priest (effective February 1, 2012).
