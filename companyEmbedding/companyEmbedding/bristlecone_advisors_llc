The Bristlecone Name
The Bristlecone Pine (Pinus Aristata) is the oldest known tree species in the world. Found only in scattered, arid, mountainous regions of six western states of America, the Bristlecone thrives in harsh environments where little else can survive. While the average age of the Bristlecone is about 1,000 years, several specimens are more than 4,000 years old.

Bristlecone Advisors' namesake stands as a clear metaphor for our mission: to provide exceptional, personal solutions that withstand the test of time. With our roots firmly planted in client service, we bring a high level of independent thinking to bear in each facet of our client offerings. This combination of institutional-quality work in a boutique setting differentiates Bristlecone Advisors and allows us to serve our clients as a trusted partner with uncommon longevity.

Overview
Bristlecone Advisors provides clients with thorough and objective investment advice and creates a disciplined framework for making investment decisions.
We recognize that no single solution will adequately address each client's investment needs. As a result, we employ an approach that merges client-specific preferences with core tenets of modern financial theory, such as diversification and adherence to a long-term perspective. In building an investment plan, our analysis is thorough, and we incorporate all aspects of our clients' financial situation including cash flow, taxes, estate planning, and charitable giving. The end result is a personalized wealth strategy built on sound investment discipline.
Bristlecone Advisors' open architecture platform allows us to recommend the most compelling investment strategies, from our equity and fixed income investment portfolios, developed in-house, to our extensive offerings of top-performing fund managers. Our clients are assured of complete objectivity in our approach, as we do not accept any type of fee sharing, soft dollars, commissions, or other incentives from third parties.
The experience of our investment specialists is extensive at all stages of the investment process – from strategy development to evaluation and implementation. In addition to bringing strong expertise in traditional asset classes, we have significant experience evaluating and investing in nontraditional investments such as hedge funds, private equity, and mission-aligned ("impact") investments.
Simply put, we have the freedom to offer our very best independent thinking along with the skills to provide the best execution on our recommendations.

Investment Process


Financial Planning –  Our services involve merging financial planning concepts with an investment strategy that is personalized to your lifestyle, aspirations, and capacity to endure market changes. Our goal is to strike the right balance for you between risk and return on an after-tax and after-fee basis.
Portfolio Design –  As a result of listening intently to your goals and objectives, we prepare a personalized investment policy statement which serves as a guide to your investment portfolio. In the design process, we discuss and agree on appropriate long-term risk tolerance, and optimize for asset location to aid in reducing the tax impacts to your portfolio.
Individually Managed Securities –  We build diversified portfolios based on each client’s objectives, utilizing the optimum blend of individual equities and bonds with top mutual funds and exchange-traded funds.  Our proprietary strategy blends a top-down, macroeconomic review with a bottom-up, fundamental research.  The customized efficiency of individual securities can provide superior after-tax returns with proactive management.
Manager Search and Selection –  Our internal research team conducts unbiased manager due diligence to identify managers for our client portfolios. When possible, we negotiate preferential terms including fees, account sizes, and custom mandates.
Portfolio Implementation –  We manage a thoughtful, logical transition from your current portfolio to your recommended strategic target portfolio. The transition process is particularly sensitive to tax implications in terms of evaluating the impact and timing of incurring taxes related to recommended changes.
Consolidated Reporting –  In addition to regular statements provided by your custodian, we prepare a set of clear, concise, and comprehensive reports designed to illustrate your holistic financial picture in a single view.
Custom Analysis –  We provide ongoing, tailored evaluation of performance, risk metrics, and portfolio characteristics. This information is key in our advice regarding cash flow, sustainable spending rates, and long-term planning.

Why Bristlecone?
Community
Our Name


Overview
Founded in 1999 as an independent investment advisory firm and multi-family office, Bristlecone Advisors is united by our unwavering commitment to exceptional client service. The advice and solutions you receive are completely objective and personalized to meet your specific goals and lifestyle. Our approach is proactive and forward-looking on your behalf, with the ultimate goals of giving you both economic and personal value, simplifying the complexities that may accompany wealth, and returning time and peace of mind to you.
We work hard to consistently earn your trust. In your client-advisor relationship with Bristlecone Advisors, you can expect a strong personal investment from us. This deeper connection allows us to accomplish the extraordinary for our clients. Focused attention and comprehensive communication combine to build a solid foundation for creating highly customized financial solutions and finely tailored life solutions.
We are true caretakers. We create partnerships that engage your entire family's health, happiness, and well-being. This uniquely personal approach is designed to give you greater confidence and security that we are doing the right thing for you.
Here are some concrete ways Bristlecone Advisors invests in you:

Transitioning the responsibilities of wealth to the next generation – A client recently asked us to help his son invest his savings and teach him how investments work, what risk means, and what he could expect given his investment guidelines. We can help prepare your family's next generation for success, offering everything they need to foster a productive lifelong client/advisor relationship – helpful tools, experienced insights, and personal introductions to other professional advisors.
Managing caregivers for aging family members – As generations age, their needs evolve. We help you shepherd that transition by providing access to experienced, high-quality caregivers to ensure your peace of mind, or even giving seniors a continued sense of independence by arranging driving service to and from regular health-care appointments.
Complex planning and coordination – Many of our clients have multiple properties, often in different states. Others require coordination of estate plans, or caretaking of their billing cycle. As part of our family office offering, we take care of coordinating your entire platform of financial, personal, and professional needs, alleviating your burden so you have more free time for family, career, and other priorities.
Family succession – Clients sometimes need guidance and reassurance regarding who should step in to guide the family through times of crisis or when family leadership is challenged. Because we have intimate knowledge of your goals and objectives, we can be your advocate to ensure your wishes are carried out.

Capital One® Secured Mastercard®


                                            I never had played in credit before, and someone suggested this card to me to build credit for the first time. I've been really satisfied for the most part. They report quickly and accurately, remind me when my bill is due, and the customer service has been kind and thorough....show more

North Carolina Farm Bureau Insurance Group


                                            I highly recommend Farm Bureau Insurance. Nathan Ray cares about his clients. As my agent, Nathan meets me with intelligence, patience, humor, warmth, knowledge and empathy.

                                            Been with for 3 years, had a homeowners claim, hail damage to my roof.  They resolved the claim super fast, would recommend to anyone. Big shout out to the claims agent, he was very polite, professional.

Electro Savings Credit Union


                                            Electro Savings approve loans under a different set of rules to African Americans than Caucasian customers!  I was 7% above their threshold and when I asked to add a cosigner the answer was still NO!   DO NOT PATRONIZE!

                                            After getting fed-up with SEFCU’s “nickel-and-dime” fee structure and lack of branches/ATMs in my area, I decided to close my account in April 2017. Fast forward to July 25, 2017 when I receive a collection notice for fees due ($175). Access to my online...show more

                                            The online banking portal provides inaccurate information and the customer service people really don't care.

                                            Applied for a credit card and was denied based on what they said was a loss from a personal loan in 1978. I have never had an account with PenFed, so I questioned the accuracy of this denial. Considering, as a business owner, my scores are well north of 700, I thought this...show more
