CUSIP NO. 245496 10 4



 

The following constitutes Amendment No. 3 to the Schedule 13D filed by the undersigned (“Amendment No. 3”).  This Amendment No. 3 amends the Schedule 13D as specifically set forth herein.
 




Item 5.


Interest in Securities of the Issuer.



 
Item 5 is hereby amended and restated to read as follows:
 
(a)           The aggregate percentage of Shares reported owned by each person named herein is based upon 39,153,003 Shares outstanding as of October 17, 2016, which is the total number of Shares outstanding as reported in the Issuer’s Prospectus Supplement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on October 28, 2016.
 
As of the close of business on the date hereof, PW Acquisitions beneficially owned directly 1,352,406 Shares, including 436,000 Shares issuable upon the exercise of warrants owned by PW Acquisitions, constituting approximately 3.4% of the Shares outstanding.
 
PW Acquisitions owns warrants exercisable for 436,000 Shares.  Such warrants are subject to a blocker provision that precludes PW Acquisitions from exercising the warrants to the extent that it and its affiliates would beneficially own (as determined in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) in excess of 9.8% of the Shares outstanding (the “Maximum Percentage”) immediately after giving effect to such exercise.  Upon written notice to the Issuer, PW Acquisitions may increase or decrease the Maximum Percentage to any other percentage specified in such notice; provided, however, that any such increase shall not be effective until the sixty-first day after such notice is delivered to the Issuer.
 
Acquisitions GP, as the general partner of PW Acquisitions, may be deemed to beneficially own the 1,352,406 Shares directly beneficially owned by PW Acquisitions, constituting approximately 3.4% of the Shares outstanding.
 
PW Capital Management, as the investment manager with respect to PW Acquisitions, may be deemed to beneficially own the 1,352,406 Shares directly beneficially owned in the aggregate by PW Acquisitions, constituting approximately 3.4% of the Shares outstanding.
 
Mr. Walsh, as the Managing Member and Chief Executive Officer of Acquisitions GP and the Managing Member of PW Capital Management, may be deemed to beneficially own the 1,352,406 Shares directly beneficially owned in the aggregate by PW Acquisitions, constituting approximately 3.4% of the Shares outstanding.
 
Each of the Reporting Persons, as a member of a “group” with the other Reporting Persons for purposes of the Exchange Act, may be deemed to beneficially own the securities of the Issuer beneficially owned by the other Reporting Persons.  The filing of this Schedule 13D shall not be deemed an admission that the Reporting Persons are, for purposes of Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act, the beneficial owners of any securities of the Issuer he or it does not directly own.  Each of the Reporting Persons specifically disclaims beneficial ownership of the securities reported herein that he or it does not directly own.
 


  


6





  
CUSIP NO. 245496 10 4


 
(b)           Each of PW Acquisitions, Acquisitions GP, PW Capital Management and Mr. Walsh may be deemed to have shared power to vote or direct the vote of, and to dispose or direct the disposition of, the Shares beneficially owned directly by PW Acquisitions.
 
(c)           Except as otherwise set forth in this paragraph, there were no transactions in the securities of the Issuer by the Reporting Persons since Amendment No. 2 to the Schedule 13D.  On December 8, 2016, PW Acquisitions sold 1,665,482 Shares at a price per Share of $14.50 in a riskless principal transaction.
 
(d)           No person other than the Reporting Persons is known to have the right to receive, or the power to direct the receipt of dividends from, or proceeds from the sale of, the Shares.
 
(e)           As of December 8, 2016, the Reporting Persons ceased to be the beneficial owners of more than 5% of the outstanding Shares of the Issuer.

CUSIP NO. 245496 10 4

After reasonable inquiry and to the best of its knowledge and belief, each of the undersigned certifies that the information with respect to it set forth in this statement is true, complete, and correct.

BBB Accreditation





                BBB Accredited Since 03/14/2017
            

                BBB has determined that C&W Acquisitions LP meets Standards of BBB Accreditation, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            

                BBB accreditation does not mean that the business's products or services have been evaluated or endorsed by BBB, or that BBB has made a determination as to the business's product quality or competency in performing services.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

                            2. cooperate with BBB's activities and efforts to promote voluntary self- regulation within the business' industry
                        
3. honor any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process

                            4. complete the required application and pay all monetary obligations to BBB in a timely manner
                        









Advertise Honestly









            Adhere to established standards of advertising and selling.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Follow federal, state/provincial and local advertising laws.
                

                    2. Abide by the BBB Code of Advertising. Supply, upon request, substantiation for advertising and selling claims. Correct advertising and selling practices, when recommended by BBB.
                
3. Adhere to applicable BBB industry codes of advertising.
4. Cooperate with BBB self-regulatory programs for the resolution of advertising disputes.
5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

                    6. Avoid misleading customers by creating the false impression of sponsorship, endorsement, popularity, trustworthiness, product quality or business size through the misuse of logos, trustmarks, pictures, testimonials, or other means
                







Tell the Truth









            Honestly represent products and services, including clear and adequate disclosures of all material terms.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Make known all material facts in both written and verbal representations, remembering that misrepresentation may result not only from direct statements but by omitting or obscuring relevant facts.
                

                    2. Ensure that any written materials are readily available, clear, accurate and complete.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.
