	Additional terms specific to the notes



	     You
	should read this terms supplement together with the prospectus dated July 1, 2005, as
	supplemented by the prospectus supplement dated July 1, 2005 relating to our medium-term
	notes of which these notes are a part, and the more detailed information contained in
	product supplement no. 1 dated December 29, 2006. This terms supplement, together with the
	documents listed below, contains the terms of the notes and supersedes all other prior or
	contemporaneous oral statements as well as any other written materials including preliminary
	or indicative pricing terms, correspondence, trade ideas, structures for implementation,
	sample structures, brochures or other educational materials of ours. You should carefully
	consider, among other things, the matters set forth in Risk factors in the accompanying
	product supplement no. 1, as the notes involve risks not associated with conventional debt
	securities. We urge you to consult your investment, legal, tax, accounting and other
	advisers before you invest in the notes.


	     You may access these documents on the SEC Web site at

	www.sec.gov

	as follows
	(or if such address has changed, by reviewing our filings for the relevant date on the SEC
	Web site):


	http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/700978/000115697306001446/u51278e424b2.htm


	     Our Central Index Key, or CIK, on the SEC Web site is 700978. As used in this terms supplement, the Company, we, us, or our refers to Eksportfinans ASA.



	Selected risk considerations



	     An investment in the notes involves significant risks. Investing in the notes is not
	equivalent to investing directly in the Reference Shares. These risks are explained in more detail in the Risk factors section of the accompanying
	product supplement no. 1 dated December 29, 2006.


	TS-3







	 






	Hypothetical examples of amounts payable at maturity



	     The following tables set out the total return to the Maturity Date of a note, based on the
	assumptions outlined below and several variables, which include (a) whether the Knock-In Level
	Trigger has occurred and (b) several hypothetical closing prices for the Reference Shares on
	the Determination Date or at any time during the life of the notes. These figures are provided
	for purposes of illustration only. They should not be taken as an indication or prediction of
	future investment results and are intended merely to illustrate the effect that various
	hypothetical Reference Share values could have on the Redemption Amount, assuming all other
	variables remain constant.


	     The information in the tables reflects hypothetical rates of return on the notes assuming
	they are purchased on the Original Issue Date and held to the Maturity Date. If you sell your
	notes prior to the Maturity Date, your return will depend upon the market value of your notes
	at the time of sale, which may be affected by a number of factors that are not reflected in the
	table below. For a discussion of some of these factors, see Risk factors beginning on page
	PS-9 of the accompanying product supplement no. 1.


	     The tables below assume no Market Disruption Event, Adjustment Event or Settlement
	Disruption Event occurs. Also, the hypothetical rates of return shown below do not take into
	account the effects of applicable taxes. Because of the U.S. tax treatment applicable to the
	notes, tax liabilities could affect the after-tax rate of return on your notes to a
	comparatively greater extent than the after-tax return on the Reference Shares.


	     The market price of each of the Reference Shares has been volatile in the past, and their
	performance cannot be predicted for any future period. The actual performance of the Reference
	Shares over the life of the notes, as well as the Redemption Amount payable, may bear little
	relation to the hypothetical return examples set forth below or to the historical price of the
	Reference Shares set forth elsewhere in this terms supplement. For information about the
	price of the Reference Shares during recent periods, see The Reference Shares below.


	     If the official closing price quoted by the Relevant Exchange never falls below the Knock-In Level on any
	Trading Day during the period from the Trade Date up to and including the Determination Date,
	or if the Final Reference Level on the Determination Date is equal to or greater than the
	Initial Reference Level, the Redemption Amount will be paid in cash.


	     By contrast, if the official closing price of the
	Reference Shares quoted by the Relevant Exchange is less than the corresponding Knock-In Level on
	any Trading Day during the period from the Trade Date up to and including the Determination
	Date, and the Final Reference Level is less than the Initial
	Reference Level on the Determination Date, the Redemption Amount payment on the Maturity Date will be made in the Reference Shares
	(with fractional shares paid in cash).

	Truck Corporation



	     

	The following examples illustrate the rate of return on the notes for a range of
	hypothetical Final Reference Levels on the Determination Date, on the
	basis of an Initial
	Reference Level of $52.14 and a Knock-In Level of $41.712. In these examples, the
	Knock-In Level Trigger never occurs during the life of the notes. In each example, the
	Redemption Amount is paid in cash.

	The Reference Shares




	General



	     Unless otherwise stated, all information contained herein on the Reference Shares and on
	the issuer of the Reference Shares is derived from publicly available sources and is provided for
	informational purposes only.


	     The Reference Shares are registered under the Exchange Act. Companies with
	securities registered under the Exchange Act are required periodically to file certain
	financial and other information specified by the SEC. Information provided to or filed with the
	SEC can be inspected and copied at the public reference facilities maintained by the SEC at
	Room 1580, 100 F Street, NE, Washington, DC 20549 and copies of such material can be obtained
	from the Public Reference Section of the SEC, 100 F Street, NE, Washington, DC 20549, at
	prescribed rates. You may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by
	calling 1-800-SEC-0330. In addition, information provided to or filed with the SEC
	electronically can be accessed through a website maintained by the SEC. The address of the
	SECs website is http://www.sec.gov.


	     According
	to its publicly available documents, Oshkosh Truck Corporation designs, manufactures and markets a range of commercial, fire and
	emergency, and military trucks under the Oshkosh and Pierce trademarks; truck bodies under the
	McNeilus, Medtec, Jerr-Dan, BAI, London, Geesink and Norba trademarks; mobile and stationary
	compactors and transfer stations under the Kiggen trademark; portable and stationary concrete batch
	plants under the CON-E-CO and McNeilus trademarks, and mobile medical trailers under the AK
	trademark. Oshkosh Truck Corporation operates in three segments: fire and emergency segment,
	defense segment and commercial segment. In December 2006, it completed the acquisition of JLG
	Industries, Inc. Information provided to or filed with the SEC
	by Oshkosh Truck Corporation pursuant to the
	Exchange Act can be located on the SECs website by reference to
	SEC file number 001-31371.




	     In addition, information regarding the issuer of the Reference Shares may be obtained from other
	sources including, but not limited to, press releases, newspaper articles and other publicly
	disseminated documents. We make no representation or warranty as to the accuracy or
	completeness of these reports.


	     

	This
	terms supplement relates only to the notes offered hereby and does not relate to
	the Reference Shares. We have derived all disclosures contained in
	this terms supplement
	regarding the issuer of the Reference Shares from the publicly available documents described in the
	preceding paragraphs. Neither we nor the agent nor its affiliates have participated in the
	preparation of such documents or made any due diligence inquiry with respect to any of the
	issuer of the Reference Shares in connection with the offering of the notes. Neither we nor the agent nor
	its affiliates make any representation that such publicly available documents or any other
	publicly available information regarding any of the issuer of the Reference Shares are accurate or complete.
	Furthermore, we cannot give any assurance that all the events occurring prior to the date of
	this terms supplement (including events that would affect the accuracy or completeness of the
	publicly available documents described in the preceding paragraph) that would affect the
	trading price of any of the Reference Shares (and therefore the Initial Reference Level and the
	Knock-In Level and Redemption Amount) have been publicly disclosed. Subsequent disclosure of
	any such events or the disclosure of or failure to disclose material future events concerning
	any of the issuer of the Reference Shares could affect the value you will receive on the Maturity Date with
	respect to the notes and therefore the market value of the notes. Neither we nor any of our
	affiliates have any obligation to disclose any information about any of the issuer of the Reference Shares
	after the date of this terms supplement.



	     Neither we nor any of our affiliates makes any representation to you as to the performance
	of the Reference Shares. As a prospective purchaser of notes, you should undertake such
	independent investigation of the issuer of the Reference Shares as in your judgment is appropriate to make
	an informed decision with respect to an investment in the Reference Shares.


	     

	Historical Performance



	     The Reference Shares are traded on
	NYSE under the symbol OSK. The
	following table sets forth the published intra-day high, low and closing prices of each of the
	Reference Shares since December 31, 2003. We obtained the information in the tables below from
	Bloomberg without independent verification.


	TS-5







	 





	     

	Any historical upward or downward trend in the price of any of the Reference Shares during
	any period shown below is not an indication that the price of those Reference Shares is more or
	less likely to increase or decrease at any time during the term of the notes. You should not
	take the historical performance levels as an indication of future performance of any of the
	Reference Shares. We cannot assure you that the future performance of any of the Reference
	Shares will result in your receiving the face amount notes or more on the Maturity Date. The
	actual performance of any of the Reference Shares over the life of the notes may bear little
	relation to the historical levels shown below.

	Additional terms specific to the securities



	     

	Eksportfinans ASA has filed a registration statement (including a prospectus) with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, for the offerings to which this terms supplement relates. Before you invest, you should read the prospectus in that registration statement and the other documents relating to these offerings that Eksportfinans ASA has filed with the SEC for more complete information about Eksportfinans ASA and these offerings. You may get these documents without cost by visiting EDGAR on the SEC Web site at www.sec.gov. Alternatively, Eksportfinans ASA, any agent or any dealer participating in these offerings will arrange to send you the prospectus, each prospectus supplement, product supplement no. 2 and this terms supplement if you so request by calling toll-free 1-888-215-4145 or 1-212-214-6282.



	     You should read this terms supplement together with the prospectus dated February 5, 2007, as supplemented by the prospectus supplement dated February 5, 2007 relating to our medium-term notes of which these securities are a part, and the more detailed information contained in product supplement no. 2 dated September 7, 2007. This terms supplement, together with these documents, contains the terms of the securities and supersedes all other prior or contemporaneous oral statements as well as any other written materials including preliminary or indicative pricing terms, correspondence, trade ideas, structures for implementation, sample structures, brochures or other educational materials of ours. You should carefully consider, among other things, the matters set forth in Risk factors in the accompanying product supplement no. 2
	and the accompanying prospectus supplement, as the securities involve risks not associated with
	conventional debt securities. We urge you to consult your investment, legal, tax, accounting and other advisers before you invest in the securities.


	     You may access these documents on the SEC Web site at www.sec.gov as follows (or if such address has changed, by reviewing our filings for the relevant date on the SEC Web site):




	http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/700978/000095012307012382/u53557e424b2.htm




	     Our Central Index Key, or CIK, on the SEC Web site is 700978. As used in this terms supplement, the Company, we, us, or our refers to Eksportfinans ASA.



	Selected risk considerations



	     An investment in the securities involves significant risks. Investing in the securities is not equivalent to investing directly in the Underlying Stocks. These risks are explained in more detail in the Risk factors sections of the accompanying product supplement no. 2 dated September 7, 2007 and the accompanying prospectus supplement.


	     

	No guaranteed return of principal.

	With an investment in the securities, you bear the risk of losing some or all of the value of your principal if a knock-in event occurs during the term of the securities and the final stock price is less than the initial stock price. Under these circumstances, at maturity, for each security you hold, the maturity payment amount that you will receive will be shares of the applicable Underlying Stock, which represents the number of shares of the applicable Underlying Stock equal to the share amount multiplied by the share multiplier. In these circumstances, you will lose some or all of the value of the principal amount of your securities and receive shares of the applicable Underlying Stock instead of a cash payment.


	     

	Yield may be lower.

	The yield that you will receive on your securities, which could be negative, may be less than the return you could earn on other investments. Even if your yield is positive, your yield may be less than the yield you would earn if you bought a standard senior non-callable debt security with the same maturity date.


	     

	Relationship to the Underlying Stocks.

	You will have no rights against any of the Underlying Stock Issuers even though the market value of the securities and the amount you will receive at maturity depend on the performance of the applicable Underlying Stock. The Underlying Stock Issuers are not involved in the offering of the securities and have no obligations relating to the securities. In addition, you will not receive any dividend payments or other distributions on any of the Underlying Stocks, and as a holder of the securities, you will not have voting rights or any other rights that holders of the Underlying Stocks may have.


	     

	No active trading market.

	The securities will not be listed or displayed on any securities exchange, the Nasdaq National Market or any electronic communications network. There can be no assurance that a liquid trading market will develop for the securities. The development of a trading market for the securities will depend on our financial performance and other factors such as the market price of any of the Underlying Stocks. Even if a secondary market for the securities develops, it may not provide significant liquidity and transaction costs in any secondary market could be high.

	Potential conflicts of interest.

	Wells Fargo Securities, LLC or its affiliates may presently or from time to time engage in business that may adversely affect the price of the securities, including hedging activities. In addition, the inclusion of commissions and projected profits from hedging in the original issue price is likely to adversely affect secondary market prices. In the course of business, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC or its affiliates may acquire non-public information relating to any of the Underlying Stock Issuers and, in addition, one or more affiliates of Wells Fargo Securities, LLC may publish research reports about any of the Underlying Stock Issuers. Neither we nor Wells Fargo Securities, LLC make any representation to any purchasers of the securities regarding any matters whatsoever relating to any of the Underlying Stock Issuers.



	Hypothetical returns



	     The following table illustrates the hypothetical maturity payment amount and corresponding hypothetical return at maturity per security (in each case, including interest payments), for a range of hypothetical final stock prices and the corresponding hypothetical price return of each of the Underlying Stocks and whether or not a knock-in event has occurred.


	     The tables below assume no market disruption event, antidilution adjustments or settlement disruption event occurs. Also, the hypothetical rates of return shown below do not take into account the effects of applicable taxes. Because of the U.S. tax treatment applicable to the securities, tax liabilities could affect the after-tax rate of return on the securities to a comparatively greater extent than the after-tax return on each of the Underlying Stocks.

	Securities linked to Chesapeake Energy Corporation



	     The examples are based on the following hypothetical terms:




	a hypothetical initial stock price of $28.69;



	a hypothetical knock-in price of $21.518;



	an interest rate of 14.50%; and


	an investment term of 183 days.



	     The figures below are for purposes of illustration only. The actual maturity payment amount and the resulting return (inclusive of coupons) will depend on the actual final stock price and whether or not a knock-in event occurs, each determined by the calculation agent as described in this terms supplement.

Additional Terms Specific to the Notes
     You should read this pricing
supplement together with the prospectus dated February 5, 2007, as supplemented by the prospectus supplement dated February 5, 2007 relating to our medium-term notes of which these
notes are a part, and the more detailed information contained in product
supplement no. 1 dated April
12, 2007. This pricing
supplement, together with the documents listed below, contains the terms of the
notes and supersedes all other prior or contemporaneous oral statements as well
as any other written materials including preliminary or indicative pricing
terms, correspondence, trade ideas, structures for implementation, sample
structures, brochures or other educational materials of ours. You should carefully
consider, among other things, the matters set forth in “Risk factors”
in the accompanying product supplement no. 1 and the accompanying prospectus
supplement, as the notes involve risks not associated with conventional debt
securities. We urge you to consult your investment, legal, tax, accounting and
other advisers before you invest in the notes.
     You may access these documents on the SEC Web site at
www.sec.gov as follows (or if such address has changed, by reviewing our
filings for the relevant date on the SEC Web site): 
http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/700978/000115697307000604/u52418e424b2.htm

     Our Central Index Key, or CIK, on the SEC Web site is
700978. As used in this pricing supplement, the “Company,”
“we,” “us,” or “our” refers to Eksportfinans ASA.
Selected Risk Considerations
     An investment in the notes
involves significant risks. Investing in the notes is not equivalent to
investing directly in the Reference Shares. These risks are explained in more
detail in the “Risk factors” section, beginning on page PS-9 of the
accompanying product supplement no. 1 and beginning on page S-4 of the
accompanying prospectus supplement.
Additional Information
     Unless otherwise stated, all
information contained herein on the Reference Shares and on the issuers of the
Reference Shares (each a Reference Issuer) is derived from publicly
available sources and is provided for informational purposes only.
     Each of the Reference Shares is
registered under the Exchange Act. Companies with securities registered under
the Exchange Act are required periodically to file certain financial and other
information specified by the SEC. Information provided to or filed with the SEC
can be inspected and copied at the public reference facilities maintained by
the SEC at Room 1580, 100 F Street, NE, Washington, DC 20549 and copies of such
material can be obtained from the Public Reference Section of the SEC, 100 F
Street, NE, Washington, DC 20549, at prescribed rates. You may obtain
information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling
1-800-SEC-0330. In addition, information provided to or filed with the SEC
electronically can be accessed through a website maintained by the SEC. The
address of the SEC’s website is www.sec.gov.
     In addition, information regarding
the Reference Issuers may be obtained from other sources including, but not
limited to, press releases, newspaper articles and other publicly disseminated
documents. We make no representation or warranty as to the accuracy or
completeness of these reports.
     This pricing supplement
relates only to the notes offered hereby and does not relate to the Reference
Shares. We have derived all disclosures contained in this pricing supplement
regarding the Reference Issuers from the publicly available documents described
in the preceding paragraphs. Neither we nor the agent nor its affiliates have
participated in the preparation of such documents or made any due diligence
inquiry with respect to any of the Reference Issuers in connection with the
offering of the notes. Neither we nor the agent nor its affiliates make any
representation that such publicly available documents or any other publicly
available information regarding any of the Reference Issuers are accurate or
complete. Furthermore, we cannot give any assurance that all the events
occurring prior to the date of this pricing supplement (including events that
would affect the accuracy or completeness of the publicly available documents
described in the preceding paragraph) that would affect the trading price of
any of the Reference Shares (and therefore the Initial Reference Level and the
Knock-In Level and Redemption Amount) have been publicly disclosed. Subsequent
disclosure of any such events or the disclosure of or failure to disclose
material future events concerning any of the Reference Issuers could affect the
value you will receive on the Maturity Date with respect to the notes and
therefore the market value of the notes. Neither we nor any of our affiliates
have any obligation to disclose any information about the Reference Issuers
after the date of this pricing supplement. 





 

P-3
 




     Neither we nor any of our
affiliates makes any representation to you as to the performance of the
Reference Shares. As a prospective purchaser of notes, you should undertake such
independent investigation of the Reference Issuers as in your judgment is
appropriate to make an informed decision with respect to an investment in the
Reference Shares.
     Any historical upward or
downward trend in the price of any of the Reference Shares during any period
shown in this pricing supplement is not an indication that the price of those
Reference Shares is more or less likely to increase or decrease at any time
during the term of the notes. You should not take the historical performance levels
as an indication of future performance of any of the Reference Shares. We
cannot assure you that the future performance of any of the Reference Shares
will result in your receiving the face amount of your notes on the Maturity
Date. The actual performance of any of the Reference Shares over the life of
the notes may bear little relation to the historical levels shown in this
pricing supplement.
Hypothetical Returns on the Notes
     The tables of hypothetical
returns contained in this pricing supplement set out the total return to the
Maturity Date of a note, based on the assumptions outlined in the introduction
to each respective table of hypothetical returns and several variables, which
include (a) whether the Knock-In Level Trigger has occurred and (b) several
hypothetical closing prices for the Reference Shares on the Determination Date
or at any time during the life of the notes. These figures are provided for
purposes of illustration only. They should not be taken as an indication or
prediction of future investment results and are intended merely to illustrate
the effect that various hypothetical Reference Share values could have on the
Redemption Amount, assuming all other variables remain constant.
     The information in the tables
of hypothetical returns reflects hypothetical rates of return on the notes
assuming they are purchased on the Original Issue Date and held to the Maturity
Date. If you sell your notes prior to the Maturity Date, your return will
depend upon the market value of your notes at the time of sale, which may be
affected by a number of factors that are not reflected in the table below. For
a discussion of some of these factors, see “Risk factors” beginning
on page PS-9 of the accompanying product supplement no. 1 and beginning on page
S-4 of the accompanying prospectus supplement.
     The tables of hypothetical
returns assume no Market Disruption Event, Adjustment Event or Settlement
Disruption Event occurs. Also, the hypothetical rates of return shown below do
not take into account the effects of applicable taxes. Because of the U.S. tax treatment applicable to the notes, tax
liabilities could affect the after-tax rate of return on your notes to a
comparatively greater extent than the after-tax return on the Reference Shares.
     The market price of each of the
Reference Shares has been volatile in the past, and their performance cannot be
predicted for any future period. The actual performance of the Reference Shares
over the life of the notes, as well as the Redemption Amount payable, may bear
little relation to the hypothetical return examples set forth in the tables of
hypothetical returns or to the historical price of the Reference Shares set
forth in this pricing supplement.





 

P-4
 





Supplemental Information Regarding Taxation in the United States
     The amount of the stated
interest rate on each of the notes that constitutes interest on the Deposit (as
defined in the accompanying product supplement no. 1) is set forth in the table
below.
     Deposit Interest for the notes equals 2.87%. The Put
Premium is the Interest Rate minus the Deposit Interest.
     In addition to
potential alternative treatments under current tax law, it is also possible
that the tax law may be changed by legislative or regulatory action, possibly
with retroactive effect. However, it is not possible to predict whether or when
such action will occur and the effect of such potential changes is uncertain.
     Please refer to “Taxation
in the United States” beginning on page PS-16 of the
accompanying product supplement no. 1.
Supplemental Plan of Distribution
     The notes are being purchased
by Natixis Securities North America Inc. (the agent) as principal, pursuant to
a terms agreement dated as of the Trade Date between the agent and us. The
agent has agreed to pay our out-of-pocket expenses in connection with the
issuance of the notes.
     See “Supplemental plan of
distribution” beginning on page PS-19 of the accompanying product
supplement no. 1.

Eksportfinans ASA


Top contentNovember 22, 2011Joint press release from Eksportfinans’ four largest shareholders
EKSPORTFINANS ASA
The largest owners of Eksportfinans ASA aim to wind down the company in an orderly manner in order to preserve the interests of all stakeholders. In our capacity as shareholders, we presently view the company’s financial status, liquidity position and capitalization as adequate to achieve this.With reference to Moody’s downgrading of the rating in Eksportfinans ASA from Aa3 to Ba1 today, the largest owners of the company will have the interests of all stakeholders in focus, alongside own interests as shareholders. 
No new loans will be granted from Eksportfinans going forward. Eksportfinans will be managing Norway’s export financing on behalf of the Kingdom of Norway until the new permanent organization is in place, no later than July 1, 2012. The company’s funding and liquidity situation is assessed to be well matched to its needs going forward.
Eksportfinans is considered to be adequately capitalised to manage the run-off portfolio. The existing loan book, which is fully supported by government guarantees (42.3%) or bank guarantees (57.7%) also going forward, is not affected by recent developments and the downgrade from Moody’s is not motivated by asset qualityconcerns. The owners consequently plan to wind down the company in an orderly manner with the aim of maintaining the equity in the company intact.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.
