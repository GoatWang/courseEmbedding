But if you plan to rent one out to tenants, you may actually need a landlord insurance policy.Learn More What Is Comprehensive Auto Insurance?When you hear the word "comprehensive," you might think "all-encompassing." But when it comes to insurance, the word has a different meaning. Simply put, comprehensive coverage helps protect you against damage to your car that is not the result of a collision - such as theft or a fallen tree branch. I'd be happy to talk to you about whether comprehensive coverage makes sense for you.Learn More Comparing Renters Insurance QuotesWhen comparing renters insurance quotes from different insurers, it's important to take more than price into consideration. Understanding what the policy covers and making sure it fits your needs may help give you the peace of mind that comes from knowing you have certain protections in place while you're living in a rented home or apartment.Learn More Retirement & Life InsuranceYou've planned for your retirement so that you can afford what's important to you, whether it's travel, hobbies or time with the grandkids. But have you included life insurance in your planning, too? Retirement may affect your life insurance needs, from the cost of premiums on a new budget to how long you need a policy or if you need an emergency fund. Whether retirement is around the corner or you're already enjoying your new freedom, make sure you have a life insurance policy that will fit your needs during retirement.Learn More Photographers InsuranceFamilies and businesses trust you to capture some of life's most important moments - from weddings and first birthdays to ribbon cuttings and charitable events. Your clients rely on you to document their special occasions, and you are very careful about safeguarding those irreplaceable images. You should take the same care when choosing your business insurance, too, from making sure your equipment is covered to knowing you have liability protection if something is damaged during a shoot. I'm here to help make sure you can focus on business as usual.Learn More Insurance That Protects Your BikeYour motorcycle is more than just a way to get around. You've invested your time in it, you've made sure it's in perfect working order and you took classes and bought the right gear so you could enjoy it safely. It only make sense that you put the same effort into safeguarding your bike, and you, with insurance. Whether it's collision coverage or a custom paint job, it's important to make sure you have the protection that fits your bike. Here's a breakdown of coverages to help you decide what is right for you.Learn More RV Insurance 101You may be so used to driving your RV that it doesn't seem different than any other vehicle on the road. But when it comes to insurance, an RV is quite different. You need coverage in case of an accident, but what about all the stuff that makes it your home away from home? From state required insurance coverage to storing your RV when it's not on the road, there's a lot to take into account. This overview can help get you thinking about the best options for insuring your RV.Learn More Condo LiabilityWhen you get ready for company, chances are you're planning what to serve and making sure everything is clean. Someone getting hurt may not even cross your mind, but unfortunately something as simple as a friend tripping on your rug could lead to an injury and lawsuit. Thankfully, personal liability coverage is typically included in standard condo insurance and can help if you are sued due to an accident or if you damage someone else's property. Let's make sure you have the coverage that fits your life so that you can focus on enjoying time with your guests.Learn More Show moreShow lessInsurance Products & ServicesInsurance is unlike any other product out there - you pay for it and hope you never have to use it. And that makes paying more than you need to that much more uncomfortable.With a policy from Allstate, you can help keep your insurance costs low with the wide variety of discounts we offer. Keep in mind, not all discounts are available in every state.
