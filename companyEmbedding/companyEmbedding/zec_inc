Products

 By virtue of our certified production processes, ZEC S.p.A.'s range of thermoplastic tubes offers technical advantages worth highlighting:

- reduced weight and size thanks to the use of raw materials of improved toughness and low specific weight;
- excellent resistance to fatigue stress, alternating flexing and vibrations;
- highly specular internal surfaces (higher flow rate with the same diameter);
- long-term durability and very strong anti-ageing qualities.
Moreover, our hoses are in compliance with the REACH Regulation (2006/1907/EC) and the RoHS 2 (2011/65/EU) European Directive.
