History[edit]
Calavo Growers, Inc. was founded on January 21, 1924, as the California Avocado Growers' Exchange. Due to overwhelming interest in the avocado, many California growers had planted avocado seeds that had originated in Mexico. Although slow to mature, by 1923 those avocado trees were producing a large enough crop to be marketed. The problem was the lack of a marketing outlet. The founders studied grower cooperatives that were doing well at the time such as the California Fruit Growers Exchange and adopted features that would work best for the avocado industry.[8] In the first year, the California Avocado Growers Exchange packed the 18,000 lbs. of fruit that launched the California avocado industry.[9] Shortly after, the growers exchange adopted the name Calavo as a brand. This was the result of a naming contest in which multiple entries were submitted combining the words "California" and "avocado". Calavo quickly became the brand name of high quality avocados.[8] In the early 1930s, the cooperative increased its offerings to include limes, coconuts, kiwis, mangos and persimmons. Papayas were added in the late 1940s.[8]
The California Avocado Advisory board was created in 1961, Calavo played a key role in its creation and development. The purpose was to market the California avocado industry as a whole and not just the avocado growers in the cooperative. Today it is known as the California Avocado Commission.[9]
After 78 years as a growers cooperative, Calavo members voted to take the company public. In 2002, Calavo Growers Inc. was designated the ticker symbol CVGW on the NASDAQ National Market System. The seats on the company's board of directors were filled mainly with longtime avocado growers, and that remains so today.
Products[edit]
Calavo Growers markets fresh avocados grown in California, Mexico, and Chile.[10] Additionally, it distribute other fruit products such as tomatoes, pineapples and Hawaiian produced papayas.[5] Operations in Mexico, pack and ship fresh avocados from their 50,000 sq. ft. packinghouse while a second 90,000 sq.ft. facility prepares and packages fresh avocado products such as guacamole. Their products are distributed throughout the U.S. to retailers and foodservice operations nationwide, as well as Canada, Europe and Asia.[11]

History[edit]
Calavo Growers, Inc. was founded on January 21, 1924, as the California Avocado Growers' Exchange. Due to overwhelming interest in the avocado, many California growers had planted avocado seeds that had originated in Mexico. Although slow to mature, by 1923 those avocado trees were producing a large enough crop to be marketed. The problem was the lack of a marketing outlet. The founders studied grower cooperatives that were doing well at the time such as the California Fruit Growers Exchange and adopted features that would work best for the avocado industry.[8] In the first year, the California Avocado Growers Exchange packed the 18,000 lbs. of fruit that launched the California avocado industry.[9] Shortly after, the growers exchange adopted the name Calavo as a brand. This was the result of a naming contest in which multiple entries were submitted combining the words "California" and "avocado". Calavo quickly became the brand name of high quality avocados.[8] In the early 1930s, the cooperative increased its offerings to include limes, coconuts, kiwis, mangos and persimmons. Papayas were added in the late 1940s.[8]
The California Avocado Advisory board was created in 1961, Calavo played a key role in its creation and development. The purpose was to market the California avocado industry as a whole and not just the avocado growers in the cooperative. Today it is known as the California Avocado Commission.[9]
After 78 years as a growers cooperative, Calavo members voted to take the company public. In 2002, Calavo Growers Inc. was designated the ticker symbol CVGW on the NASDAQ National Market System. The seats on the company's board of directors were filled mainly with longtime avocado growers, and that remains so today.
Products[edit]
Calavo Growers markets fresh avocados grown in California, Mexico, and Chile.[10] Additionally, it distribute other fruit products such as tomatoes, pineapples and Hawaiian produced papayas.[5] Operations in Mexico, pack and ship fresh avocados from their 50,000 sq. ft. packinghouse while a second 90,000 sq.ft. facility prepares and packages fresh avocado products such as guacamole. Their products are distributed throughout the U.S. to retailers and foodservice operations nationwide, as well as Canada, Europe and Asia.[11]

Calavo Growers, Inc. Acquires Riverside, CA Production Facility - Renaissance Food Group
















































Calavo Growers, Inc. Acquires Riverside, CA Production Facility

November 28, 2016 | Press Releases


Calavo Growers, Inc., a global avocado industry leader and expanding provider of value-added fresh food, today announced that it has completed the purchase of a production facility in Riverside, Calif. The newly acquired production facility will further enhance the national footprint for the company’s Renaissance Food Group, LLC (RFG) business segment and position the segment to serve its growing customer base across the southwestern United States.
The acquired facility, which totals approximately 128,000 square feet situated on about 11 acres, was previously owned and operated by affiliates of the former Fresh & Easy Neighborhood Markets.
The company described the new facility as nearly “turnkey,” which will allow RFG to quickly expand capacity and meet growing demand among current and new customers for its fresh, value-added packaged fruit and vegetables, ready-to-eat salads and prepared foods offerings. The facility’s state-of-the-art design allows for an efficient start up, optimal food-safety measures, and quality production flow. Its physical location, in Southern California’s burgeoning Inland Empire region, is highly sought after for its prime interstate and rail access.
Calavo Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Lee E. Cole stated: “This best-in-class facility aligns with and extends our company’s strategic growth initiatives to build a leading market position in the refrigerated fresh packaged foods category. The new facility enables us to satisfy demand from several key accounts in Southern California, while providing the platform for deeper market penetration across the southwest, including southern Nevada, Arizona and Utah. Quick-turn, ‘just-in-time’ order fulfillment is a cornerstone of RFG’s operating success, along with the outstanding depth and breadth of its product portfolio.”
The new Riverside facility follows the recent addition of a 209,000 square foot production and distribution center near Jacksonville, Fla. and the new renovation and expansion of the 89,000 square foot production facility in Houston, Texas.
Total transaction consideration approximated $19.4 million, according to the company. Calavo reported that it purchased the facility through a variable interest entity created to effect a potential like-kind exchange under Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code.

History[edit]
Calavo Growers, Inc. was founded on January 21, 1924, as the California Avocado Growers' Exchange. Due to overwhelming interest in the avocado, many California growers had planted avocado seeds that had originated in Mexico. Although slow to mature, by 1923 those avocado trees were producing a large enough crop to be marketed. The problem was the lack of a marketing outlet. The founders studied grower cooperatives that were doing well at the time such as the California Fruit Growers Exchange and adopted features that would work best for the avocado industry.[8] In the first year, the California Avocado Growers Exchange packed the 18,000 lbs. of fruit that launched the California avocado industry.[9] Shortly after, the growers exchange adopted the name Calavo as a brand. This was the result of a naming contest in which multiple entries were submitted combining the words "California" and "avocado". Calavo quickly became the brand name of high quality avocados.[8] In the early 1930s, the cooperative increased its offerings to include limes, coconuts, kiwis, mangos and persimmons. Papayas were added in the late 1940s.[8]
The California Avocado Advisory board was created in 1961, Calavo played a key role in its creation and development. The purpose was to market the California avocado industry as a whole and not just the avocado growers in the cooperative. Today it is known as the California Avocado Commission.[9]
After 78 years as a growers cooperative, Calavo members voted to take the company public. In 2002, Calavo Growers Inc. was designated the ticker symbol CVGW on the NASDAQ National Market System. The seats on the company's board of directors were filled mainly with longtime avocado growers, and that remains so today.
Products[edit]
Calavo Growers markets fresh avocados grown in California, Mexico, and Chile.[10] Additionally, it distribute other fruit products such as tomatoes, pineapples and Hawaiian produced papayas.[5] Operations in Mexico, pack and ship fresh avocados from their 50,000 sq. ft. packinghouse while a second 90,000 sq.ft. facility prepares and packages fresh avocado products such as guacamole. Their products are distributed throughout the U.S. to retailers and foodservice operations nationwide, as well as Canada, Europe and Asia.[11]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
