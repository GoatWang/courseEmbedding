                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

BBB Accreditation





                BBB Accredited Since 02/24/1998
            

                BBB has determined that Community Choice Financial, Inc. meets Standards of BBB Accreditation, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            

                BBB accreditation does not mean that the business's products or services have been evaluated or endorsed by BBB, or that BBB has made a determination as to the business's product quality or competency in performing services.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

                        Community Choice Financial, Inc. has received 3.74 out of 5 stars based on 11 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of A+.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

We estimate that the net proceeds from this offering with respect to the shares
to be sold by us will be $106.8 million, after deducting the underwriting 
discount and estimated expenses payable by us in connection with this offering,
and assuming a public offering price of $11.00 per share (the midpoint of the 
price range set forth on the cover of this prospectus), assuming no exercise of
the underwriters' overallotment option. 

We will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling 
shareholders in connection with any exercise of the underwriters' overallotment
option. However, we will receive net proceeds of approximately $2.0 million if 
the underwriters exercise their overallotment option in full, prior to giving 
effect to the payment of $5.2 million to management.

We intend to use the net proceeds received by us to fund acquisitions, 
including the Florida Acquisition, to pay a termination fee of approximately 
$5.8 million under our management agreement and for general corporate purposes,
which may include redeeming up to $39.5 million aggregate principal amount of 
our 10.75% senior secured notes due 2019. 

The net proceeds from the offering of the senior notes, together with the 
initial borrowings under our revolving credit facility and cash on hand, were 
used to retire $207.2 million of CheckSmart's outstanding debt and $74.1 
million of CCCS's outstanding debt, pay a $120.6 million special dividend to 
our shareholders, and pay a $4.4 million bonus to management. 

We have discussions on an ongoing basis regarding possible acquisitions of 
businesses complementary to our business. Although we may use a portion of the 
net proceeds received by us for these kinds of possible acquisitions, no 
definitive agreements or commitments in this regard currently exist. 

A $1.00 increase (decrease) in the assumed initial public offering price of 
$11.00 per share would increase (decrease) the net proceeds to us from this 
offering by $9.9 million, assuming the number of shares offered by us, as set 
forth on the cover page of this prospectus, remains the same and after 
deducting the underwriting discount and estimated offering expenses payable by 
us. In addition, an increase or decrease in the number of shares of our common 
shares sold by us in this offering by 10% would cause the net proceeds received
by us from this offering, after deducting the estimated underwriting discount 
and estimated offering expenses, to increase or decrease by approximately $10.9
million, assuming an initial offering price of $11.00 per common share, which 
is the midpoint of the estimated range set forth on the cover page of this 
prospectus.


The industry in which we operate is highly fragmented and very competitive. We 
believe the principal competitive factors in short-term consumer lending, title
lending, check cashing and prepaid debit card services are location, customer 
service, fees and the transparency of fees, convenience, range of services 
offered, speed of service and confidentiality. We face intense competition and 
believe each of the markets in which we operate is becoming more competitive as
these industries mature and consolidate. With respect to our short-term 
consumer lending business, we compete primarily with mono-line payday lending 
businesses, other check cashers and multi-line alternative financial service 
providers, pawn shops, rent-to-own businesses, banks and credit unions. With 
respect to our check cashing business, we compete with other check cashers and 
multi-line alternative financial service providers, grocery stores, convenience
stores, banks, credit unions, and any other retailer that cashes checks, sells 
money orders, provides money transfer services or offers other similar 
financial services, including some big-box retailers. Some retailers cash 
checks without charging a fee under limited circumstances. With respect to our 
prepaid debit card services, we compete primarily with prepaid debit card 
issuers, other check cashers and multi-line alternative financial service 
providers, banks, credit unions, and any other retailer offering general 
purpose reloadable prepaid debit cards, including some big-box retailers. Some 
of our competitors, such as big-box retailers, have larger and more established
customer bases and networks of existing stores and substantially greater 
financial, marketing and other resources than us.


Company Description
We are a leading retailer of alternative financial services to unbanked and 
underbanked consumers through a network of 435 retail storefronts across 14 
states. We focus on providing a wide range of convenient consumer financial 
products and services to help customers manage their day-to-day


 financial 
needs, including short-term consumer loans, medium-term loans, title loans, 
check cashing, prepaid debit cards, money transfers, bill payments and money 
orders. Although the majority of our customers have banking relationships, we 
believe that our customers use our financial services because they are 
convenient, easy to understand, and in many instances, more affordable than 
available alternatives. 

We strive to provide customers with unparalleled customer service in a safe, 
clean and welcoming environment. Our stores are located in highly visible, 
accessible locations that allow customers convenient and immediate access to 
our services. Our professional work environment combines high employee 
performance standards, incentive-based pay and a wide array of training 
programs to incentivize our employees to provide superior customer service. We 
believe that this approach has enabled us to build strong customer loyalty, 
putting us in a position to expand and continue to capitalize on our 
innovative product offerings. As a result of our focus on store selection and 
design and our efforts to provide consistent, high-quality customer service, we
have achieved per store revenue and per store Adjusted EBITDA contribution 
levels that we believe substantially exceed our publicly traded peers. 

We serve the large and growing market of individuals who have limited or no 
access to traditional sources of consumer credit and financial services. A 
study conducted by the FDIC published in 2009 indicates 25.6% of U.S. 
households are either unbanked or underbanked, representing approximately 60 
million adults. As traditional financial institutions increase fees for 
consumer services, such as checking accounts and debit cards, and tighten 
credit standards as a result of economic and other market driven developments, 
consumers have looked elsewhere for less expensive and more convenient 
alternatives to meet their financial needs. According to a recent Federal 
Reserve Bank of New York report, total consumer credit outstanding has declined
over $1.4 trillion since its peak in the third quarter of 2008. This 
contraction in the supply of consumer credit has resulted in significant unmet
