Dining Room Supplies
Make your dining room perfect with our huge selection of tabletop and buffet items



        Dining room supplies have been part of the foodservicedirect product offering for over 15 years. We have cultivated great relationships with premier manufacturers such as Oneida and Libbey glassware. Our goal is to give the independent operator the largest possible selection of name brand items at amazingly competitive prices. Many food service suppliers offered dining room supplies only as an add-on, however, at foodservicedirect, we stock many thousands of these items and they have always been at the core of our offering.

Specialty Food
Choose from over 30,000 specialty food items



        Foodservicedirect offers over 10,000 specialty food items. All of our specialty food products ship in case quantities, typically within three business days. The specialty category encompasses a broad range - from ethnic and regional specialties to organic and gluten-free products. Many of our restaurant operator customers have found these specialty items to be a welcome supplement to their menus. We have also found that we have attracted some new folks, like the guy looking for the barbecue sauce he grew up enjoying in Georgia. If you are not sure where to start, may we suggest organic cookies?
