Payment logistics[edit]
Using Stripe, web developers can integrate payment processing into their websites without having to register and maintain a merchant account.[4] Stripe has a seven-day waiting period for initial transactions, during which time it profiles the businesses involved to protect against potential fraud. Stripe then transfers the funds directly into the bank account linked to the payee.[5]
History[edit]
Irish entrepreneurs John and Patrick Collison founded Stripe in 2010.[5] Stripe began as a start-up called /dev/payments. The name resulted in misspellings and confusion to those outside the company, so the company renamed itself Stripe.[6] In June 2010, Stripe received seed funding from Y Combinator, a start-up accelerator.[7] In May 2011, Stripe received a $2 million investment from venture capitalists Peter Thiel, Sequoia Capital, and Andreessen Horowitz.[8] In February 2012, Stripe received an $18 million Series A investment led by Sequoia Capital at a $100 million valuation.[9] Stripe launched publicly in September 2011 after an extensive private beta.[10] Less than a year after its public launch, Stripe received a $20 million Series B investment.[11] In March, 2013, Stripe acquired chat and task-management application Kick-off.[12]
In March 2014, CEO Patrick Collison announced that Stripe would support bitcoin transactions.[13] In January 2015, Stripe introduced a machine learning–based fraud detection system.[14]
In 2016, Stripe was ranked number four on the Forbes magazine Cloud 100, a list of companies that engage in cloud computing.[15]

Relay
Let other businesses sell their products directly within your mobile app.

Explore the docs













Explore the docs

















Mobile commerce done right
Mobile websites don't convert well: while mobile devices represent 60% of browsing traffic, they only account for 15% of purchasing.
In-app buy buttons fix this with an instant purchase experience for customers. With Relay, you can let customers purchase products from other sellers directly within your app.







Your commerce API
It’s easy for any e-commerce company to programmatically share their product catalogs, SKUs, and inventory and to accept orders from your app.
Explore the docs











Start in minutes
Relay standardizes how product data and orders are shared between e-commerce retailers and your app.


Receive product data
Businesses can link e-commerce systems or directly add product info and SKUs.


Actionable product screens
Rather than just linking to a webpage, let customers convert from within your app.


Send structured order info
For each sale, we'll help send all the info the business needs to complete the order.







Platform friendly
Relay is integrated with popular e-commerce platforms like Demandware and SAP Hybris, making it simple for sellers to get up and running.
        


Calculate taxes and shipping
We’ve even partnered with companies like Avalara, TaxJar, EasyPost, and Shippo to help you calculate taxes and shipping for products globally.

Why This 5-Year-Old Payments Company Is Worth $3.6 Billion


How Stripe founders Patrick and John Collison are reimagining payments for the Internet era.

COMPANY PROFILE
Company: Stripe Headquarters: San Francisco Founder: Patrick Collison (26), John Collison (24) Year Founded: 2010 Full Year Revenue: Undisclosed Employees: 200 Raised: $190 million Twitter: @stripe Facebook: facebook.com/StripePayments Website: www.stripe.com 







Editor's note: Stripe is one of Inc.'s 2015 30 Under 30. This year's readers' choice winner is ThinkLite.  
Sometimes the most stunning changes arise from the smallest of ideas. That's the origin story of Stripe, the payments company that's quietly eating the lunch of entrenched competitors in the $1.5 trillion global e-commerce payments industry.
Founded in 2010 by wunderkind brothers John and Patrick Collison--serial entrepreneurs who hail from Limerick, Ireland--Stripe is making the digital payment process for smartphones and websites so pain-free, it's practically invisible.
Like many Silicon Valley luminaries, the Collisons dropped out of college--Harvard and MIT, respectively--to launch their first startup, an auction and marketplace management system for eBay merchants. That business, called Auctomatic, sold for $5 million in 2008 to a Canadian media company, making the Collisons millionaires when they were still teenagers. 
With Stripe, the Collisons saw a bigger unfilled need, which was the payments void that customers are still subject to when they buy online.
"The market opportunity for Stripe before Stripe existed was obvious," says John Collison, the company's 24-year-old president. When buying online, people were forced to use outside vendors like PayPal to complete a purchase. That gap is where Stripe fits in, Collison adds.
Stripe lets merchants process credit cards directly from their own websites, simply by inserting a few lines of code. While that may seem incredibly minor, transactions experts say it improves the payment experience by keeping customers at merchants' websites, and by reducing the time it takes to pay. That, in turn, increases the likelihood customers will buy, and come back to buy again.
"You don't have that disjointed experience when you go to PayPal, or wherever else, to input your payment information," says Andy Schmidt, research director at CEB TowerGroup, a research firm focused on the financial services industry.
That small change has plenty of evangelists. Venture capitalist Venky Ganesan, managing director of Menlo Ventures, says the payments industry is ripe for the kind of disruption that Stripe is promising. The company is able to offer lower rates by cutting out some of the middlemen in an industry that had been controlled by the credit card companies, as well as merchant issuing and merchant processing banks, which each take a percentage of transactions. 
"Silicon Valley is all about finding the next Mark Zuckerberg, and I know plenty of people who put [the Collisons] on this list," says Ganesan. "They are incredible entrepreneurs."
Ex-PayPalers Elon Musk and Max Levchin, not to mention the ever-prevalent Peter Thiel, have taken notice. So too have prominent VC firms such as Andreessen Horowitz, Khosla Ventures, and Sequoia Capital. Collectively, they've ponied up $190 million, valuing Stripe at around $3.6 billion. Stripe does not release its revenue number, but it's likely to be a fraction of PayPal's, which reported annual revenue of about $7.9 billion for 2014.
Stripe currently supports payments in 138 currencies. And with newly inked deals to process payments for Apple Pay and Alibaba's Alipay, as well as a feature that allows merchants to accept bitcoins for payments, Stripe has positioned itself to become a global payments phenomenon.
"For too long people have looked at the internet with a bricks-and-mortar lens, but that is not what the internet is about," Collison says. "There are new kinds of internet companies with new kinds of business models, and that's the stuff we are interested in enabling."
