What business type is right for you?
When you're starting a new business, you want to determine the business structure that's right for you. What's the difference between a limited liability company (LLC) and a corporation (Inc.)? And how is a C corporation different from an S corporation? Use these charts to help decide what business type is best for your needs.








LLC vs. Corporation






Limited Liability Company (LLC)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my LLCCorporation (Inc)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my Corporation







What is an S corporation?
After you create a corporation or LLC, you also have the opportunity to decide how you'd like your business to be taxed.Single owner LLCs can be taxed either as a sole proprietorship or a corporation.  LLCs with more than one owner can be taxed either as a partnership or a corporation.  Income from LLCs treated as sole proprietorships or partnerships is reported directly on the owner’s individual tax returns.New corporations, as well as LLCs considering corporate taxation can choose between filing taxes as a C corporation ("C corp") or an S corporation ("S corp"). An S corp is considered a "pass-through entity," which means the business itself isn't taxed. Instead, income is reported on the owners' personal tax returns. Businesses taxed as C corporations are not pass through entities.  Income is taxed at the corporate level, and, if dividends are distributed, at the individual level as well.We can help you understand your options so you choose what's best for your business. Talk to one of our network of attorneys today.








C-corp or S-corp 






Here's a comparison of some key characteristics of businesses that choose to be treated as C corps and S corps.C DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensS DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensYou don't have to decide about S corp status right away. You have 75 days after the formation of your business to file with the IRS. If you're still not sure what to do, you may want to consult with one of our attorneys or tax specialists.





Step-by-Step Guide on Starting Your Business













Easy as 1-2-3




1. Select the business structure that's right for you and fill out a simple questionnaire.





2. We'll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state.





3. You'll receive your completed paperwork by mail.








Ask away. We have answers.



Common questions

Can I start a business without creating a corporation or LLC?
You don't need a corporation or LLC to go into business. Many business owners are in partnerships or are sole proprietors. But both a corporation and LLC canshield you from liability and may offer tax advantages.


What are the main differences between an LLC and a sole proprietorship?
You don't need to file any paperwork with your state to create a sole proprietorship (though you may still need business permits and licenses to operate lawfully). But an LLC protects you from personal liability  - a sole proprietorship doesn't.Also, LLCs provide more flexibility as you grow your business.


What are the main differences between an LLC and an S corporation?
An LLC has more flexibility and fewer corporate formalities than an S corporation. S corporations are required to have annual meetings of shareholders and directors, while meetings of LLC member and/or managers are not required..  Also,  LLCs can provide for a flexible management structure by members or managers, while corporations require management by a Board of Directors.Learn more.


Do I need a name or DBA for my business?
You only need a DBA ("doing business as") if you are operating a sole proprietorship or partnership and you want to use a fictitious name for the business. You don't need a DBA for an LLC or a corporation unless you are using a name other than your LLC or corporate name while doing business.Learn more.


Do I need any other licenses or permits to start my business? 
Some cities, counties, and states require businesses to obtain licenses and permits to operate lawfully. We can help you figure out what you need. Learn More.

Compare Business Structures – LLC vs. Corporation, S Corporation and C Corporation 

		 You’ve decided to start a business, but you’re not sure where to begin. You don’t know if you should form an LLC or corporation, and need guidance to help you choose the right business structure. Each business structure has its advantages and disadvantages that are important to understand because choosing the wrong business entity could result in legal and tax implications down the road. The information above will allow you to compare LLC vs. corporation, and learn the difference between an S corporation and C corporation. LLCs and corporations both offer personal liability protection, but the most significant difference between LLC and corporation is that corporations are preferred by outside investors. When comparing LLC vs S corp, there are a few important differences to be aware of which are outlined above. Once you determine which business structure you need, you can start a business with LegalZoom in just three easy steps. The process begins by filling out a simple questionnaire. We’ll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state, and you’ll receive your completed paperwork by mail. If you need help deciding which business structure is right for you, a LegalZoom legal plan attorney can explain how each business entity works and help you decide.

Bath Safety: 
							According to the National

							minimize the chance of such accidents...Fight Over Bed Sores: 
						Bed sores are significant and growing problems for patients
                        in confinement to bed or a chair, being unable to move,
                        losing of bowel or bladder control, having poor
                        nutrition, or with lowered mental awareness. Anyone who
                        must stay in a bed, chair, or wheelchair because of
                        illness or injury can get bed sores...Overweight / Obesity 
						According to US Surgeon General, the primary concern of
                        overweight / obesity is one of health and not
                        appearance. It is estimated that 300,000 deaths per year
                        may be due to obesity. The risk of death rises with
                        increasing weight. Bariatric
                        individuals have 50-100% increased risk of premature

Directory of Home Care Services


find the best home care in your local area






		Home care can refer to health care provided in the home by health care professionals (often referred to as home health care or formal care) or by family and friends (informal care). Estimates for the US indicate that most home care is of the informal variety with families and friends providing substantial amounts of care, including very high tech kinds of care as well as simpler assistance with bathing or dressing.
          Home care is paid or unpaid assistance provided to a person with a chronic disability or illness, living in the community. 
          It is provided by a clinical NetWork made up of members who care for patients in the home or who have special interest in promoting the development of home care as a viable alternative to in-hospital care.
          Home care is the provision of assistance to persons over the age of 16 in their home, according to an assessment of their needs. The assistance could be practical, financial (not advice), or help with day to day activities. 
          This involves the provision of comprehensive care by community members, NGOs, Community Based Organizations (CBOs), health workers and family members. This type of care is complementary to the existing health care 
          services. Home care, also known as domiciliary care, is health care provided in the patient's home by healthcare professionals (often referred to as home health care or formal care; in the United States, it is known as skilled care) or by family and friends (also known as caregivers, or known as a primary caregiver, who give informal care). 
          This 
          free directory features thousands of home care service providers or 
          facilities from across the U.S. and Canada. You will find contact 
          information about each featured facility in your geographic location

Low Beds for Alzheimer's Disease - Safety & Comfort



According to the National Institute on Aging, safety and comfort are the two essentials in Alzheimre's Disease patient care. To ensure safety, facilities and caregivers are required to:
 Provide a safe and structured environment.
Provide consistent staff to attend the patient.
Place the patient in a room that allows easy and careful observation.
Place bed in low position.
By no means leave anything at the bedside that might harm the patient.
Elopement precautions: Place the patient in a room where he has to pass the nursing station in order to reach an exit. Have a photo of the patient on file.

Our low beds can be lowered to a very low heights to maximize safety for patients with Alzheimer's and other diseases. 
In addtion to low hospital bed, the following accessories are also commonly used for safety and ease of care: 
Patient Alarms are tools for caregivers to monitor patients and ensure safety by reducing risk of falling together with side rail pad. 
Alzheimer patient floor mat is to minimize the chance for patient who falls to be injured. 
Low bed overbed table makes the care giving and daily living much easier.

Pulmonary Therapy Mattress




Pulmonary therapy 
			includes exercises and treatments designed to help patients maintain 
			and recover lung function, such as with cystic fibrosis and after 
			surgery or accident. Caring for critically ill or injured patients, 
			especially those who are immobilized, requires the skill, dedication 
			and compassion of experienced nursing professionals can be 
			strengthened by using pulmonary therapy mattresses that offer some 
			of different functions such as lateral rotation, percussion / 
			vibration, low air loss and pressure relief for advanced pulmonary 
			therapy and ulcer prevention.
			Our lateral rotation mattress, also called 
			lateral 
			turn mattress, can turn patient laterally to 
			change his / her body position automatically. This helps patient 
			recover from pulmonary diseases and complications, and promotes 
			secondary wound healing and prevention. Lateral rotation mattresses 
			are usually built with low air loss function for pressure relief 
			function since patients with bed-ridden pulmonary diseases are at 
			risk of suffering from bed sores. These products include models
			
			SYS-MIL-TTL and
			
			LS9500.

SUNDAY SEMINAR LINE UP10:15-11:00AMD201 Pesticide Use in Cannabis Culture Dr. James Namnath, Cann-CareAs cannabis gains recreational and medical legal status in many states the legal cultivation community grows. Federal Laws governs most pesticide uses and that is problematic for cannabis since it is classified as a Schedule I substance and cannot be considered by federal authorities for any pesticide use. Nonetheless there ARE avenues to create legal approved cannabis plant care pesticides to provide growers with a healthy and abundant harvest. Illegal pesticide use on cannabis is easily detected and has already resulted in severe penalties to growers.

I feel amazing now that I've started taking HomocysteX Plus. The combo of B vitamins seems to be just right for me and I'm not always easy to please with having a double C677T MTHFR mutation!!"
Thanks Seeking Health!!
– Camille








I am a repeat customer who is very pleased with how good I feel on this multi!!"
– Carol








As always, a high quality product from Dr. Lynch. Easy to use lozenge. I don't want to miss this product in my day. Highly recommend."
– Mary Alice








I love this product. It was difficult to find Adeno B12. I'm happy to have found it now. This supplement is very pure and does not contain magnesium stearate."
– Michelle








I can tell this is a superior Vit C. I'm taking it with the Glutathione. I don't remember where Vit C fits in with the methylation cycle. I'm still tweaking all of my supplements, but this is awesome stuff."
– Holly








Why this powder? Because the list of ingredients is comprehensive, they are all in their bio-available form, and it has protein (I’m a vegetarian). I was also extreeeemely impressed with the timely and knowledgeable answers customer service provided when I was investigating which multivitamin to spend my money on. Everything inspired all-around trust!"

How many supplement companies have a doctor sharing a wealth of information on how to take these vitamins, anticipated reactions, side effects, how to move forward with different supplements. This doesn't even include all of his research in biochemistry and methylation pathways. Dr. Lynch and Seeking Health is one of the most helpful one-stop resources to help you manage and improve your health on the web. I can't say enough about his research, supplement company and integrity in producing some of the best products for your health."
– P. Renn








This product has made a big difference in my everyday routine. Thank you for producing a great, pure product."
– Ellen








Family friend recommended Lactase Drops from SeekingHealth.com. Could not be more pleased with product. Not only a great product, but also great customer service. The first bottle we received was damaged and the majority of the contents had leaked out. Contacted SeekingHealth.com that day and received a free replacement bottle within 2 days!"
– Jonas








I bought the Niacin in the 50mg capsule form for several reasons. I always learn so much from Seeking Health's site and appreciate the articles and helpful directions to listen to from Dr. Ben. I also have to add that I do not worry about ordering from Seeking Health as their customer service is top notch with wanting one to be happy with their order."
– J








First of all the customer service person who helped me was extremely helpful-and I am impressed with the variety of vitamins and other helpful ingredients in this mix. I am using this for the first time and have mixed it with plain water-in the future I hope to mix it with frozen fruit in a blender as recommended by the helpful customer service representative. Thank you Seeking Health for this healthy product!"
– Judy








I hesitated in purchasing optimal electrolyte, because I have always greatly disliked the taste of drinks sweetened with stevia. I went ahead and ordered it, desiring the health benefits it would give. I am so glad that I did. The taste is delicious. It reminds me of a creamsicle, or (if you are old enough to remember) orange crush soda!!"
– Rhonda




















You demand the best for you and your family. We research so we can give it to you. Our rapid growth is a testament to you, our customers. Seeking Health is a proud honoree of Inc. 500’s fastest-growing companies in America for the second year in a row.

Medical Cannabis Fast Facts



The Compassionate Use of Medical Cannabis Pilot Program Act was signed by Governor Quinn on August 1, 2013 and went into effect January 1, 2014.
The term medical marijuana describes using cannabis, including cannabinoids such as THC and CBD, in a variety of forms to provide therapeutic or palliative relief to a medical symptom or condition.
In Illinois, medical marijuana can only be purchased from a properly registered Illinois marijuana dispensary.
Cannabis is one of the most pharmacologically active plants on the planet with over 400 different active chemicals.


Medical marijuana is often used for the following palliative effects:
Reduce Nausea & Vomiting
Treat Pain & Muscle Spasticity
Reduce Inflammation
Act as an Analgesic

Can an Illinois Medical Cannabis Patient Legally Purchase or Own a Gun?

What business type is right for you?
When you're starting a new business, you want to determine the business structure that's right for you. What's the difference between a limited liability company (LLC) and a corporation (Inc.)? And how is a C corporation different from an S corporation? Use these charts to help decide what business type is best for your needs.








LLC vs. Corporation






Limited Liability Company (LLC)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my LLCCorporation (Inc)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my Corporation







What is an S corporation?
After you create a corporation or LLC, you also have the opportunity to decide how you'd like your business to be taxed.Single owner LLCs can be taxed either as a sole proprietorship or a corporation.  LLCs with more than one owner can be taxed either as a partnership or a corporation.  Income from LLCs treated as sole proprietorships or partnerships is reported directly on the owner’s individual tax returns.New corporations, as well as LLCs considering corporate taxation can choose between filing taxes as a C corporation ("C corp") or an S corporation ("S corp"). An S corp is considered a "pass-through entity," which means the business itself isn't taxed. Instead, income is reported on the owners' personal tax returns. Businesses taxed as C corporations are not pass through entities.  Income is taxed at the corporate level, and, if dividends are distributed, at the individual level as well.We can help you understand your options so you choose what's best for your business. Talk to one of our network of attorneys today.








C-corp or S-corp 






Here's a comparison of some key characteristics of businesses that choose to be treated as C corps and S corps.C DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensS DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensYou don't have to decide about S corp status right away. You have 75 days after the formation of your business to file with the IRS. If you're still not sure what to do, you may want to consult with one of our attorneys or tax specialists.





Step-by-Step Guide on Starting Your Business













Easy as 1-2-3




1. Select the business structure that's right for you and fill out a simple questionnaire.





2. We'll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state.





3. You'll receive your completed paperwork by mail.








Ask away. We have answers.



Common questions

Can I start a business without creating a corporation or LLC?
You don't need a corporation or LLC to go into business. Many business owners are in partnerships or are sole proprietors. But both a corporation and LLC canshield you from liability and may offer tax advantages.


What are the main differences between an LLC and a sole proprietorship?
You don't need to file any paperwork with your state to create a sole proprietorship (though you may still need business permits and licenses to operate lawfully). But an LLC protects you from personal liability  - a sole proprietorship doesn't.Also, LLCs provide more flexibility as you grow your business.


What are the main differences between an LLC and an S corporation?
An LLC has more flexibility and fewer corporate formalities than an S corporation. S corporations are required to have annual meetings of shareholders and directors, while meetings of LLC member and/or managers are not required..  Also,  LLCs can provide for a flexible management structure by members or managers, while corporations require management by a Board of Directors.Learn more.


Do I need a name or DBA for my business?
You only need a DBA ("doing business as") if you are operating a sole proprietorship or partnership and you want to use a fictitious name for the business. You don't need a DBA for an LLC or a corporation unless you are using a name other than your LLC or corporate name while doing business.Learn more.


Do I need any other licenses or permits to start my business? 
Some cities, counties, and states require businesses to obtain licenses and permits to operate lawfully. We can help you figure out what you need. Learn More.

Compare Business Structures – LLC vs. Corporation, S Corporation and C Corporation 

		 You’ve decided to start a business, but you’re not sure where to begin. You don’t know if you should form an LLC or corporation, and need guidance to help you choose the right business structure. Each business structure has its advantages and disadvantages that are important to understand because choosing the wrong business entity could result in legal and tax implications down the road. The information above will allow you to compare LLC vs. corporation, and learn the difference between an S corporation and C corporation. LLCs and corporations both offer personal liability protection, but the most significant difference between LLC and corporation is that corporations are preferred by outside investors. When comparing LLC vs S corp, there are a few important differences to be aware of which are outlined above. Once you determine which business structure you need, you can start a business with LegalZoom in just three easy steps. The process begins by filling out a simple questionnaire. We’ll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state, and you’ll receive your completed paperwork by mail. If you need help deciding which business structure is right for you, a LegalZoom legal plan attorney can explain how each business entity works and help you decide.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
