As the largest owner of hair salons in North America, Regis Corp. already has some substantial advantages over its competition. According to Vice President of Logistics Bruce McMahon, one of those is how the company’s size benefits its supply chain operations. Whereas smaller salon chains and independents have to handle their purchasing individually, Regis Corp.’s size in the marketplace makes it easy for the company to supply all of its salons directly and through a single order.
Regis Corp. owns and operates approximately 8,000 salons throughout North America, and McMahon says this scale allows Regis Corp. to operate its supply chain with the greatest efficiency possible. Thanks to its state-of-the-art distribution network, the company can supply its salons with the right products at the right time and with one streamlined process. With more than 13,000 SKUs within its inventory, this kind of efficiency is crucial for Regis Corp.
Even though the company already boasts perhaps the most efficient distribution network in the industry, McMahon says Regis Corp. continues to push for improvements. The company plans to open new distribution centers in strategic locations in the United States, and continues to refine the technology it puts to use in its system. As long as the company continues playing to its strengths, Regis Corp. will be an example of operational excellence for the long term, McMahon says.
Bigger is Better
Because Regis Corp. is significantly larger than its next-largest competitors, the company has the luxury of being big enough to bypass the traditional distribution process in which stores order from distributors. “With our distribution infrastructure, we’re able to go direct to vendors,” McMahon says. “If there’s anything that sets us apart, it’s that our size allows us to have that distribution structure.”
Regis Corp. buys directly from major vendors including Paul Mitchell and L’Oreal, consolidating the orders of nearly 8,000 corporate-owned and franchise Regis salons into a single purchase. “We buy once a week from Paul Mitchell, and there’s one invoice,” McMahon says.
The company’s ability to purchase for all of its salons at the same time makes for a streamlined and cost-effective solution. Transportation costs are lower and the delivery schedule is arranged so that salons only have to receive one delivery at a time. “It is much cheaper to have UPS walk into your salon with two boxes once instead of twice with one box each time,” McMahon says.
Careful and Cautious
Although Regis Corp. avoids many of the logistics hassles and headaches most salons have to contend with, there still remain some challenges that it must be careful with, McMahon says. One of the company’s biggest challenges is simply juggling an inventory of more than 13,000 SKUs and finding a balance between a broad selection and an efficient throughput.
Also, because the majority of the products it handles are liquids, shipping them to salons is more difficult than with dry goods. UPS handles nearly 95 percent of the shipping for Regis Corp., and McMahon says the two companies have worked together to develop packaging with enhanced integrity. As a result, Regis Corp. has reduced damages caused during shipping by more than 500 percent in recent years.
Another significant challenge is the fact that salons usually want to receive all of their deliveries at the same time. Because the typical shipment size is 10 boxes, McMahon says proper planning is essential. “Anytime you have a retail company that allows you to put your delivery to the stores on a schedule, that schedule becomes critical,” he says, adding that Regis Corp. works to maximize trailer fills as trucks are sent out.
Rethinking the Plan
McMahon says Regis Corp. revises its strategic five-year plan every two years to keep up with changes in the industry. As it stands, a major portion of the company’s current five-year plan is to add distribution centers in cities such as Chattanooga, Tenn., and Salt Lake City to join its current facility in Minneapolis.
McMahon says Regis Corp. is proud of the technology it utilizes in its distribution center, and continues to investigate new ways to integrate technology into its operations. The company uses a warehouse management system called LogisticsPro that interfaces directly with its inventory system. Combined with warehouse control and execution systems, Regis Corp. can select from a number of options for shipping product depending on the conditions. With the help of UPS’s Quantum View system, Regis Corp. can track 99.995 percent of all boxes from the distribution center to the salon.
McMahon says Regis Corp. strives for continuous improvement, and emphasizes the application of lean and Six Sigma principles whenever possible. The company’s entire management team has been trained to Six Sigma yellow belt level through the University of Tennessee. Even though Regis Corp. already does so many things right, McMahon says there’s always an opportunity to do something better. “At times it’s humbling when you look at something you’ve been doing for many years and then the ah-ha moment arrives when you realize you don’t have to do that anymore,” he says.­­­

You work nights, weekends and holidays with no extra pay and upper management sucks and liesAdvice to ManagementPaying your people minimum wage makes you look pathetic. Trust your SDL's instead of lying to them and backstabbing. Oh yeah, and maybe don't pay your sucky managers more than your SDL's - there's an idea!Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (4) Regis Corporation Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Regis Corporation 2017-06-27 14:56 PDT Jul 23, 2017"Salon Manager"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementCurrent Employee - Salon Manager in Honolulu, HICurrent Employee - Salon Manager in Honolulu, HIDoesn't RecommendNegative OutlookNo opinion of CEOI have been working at Regis Corporation full-time (More than 10 years)ProsI've been with Regis Corporation for over 10 years and although I have had great experiences working for this corporation I struggle with finding positives to boast aboutConsPay structure is set so the corporation makes money at the expense of stylists. Corporation floods the market with coupons to drive guests into the salon, but stylists do not reap the benefits of guest increase. Working on a matrix scale, stylists must maintain a certain production per hour. Salon can be extremely busy on weekends but slower during the week. If a stylist meets a high production on a weekend, but is met with a slow weekday, you slip back to your base rate of minimum wage. Licensed professionals making minimum wage! They will sell you on making all this money, but equate tips into that. We all know not everyone tips. Be okay with making minimum wage. Corporation will sell you on on going education, don't be fooled. That won't happen and when it does it's a year behind trend. Corporation used to provide tools (clippers, blowdryers, etc), that has been discontinued. Corporation will say tools are sold on their website at an affordable price, that too is a lie. If you work for supercuts you will be required to purchase tools to provide their technique of haircutting. You will be responsible to use your tools and charge their prices and they will make profit, not you! Salons are continually being opened with NO STAFF! People work alone for 10+ hours and they will blame you for low sales and no applicants.Advice to ManagementIn order to run a business you need to have someone who understands the business and people aspect. Bad decisions are being made with too many salons being opened in close proximity to each other. Don't look at the stylists and managers, look at the person making the decision to open these salons! How can you allow districts and a territory to perform the way that it does and not look at the leader?Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (0) Regis Corporation Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Regis Corporation 2017-07-23 22:52 PDT Showing 699 of 706 reviewsReset FiltersPrevious12345NextReviews > Regis Corporation RSS Feed</>Embed Regis Corporation Careers At Regis, our vision is to be the place for stylists to have successful and satisfying careers.
