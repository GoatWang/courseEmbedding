History[edit]
Founding and early history[edit]
Initially organized in 1929 as Masco Screw Products Company by Alex Manoogian in Livonia, Michigan. The company went public on the Detroit Stock Exchange in 1936.
Masco Screw Products Company produced machined automotive parts for the Detroit automotive companies.[8] The company’s first contract came in 1930 with the Hudson Motor Company valued at $7,000.00. In 1935, the company's sales reached $100,000 dollars. The following year Masco became a publicly traded company traded on the Detroit Stock Exchange. In 1942, Masco’s sales exceeded $1,000,000 dollars.[9]
Masco Screw Products grew into the Masco Corporation, a large corporate holding company for numerous acquisitions. Small, family-run businesses were bought out by Masco Corporation with cash and stock in the parent corporation. Between 1997 and 2002, Richard Manoogian, who succeeded his father as chief executive, acquired 42 companies valued at a total of $10 billion.
Alex Manoogian and his wife donated the Manoogian Mansion to the City of Detroit as the official residence of the mayor.
Masco in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s[edit]
In 1952, Manoogian began redesigning the single-handle washerless faucet.[9] The faucet he created was one of the very first single-handle hot/cold faucets; it is now known as Delta. Delta’s television advertisements were a first for any faucet, and made the product a successful seller. Masco went on to capture the mass market as sales moved from plumbing wholesalers to retail stores.[8] These steps of production and marketing of the Delta faucet began in 1954, and four years later Delta Faucet’s annual sales exceeded a million dollars.[9] This was the last year that the company would be referred to as Masco Screw Products Company.
Alex Manoogian, founder, acted as President and Chief Operating Officer (COO) from 1929 until 1967. In 1958 his son Richard joined the company. Richard, having spent nine years with the company, succeeded his father one year after the company moved to Taylor, Michigan. Alex died on July 10, 1996, the same year that his son Richard passed on his COO role to Ray Kennedy, allowing him to assume the position of Chief Executive Officer. In response to Kennedy’s death, Alan Barry was appointed as Masco’s President and COO on April 8, 2003.[9]
In 1961, Masco Screw Products Company changed its name to Masco Corporation. In 1967, they moved to their current corporate headquarters in Taylor, Michigan. For the first time, in 1969, Masco was listed on the New York Stock Exchange. In 1975, Masco first appeared on the Fortune 500, and Masco’s annual sales exceeded one billion dollars for the first time ever in 1984. One year later, Masco began manufacturing cabinets.[9]
Reorganizing in the 1980s and 1990s[edit]
In 1982 Masco’s earnings did not grow for the first time in 26 years. The next year however, “In 1983, earnings climbed again for this maker of faucets and diverse product mix of builders’ hardware, because of increased housing starts and a strong do-it-yourself market.”[10]
In 1985, Masco purchased the remaining outstanding stock of Flint & Walling, Inc (after purchasing 30% in 1971 and controlling interest in 1978).
In 1986, Masco started a home furnishings division by buying Henredon for $298 million and Drexel Heritage for $356 million. Other companies added to the division were Lexington Home Brands, Hickorycraft, Marge Carson, La Barge and Marbro in 1987, and fabric company Robert Allen/Ametex in 1988. In 1989, Universal Furniture, BenchCraft and Cal-Style were added in a $480 million deal, as well as Sunbury Textiles. The division added Berkline in 1994 and sold Marge Carson and Cal-Style in 1995.[11]
Masco reorganized its numerous companies; in 1988, the specialty products divisions of Masco Industries and Masco Corporation combined to form TriMas Corporation. Three years after this merger, TriMas was listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). The remainder of Masco Industries became Masco Tech Inc. and in 1993 was listed on the NYSE. At that point in time three different Masco Companies existed: Masco Corp., Masco Tech., and TriMas Corp.
Two years later, Masco entered the services business. TriMas and Masco Tech merged to form one company offering a wide array of products. Masco announced a 2 for 1 stock split, which was the ninth time the Company had split its shares since 1960 and was the 40th year in a row that its dividends were increased. This merger left two companies, Masco Tech. and Masco Corp.[citation needed]
In 1996, Masco sold most of its Home Furnishings Division to investors for $1.1 billion, creating a new company called LifeStyle Furnishings International.[11]
In 1999 Masco involved itself in the architectural coatings business, and the company’s annual sales topped five billion dollars for the first time.
1999 - present[edit]
In 1999, Masco Corp acquired Arrow Fastener Co., Inc., a hand tool company expanding its business in the hardware category.
In 2000, Masco Tech. was purchased by a Heartland Industrial Partners, a private equity firm and its name was changed to Metaldyne. Metaldyne is headquartered in Plymouth, Michigan. Masco also divested Flint & Walling, Inc this year to Zoeller Company.
In 2001, Masco Corp., or simply Masco, entered the windows business and had operating profits beyond a billion dollars.[9] Late in the year, Masco announced it would write down the value of its stake in LifeStyle Furnishings International by $460 million, since its equity share was only 15 percent, with the rest being debt. LifeStyle, the third largest furniture maker in the United States with $2 billion in sales, had sold Universal Furniture to Lacquer Craft.[11] Then Masco announced Furniture Brands International would buy Drexel Heritage, Henredon and Maitland-Smith for $275 million, with management of Berkline, BenchCraft and Sunbury taking over those companies. LifeStyle continued to own Lexington, Robert Allen/Ametex and the Beacon Hill showrooms.[12]
In 2003, Masco’s annual sales topped ten billion dollars and Masco increased its quarterly dividend for the 47th consecutive year. This ranked them in the top ten publicly owned companies achieving increased annual consecutive dividends.[9]
Throughout his time with the company, Richard Manoogian has achieved a net worth of approximately $750 million. He has been ranked as high as number five on the Forbes 400 list of richest manufacturers.[13] The Manoogian family is no longer involved in the management of the company.

About Zenith Products Corp. (ZPC)

Brief history

1940s  Zenith Products Corp. (ZPC) was founded just after World War II by the Roggio Brothers in the Philadelphia, Pa., area with a small metal fabricating business making window boxes and small cabinets. While the brothers were competitive in spirit between each other, they had little idea together they would go on to pioneer the bath storage and organization industry!
1950s  Zenith added capabilities with various metal presses for medicine cabinets, leading with the #2 and the #701L cabinet, famous for the sliding doors and the lit top, a unit still found in many homes today.
1960s  The first over the toilet bath spacesaver was made! It had tension poles to hold it to the ceiling. Check out pole lamps of the '60s for this iconic style!!
1970s  After the sudden death of Victor Roggio, Jim Aruffo led the company through the '70s in the Primos, Pa., headquarters. Plastic injection molding was added to our manufacturing capabilities with new style medicine cabinets. Then came wood body medicine cabinets, putting Zenith in the forefront with the most cabinet styles and choices. The '70s also marked the introduction of the first tension shower rod for the bath, spawning the entire industry of today's beautiful choices (see the Shower Rod tab above!). Wicker hampers were also a popular product in those days.
1980s  A tragic fire destroyed the entire factory in 1977, but Zenith was able to rebuild without missing a beat in Aston, Pa., thanks to an amazing team. Zenith went global in distribution and also in began to source some natural wicker items in Singapore and China.  Wood and metal spacesavers were introduced, initiating a whole new trend in bath furniture. 
1990s  As a division of Masco Corporation, Zenith relocated to our current corporate headquarters in New Castle, Del., overlooking the Delaware River, where today we are a major employer with over 700,000 square feet of U.S. manufacturing and warehousing space that includes state-of-the-art manufacturing equipment for wood, metal and plastic products. Under President Joe Mahon, Zenith purchased the commercial leader American Pride, and the designer fashion trend setter India Ink, both brands that have become key to the ZPC portfolio. Check out the Brands above!
2000s  ZPC  launched our beautiful New York showroom at 295 5th Ave. and many new innovative products. You will see them throughout the site, of course!
Today  Inspired and led by our CEO, Terry Douglas, and backed by our partners Charlesbank, Zenith is dedicated to the ongoing launching of new and innovative products via our empowered team -- always bringing you the best and most beneficial products for your home. 

 
A NOTE ON INNOVATION
We want to keep bringing you the solutions you need. We know ideas come from many places.  We have many in process and on the way for you.  We have designers designing.  We have researchers researching.  We like to think we know ... but maybe we don’t! Maybe we didn’t think of that thing you need! So please tell us. Use that Contact Us button or Facebook ... or whatever communication method is comfortable for you. Thanks!
