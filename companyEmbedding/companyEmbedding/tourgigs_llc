Perpetual Groove










									 
								

Perpetual Groove (or PGroove) was an American jam band that originated in 1997 in Savannah, Georgia. PGroove incorporated a blend of traditional Southern rock, funk, jazzy improvisation, indie rock and synth loops. The members have now relocated to Athens, Georgia and continue to work on solo and side projects. Contents 1 History, 2 Hiatus, 3 Amberland, 4 Lighting, 5 Discography, 6 References, 7 External links, History edit: The band's founding members include Brock Butler on guitar and lead vocals, Adam Perry on bass, Joe Stickney on drums and Brett Hinton on keyboards. The four met at Savannah College of Art and Design during their first year. After graduation, Stickney and Hinton both left the band. In 2001, drummer Albert Suttle and keyboardist Matt McDonald, both then active-duty members of the US Army, met Butler and Perry at a Savannah open-mic night and soon joined Perpetual Groove. After moving out of Savannah they needed a new town to claim (athens ga) the home of REM, WSP, B52's and many more acts over the years. The band first attracted attention at Jake's Roadhouse in Atlanta and JJ Cagney's on Savannah's Bay Street, which eventually relocated to River Street and later became The Live Wire Music Hall. their most notable show at J. J. Cagney's was a private party for the cast and crew of Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil with several other local bands, including The Eric Culberson Trio and a group called "Ciaxa" led by Joe and Eric Layden, who would later form the international jam/funk revue band The Looters. Actors Paul Hipp and Jack Thompson also performed with the bands. As crowds grew, they played larger venues such as Loco's, the Lucas Theater (New Year's Eve 2003), SCAD's Trustees Theater, the Armstrong Center at Armstrong Atlantic State University and The Roundhouse Railroad Museum. Since 2006 PGroove has played hometown benefit concerts for the Jolly Foundation, in honor of Butler's childhood friend Mary Ellen McKee. In 2006, PGroove relocated from Savannah to Athens, Georgia. The Georgia Theatre in Athens had become one of the band's main venues prior to the move. PGroove's first wider US tour was in 2003. Since then they have toured the US extensively, gaining fans on the West Coast and in the Northeast, with a growing fan-base in the South. They have also played in Japan, Amsterdam and aboard cruise ships at the Jam Cruise and Xingolati music festivals. John Hruby replaced McDonald on keyboards in June 2008, making the line-up of Butler, Perry, Suttle and Hruby from 5/25/08 until 01/01/2012. McDonald played his final official show with the band the Amberland festival on May 25, 2008. He left on amicable terms to focus on his family. McDonald continues to compose and produce music independently under the name which bore his initials M.S.M. but stood for "My Subversive Media" and still occasionally played with Brock Butler and Perpetual Groove. On June 16, 2008 the band announced that John Hruby, formerly of Ohio jamband Guest, was their new keyboard player. He is a long-time friend of the band and was part of side project, The Ruins with Butler, Perry, and drummer Travis Cline of Atlanta's Captain Soularcat. Hruby had previously worked as a producer at Atlanta's Zone Studios where worked on albums for hip-hop acts such as Ciara, Ludacris, David Banner and The Ying Yang Twins. In November 2011, Perpetual Groove announced that John Hruby would be leaving the band, and Matt McDonald would be returning to playing full time. The new, yet familiar lineup of Perpetual Groove was immediately dubbed as PG 2.012 by fans, referring to the "definitive lineup" of the band. Hiatus edit: On January 13th 2013 pgroove.com released a message from the band saying they would be taking a hiatus at the end of the tour. Albert, Matt and Adam will continue touring and recording under the new name Ghost Owl. Brock apologized to fans saying he needs time off to break bad habits and create new good ones. Brock stated that a reunion is not out of the question at some point but he cannot promise or give any time frame. The band performed its final show in front of a sold out audience at the Georgia Theatre in Athens, GA on April 5, 2013.

moe.










									 
								

moe. is the preeminent progressive rock band on the music scene today—a quintet of world class musicians, whose creative output equals that of their longevity. In a remarkable career that has touched three decades and produced a discography of 24 albums, the Sugar Hill Records recording artist of Al Schnier and Chuck Garvey on guitars and vocals, Rob Derhak on bass and vocals, Jim Loughlin on percussion and vibes, and Vinnie Amico on drums, continue to push the standard for performance art higher and further.
Whether touring around the globe, headlining music festivals, or sharing the stage with such diverse acts as the Allman Brothers, Dave Matthews Band, The Who, Robert Plant, Government Mule, or Blues Traveler, among many others, what keeps moe. at the forefront of the music scene is not only the energy and vitality of their music and songwriting, but the showmanship in which it is delivered. Their music is clever, melodic, refined, filled with “ferocious guitar riffs” and “intricate rhythms” (Relix); their performances are entertaining, mesmerizing, and epic.
From their humble, inconspicuous beginnings as a local bar band in Buffalo, NY, to headlining Radio City Music Hall on New Year’s Eve, moe.’s journey has been one of hard work, perseverance, and dedication. Critical acclaim and a solid national and international fan base has resulted in a dedicated following that grows each year. Rolling Stone magazine named Chuck and Al among the top twenty new “guitar gods,” The pair have been featured in Guitar World and Modern Guitar, Jim and Vinnie in Drum!, and Rob in Bass Player. The renowned guitar play between Al and Chuck has become the stuff of legend. The exceptional vibe and percussion work by Jim is brilliant. The understated bass play by Rob is masterful. The seamless, efficiency of Vinnie’s drumming is extraordinary. Together, the five create a musical synergy greater than the sum of their parts.
The news about moe. keeps getting better, too, in the studio and on tour. A new album, their second on Sugar Hill Records, is set for a 2014 release. It follows the critically acclaimed 2012 release, What Happened To The LA LAs, and the 2010 Smash Hits, Volume One—a rerecording of some of moe.’s most endearing classics. The band’s tour schedule is extensive, playing in venues, intimate and grand, from NYC to LA, San Fran to Atlanta, Chi Town to Bean Town, from Tokyo to Toronto, and across the Atlantic to Paris, Amsterdam, London, Hamburg, and Milano. Long a featured act at music festivals, they’ve performed and headlined at the likes of Bonnaroo, All Good, and High Sierra, in the US, and Fuji Rock Festival in Japan, and Burg Herzberg in Germany, to name a few; yet made time to promote and perform at their own festivals—Summer Camp, Snoe.down, and moe.down.
By all accounts, for this “legendary jam band,” as Rolling Stone described them, moe. represents rock and roll at its best. Welcome news for the moe. faithful and the band’s ever-expanding fan base. Even better news for the world of rock and roll, for moe. is just hitting their creative stride.

STS9










									 
								

Since forming in Atlanta over a decade ago, instrumental electronic rock band STS9 has experienced a meteoric rise to the forefront of the electronic-rock music scene. Recently ranked #25 among Pollstar's list of top-grossing touring acts for Summer 2010, STS9 averaged more than 4,200 tickets sold per city on a 25 city tour that boasted opening acts such as Ghostland Observatory, Thievery Corporation and Big Boi of Outkast. The band's tour culminated with two sold out performances at the legendary Red Rocks Amphitheatre in Morrison, Colorado, with 18,000 fans on-hand to experience the audio-visual force that is STS9.
STS9 truly does it all; from headlining stages at festivals such as Austin City Limits Festival, Lollapalooza and Electric Daisy Carnival, to selling out shows around the country in opera houses and amphitheatres alike, to performing with Jay-Z in arenas, to running their own record label, 1320 Records, to using their voice as a platform for change and raising significant amounts of money towards funding for their activism efforts (including $150,000 this past year to The Make it Right Foundation, paving the way to rebuild a house in the Lower 9th Ward of New Orleans).
Pushing boundaries is all in a day's work for STS9. In addition to the release of their latest studio album, Ad Explorata (the tenth in their full discography), and in keeping with XLR8R Magazine's notion that STS9 is "one of the country's most intriguing, innovative outfits around," June 2010 brought the release of Axe the Cables (1320 Records), a live album featuring STS9's first ever acoustic performance recorded in late 2009 at the Gates Opera House in Denver, Colorado.
These electronic virtuosos got back to their roots, performing on all acoustic instruments to absolutely rave reviews, and inspired additional "unplugged" events at various noteworthy stops across the country during their summer tour – including sold out performances at the Gramercy Theatre in New York, Atlanta's Tabernacle and the Old Town School of Folk Music in Chicago. STS9's self-owned record label, 1320 Records was founded on the principles of collaboration, cooperation, and community. The goal is clear: bring the music to the people in the most conscious, unique innovative and savvy ways possible. By doing so, the distance lessens between artists and fans, putting the power back in the hands of those that make music and those that live for it.

Umphrey's McGee










									 
								

After 17-plus years of performing more than 100 concerts annually, releasing eight studio albums and selling more than 3.5 million tracks online, Umphrey’s McGee might be forgiven if they chose to rest on their laurels. But then that wouldn’t be consistent with the work ethic demonstrated by the band, which consistently attempts to raise the bar, setting and achieving new goals since forming on the Notre Dame campus in South Bend, IN, in 1997. After releasing their eighth studio album, Similar Skin, the first for their own indie label, Nothing Too Fancy (N2F) Music (distributed by RED), the group continue to push the envelope and test the limits. Their brand-new studio album, The London Session, was a dream come true for the members having been recorded at the legendary Studio Two at historic Abbey Road. The stealth recording session yielded 10 tracks in a single day, proving once again, the prolific UM waits for no one. 
The original Umphrey’s McGee played a mix of originals and cover songs, waiting just eight months to release their debut album, the cheekily titled Greatest Hits Volume III. Their initial “proper” recording, Local Band Does OK, came out in 2002, followed shortly afterward by an appearance at the first-ever Bonnaroo in Tennessee, selling more albums than any other band on the bill. The 2007 double album, Live at the Murat, earned a four-star review in Rolling Stone and a Jammy for Best Live Album.
Despite attempts at categorizing UM, the band has devoted its craft to making their devoted followers feel as if they are part of something larger, through such technology-fueled innovations as fan-curated sets, the immersive high-end audio offering, “Headphones & Snowcones,” where the pristine sound of the live soundboard mix is piped wirelessly through high-end personal monitor systems and headphones, as well as making every live show since 2005 available via their live music portal UMLive.net. UM were also the first group to launch its own single-artist streaming service. 
Last year’s Similar Skin saw Umphrey’s McGee aim to strut their rock and progressive roots, with touchstones ranging from the Police and U2 (“The Linear”), the Beatles (“No Diablo”), Nirvana (“Loose Ends”) and Led Zeppelin (“Hindsight”) to Metallica, Soundgarden and Pantera (“Puppet String”) and even the symphonic rock of Gentle Giant, King Crimson, Yes or Genesis (the closing nine-minute live staple, “Bridgeless,” finally committed to record). “Every night, we have the opportunity to play whatever and however long we want,” says singer/guitarist Brendan Bayliss. Going into the studio, the challenge was to be as concise as possible, to trim all the fat we could.”
Recorded at IV Labs in Chicago between tour dates, Similar Skin was produced by Umphrey’s McGee themselves as “a coherent vision,” featuring plenty of dynamics and contrast, with many of the songs coming from their live repertoire. Thematically, Bayliss was inspired by his own fatherhood, tackling such issues as living in the moment (“The Linear”), his own mortality (“Cut the Cable,” “Hourglass”),
having children (“No Diablo”), the things that bring us together (“Similar Skin”), the question of whether there is a God (the Ryan Stasik slap-bass-driven “Puppet String”), sleep-walking (“Educated Guesses”), the art of storytelling and, according to Brendan, “unresolved psychological issues from the past” (“Loose Ends”).
Finding themselves in London last June for three shows at the Brooklyn Bowl, the idea of recording at Abbey Road was first proposed by Umphrey’s producer Manny Sanchez, a notion, as Bayliss recently told Rolling Stone that seemed as likely as “being asked to give a sermon at the Vatican.” 
“It wasn’t a goal,” he explains, “because it never seemed like a possibility.” But never to be bound by what seems possible, UM secured a coveted day at the world’s most famous recording studio and dove in headfirst. 
The first songs Umphrey’s McGee recorded that day were altered acoustic arrangements of “Cut the Cable” and “No Diablo,” from Similar Skin. “Something we could go in and get quickly,” according to Brendan.
“Bad Friday,” a song the band debuted live in Denver the previous New Year’s Eve and “Comma Later,” a song described by Rolling Stone as “smooth R&B menace with Jeff Beck-styled lead guitar” – was another recent original, recalling the Rock and Roll Hall of Famer’s Wired album was also recorded at Abbey Road under its cathedral-high ceiling.
“It makes one note just fold over and over again, coming back around,” marveled guitarist/ vocalist Jake Cinninger, who ventured into the original microphone closet, where he discovered all the Neumann and Telefunken mics The Beatles used still in pristine condition. “You can hear the echo in the room. The notes keep singing operatically.” 
“Glory,” “Eat” and “Out of Order” were three set-list regulars that had never been recorded for a studio release. With time still left on the clock, the band decided to cut The Beatles’ “(I Want You) She’s So Heavy,” for their own entertainment, but ultimately ending up including on the album. 
Twelve hours after first setting foot in Abbey Road Studios, just before midnight, Umphrey’s McGee left the historic room with their own new album, The London Session, what Rolling Stone dubs “a historical primer, an evolution story inside 51 minutes.”
“You’re looking at 17 years of change,” says Bayliss. “We managed to capture a good representation of our spectrum.” 
Umphrey’s McGee are more than just a rock band – through nearly two decades, they have proven to be on the cutting-edge of both music and technology, super-serving their fans through a community that stretches from the campus of Notre Dame to the hallowed halls of Abbey Road.
