Michael Werdann Promoted to Vice President of Americas Sales at NETGEAR
Networking Products Company Appoints Veteran to Focus on Growing Partner Relationships and Sales Momentum with Reseller Channels
SANTA CLARA, Calif. -- December 1, 2003 -- NETGEAR, Inc. (Nasdaq: NTGR), a worldwide provider of technologically advanced, branded networking products, today announced that Michael Werdann was promoted to vice president of Americas sales.  Mr. Werdann, previously NETGEAR's U.S. director of sales for e-commerce and direct market resellers (DMR), has been with the company for over five years.  His primary focus in his new role will be to grow the company's partner relationships and market share across all channels of the reseller community.

"Michael was an obvious choice to fill this position.  He has played an instrumental role in NETGEAR's strategic development and has helped us grow revenue in both the home and small- and medium business markets," said Ray Robidoux, NETGEAR's president.  "His efforts to strengthen our relationships with value-added reseller, e-commerce/catalogue, and retail partners alike will be of value as we expand our business-class product line for small- and medium-sized companies and develop additional innovative products for home customers."

"I am pleased to work even closer with NETGEAR's channel partners to increase sales and distribution activities in the Americas," said Michael Werdann.  "I am excited to put the programs in place together that will enrich our relationships further."

Mr. Werdann joined NETGEAR in October 1998 as a regional sales director.  Over the last five years, he has been an integral part of the team responsible for NETGEAR's leadership targeting the home and small and medium business markets.  Before joining NETGEAR, Mr. Werdann was with Iomega Corporation, a global leader in data storage.  During his three-year stint as U.S. sales director for value-added resellers (VARs), Iomega's corporate revenues grew over 800 percent.  Mr. Werdann previously held positions in sales and management with several nationally recognized VARs.

Mr. Werdann holds a bachelor's of science degree in communications from Seton Hall University in South Orange, New Jersey.   He will divide his time between NETGEAR's East Coast sales office in New Jersey and the corporate headquarters in California.
