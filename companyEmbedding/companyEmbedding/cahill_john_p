From 1997 to 2001, Cahill served as the Commissioner of the Department of Environmental Conservation where he led the State agency with 3,000 employees and a $500 million annual budget. His responsibilities included enhancing and protecting the State's vast natural resources and the successful implementation of the 1996 $1.75-billion Clean Water Air Bond Act, a landmark piece of legislation. Cahill also led the State's efforts to preserve over one million acres of open space.

He was responsible for negotiations with the state legislature, and was the Governor's point of contact with the White House, Congress and federal agencies.

Biography

John P. Cahill, Jr. focuses his practice on the representation of architects, engineers, surveyors, real estate agents and brokers and handles, in general, all matters related to construction issues. He also represents contractors and subcontractors. In addition to defending clients involved in disputes, Mr. Cahill assists clients in connection with risk management before the project begins. He is actively involved in assisting clients in contract negotiations with a mind not only towards an efficient project, but also towards protecting his clients in the event that there is a subsequent dispute. He frequently provides in-house seminars and risk management presentations to clients in order to help to avoid problems arising from projects and transactions. Mr. Cahill recognizes the fact that no matter how much risk management is undertaken, situations arise. His wide-ranging practice has involved covering disputes regarding the design and construction of residential foundations, the sale of homes, to the Northline Mall collapse and the 1987 explosion at the Hoechst Celanese Plant in Pampa, Texas. His client base ranges from individual architects and engineers to small, medium and large architectural and engineering firms. He has done work directly for these firms, in addition to representing clients through insurance carrier contacts. He also represents real estate agents and brokers. While a significant part of that representation has involved litigation, he has also been involved in resolving contract disputes and assisting and facilitating transactions that have had issues arise and have had closings at risk. In addition to handling litigated matters, Mr. Cahill has also represented licensed professionals in connection with state investigative matters and appeared before the Texas Board of Professional Engineers and the Texas Board of Architectural Examiners. He has assisted and represented clients in connection with investigations by the Texas Real Estate Commission and the Texas Workforce Commission.  Earlier in his practice, Mr. Cahill also represented a major surety company extensively in locate probate courts in guardianship and administration proceedings.
