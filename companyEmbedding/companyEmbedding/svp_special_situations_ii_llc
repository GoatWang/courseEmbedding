SVP Global Closes Special Situations Fund III Above Target

Dec 10, 2014, 09:00 ET
		  		  						
						 from   Strategic Value Partners, LLC 











 
















































 

 




















 


GREENWICH, Conn., Dec. 10, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- Strategic Value Partners LLC ("SVP Global"), a leading global investment firm focused on distressed and deep value opportunities, today announced the successful final closing of Strategic Value Special Situations Fund III ("SVSS III" or the "Fund"). The Fund raised a total of $1.31 billion in aggregate commitments, which brings the total for the strategy to $1.56 billion including $250 million of reserved capacity for a "fund-of-one" limited partner relationship. This is well above the $1 billion original target and is a step up from Fund II which had $918 million in commitments. 
SVSS III's focus will be the same as that of its predecessors, Special Situations Funds I and II, investing primarily in the distressed debt of middle-market companies and assets where SVP Global can exert meaningful influence in both financial restructurings and operational improvements. SVSS III is already 42% called, as it capitalizes on the increasing sales by European banks of distressed assets and loans on both sides of the Atlantic. While SVSS III has a global mandate, its investments are expected to be more focused on Europe than previous funds. SVP Global has invested more than $20 billion of capital since inception in 2001, including $9 billion in Europe, where it was among the earliest US firms in the distressed arena to establish a presence, opening in London in 2004 and Frankfurt in 2005. 
The investor base for SVSS III is diverse and international, including prominent investors from the U.S., Europe, Australia, the Middle East and Japan. Investors representing nearly 90% of the capital in the predecessor fund, SVSS II, have re-upped into SVSS III. 
Victor Khosla, Founder and Chief Investment Officer of SVP Global, said: "We are delighted to be announcing the successful close of SVSS III and are extremely grateful for the trust and support that we have received from investors, both existing and new. With more than 10 years of experience in Europe, we are well positioned to seize the opportunities being generated by increasing European bank disposals." 
About SVP Global SVP Global was founded in 2001 by Victor Khosla. With approximately $5 billion in assets under management, SVP Global is a leading global investment firm with offices in Greenwich (CT), London, Frankfurt and Tokyo, focused on distressed and deep value investments. SVP Global seeks to create value in these investments through its substantial industry, restructuring and operating experience. It employs more than 100 individuals, including an investment team of 34 professionals, over half of whom are based in Europe. Since its inception in 2001, SVP Global has invested in excess of $20 billion in over 300 transactions, and taken a leadership role in more than 100 restructurings globally, approximately half of which have been in Europe.

Form 10-K
A 10-K is a comprehensive summary report of a company's performance that must be submitted annually to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Typically, the 10-K contains much more detail than the annual report. It includes information such as company history, organizational structure, equity, holdings, earnings per share, subsidiaries, etc. 

The 10-K must be filed within 60 days (it used to be 90 days) after the end of the fiscal year.
Form 10-K/A
Amended Form 10-K
Form 10-Q
The SEC form 10-Q is a comprehensive report of a company's performance that must be submitted quarterly by all public companies to the Securities and Exchange Commission. In the 10-Q, firms are required to disclose relevant information regarding their financial position. The form must be submitted on time, and the information should be available to all interested parties. 

The 10-Q is due 35 days (it used to be 45 days) after each of the first three fiscal quarters. There is no filing after the fourth quarter because that is when the 10-K is filed.
Form 10-Q/A
Amended Form 10-Q
Form 3
A document that must be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) by an insider affiliated with a public company's operation or by any investor owning 10% or more of the company's outstanding shares

This document must be filed with the SEC no later than 10 days after an insider becomes affiliated with a company, and it must be filed for each company in which a person is an insider, regardless of whether or not the insider has an equity position in the company at that time.
Form 3/A
Amended Form 3
Form 4
A Form 4 is a document that must be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) whenever there is a material change in the holdings of company insiders. Insiders required to submit a Form 4 include directors and officers of the company as well as any shareholders owning 10% or more of the company's outstanding stock.

This two-page document covers any buy-and-sell orders on the open market as well as the exercise of company stock options. A Form 4 is mandatory within two business days starting from the end of the day the material transaction occurred. This filing is related to Form 3 and the Form 5, which also cover changes to the company insider holdings.
Form 4/A
Amended Form 4
Form 5
The annual statement of beneficial ownership of securities.
Form 5/A
Amended Form 5
Form 8-K
An 8-K is a report of unscheduled material events or corporate changes at a company that could be of importance to the shareholders or the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

Examples of events reported on an 8-K include acquisition, bankruptcy, resignation of directors, or a change in the fiscal year. Also known as Form 8k.
Form D
A filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) required for companies that are selling securities in reliance on a Regulation D exemption or Section 4(6) exemption provisions. 

Form D is a brief notice of a company's executive officers and stock promoters, in lieu of the regular reports required when no exemption under Regulation D exists. 

Form D must be filed no later than 15 days after the first sale of securities.

Form D is also known as the Notice of Sale of Securities and is a requirement under Regulation D, Section 4(6) and/or the Uniform Limited Offering Exemption of the Securities Exchange Act of 1933. 

This act, often referred to as the "truth in securities" law, requires that these registration forms, providing essential facts, are filed to disclose important information upon registration of a company's securities. This helps the SEC achieve the objectives of this act - requiring investors to receive significant information regarding securities offered and prohibiting fraud in the sale of the offered securities.
Form D/A
Amended Form D
Form DEF 14A
A filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that must be filed by or on behalf of a registrant when a shareholder vote is required. SEC Form DEF 14A is most commonly used in conjunction with an annual meeting proxy. The form should provide security holders with sufficient information to allow them to make an informed vote at an upcoming security holders' meeting or to authorize a proxy to vote on their behalf. It includes information about the date, time and place of the meeting of security holders; revocability of proxy; dissenter's right of appraisal; persons making the solicitation; direct or indirect interest of certain persons in matters to be acted upon; modification or exchange of securities; financial statements; voting procedures; and other details. 

All other filed by non-management definitive proxy statements - typically an annual meeting proxy.

Form DEF 14A, which is also known as "definitive proxy statement", is required under Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. This form is filed with the SEC when a definitive proxy statement is given to shareholders and helps the SEC ensure that shareholders' rights are upheld.
Form S-1
The SEC form S-1 is the initial registration form for new securities required by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for public companies. Any security that meets the criteria must have an S-1 filing before shares can be listed on a national exchange. 

Form S-1 requires companies to provide information on the planned use of capital proceeds, detail the current business model and competition, as well provide a a brief prospectus of the planned security itself, offering price methodology, and any dilution that will occur to other listed securities. The SEC also requires the disclosure of any material business dealings between the company and its directors and outside counsel. 

Form S-1 is also known as the "Registration Statement Under the Securities Exchange Act of 1933". 

Investors can view S-1 filings online to perform due diligence on new offerings prior to their issue. The form is sometimes amended as material information changes or general market conditions cause a delay in the offering. 

The Securities Exchange Act of 1933, often referred to as the "truth in securities" law, requires that these registration forms are filed to disclose important information upon registration of a company's securities. This helps the SEC achieve the objectives of this act, which is requiring investors to receive significant information regarding securities offered, and to prohibit fraud in the sale of the offered securities. 

A less rigid registration form is the S-3, which is for companies that don't have the same ongoing reporting requirements.

Press Release: SVPGlobal Closes Special Situations Fund III


Greenwich (CT), December 10, 2014 – Strategic Value Partners LLC (“SVP Global”), a leading global investment firm focused on distressed and deep value opportunities, today announced the successful final closing of Strategic Value Special Situations Fund III (“SVSS III” or the “Fund”). The Fund raised a total of $1.31 billion in aggregate commitments, which brings the total for the strategy to $1.56 billion including $250 million of reserved capacity for a “fund-of-one” limited partner relationship.  This is well above the $1 billion original target and is a step up from Fund II which had $918 million in commitments.
SVSS III’s focus will be the same as that of its predecessors, Special Situations Funds I and II, investing primarily in the distressed debt of middle-market companies and assets where SVP Global can exert meaningful influence in both financial restructurings and operational improvements. SVSS III is already 42% called, as it capitalizes on the increasing sales by European banks of distressed assets and loans on both sides of the Atlantic.  While SVSS III has a global mandate, its investments are expected to be more focused on Europe than previous funds.  SVP Global has invested more than $20 billion of capital since inception in 2001, including $9 billion in Europe, where it was among the earliest US firms in the distressed arena to establish a presence, opening in London in 2004 and Frankfurt in 2005.
The investor base for SVSS III is diverse and international, including prominent investors from the U.S., Europe, Australia, the Middle East and Japan.  Investors representing nearly 90% of the capital in the predecessor fund, SVSS II, have re-upped into SVSS III.
Victor Khosla, Founder and Chief Investment Officer of SVP Global, said: “We are delighted to be announcing the successful close of SVSS III and are extremely grateful for the trust and support that we have received from investors, both existing and new. With more than 10 years of experience in Europe, we are well positioned to seize the opportunities being generated by increasing European bank disposals.”
About SVP Global

Since its inception in 2001, SVP Global has invested in excess of $20 billion in over 300 transactions, and taken a leadership role in more than 100 restructurings globally, approximately half of which have been in Europe.

Investment firm SVP Global has closed its third special situations fund on $1.3 billion, sweeping past its original $1 billion target.
The fund’s LP base includes unnamed investors from the U.S., Europe, Australia, the Middle East and Japan. Nearly 90 percent of the investors backed SVP Global’s previous funds.
As in the case of its predecessors, Strategic Value Special Situations Fund III will focus on middle-market distressed debt. However, unlike the firm’s previous funds, the pool is expected to invest more in Europe.
SVP Global’s Strategic Value Special Situations Fund II closed at $918 million in 2012, beating its $600 million target. No information was available about its returns.
