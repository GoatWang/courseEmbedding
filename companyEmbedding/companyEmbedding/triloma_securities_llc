BEYOND BUSINESS















At Triloma, we are doing business to change lives.™ Whether it’s the lives of our associates or the life of a child half-way across the world, we aspire for our business to have a positive impact on everyone we come in contact with. Our mission to change lives drives our relationship-driven culture and puts a high priority on operating with integrity in all aspects of our business.
                  















                    One of the ways we’re living out this mission is by supporting the non-profit organization, Beauty for Ashes Uganda. Two of our founding partners serve on its board of directors, and many of our associates and business partners are committing their time and financial support as well.
                  












                    Beauty for Ashes Uganda educates and empowers oppressed single mothers and widows in the Teso region of Uganda so they can break the poverty cycle and achieve long-term financial sustainability for their families. In Ugandan society, single mothers and widows have almost no legal rights or social standing and, therefore, very limited means of providing for their children. Beauty for Ashes Uganda works directly with them in their villages to help form cooperatives of about 30 women, providing them with practical resources for self-sufficiency (such as cows, chickens and mosquito nets) as well as training in literacy, finance, micro-agriculture, hygiene and more. Additionally, because education is one of the primary means of breaking the poverty cycle, their children receive scholarships to attend secondary and postsecondary school. Thanks to Triloma’s partnership with Beauty for Ashes Uganda, more than 7,000 people in Uganda are being directly impacted, and that number grows daily.
                  














                    To learn more about Beauty for Ashes Uganda or how you can join Triloma in its support of this amazing organization, please contact Brandi Lea at brandi@beautyforashesuganda.org or 719-322-2273, or click here to visit the website.

ORLANDO, Fla. and WASHINGTON, Feb. 23, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Triloma Financial Group ("Triloma") and EIG Global Energy Partners ("EIG") today announced the formation of Triloma EIG Global Energy Fund (the "Fund"), an unlisted investment company that will invest primarily in a global portfolio of privately originated energy company and project debt. The Fund will be managed by Triloma Energy Advisors and EIG Credit Management Company, and will seek to raise capital with the issuance of common stock through a best effort, continuous public offering with Triloma Securities, member FINRA/SIPC, serving as the managing dealer. 
"Our creation of this Fund with EIG represents a significant milestone in Triloma's strategy of identifying unique alternative investment opportunities and creating longstanding joint ventures with experienced and proven investment partners," said Larry Goff, Chief Executive Officer of Triloma Securities. "Partnering with EIG allows us to provide individual investors with unparalleled access to energy investment opportunities with one of the oldest and preeminent energy investors in the world."
"The energy sector is a voracious consumer of capital and is tailor-made for specialists like EIG that can provide privately-negotiated financial solutions," said R. Blair Thomas, Chief Executive Officer of EIG. "Current market volatility only serves to increase the opportunity set as generalists exit the space and companies find themselves with funding gaps caused by lower commodity prices and commercial banks pulling back due to regulatory and market pressure. Our 33-years of experience in this space give us confidence that now is an attractive time to create the Fund to take advantage of current market dynamics. Triloma's team has a strong distribution and asset management platform and extensive experience with publicly registered investment programs, and will allow us to attract a broader range of investors to our platform." 
Barry Goff, Managing Director of Triloma, said: "We believe energy companies and projects are underserved by traditional sources of financing. In order to take full advantage of the current market environment, it is essential to have experience investing across many commodity cycles and the in-house technical capabilities necessary to successfully navigate the complexities in the energy sector. EIG's experience and expertise will allow us to take advantage of investment opportunities throughout the energy value chain on a global basis."
About Triloma EIG Global Energy FundTriloma EIG Global Energy Fund (the "Fund") is an unlisted investment company that will primarily invest in a global portfolio of privately originated energy company and project debt. Its investment objective will be to provide shareholders with current income, capital preservation and, to a lesser extent, long term capital appreciation. The Fund will be managed by Triloma Energy Advisors and EIG Credit Management Company, and will offer individuals an opportunity to invest in U.S. and non-U.S. energy companies and projects in many instances alongside institutional investors. Investments will be made through a series of feeder funds each of which will invest substantially all of the net proceeds its raises from its public offering in the Fund. 
About TrilomaTriloma Financial Group is a leading private investment management firm providing individuals with unique alternative investment opportunities. Its business is organized primarily into investment management and capital markets activities. Triloma manages and sponsors a group of private and publicly-offered investment programs focused on private equity, real estate and energy investments.

BEYOND BUSINESS















At Triloma, we are doing business to change lives.™ Whether it’s the lives of our associates or the life of a child half-way across the world, we aspire for our business to have a positive impact on everyone we come in contact with. Our mission to change lives drives our relationship-driven culture and puts a high priority on operating with integrity in all aspects of our business.
                  















                    One of the ways we’re living out this mission is by supporting the non-profit organization, Beauty for Ashes Uganda. Two of our founding partners serve on its board of directors, and many of our associates and business partners are committing their time and financial support as well.
                  












                    Beauty for Ashes Uganda educates and empowers oppressed single mothers and widows in the Teso region of Uganda so they can break the poverty cycle and achieve long-term financial sustainability for their families. In Ugandan society, single mothers and widows have almost no legal rights or social standing and, therefore, very limited means of providing for their children. Beauty for Ashes Uganda works directly with them in their villages to help form cooperatives of about 30 women, providing them with practical resources for self-sufficiency (such as cows, chickens and mosquito nets) as well as training in literacy, finance, micro-agriculture, hygiene and more. Additionally, because education is one of the primary means of breaking the poverty cycle, their children receive scholarships to attend secondary and postsecondary school. Thanks to Triloma’s partnership with Beauty for Ashes Uganda, more than 7,000 people in Uganda are being directly impacted, and that number grows daily.
                  














                    To learn more about Beauty for Ashes Uganda or how you can join Triloma in its support of this amazing organization, please contact Brandi Lea at brandi@beautyforashesuganda.org or 719-322-2273, or click here to visit the website.

                    Triloma Continues Growth, Signs Lease for Additional Office Space
                




                  ORLANDO, Fla. (March 15, 2017) – Triloma, a Winter Park, Florida-based private investment management firm, announced today it has leased an additional 9,500 square feet of space in its current downtown Winter Park office building, bringing its total office space to over 17,000 square feet.
                


                    “Having this additional space available will allow us to accommodate our growing team,” explained managing director, Mike Wood. “More importantly, it affirms our commitment to Winter Park, and we’re excited for what the future holds for us here.”
                  

                    To accommodate its rapidly growing team, Triloma has expanded its offices three times since initially leasing 1,763 square feet of space on Park Avenue in late 2013. One of the ways the firm seeks to promote a healthy work/life balance for its associates is by keeping daily commutes as short as possible, which ultimately led Triloma to its current building just a block away on New York Avenue.
                  

                    Triloma now has 58 associates, each averaging 16 years of investment industry experience. The firm has two public investment offerings currently available, and will continue to offer a series of private investment opportunities this year. Additionally, Triloma intends to introduce new products for 2017 in response to the ever-changing investment and regulatory environments.
                  

                    This announcement comes on the heels of Triloma reporting more than $200 million in equity capital raised in 2016, as well as plans for continued growth and increased involvement in industry advocacy in 2017.

We continue to make it our priority as a firm to improve the lives of our investors, partners and associates, and we believe our success to be a direct result of this focus.”
                  

                    In 2017, the firm plans to continue to expand its selling syndicate for the Triloma EIG Energy Income Funds, add additional talent to its operations teams, and further diversify its platform of products.
                  

                    Triloma also will increase its involvement in the Investment Program Association (IPA), the financial service industry’s leading education and advocacy body for Direct Investment programs. The IPA has announced the appointment of Triloma managing director Nathan Headrick as chair-elect of the board, assuming the position of chair in 2018.

Each of the three new hires has been carefully selected to support the anticipated growth in assets for Triloma EIG Global Energy Fund and Triloma EIG Global Energy Term Fund I, which are advised by Triloma Energy Advisors. Collectively, they bring decades of experience to the burgeoning investment management company.
Elizabeth Strouse, who will serve as CFO of Triloma Energy Advisors, has extensive accounting, administration and financial reporting experience in the investment management industry. Prior to joining Triloma, Ms. Strouse served as managing director of State Street Corp, and was primarily responsible for helping the company’s key asset management clients navigate the complex regulatory environment. From 2009 to 2014, Ms. Strouse served as chief accounting officer of Transamerica Asset Management providing oversight for approximately $70 billion of assets under management within approximately 190 registered funds, including serving as the principal financial officer, chairman of the valuation committee, and member of various risk committees. In addition to her role as CFO of Triloma Energy Advisors, Ms. Strouse was appointed CFO of Triloma EIG Global Energy Fund and Triloma EIG Global Energy Term Fund I.
Elizabeth Ortiz brings broad investment company accounting and financial reporting experience to her position as fund controller of Triloma Energy Advisors. In her new role, Ms. Ortiz will provide accounting and administration services to the Triloma EIG Global Energy Funds. Prior to joining Triloma, Ms. Ortiz spent over 14 years at BNY Mellon, and was most recently responsible for the preparation of investment company financial statements for several clients (Voya, CBRE, DBX, CurrencyShares, among others) including regulatory SEC filings. Her responsibilities at BNY Mellon included a variety of roles across the mutual fund accounting division, with experience managing internal senior staff accountants and communicating with third-party clients or custodians.
Minerva Rodriguez will serve as fund accounting manager of Triloma Energy Advisors, supporting the accounting and administration of the Triloma EIG Global Energy Funds. Ms. Rodriguez is a seasoned accounting professional with over 20 years of experience in financial management. Prior to joining Triloma, Ms. Rodriguez spent 14 years at BNY Mellon, and was most recently responsible for all aspects of fund accounting, daily processing, valuation of net assets, preparation of regulatory SEC filings, and reporting of domestic and global equity securities, fixed income securities, term loans, derivatives and complex financial instruments.
“We are thrilled to welcome Liz, Elizabeth and Minerva to our growing team,” said Deryck Harmer, president and CEO of Triloma Energy Advisors. “Triloma is focused on providing best-in-class support and service, and the collective experience they bring to our group is a terrific asset as we ramp up investment operations for the energy funds.”
The announcement of the three new hires comes one month after Triloma revealed that it experienced one of the quickest sponsor launches in the alternative investment industry to-date, raising more than $117 million in equity in 12 offerings in just over eight months.

                    Triloma Announces 2015 Growth Activity
                




Investment firm exceeds equity raising goals in its first year of operations

                  ORLANDO, Fla. (Feb. 17, 2016) – Triloma Securities (“Triloma”) announced today the results of its syndication activity in 2015. The firm, which commenced broker-dealer operations on April 23, 2015, surpassed its equity raising goals for the year in just over eight months.
                


                    In 2015, Triloma raised more than $117 million in equity in 12 offerings, marking one of the quickest sponsor launches in the alternative investment industry to-date. As part of its capital raising efforts, Triloma signed 57 selling agreements with 23
                    different retail broker-dealer firms throughout the year, with investment offerings in energy, seniors housing and land development.
                  

                    “When we founded Triloma, our goal was to create a company where we could improve the lives of our investors, partners and associates,” said Larry Goff, chief executive officer of Triloma Securities. “As we look back at an extraordinary first year for
                    our firm, we have exceeded that goal. We are also proud to have three outstanding investment partners, and to have added to our team some of the brightest and most experienced professionals in our industry.”
                  

                    In the last year, Triloma and its affiliate, Triloma Financial Group, have grown from 9 to 46 associates. These associates include industry veterans who average 15 years of experience in the investment industry. To accommodate this strategic
                    growth, the company relocated to a larger office in Winter Park, Florida.
                  

                    Plans for continued growth in 2016 are well underway, as Triloma prepares to expand its presence in the broker-dealer community.
