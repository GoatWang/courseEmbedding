 GGC Approves Distribution of $0.14/bushel, Builds Reserve			 June 26, 2017/in News /by Golden GrowersRecently, the ProGold Board of Governors voted to resume monthly distributions to its members.  The Golden Growers Board is now able to consider future obligations against revenue as they plan for member distributions.
On June 15th, the Golden Growers Board of Directors approved a distribution of $0.14/bushel or $2,168,667 to members of record as of June 1, 2017. This distribution is to be issued no later than June 30th. Total 2016 allocated income was $7,366,209. Along with the February distribution, a total of $4,383,806 of 2016 equity credit has been retired.
Your Golden Growers Board believes it is important to build a reserve during the course of this lease for several reasons. If Cargill chooses to exercise its option to purchase 50% interest in ProGold from American Crystal Sugar Company, Golden Growers will be obligated to buy American Crystal’s remaining 1% in ProGold. In addition, there are likely to be capital expenditures during the lease that are the obligation of ProGold while lease income declines. When capital exenditures occur, distributions from ProGold will be reduced. By building a reserve, Golden Growers Cooperative will be able to moderate the impact of those capital expenditures and declining lease revenue.
The distribution authorized by the Board will result in a remaining equity credit balance for 2016 of $2,982,403.
With this payment, Golden Growers has issued payments to members totaling $94,043,859. This represents 174% of members’ original equity investment in the ProGold plant.

Golden Growers2017-06-26 08:00:462017-06-19 22:00:05GGC Approves Distribution of $0.14/bushel, Builds Reserve Revised US/Mexico Sugar Sugar Trade Suspension Agreement Reached – Duties/Retaliation Avoided, for now			 June 8, 2017/in News /by Golden GrowersIn late April, after the confirmation of US Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Purdue, expectations for a deal to revise terms of the 2014 Anti-dumping and Countervailing Duty Suspension Agreements were circulating around Washington, D.C. The following week, the U.S. Department of Commerce issued an ultimatum that the Department would reinstate duties on sugar imports from Mexico unless an agreement is reached by June 5th. In response Mexico’s sugar industry submitted a request to Mexico’s Economy Ministry asking for an investigation into suspected dumping of U.S. HFCS syrup into Mexico. On June 6th, an agreement (in principle) was reached that avoided placement of 80% duties on Mexican sugar and immediate retaliation against HFCS by the Mexican Government.  The Mexican sugar industry has not withdrawn their request for a probe of HFCS dumping.

Golden Growers2017-06-08 17:55:512017-06-08 20:29:48Revised US/Mexico Sugar Sugar Trade Suspension Agreement Reached - Duties/Retaliation Avoided, for now Cargill signs five year lease with ProGold			 April 10, 2017/in News /by Golden GrowersProGold announced on Monday, April 10th that a new lease agreement has been reached with Cargill, Inc. to be effective as of January 1, 2018. The prior lease will remain in effect until then.
While prior leases were 10 years in length, this lease is a five-year commitment with an optional 6th year.
Base rent for the lease is as follows:

2018-9 – $17,000,000
2020 – $16,000,000
2021-2 – $15,500,000
2023 – $14,000,000 (optional 6th year)

In order to maintain the condition of the plant, ProGold agreed to fund a minimum of $750,000 for infrastructure maintenance each year of the lease.
ProGold may also be required to pay additional sums in order to make certain capital improvements in a manner similar to how the cooling tower replacement occurred in 2015.
The agreement includes an option for Cargill to purchase 50% interest in ProGold from American Crystal Sugar Company (ACSC). If Cargill exercises the option, GGC would purchase ACSC’s remaining 1%, to become a 50% owner of ProGold. GGC and Cargill have agreed to a general framework for a future partnership, with a detailed partnership agreement to be completed prior to Cargill exercising its option.
“The evolution of the corn wet milling industry was an important aspect of our discussions,” stated GGC Chairman Mark Harless. “We believe this lease is a reasonable bargain for the near term. It also holds out a possibility of a long term future for the ProGold plant.”

Golden Growers2017-04-10 15:00:052017-04-10 19:34:36Cargill signs five year lease with ProGold 2016 Member Survey Results			 April 7, 2017/in News /by Golden GrowersIn his Executive Vice President’s report, Scott Stofferahn presented detailed results from last year’s member survey.
Stofferahn complimented GGC members for their 80% response rate.  “We used best practices to obtain a response, but noboey would have predicted that we would have more than an 80% response rate! This is considered phenomenal for a mail in survey.”
Over the course of 20 years, GGC anticipated changes in member farming status.  At the time the cooperative was organized, every member had to be a producer.  That requirement was removed in 2009, yet the response shows that 64% of members continue to be producers.  Another 12% indicated that htey are retired, but ‘associated’ with a farming operation.  Generally these are people who, while retired, maintain an active relationship with their family members who are operating the farm.  “For purposes of analyzing data, we grouped producers with these ‘retired, but associated’ members.”  Another 24% said that they were retired or not farming with no association with a farming operation.

Electronic Delivery – roughly 2/3 of members are not interested in electronic delivery of newsletters or payments.

Investing Results:
When asked about how GGC might pay for value added processing at the ProGold plant, the majority recommended allowing individual members the opportunity to invest.  46% favored using ProGold lease income for this purpose.

While the majority of members (56%) were not interested in value added processing unrelated to the ProGold plant, those who did show interest (46%) had a preference for soybean crushing.
79% of Golden Growers members consider themselves to be ‘accredited investors’, a term defined by the SEC that measures income and assets to decide if someone is a sophisticated investor.
Delivery Results:
GGC members who meet their annual delivery requirement through direct deliveries to the plant (Method A Pool) also deliver an additional 13.5 million bushels on an annual basis.  This means that nearly 2/3 of the annual grind comes from Golden Growers members.
Among Method B pool participants, over 50% produce corn while 33% of Method B respondents said they are not crop producers.
Producer Only Responses:
Compared to twenty years ago, our members are planting more corn and soybeans.  Small grains and sunflowers are not nearly as comon within our membership as they were.

57% of Producers have a history of producing specialty crops with edible beans topping the list.
21% of Producers have raised non-GM corn or soybeans for specialty markets.
69% of producers are willing to produce crops for specialty markets.
48% said they were not interested in producing Non-GM corn.  Yet 59% would consider producing Non-GM corn if an incentive was offered and 31% indicated that producing Non-GM corn would align with a crop rotation strategy.
90% of producers indicated that they would produce for niche markets that would benefit the long-term stability of the ProGold plant. “We believe this answer shows an underlying commitment by our producers for a successful enterprise,” said Stofferahn.

Golden Growers2017-04-07 20:55:252017-04-07 20:55:252016 Member Survey Results NDSU Files Corn Wet Milling Market and Valuation Report			 April 7, 2017/in News /by Golden GrowersDr. David Ripplinger, Assistant Professor at NDSU’s Department of Agribusiness & Applied Economics presented the recently filed ‘Corn Wet Mill Marketing Analysis and Valuation’ report at the Golden Growers annual meeting held on March 23rd.
Dr. Ripplinger conducted a SWAT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) analysis for corn wet milling in our region.  His research highlighted  decreased per-capital HFCS consumption and a shift to alternative sweeteners as threats to the HFCS industry.   Increased world consumption, new products, and the renewable fuels standard were considered strengths.
‘Three factors impacting perception and consumption of HFCS stand out,’ writes Ripplinger: 1) a broad popular conception that HFCS is unhealthy and leads to obesity; 2) a large number of consumers avoid products containing genetically modified products; and 3) consumption of sweetened soft drinks has tracked the fall of HFCS consumption in the United States.
Strengths for the region include a competitive cost advantage for corn when compared to the corn belt.  In addition, Golden Growers has the advantage of being able to control the supply of corn to the plant.  Yet the Cooperative does not have the history or experience in corn mill operations, technology, or food ingredients.
In terms of strategies, the report recommends avoiding products with contradictory attributes (ex: non-GM HFCS) and to identify and pursue natural hedges against the decline of HFCS use (advanced biofuels, reduced calorie sweeteners derived from corn, etc.)
The next step is to build upon that research using Value Added Producer Grant funding obtained from USDA’s Rural Development. Kyle Althoff of Equinox will lead that project in the coming months.
The full NDSU report is available for review and download here (Final Report).

Golden Growers2017-03-06 19:40:432017-03-06 19:40:43Board Election 2017 (Vacancy in SE District) Golden Growers Board Approves February Distribution			 March 6, 2017/in News /by Golden GrowersOn Friday, February 3, 2017, the Golden Growers Board of Directors allocated income for the 2016 tax year and approved a distribution of $.143/bushel delivered in 2016.
Traditionally, the Board has issued distributions near $0.20/bushel.  This year, however, the Board issued a distribution equal to 30% of allocated income, the amount required to be distributed according to our bylaws.
In January, the ProGold Board of Governors voted to suspend automatic distributions to its partners until such time as a final decision has been made for the use of the plant starting on January 1, 2018.  A new lease has not yet been finalized and the ProGold Board of Governors believed it would be prudent to conserve cash if it became necessary to implement alternative plans.
Because of this ProGold decision, the Golden Growers Board decided to limit the February distribution to the minimum required by our bylaws.  As this situation evolves, we will continue to keep you informed.

Golden Growers Cooperative
Golden Growers Cooperative (GGC) was formed in 1994 to create a value-added processing opportunity for corn growers in the Dakotas and Minnesota, and currently has about 1,600 members. GGC owns 49% of ProGold LLC in partnership with American Crystal Sugar Company, and ProGold owns a corn wet-milling plant near Wahpeton, North Dakota. The ProGold plant makes high fructose corn sweeteners, corn gluten feed and corn gluten meal. The plant also separates corn germ which is sold for production of corn oil. Since, 1997, the ProGold plant has been leased to Cargill, Inc., which operates the plant and markets all of its products. The current lease agreement extends to December 31, 2017.
In September, 2009, the co-op was re-organized under Minnesota’s statute 308B, which allows GGC to function as a cooperative but be taxed as a limited liability partnership. At that time, GGC opened its membership to residents of the 50 states and non-corn producers. All members do, however, have an annual corn delivery obligation that can be met by actual corn deliveries or by appointing GGC as its agent to arrange for delivery of their commitment. Members are required to own a minimum of 4,000 Units, and each member’s corn commitment is one bushel per Unit of ownership.
Persons interested in learning more about acquiring GGC Units should contact FNC Ag Stock, LLC at (701)780-2828 or (855)827-7391, and ask for Mr. Jayson Menke, or email to jmenke@fncagstock.com.

 Golden Growers Cooperative	
Business Description








Golden Growers Cooperative is a value-added agricultural cooperative association 
  owned by 1,556 members primarily from Minnesota, North Dakota and South Dakota, 
  all of whom deliver corn to the Cooperative for processing into a value-added 
  product. Golden Growers Cooperative was originally formed in 1994 as a North 
  Dakota agricultural cooperative. On September 1, 2009, by way of a series of 
  mergers, the Cooperative changed its domicile and form of entity from a North 
  Dakota cooperative to a Minnesota cooperative association governed under Minnesota 
  Statutes Chapter 308B. A Minnesota cooperative association formed under Minnesota 
  Statutes 308B operates as a cooperative for state law purposes, but is taxed 
  as a partnership under Subchapter K of the Internal Revenue Code for tax purposes.
The Cooperative is in the business of providing value to our members by facilitating 
  their delivery of corn to the corn wet-milling facility owned by ProGold. We 
  accomplish our business on behalf of our members not through the ownership of 
  assets such as a plant and equipment but through our contract relationships 
  with all of the parties involved in the ownership and operation of the facility. 
  From an income production perspective our membership interest in ProGold is 
  our primary asset that, in addition to giving the Cooperative the right to receive 
  distributions from ProGold, also provides our members with additional value 
  for the delivery of their corn for processing. Annually the Cooperative is required 
  to deliver approximately 15,490,480 bushels of corn to Cargill for processing 
  at the ProGold facility. We meet this delivery obligation by having our members 
  deliver their corn to the ProGold facility.

  Since November 1997, ProGold has leased its corn wet-milling facility to Cargill. 
  Annually, Cargill pays ProGold rent equal to $21,500,000. Throughout the term 
  of the lease between Cargill and ProGold, our members, on the Cooperative’s 
  behalf, have delivered corn to the facility for processing into high fructose 
  corn syrup and related co-products. It is our ownership interest in ProGold 
  that creates a value-added relationship between our growers and the facility. 
  Notwithstanding this cooperative arrangement, Cargill is an integral part of 
  our financial success. Separate from the lease, Cargill also provides the Cooperative 
  services that allow us to facilitate corn delivery at little or no expense. 
  In addition, the lease payments Cargill makes to ProGold that are in turn distributed 
  to the Cooperative provide us with the cash to make distributions to our members. 
  If, however, at some time in the future ProGold stopped leasing its plant to 
  Cargill it is anticipated that the plant would continue operations, managed 
  either by ProGold or another party. It is expected that the plant would continue 
  to provide a market for the corn produced by our members whether the plant is 
  leased in the future by Cargill or another party or operated by ProGold.

  Any person residing in the United States can own our Units as long as that person 
  delivers or provides for the delivery of corn for processing at the ProGold 
  facility. Ownership of our Units requires our members to deliver corn to the 
  Cooperative in proportion to the number of Units each member holds. Currently 
  15,490,480 Units are issued and outstanding. The Cooperative’s income 
  and losses are allocated to our members based on the volume of corn a member 
  delivers or has delivered. Subject to certain limitations, as long as a member 
  patronizes the Cooperative by delivering corn equal to the number of Units held 
  by the member, the member will be allocated a corresponding portion of our income 
  (or loss). In this way, we operate on a cooperative basis.

  To hold our Units a member is required to execute a Uniform Member Agreement 
  that obligates the member to deliver corn to us and an Annual Delivery Agreement 
  by which each member annually elects the member’s method to deliver corn 
  — either Method A or Method B, or a combination of both. Under Method 
  A, a member is required to physically deliver the required bushels of corn to 
  us either at the ProGold facility or another location designated by the Cooperative. 
  Under Method B, a member appoints us as its agent to arrange for the acquisition 
  and delivery of the required bushels of corn on the member’s behalf. Separate 
  from leasing the facility from ProGold, Cargill is in the grain services business. 
  In order to most cost effectively provide delivery services to our members, 
  the Cooperative has entered into an agreement with Cargill whereby we appoint 
  Cargill as our agent to arrange for the delivery of the corn by our members 
  who elect to deliver corn using Method A, and we appoint Cargill as our agent 
  to acquire corn on our behalf for our members who elect to deliver corn using 
  Method B. If a member elects to deliver corn using Method B, the price per bushel 
  the Cooperative pays to the member is equal to the price per bushel paid by 
  Cargill to acquire the corn as our agent. The Cooperative pays members who deliver 
  corn under Method A the market price or contracted price for their corn at the 
  time of delivery. Members who deliver corn under Method A receive from the Cooperative 
  an incentive payment of $.05 per bushel on the corn that they deliver while 
  members who elect Method B to deliver corn pay to the Cooperative a $.02 per 
  bushel agency fee for the cost of having us deliver corn on their behalf. The 
  incentive payment for Method A deliveries and the agency fee for Method B deliveries 
  are subject to annual adjustment at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors. 
  While the Cooperative is financially responsible for the various payments to 
  the members for corn, Cargill, serving as the Cooperative’s administrative 
  agent, issues payments to members for corn on the Cooperative’s behalf.

  Annually, we notify Cargill of the number of bushels of Method A corn to be 
  delivered by each member who has elected to deliver corn by Method A. Once we 
  provide notification to Cargill of the number of bushels of corn, Cargill then 
  confirms the amount of corn with each member and notifies that member with respect 
  to quality specifications, allowances, deductions and premiums to be applicable 
  to that corn. That Method A member then directly contracts with Cargill for 
  the contract price agreed upon for the corn or, in the absence of an agreed 
  upon price, the market price per bushel for corn delivered on the day on which 
  the corn is delivered and accepted at the facility. With respect to all corn 
  that is delivered by Method A, Cargill pays to the Cooperative the aggregate 
  purchase price for corn purchased from our members, and then, on our behalf, 
  makes individual payments for corn directly to our members. In the event a member 
  who has elected to deliver corn by Method A delivers to Cargill more than its 
  delivery commitment, any corn delivered in excess of that commitment is handled 
  as a direct sale of corn to Cargill and is priced at the current closing delivery 
  corn price established by Cargill at the facility on the day it is unloaded. 
  In the event a member who has elected to deliver corn by Method A delivers to 
  Cargill less than its committed amount of corn, the quantity of the shortfall 
  is then purchased and delivered by Cargill on our behalf, but this purchased 
  corn is not credited to such member’s account. If a member fails to fully 
  satisfy the corn delivery requirement, Cargill purchases replacement corn for 
  which we reimburse Cargill the amount by which the underlying contracted corn 
  price is less than the price of buying the replacement corn that was due on 
  the delivery date. In addition, if a member fails to deliver all of the corn 
  it was obligated to deliver, that member’s allocation of our profit or 
  losses and any cash distributions is proportionately reduced and we may terminate 
  the member’s membership.

  Based on the corn to be delivered by our members using Method A, Cargill then 
  purchases the remainder of the corn to be delivered by us on behalf of our Method 
  B delivering members at such time and in such quantities and at such prices 
  it deems appropriate and in the best interest of us and Cargill. Because Cargill 
  purchases the corn on our behalf for our members who elect to deliver using 
  Method B, the purchase price for the corn that would be paid to our members 
  if they actually delivered the corn is offset against the payment to be made 
  by us to Cargill for the cost to purchase the corn, thus no payment is made 
  from Cargill to us for corn delivered using Method B.

Golden Growers Cooperative
Golden Growers Cooperative (GGC) was formed in 1994 to create a value-added processing opportunity for corn growers in the Dakotas and Minnesota, and currently has about 1,600 members. GGC owns 49% of ProGold LLC in partnership with American Crystal Sugar Company, and ProGold owns a corn wet-milling plant near Wahpeton, North Dakota. The ProGold plant makes high fructose corn sweeteners, corn gluten feed and corn gluten meal. The plant also separates corn germ which is sold for production of corn oil. Since, 1997, the ProGold plant has been leased to Cargill, Inc., which operates the plant and markets all of its products. The current lease agreement extends to December 31, 2017.
In September, 2009, the co-op was re-organized under Minnesota’s statute 308B, which allows GGC to function as a cooperative but be taxed as a limited liability partnership. At that time, GGC opened its membership to residents of the 50 states and non-corn producers. All members do, however, have an annual corn delivery obligation that can be met by actual corn deliveries or by appointing GGC as its agent to arrange for delivery of their commitment. Members are required to own a minimum of 4,000 Units, and each member’s corn commitment is one bushel per Unit of ownership.
Persons interested in learning more about acquiring GGC Units should contact FNC Ag Stock, LLC at (701)780-2828 or (855)827-7391, and ask for Mr. Jayson Menke, or email to jmenke@fncagstock.com.

History - Golden Growers Cooperative
























































 
 






HistoryYou are here: Home / About / History





Corn growers in Minnesota and the Dakotas saw the potential for value-added processing cooperatives in the 1980s and early 1990s. The model created by sugar co-ops and a corn miller in southwest Minnesota provided the incentive to consider possibilities for the tri-state region.
In 1993, discussion moved from speculation to planning. At the same time, American Crystal Sugar Company in Moorhead, Minn., was considering expanding its product line to include corn sweeteners. Corn growers held their first meetings with American Crystal that summer, and the sugar co-op committed resources to the project.
The group had a volunteer planning board and a conceptual agreement to pursue plans for a corn wet mill. American Crystal and a second beet sugar co-op, Minn-Dak, Wahpeton, N.D., had expressed interest in joining in a project.
By March, 1994, the corn growers and sugar co-ops had developed a preliminary plan, and each group had tentatively agreed to invest in the project. Plans called for a new corn growers’ cooperative to own 49% of the project, American Crystal to own 46%, and Minn-Dak to own 5%. (Minn-Dak sold its share in 2003 to American Crystal.) It was decided the plant would focus on producing high fructose corn syrup (HFCS). The grind capacity was set at approximately 30 million bushels a year, with maximum annual production of about 1 billion pounds of HFCS.
The corn growers group held meetings with prospective members, asking for contributions to finance the development stage of the co-op and fund its share of further research. Growers responded with $1.7 million in donations, and Golden Growers Cooperative (GGC) was born.
GGC then officially joined with American Crystal and Minn-Dak to create ProGold LLC, and ProGold hired its first employees to begin planning and development of the project. The staff and board hired a plant management team, chose a site for the plant, and chose an engineering-design company.
In May, 1995, ground was broken the ProGold plant at a 150-acre site north of Wahpeton, and construction continued until the plant was operational in late 1996. Start-up of the ProGold plant unfortunately coincided with the lowest HFCS prices in history. In addition to the ProGold plant, other HFCS factories in the U.S. had been built or upgraded since 1995, and the resulting over-capacity resulted in falling prices.
The low market prices created losses throughout the HFCS industry, and ProGold was no exception. Although losses were anticipated for its start-up year, ProGold experienced much higher losses than expected in 1997 and projected even greater losses for 1998.
ProGold sought a partner with strength in operations, marketing and finance. ProGold signed a lease agreement with Cargill, Inc., to operate its Wahpeton plant and market the products from that plant through 2007. The lease was renewed on January 1, 2008, to extend through December 31, 2017. Coincidentally, ProGold retired its debt for plant construction in January, 2008.
