Zach Sternberg Returns to Hoosier State as Member of Indy Fuel


Michael Guzman | July 17, 2014 | Indy Fuel | No Comments













Tweet


INDIANAPOLIS – Adding to their defensive backline, the Indy Fuel announced today that Culver Military Academy product Zach Sternberg will be beginning his professional career with the team upon signing his first professional contract. Like the other signings the Fuel have produced thus far, Sternberg is signed to an ECHL-level contract, rather than an assigned NHL entry-level contract.

Sternberg, 23, is the second blue-liner to be signed by the Fuel, and the second to bolster a game that features an offensive style much like Anders Franzon, whom the team signed earlier this month. Like Franzon, Sternberg is also undersized, although Coach Scott Hillman hinted in the team’s announcement that Sternberg could see special teams time once the team begins practicing later this year. Per the Fuel’s website, “Zach is a solid defenseman with strong offensive instincts,” explained Fuel Head Coach and Vice President of Hockey Operations Scott Hillman on Thursday. “We expect his ability to move the puck to be a valuable asset on the power-play.”
At the NCAA level, Sternberg showed improvement throughout each of his four years at Lake Superior State University, tallying 16 points on 11 assists in 36 games as a fourth-year player. During the 2012-2013 campaign, Sternberg led all defenseman at Lake Superior State in both goals and assists.
Standing 6’0 and listed as 187 pounds, Sternberg should begin the season towards the bottom of the defensive pairing due to his size and lack of experience. Sternberg’s best season came with the Nepan Raiders of the Central Canada Hockey League (a junior league) where he led all defenseman with 34 assists and ranked second amongst d-men with 38 points.
“I certainly pride myself on playing fast,” Sternberg said in the Fuel’s announcement. “I like to push the pace and jump up into the play while always taking care of my own zone.”
From an organizational point-of-view, the Blackhawks have shown their depth at the defenseman position, and will be assigning multiple contracts to the ECHL in order to give young players experience and the opportunity for more playing time. Blackhawks Prospect Camp has one practice remaining, and from there training camp at the University of Notre Dame will determine which Blackhawks players will begin in the ECHL, AHL Rockford IceHogs, or NHL Chicago Blackhawks.
