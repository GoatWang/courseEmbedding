AppaloosaColumbiaColumbia (label)Rock (CD, LP) 


 Also available Appaloosa — Appaloosa ... CD 15.99 

                    A beautiful musical discovery that we'd somehow never managed to hear all these years – the debut of (and possibly only album by) Appaloosa, a group who mix together gentle folk and a bit of strings – in a mode that's strongly resonant with some of Tim Hardin or Tim Buckley's best work of the late 60s!  As you can guess from the cover image, the group is pretty young – but they work with a timeless quality beyond their years, a mode that mixes guitar, violin, and cello together as the core instrumentation for the tunes – topped by wonderful vocals from singer Robin Batteau, who has one of those "shoulda been huge" voices that really grab you right away.  Al Kooper produced and contributed some instrumentation – but in a really subtle way that respects the band's sound strongly – and titles include "Pascal's Paradox", "Now That I Want You", "Georgia Street", "Rosalie", "Rivers Run To The Sea", "Glossolalia", and "Feathers". (360 Sound stereo pressing – with insert!  Cover has a cut corner and some surface wear.)  © 1996-2017, Dusty Groove, Inc. 




Very Good

Vinyl can have some dirt, but nothing major.
    May not shine under light, but should still be pretty clean,
        and not too dirty.
    May have a number of marks (5 to 10 at most), and obvious signs of play,
        but never a big cluster of them, or any major mark that would be very deep.
        Most marks should still not click under a fingernail.
    May not look near perfect, but should play fairly well,
        with slight surface noise, and the occasional click in part of a song,
        but never throughout a whole song or more.
    This is clearly a copy that was played by someone a number of times,
        but which could also be a good "play copy" for someone new.



Additional Marks & Notes

    If something is noteworthy, we try to note it in the comments — especially
    if it is an oddity that is the only wrong thing about the record.
    This might include, but isn't limited to, warped records, tracks that skip,
    cover damage or wear as noted above, or strictly cosmetic flaws.

Santana

Abraxas

Columbia,  1970.  Very Good+  Gatefold 

LP...$19.99

In the past 30 years, this one's gone from being a fierce outpouring of the Bay Area underground, to a cliche of classic rock, to a brilliant example of west coast Latin rock/funk/fusion in action!  Features a stellar cover of "Oye Como Va", plus "Black Magic Woman/Gypsy Queen", ...  LP, Vinyl record album  






 

Fraser & Debolt

Fraser & Debolt With Ian Guenther

Columbia,  1971.  Very Good 

LP...$7.99

Moody, folksy work from the Canadian duo of Fraser & Debolt – helped here by a bit of extra work on fiddle from Ian Guenther!  The sound is often quite spare – acoustic guitars and vocals, with little else more than the guest fiddle – in a style that's nicely rough-edged, ...  LP, Vinyl record album  






 

Bob Dylan

Times They Are A-Changin'

Columbia,  1964.  Very Good

History[edit]
In 1993, David Tepper and Jack Walton founded Appaloosa Management, an employee-owned hedge fund, in Chatham, New Jersey.[4][5] Throughout the 1990s, the firm was known as a junk bond investment boutique,[6] and through the 2000s it was known as a hedge fund.[7]
2002 Conseco & Marconi Corp.[edit]
In the fourth quarter of 2002, Appaloosa Management returns were heavily a result of junk-bond and distressed debt bets in Conseco and Marconi Corp. that the market was bottoming out.[8]
2007 Delphi[edit]
Assets under management in 2007 were $5.3 billion.[5] The Financial Times reports the company has "attracted interest for its large ownership position in Delphi, the bankrupt car parts supplier, and its clashes on whether management has the shareholders best interests in mind or those of GM and the UAW."[4]
2008 financial crisis through 2011[edit]
Appaloosa survived the financial crisis of 2008 with relatively few investor redemption orders.[9]
From 2009 to 2010, Appaloosa Management's assets under management grew from $5 billion to $12 billion.[10]
In November 2010, the New York Times reported total assets under management of $14 billion.[2] In 2010, it was reported that since 1993 Appaloosa Management had returned $12.4 billion to clients—ranking it sixth on a ranking of total returns to clients by managers since inception.[11]
In September 2011, a Delaware bankruptcy court found that Appaloosa Management is one of four hedge funds that had played a role in Washington Mutual’s restructuring which might have received confidential information that could have been used to trade improperly in the bank’s debt.[12] In 2011, the company was awarded the Institutional Hedge Fund Firm of the Year award.[13]
Investment strategy[edit]
Appaloosa Management's investments focus on undiversified concentrated investment positions.[9] Appaloosa invests in the global public equity and fixed income markets with a focus on "equities and debt of distressed companies, bonds, exchange warrants, options, futures, notes, and junk bonds."[1] According to BusinessWeek, the firm's client base consists of high-net-worth individuals, pension and profit sharing plans, corporations, foreign governments, foundations, universities, and other organizations."[1][4] Investors commit to a locked period of three years during which their withdrawals are limited to 25 percent of their total investment.[9]
Products and performance[edit]
Appaloosa Management manages four investment vehicles: the offshore Palomino Fund LTD, an offshore and onshore version of its Thoroughbred fund, and its flagship fund Appaloosa Investment.[2][14]
Palomino Fund[edit]
The Palomino Fund from its inception in 1995 to 1998 had a 25 percent return. After Russia defaulted, the fund lost 49 percent of its value between February to September 1998.[3] The fund returned –26.7% percent in 2008 and 117.3 percent in 2009. The company was ranked by Bloomberg Markets as the top performing fund of any hedge fund manager managing over one billion dollars.[9]
Appaloosa Investment I[edit]
In 2001, the fund was up 67 percent followed the next year losing 25 percent. In 2003 the fund saw 149 percent returns for investors.[8]
Administration[edit]
The company leaders include: David Tepper, Founder and President,[1] Michael L. Palmer, Chief Financial Officer,[1] and Jeffrey L. Kaplan, Chief Operating Officer.[1]

History[edit]
In 1993, David Tepper and Jack Walton founded Appaloosa Management, an employee-owned hedge fund, in Chatham, New Jersey.[4][5] Throughout the 1990s, the firm was known as a junk bond investment boutique,[6] and through the 2000s it was known as a hedge fund.[7]
2002 Conseco & Marconi Corp.[edit]
In the fourth quarter of 2002, Appaloosa Management returns were heavily a result of junk-bond and distressed debt bets in Conseco and Marconi Corp. that the market was bottoming out.[8]
2007 Delphi[edit]
Assets under management in 2007 were $5.3 billion.[5] The Financial Times reports the company has "attracted interest for its large ownership position in Delphi, the bankrupt car parts supplier, and its clashes on whether management has the shareholders best interests in mind or those of GM and the UAW."[4]
2008 financial crisis through 2011[edit]
Appaloosa survived the financial crisis of 2008 with relatively few investor redemption orders.[9]
From 2009 to 2010, Appaloosa Management's assets under management grew from $5 billion to $12 billion.[10]
In November 2010, the New York Times reported total assets under management of $14 billion.[2] In 2010, it was reported that since 1993 Appaloosa Management had returned $12.4 billion to clients—ranking it sixth on a ranking of total returns to clients by managers since inception.[11]
In September 2011, a Delaware bankruptcy court found that Appaloosa Management is one of four hedge funds that had played a role in Washington Mutual’s restructuring which might have received confidential information that could have been used to trade improperly in the bank’s debt.[12] In 2011, the company was awarded the Institutional Hedge Fund Firm of the Year award.[13]
Investment strategy[edit]
Appaloosa Management's investments focus on undiversified concentrated investment positions.[9] Appaloosa invests in the global public equity and fixed income markets with a focus on "equities and debt of distressed companies, bonds, exchange warrants, options, futures, notes, and junk bonds."[1] According to BusinessWeek, the firm's client base consists of high-net-worth individuals, pension and profit sharing plans, corporations, foreign governments, foundations, universities, and other organizations."[1][4] Investors commit to a locked period of three years during which their withdrawals are limited to 25 percent of their total investment.[9]
Products and performance[edit]
Appaloosa Management manages four investment vehicles: the offshore Palomino Fund LTD, an offshore and onshore version of its Thoroughbred fund, and its flagship fund Appaloosa Investment.[2][14]
Palomino Fund[edit]
The Palomino Fund from its inception in 1995 to 1998 had a 25 percent return. After Russia defaulted, the fund lost 49 percent of its value between February to September 1998.[3] The fund returned –26.7% percent in 2008 and 117.3 percent in 2009. The company was ranked by Bloomberg Markets as the top performing fund of any hedge fund manager managing over one billion dollars.[9]
Appaloosa Investment I[edit]
In 2001, the fund was up 67 percent followed the next year losing 25 percent. In 2003 the fund saw 149 percent returns for investors.[8]
Administration[edit]
The company leaders include: David Tepper, Founder and President,[1] Michael L. Palmer, Chief Financial Officer,[1] and Jeffrey L. Kaplan, Chief Operating Officer.[1]

 Also available Appaloosa — Appaloosa ... LP 14.99 

                    A beautiful musical discovery that we'd somehow never managed to hear all these years – the debut of (and possibly only album by) Appaloosa, a group who mix together gentle folk and a bit of strings – in a mode that's strongly resonant with some of Tim Hardin or Tim Buckley's best work of the late 60s!  As you can guess from the cover image, the group is pretty young – but they work with a timeless quality beyond their years, a mode that mixes guitar, violin, and cello together as the core instrumentation for the tunes – topped by wonderful vocals from singer Robin Batteau, who has one of those "shoulda been huge" voices that really grab you right away.  Al Kooper produced and contributed some instrumentation – but in a really subtle way that respects the band's sound strongly – and titles include "Pascal's Paradox", "Now That I Want You", "Georgia Street", "Rosalie", "Rivers Run To The Sea", "Glossolalia", and "Feathers".   © 1996-2017, Dusty Groove, Inc. 





    We realize that there are many different interpretations of the standard grades used
    for pre-owned vinyl record albums & CD, so we thought we'd offer you the ones that we are working with,
    so you have an idea what we mean when we give the grade for a non-new item on our pages.

Used Vinyl Grades

    Below are stated conditions for a used vinyl records at Dusty Groove. Grading for
    the cover should be assumed to be near (within a "+" or "-")
    the grading for the vinyl.
    If there is significant divergence from the condition of the vinyl, or specific flaws,
    these will be noted in the comments section of the item. However, please be aware that
    since the emphasis of this site is towards the music listener, our main concern is with
    the vinyl of any used item we sell. Additionally, please note that all of our records
    are graded visually; considering the volume of used vinyl we handle, it is impossible
    for us to listen to each record. If we spot any significant flaws, we make every attempt
    to listen through them and note how they play.


    The following grading conditions apply to the vinyl component of an album or single:



Sealed

    This is what it says, that the record is still held fast in shrink-wrap.
    We tend to be pretty suspicious about these things, so if the shrink-wrap doesn't
    look original, or if the record seems to have undergone some damage over time,
    we'll probably take it out of the wrapper to ensure that it's in good shape —
    which is why we don't have more of these.  In some cases the shrink-wrap may be
    torn in spots, but if it's not possible the record has been taken out and played,
    the record will still qualify as "Sealed".



Near Mint

    Dusty Groove does not use the grades of Near Mint
    (or Mint, for that matter) because in our experience, we find that no records
    ever qualify for such a high grade.  Even sealed records tend to have one or two
    slight faults, enough to usually qualify them for a grade of NM- or lower.  We've
    often found that records which are clearly unplayed will have a slight amount of
    surface noise, especially in quieter recordings.



Near Mint - (minus)

Black vinyl that may show a slight amount of dust or dirt.
    Should still be very shiny under a light, even with slight amount of dust on surface.
    One or two small marks that would make an otherwise near perfect record slightly less so.
        These marks cannot be too deep, and should only be surface marks that won't affect play,
        but might detract from the looks.
    May have some flaws and discoloration in the vinyl, but only those that would be
        intrinsic to the pressing. These should disappear when the record is tilted under
        the light, and will only show up when looking straight at the record.
        (Buddah and ABC pressings from the 70's are a good example of this.)
    May have some slight marks from aging of the paper sleeve on the vinyl.
    Possible minor surface noise when played.



Very Good + (plus)

Vinyl should be very clean, but can have less luster than near mint.
    Should still shine under a light, but one or two marks may show up when tilted.
    Can have a few small marks that may show up easily, but which do not affect play at all.  Most marks of this quality will disappear when the record is tilted, and will not be felt with the back of a fingernail.
    This is the kind of record that will play "near mint", but which will have
        some signs of use (although not major ones).
    May have slight surface noise when played.



Very Good

Vinyl can have some dirt, but nothing major.
    May not shine under light, but should still be pretty clean,
        and not too dirty.
    May have a number of marks (5 to 10 at most), and obvious signs of play,
        but never a big cluster of them, or any major mark that would be very deep.
        Most marks should still not click under a fingernail.
    May not look near perfect, but should play fairly well,
        with slight surface noise, and the occasional click in part of a song,
        but never throughout a whole song or more.
    This is clearly a copy that was played by someone a number of times,
        but which could also be a good "play copy" for someone new.



Very Good - (minus)

Vinyl may be dirty, and can lack a fair amount of luster.
    Vinyl can have a number of marks, either in clusters or smaller amounts, but deeper.
    This is the kind of record that you'd buy to play,
        but not because it looked that great. Still, the flaws should be mostly cosmetic,
        with nothing too deep that would ruin the overall record.
    Examples include a record that has been kept for a while in a
        cover without the paper sleeve, or heavily played by a previous owner
        and has some marks across the surface.  The record should play okay,
        though probably with surface noise.



Good + (plus)

Vinyl may be dirty, or have one outstanding flaw,
        such as a light residue, which could be difficult to clean.
    May have marks on all parts, too many to qualify as Very Good-,
        or several deeper marks, but the record should still be ok for play without skips.
    In general, this is a record that was played a fair amount,
        and handled without care.  A typical example may be a record which has
        been heavily played by a DJ, and carries marks from slip cueing.
        Depending on the quality of the vinyl, may play with surface noise throughout.



Good

A record that you'd buy to play, cheap, but which you wouldn't buy for collecting.
    Will have marks across all parts of the playing surface,
        and will most likely play with surface noise throughout.
        May have some other significant flaws, such as residue, or a track that skips.
    In most cases, a poor quality copy of a very difficult to find record.



Fair

    This is a grade we rarely use, as we try not to sell records
    in very bad condition, though in some rare cases we will list a
    record in such bad shape that it does not conform to the standards above.
    A "Fair" record will have enough marks or significant flaws that it
    does not even qualify as "Good", but is a copy you might consider
    for playing, if you're willing to put up with noise and/or flaws.
    An example might be a recording with surface noise so heavy that
    it is equal to the volume of the music.  For records listed as "Fair",
    we will describe the extent of the condition in the comments.



Poor

    Like "Fair", we rarely list records in this condition,
    as they represent the extreme low end of spectrum.
    These records typically have multiple serious problems,
    and we offer them as "relics" or "objects" only — for
    those who want to at least have a copy of a record,
    even if it is not really worthy of play, perhaps for the cover alone.
    For these records, we will describe the extent of the condition in the comments.



Additional Marks & Notes

    If something is noteworthy, we try to note it in the comments — especially
    if it is an oddity that is the only wrong thing about the record.
    This might include, but isn't limited to, warped records, tracks that skip,
    cover damage or wear as noted above, or strictly cosmetic flaws.




Used CD Grade

    We have only one grade for non-new CDs at Dusty Groove — "Used CD".
    This grade is somewhat all-encompassing, but we choose it because we try to offer
    Used CDs in the best shape possible. All of our Used CDs are guaranteed to play
    without skipping or flaws. If you purchase a Used CD from Dusty Groove,
    you have 1 week to play it to determine that it plays correctly — and if it does not,
    then you may return it for a full refund.


    With our Used CDs, you can expect the disc to be free of all but the lightest of
    surface marks — clean, and not dirty at all.  You can also expect the case to be
    clean (we often change the cases ourselves — putting fresh cases on Used CDs we
    handle) — and you can expect the booklet to be in good shape, unless noted
    otherwise. We will list any specific details/defects underneath the item — so
    look for notes on cutout marks in the case, stamps on the barcode, or details like that.

Weirdly wonderful sounds from the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band – emerging here as a post-folk group who haven't really gone for sunshine pop, but who know how to use both their own harmonies and the strengths of the studio to their best advantage!

Brilliant early work from Nitty Gritty Dirt Band – a group who grew up in the same Cali sunshine that birthed The Byrds, but who definitely took a very unique path in the way they blended together folk, rock, and country!

Twice As Nice & Half The Price (Japanese paper sleeve edition)

Dawn/Wasabi (Japan),  1971.  New Copy

The title's a reference to the double-length nature of the set – but it might also be taken as a reference to the group's sound, too – as Heron's got a slightly fuller approach than on their debut album!

20th Century/Universal (Japan),  1964.  New Copy

Diane Renay's clearly got a thing for sailors going on here – but maybe that's no surprise, given that she's handled on the album by the great Bob Crewe – whose perfect presentation of the music is right up there with his best pop of the 60s!  Charlie Calello handled almost all of the ...  CD

6.99 (LP...$11.99)
A tremendous album from Laura Nyro – a real return to the soulful style of her roots, thanks to help from Labelle on backing vocals, and the team of Gamble & Huff on production!  If Nyro only ever gave the world this record, that would more than be enough – because the whole thing's ...  CD  






 

David Bowie

No Plan EP

Columbia,  2017.  New Copy 

CD...$6.99
7.98 
A record that may well be worth it just for the first vocal line from David Bowie – which begins "Look up here, I'm in heaven"!  The set brings together Bowie's final recordings, done in close collaboration with jazzman Donny McCaslin, whose work on saxes really shapes some great ...  CD
