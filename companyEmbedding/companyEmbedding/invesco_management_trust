History[edit]




Invesco headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia


INVESCO (all caps) was created in Atlanta in 1978 when Citizens & Southern National Bank divested its money management operations.[6] In 1988, the company was purchased by the British firm Britannia Arrow, based in London, which later took the INVESCO name.[7] In 1997 INVESCO PLC merged with AIM Investments.[8] Upon completion of the merger the company adopted the name Amvescap.[9]
Since 2000 Invesco has grown through acquisitions such as the ETF firm PowerShares Capital Management and the restructuring of WL Ross & Co.[8]
In 2004, the company agreed to a $450 million settlement with the Attorneys General of New York, Colorado and the SEC after allegations of improper trading practices.[10]
In May 2007 the company changed their name to Invesco (initial cap only) PLC, moved its primary stock market listing from the London Stock Exchange to the NYSE and became domiciled in Bermuda, adopting the name Invesco Ltd.[11] As a result, the company's shares were withdrawn from the FTSE 100 Index and added to the Russell 1000 index.[12] In November 2007, Invesco moved its headquarters from London to Atlanta.[6]
Invesco plans to list the PowerShares Global Progressive Transportation Portfolio (PTRP on the Nasdaq Stock Market.[13][14]
On October 19, 2009, Invesco bought Morgan Stanley's Retail Unit, including Van Kampen Investments for $1.5 billion.[15]
In April 2010, Invesco Aim became Invesco. Later that year, it was reported that Invesco had plans to introduce a Risk parity commodity fund according to regulatory filings.[16]
In December 2013, Invesco reported assets under management (AUM) of $778.7 billion[17]

History[edit]




Invesco headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia


INVESCO (all caps) was created in Atlanta in 1978 when Citizens & Southern National Bank divested its money management operations.[6] In 1988, the company was purchased by the British firm Britannia Arrow, based in London, which later took the INVESCO name.[7] In 1997 INVESCO PLC merged with AIM Investments.[8] Upon completion of the merger the company adopted the name Amvescap.[9]
Since 2000 Invesco has grown through acquisitions such as the ETF firm PowerShares Capital Management and the restructuring of WL Ross & Co.[8]
In 2004, the company agreed to a $450 million settlement with the Attorneys General of New York, Colorado and the SEC after allegations of improper trading practices.[10]
In May 2007 the company changed their name to Invesco (initial cap only) PLC, moved its primary stock market listing from the London Stock Exchange to the NYSE and became domiciled in Bermuda, adopting the name Invesco Ltd.[11] As a result, the company's shares were withdrawn from the FTSE 100 Index and added to the Russell 1000 index.[12] In November 2007, Invesco moved its headquarters from London to Atlanta.[6]
Invesco plans to list the PowerShares Global Progressive Transportation Portfolio (PTRP on the Nasdaq Stock Market.[13][14]
On October 19, 2009, Invesco bought Morgan Stanley's Retail Unit, including Van Kampen Investments for $1.5 billion.[15]
In April 2010, Invesco Aim became Invesco. Later that year, it was reported that Invesco had plans to introduce a Risk parity commodity fund according to regulatory filings.[16]
In December 2013, Invesco reported assets under management (AUM) of $778.7 billion[17]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

History[edit]




Invesco headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia


INVESCO (all caps) was created in Atlanta in 1978 when Citizens & Southern National Bank divested its money management operations.[6] In 1988, the company was purchased by the British firm Britannia Arrow, based in London, which later took the INVESCO name.[7] In 1997 INVESCO PLC merged with AIM Investments.[8] Upon completion of the merger the company adopted the name Amvescap.[9]
Since 2000 Invesco has grown through acquisitions such as the ETF firm PowerShares Capital Management and the restructuring of WL Ross & Co.[8]
In 2004, the company agreed to a $450 million settlement with the Attorneys General of New York, Colorado and the SEC after allegations of improper trading practices.[10]
In May 2007 the company changed their name to Invesco (initial cap only) PLC, moved its primary stock market listing from the London Stock Exchange to the NYSE and became domiciled in Bermuda, adopting the name Invesco Ltd.[11] As a result, the company's shares were withdrawn from the FTSE 100 Index and added to the Russell 1000 index.[12] In November 2007, Invesco moved its headquarters from London to Atlanta.[6]
Invesco plans to list the PowerShares Global Progressive Transportation Portfolio (PTRP on the Nasdaq Stock Market.[13][14]
On October 19, 2009, Invesco bought Morgan Stanley's Retail Unit, including Van Kampen Investments for $1.5 billion.[15]
In April 2010, Invesco Aim became Invesco. Later that year, it was reported that Invesco had plans to introduce a Risk parity commodity fund according to regulatory filings.[16]
In December 2013, Invesco reported assets under management (AUM) of $778.7 billion[17]

How Ireland’s economy rebounded after the financial crisis
The “Celtic tiger” now leads the eurozone in growth

  Posted    by  John Greenwood, Chief Economist      on  Jul 28, 2017,      in  Feature, Market & Economic 
Prior to the global financial crisis (GFC), Ireland’s economy was a stellar performer, earning the country the moniker of “Celtic tiger.” The onset of the GFC caused a major economic contraction and a housing crash — but today, Ireland is once again the fastest-growing economy in the eurozone. In this blog, I examine the key elements that allowed Ireland to regain its footing.

Halftime: Mid-year global market review and outlook
Strong earnings growth prospects remain outside the US — in spite of longer-term uncertainty

  Posted    by  Matt Dennis, Senior Portfolio Manager      on  Jul 27, 2017,      in  Capital Growth, Feature 

In the aftermath of a tumultuous 2016, much discussion has centered around the equity outlook for 2017 and beyond. In fact, the second quarter saw continued strong performance from global markets, though in our view, the long-term earnings outlook remains murky. As we enter the second half of the year, Invesco’s International and Global Growth team assesses global equity performance to date through our EQV (earnings, quality and valuation) lens to identify the key areas to watch — along with potential growth opportunities.

Emerging from the shadows — the case for emerging markets
A closer look at catalysts

  Posted    by  Steve Cao, Senior Portfolio Manager      on  Jul 26, 2017,      in  Capital Growth, Feature 

After an extended period of weakness, emerging market equities have rebounded nicely year-to-date — outperforming developed market stocks by a sizeable margin, as measured by the MSCI Emerging Markets Index and MSCI EAFE Index.1 In my view, this strong performance has been driven by better macroeconomic conditions, strong earnings growth and discounted valuations relative to developed market equities.1
Let’s take a closer look at these emerging market catalysts:

Weekly Market Review: Are emotions overriding facts?
In the US and Europe, sentiment doesn’t seem to match current realities

  Posted    by  Kristina Hooper, Global Market Strategist      on  Jul 24, 2017,      in  Feature, Market & Economic 
Global stocks moved higher last week, driven by a US stock market that continued to advance despite a plethora of negative headlines and a growing likelihood that President Donald Trump’s legislative agenda will not come to fruition in 2017. In addition, US stock market volatility, as measured by the VIX Index, remains very low. It’s almost as if US stocks have a Teflon-like coating around them, shielding them from the brunt of negative news. But why?

Are smart beta ETFs skewing stock valuations?
An analysis of ownership data suggests that ETFs are not the market disrupters they’re portrayed to be

  Posted    by  Eric Pollackov, Global Head of ETF Capital Markets      on  Jul 20, 2017,      in  Feature, PowerShares 
Thanks in large part to the popularity of smart beta and factor-based strategies, adoption of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has grown rapidly in recent years. Some have even speculated that the growth of ETFs is skewing the valuations of certain stocks. I do not believe that is the case. Below, I explain why.
Is the popularity of ETFs affecting single-stock ownership?

Weekly Market Review: The global forces of disruption
Disruption of many kinds has been a common theme in 2017

  Posted    by  Kristina Hooper, Global Market Strategist      on  Jul 17, 2017,      in  Feature, Market & Economic 
One of the key themes I’ve identified for 2017 and beyond is global disruption. Disruption can take many forms and be either a positive or negative force. The economist Joseph Schumpeter argued that disruption could be a positive force for economies — hence the term, “creative destruction.” Disruption — both positive and negative, both geopolitical and monetary — is abundant across the globe right now.

Why fiduciaries may want to consider fixed income
Investment clarity can help further the advisor-investor conversation

  Posted    by  Jack Tierney, Head of UIT Investment Policy and Governance      on  Jul 14, 2017,      in  Feature, Investing Essentials 
The US Marine Corps motto is “Semper Fidelis” or “Semper Fi” for short, meaning “always faithful.” Another related Latin word, “fidere,” means “to trust.” From this root also comes the word “fiduciary,” which refers to acting in a capacity of trust or confidence. While “faith” and “trust” are staples of love songs and wedding vows, “fiduciary” clearly denotes a financial relationship — and this summer, many of you may be embarking on new fiduciary relationships.
What is the fiduciary standard?

Which factors topped the list in the second quarter of 2017?
Growth and momentum strategies continue their comeback stories

  Posted    by  Nick Kalivas, Senior Equity Product Strategist      on  Jul 13, 2017,      in  Feature, PowerShares 

Growth and momentum again topped factor performance in the second quarter of 2017, with smaller-cap versions of both factors outpacing their large-cap counterparts. Growth stocks were in such favor during the quarter that the Russell 2000 Pure Growth Index and Russell MidCap Pure Growth Index were the two best performers, despite the fact that small- and mid-cap stocks as a whole lagged the broader market, as represented by the S&P 500 Index.
Factor leadership can vary from quarter to quarter, depending on market conditions and economic trends. Growth began its comeback in the first quarter of 2017 as the outlook for robust fiscal stimulus, in the form of tax cuts and infrastructure spending, faded. The small- and mid-cap value, dividend and high beta factors lagged during this time — weighed down by weakness in commodity prices and diminishing growth prospects.
More factors outperformed the broad market this quarter, with 12 factor indexes outpacing

Taking an active approach to down markets
Part 3: Exploring the truth about benchmark investing

  Posted    by  Tracy Fielder, Rethinking Risk strategist and Marie Jordon, Senior Product Manager      on  Jul 12, 2017,      in  Feature, Investing Essentials 
As noted in our previous blog on the myths of benchmark investing, active and passive strategies have cycled through periods of over- and underperformance for the last 25 years. In this blog, we focus on performance during down markets, and show that active strategies have historically captured less of the downside than market benchmarks. We’ll explain why this is a very important distinction.
Limiting downside risk is a critical part of investing due to:

Interest rate outlook: US inflation data unlikely to deter Fed from September tapering
Invesco Fixed Income shares its views of rates around the world

  Posted    by  Rob Waldner, Chief Strategist and Head of Multi-Sector      on  Jul 11, 2017,      in  Feature, Fixed Income 
US: May’s US inflation data surprised to the downside for the third month in a row. While we expect US growth to continue at a solid pace, inflation is likely to stay low for the next several months before moving higher in 2018. We do not expect the downside surprise in inflation to delay the beginning of the Federal Reserve (Fed) plan to begin reinvestment tapering in September. However, future inflation readings will be critical in determining when the Fed raises the federal funds rate again. If inflation stays low, this may not occur until the middle of 2018.

INVESCO INCOME GROWTH TRUST: The 'dividend hero' manager Ciaran Mallon who keeps the tank full to reward investors

While savers in deposit accounts have never had it so bad, investors who rely on a rising income from shares are basking in the sun.The latest data from share registrar Capita Asset Services shows that dividends paid by UK companies in the second quarter of this year were a record £33.3 billion – nearly 15 per cent up on the same quarter last year. The biggest contributors to the overall dividend bounty were HSBC, Royal Dutch Shell, National Grid, Lloyds Banking Group and tobacco giant BAT.  





 Cautious: Fund manager Ciaran Mallon has been running income portfolios at Henley-based asset manager Invesco Perpetual for 12 yearsThe payments, Capita says, were buoyed by a combination of strong profits, a weak pound (boosting profits made abroad) and several one-off dividends made by leading firms. It is now predicting that dividends this year will total more than £90 billion – 7 per cent up on 2016.Though healthy dividends will cheer income-seeking investors, fund manager Ciaran Mallon is not getting carried away.

      HOW THIS IS MONEY CAN HELP
    



Invesco Income Growth Trust: Latest price and charts




How to choose the best (and cheapest) DIY investing Isa - and our pick of the platforms





He has been running income portfolios at Henley-based asset manager Invesco Perpetual for 12 years and knows that it would take little to break the cycle that has seen UK dividends surge in 2016 and the year to date – for example, a failure by the Government to do a Brexit deal promptly and in the best interests of British business.‘If you look at the dividends firms are paying as a proportion of earnings they are generating from business activities that ratio has been rising for a while,’ he says. ‘At some stage, that upward trend may well break down, as it has done in the past, bringing a halt to dividend growth.’  





 Cautious words from a manager who in his modest and quietly efficient way has just steered the Invesco Income Growth Trust to its 20th consecutive year of dividend rises. This achievement has won it the label of ‘dividend hero’ from the investment trust lobby group, the Association of Investment Companies.It joins 20 trusts that have delivered two decades or more of consecutive annual dividend uplifts.
 

Like other ‘heroes’, Invesco Income Growth has grown its dividends through thick and thin by astute use of income reserves.It is into this financial tank that dividends from the trust’s 45 holdings are poured, and it is from it that income payments to shareholders are made. The tank always has a reservoir to ensure shareholders continue to enjoy a growing stream of income.‘We dipped into the reserves in 2010, 2011 and 2013 to support our dividend payments to investors. But for the past three years we have been refuelling the tank,’ says Mallon. The result is sufficient reserves to pay the equivalent of two thirds of last year’s total annual dividend.Like all investment funds, Invesco Income Growth is not without risk but it is managed conservatively by Mallon.


He only holds UK companies, though he has the power to invest abroad, and the fund is 70 per cent invested in FTSE 100 firms, 15 per cent in FTSE 250 firms, 12 per cent in FTSE Fledglings and 3 per cent elsewhere. There is no long tail of smaller company holdings, because Mallon likes each company stake to count.The trust’s current yield (the dividend divided by share price) is 3.5 per cent and fund costs are on the low side at 0.71 per cent.Mallon says this makes it a core holding for many investors with ‘a combination of an attractive, rising income and a decent capital return’. Over the past five years, it has outperformed its benchmark, the FTSE All Share Index, admittedly not by a lot.Boring? Maybe. But sometimes boring, as far as investments are concerned, is best.

Investment objective
The Company's objective is to provide long-term capital growth by investing in a diversified portfolio of Asian and Australasian companies. The Company aims to achieve growth in its net asset value (NAV) in excess of the Benchmark Index, the MSCI All Countries Asia ex Japan Index (total return, in sterling terms).
Further details of the Company's Investment Policy and Risk and Investment Limits can be found in the Report of the Directors contained within the Company's Annual Financial Report.

Should you wish to contact a member of the Board of Directors, please do so via the Company Secretary (see Contact details).
Investment risks
The value of investments and any income will fluctuate (this may partly be the result of exchange rate fluctuations) and investors may not get back the full amount invested.
When making an investment in an investment trust you are buying shares in a company that is listed on a stock exchange. The price of the shares will be determined by supply and demand. Consequently, the share price of an investment trust may be higher or lower than the underlying net asset value of the investments in its portfolio and there can be no certainty that there will be liquidity in the shares.
As this is an emerging markets investment trust, investors should be prepared to accept a higher degree of risk than for an investment trust with a broader investment mandate as difficulties in dealing, settlement and custody problems could arise.
The investment trust may invest in derivatives. This means that the net asset value of the investment trust may, at times, be highly volatile. The use of derivative instruments involves certain risks (including market or communication breakdown, counterparty failure and credit risk) and there is no assurance that the objectives for the use of such instruments will be achieved.
The investment trust may use borrowings to invest in the market. The use of borrowings may enhance total return when the value of the investment trust's assets is rising, but it will have the opposite effect when asset values fall. The use of borrowings may increase the volatility of the share price and the net asset value per share. In certain circumstances, the investment trust may be required to repay borrowings and this could adversely affect income and capital returns.
Issued on behalf of the board of the Invesco Asia Trust plc by Invesco Fund Managers Limited.

Investment risks

      
      The value of investments and any income will fluctuate (this may partly be as a result of exchange rate fluctuations) and investors may not get back the full amount invested. Depending on individual circumstances, this may affect investment returns.  Past performance is not a guide to future returns. The market price of shares in investment trusts may not reflect their underlying net asset value.
As this is an emerging markets investment trust, investors should be prepared to accept a higher degree of risk than for an investment trust with a broader investment mandate as difficulties in dealing, settlement and custody problems could arise.
The ordinary shares are geared by way of an unsecured revolving credit facility. As a consequence, any reduction in the value of the trusts investments may lead to a correspondingly greater percentage reduction in its net asset value which would be likely to adversely affect the investment trust&apos;s share price.
      




Important information

      
      This information has been issued on behalf of the board of the investment trust and has been approved for issue by Invesco Asset Management Limited, its Manager and Company Secretary.
All portfolio figures are as at date shown (source: Invesco Perpetual).
75% of the annual management charge, and any performance-related fees which become payable and loan interest will be deducted from the investment trust&apos;s capital, which may boost income but constrain or erode long-term capital growth.
When making an investment in an investment trust you are buying shares in a company that is listed on a stock exchange. The price of the shares will be determined by supply and demand. Consequently, the share price of an investment trust may be higher or lower than the underlying net asset value of the investments in its portfolio and there can be no certainty that there will be liquidity in the shares.
The information on this page is selective and does not constitute an offer, or an invitation to subscribe for, or purchase, any securities. This page does not form part of any prospectus and application for shares should be considered only on the basis of a full prospectus.
Where Invesco Perpetual has expressed views and opinions, these may change. For detailed information on our investment trusts, please contact us.

Investment Trusts
Here today. Here tomorrow.


Having helped many thousands of investors, we’re confident that with the right management, stock market investments have the potential to offer strong, long-term rewards. Investing your money within an investment trust – a closed ended investment company listed on the London Stock Exchange - can be an effective way, over the long-term, to enjoy the growth potential of the stock market.


At Invesco Perpetual we manage a range of nine investment trusts. These vary from the relatively new to having over 125 years’ history, but at the heart of each one is the same commitment to investment excellence. Each of the trusts is diligently managed with long-term performance in mind, based on an active, high conviction approach to investing. 




"I strongly believe the best way to invest in companies is to take a long-term approach and act as much as possible as an owner of a part of a company, rather than as a speculator in share prices"
- Ciaran Mallon,  UK Equities Fund Manager

Managed by Mark Barnett, the Company invests primarily in UK securities with the long-term objective of achieving an increase of the Net Asset Value per share by more than the growth in the FTSE All-Share Index; and growth in dividends per share by more than the rate of UK inflation.

Important information
The value of investments and any income will fluctuate (this may partly be the result of exchange rate fluctuations) and investors may not get back the full amount invested. 
When making an investment in an investment trust or investment company you are buying shares in a company that is listed on a stock exchange. The price of the shares will be determined by supply and demand. Consequently, the share price of an investment trust or investment company may be higher or lower than the underlying net asset value of the investments in its portfolio and there can be no certainty that there will be liquidity in the shares. 
Current tax levels and reliefs may change. Depending on individual circumstances, this may affect investment returns. 
Where Invesco Perpetual has expressed views and opinions, these may change. 
The investment trusts and investment companies may use borrowings to invest in the market. The use of borrowings may enhance total return when the value of the investment trusts’ and investment companies’ assets are rising, but it will have the opposite effect when asset values fall. The use of borrowings may increase the volatility of the share price and the net asset value per share. In certain circumstances, the investment trusts and investment companies may be required to repay borrowings and this could adversely affect income and capital returns. 
The Edinburgh Investment Trust plc, Invesco Asia Trust plc, Invesco Perpetual UK Smaller Companies Investment Trust plc, Keystone Investment Trust plc and Perpetual Income and Growth Investment Trust plc may invest in derivatives. This means that the net asset value of the investment trusts may, at times, be highly volatile. The use of derivative instruments involves certain risks (including market or communication breakdown, counterparty failure and credit risk) and there is no assurance that the objectives for the use of such instruments will be achieved.
Invesco Income Growth Trust plc may, subject to Board approval, invest in derivatives. This means that the net asset value of the investment trust may, at times, be highly volatile. The use of derivative instruments involves certain risks (including market or communication breakdown, counterparty failure and credit risk) and there is no assurance that the objectives for the use of such instruments will be achieved. At present the Directors have not sanctioned the use of any derivatives. 
As the Invesco Asia Trust plc is an emerging markets investment trust, investors should be prepared to accept a higher degree of risk than for an investment trust with a broader investment mandate as difficulties in dealing, settlement and custody problems could arise. 
As the Invesco Perpetual UK Smaller Companies Investment Trust plc is a smaller companies investment trust, investors should be prepared to accept a higher degree of risk than for an investment trust with a broader investment mandate. 
The City Merchants High Yield Trust Limited and Invesco Perpetual Enhanced Income Limited have a significant proportion of high-yielding bonds, which means that there is more risk to investors’ capital and income than from a Company investing in government or investment grade bonds. Income from the investment may fluctuate and is not guaranteed. The Companies may invest in derivatives. This means that the net asset value of the Companies may, at times, be highly volatile. The use of derivative instruments involves certain risks (including market or communication breakdown, counterparty failure and credit risk) and there is no assurance that the objectives for the use of such instruments will be achieved. 
The Invesco Perpetual Select Trust plc may use derivatives for the purpose of efficient portfolio management. There may not be a precise correlation between price movements in the underlying securities, currency or index, on the one hand, and price movements in the investments, which are the subject of the hedge, on the other. In addition, an active market may not exist for a particular derivative instrument at any particular time.
The Invesco Perpetual Select Trust plc Global Equity Income portfolio may invest in emerging market securities. Investors should be prepared to accept a higher degree of risk than for an investment trust with a broader investment mandate, as difficulties in dealing, settlement and custody problems could arise.
The Invesco Perpetual Select Trust plc Balanced Risk portfolio will make significant use of financial derivatives (complex instruments) which will result in large fluctuations in the value of the investment trust. Leverage created from borrowing on certain types of transactions including derivatives may impair the investment trust liquidity, cause it to liquidate positions at unfavourable times or otherwise cause the investment trust not to achieve its intended objective. Leverage occurs when the economic exposure created by the use of derivatives is greater than the amount invested resulting in the investment trust being exposed to a greater loss than the initial investment.
The Invesco Perpetual Select Trust plc Balanced Risk portfolio will gain exposure to commodities which are generally considered to be high risk investments and may result in large fluctuations in the value of the investment trust.
The Directors intend that each portfolio will effectively operate as if it were a stand-alone company. However, prospective investors should be aware that in the event that any of the portfolios have insufficient funds or assets to meet all of its liabilities, such a shortfall would become a liability of the other portfolios. In addition, should the investment trust incur material liabilities in the future, a significant fall in the value of the investment trust’s assets as a whole may affect the investment trust’s ability to pay dividends on a particular class of Shares, even though there are distributable profits attributable to the relevant portfolio.
The investment trust may use borrowings to invest in the market. The use of borrowings may enhance total return when the value of the investment trust’s assets is rising, but it will have the opposite effect when asset values fall. The use of borrowings may increase the volatility of the share price and the net asset value per share. In certain circumstances, the investment trust may be required to repay borrowings and this could adversely affect income and capital returns.
The investment trust expects to increase dividend payments on the Global Equity Income and UK Equity shares by making use of its ability to distribute capital. To the extent the investment trust uses its ability to fund dividends using capital profit this will reduce capital growth.

 Investment Objective The investment objective of this collective trust fund is to achieve a higher than market return with average market risk over the long-term by investing in the universe of global real estate securities.   Investor Profile The Invesco Equity Global Real Estate Securities Trust may be appropriate for investors who seek total return from a combination of investment income and capital appreciation and wish to invest in global real estate securities. Investors should be comfortable with moderate to high risk and must be prepared to weather sudden and unpredictable variations in portfolio value associated with the risks of foreign investing. 
 Investment strategy Invesco maintains well-diversified portfolios with exposure to major sectors of the market. Our stock selection and fundamental research may lead us to overweight or underweight particular countries or property types. The focus for this portfolio is on larger, better quality companies that are expected to provide attractive risk-adjusted returns. In constructing the Fund's portfolio we compare current security valuation levels relative to valuation levels of alternative investments, the value of underlying real estate assets and other considerations such as a REIT management team's proven ability to add value throughout the investment cycle. 
 Fund management The trustee and investment manager. The trustee and investment manager for the Fund is Invesco Trust Company, a Texas trust company. 

 Fund sub-advisor The investment sub-adviser for the Fund is Invesco Advisers, Inc. Information concerning the sub-adviser can be found in its Form ADV filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, available at www.sec.gov. Fund BenchmarkFTSE EPRA/NAREIT Developed Index 

Fund Fees and Expenses
Please refer to the Declaration of Trust and the Participation Agreement for information relating to minimum initial investments, fees and expenses payable in connection with an investment in the Fund. Fees and expenses charged by funds in which the Fund invests will be borne by the Fund. 



Investment Guidelines
Permitted Investments
The Fund will generally invest in public real estate equity securities that derive a substantial portion of their revenues from real estate industry activities and real estate fixed income securities including collateralized mortgage obligations, debt and preferred stock.

Under normal market conditions, the Fund may invest a maximum of 15% of the market value of the portfolio in securities that are not included in the stated Index.
The aggregate market value of a single issuer may not be more than 10% percent; provided however, if such security represents more than 7% of the weighting in the Index, then such security's weighting in the Fund may exceed the 10% limit, but shall not exceed the weighting in the Index plus 3%.

Important Information
This product is a bank collective trust fund for which Invesco Trust Company serves as trustee and investment manager. The fund is not FDIC-insured or registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Please see the fund's Declaration of Trust and recent financial statements (available upon request from your retirement plan sponsor) for important information before investing.

Material presented is compiled from sources believed to be reliable and current, but accuracy cannot be guaranteed. This does not constitute an offer or solicitation of any security or product, nor constitute a recommendation of the suitability of any investment strategy for a particular investor.

When evaluating whether a fund is appropriate for your investment goals, fund performance, fees and expenses are only a few of the criteria you should consider. You may also consider the investment objective, strategy and risks.





 Principal Risks of Investing
			 


The value of your investment in the Fund will go up and down with the prices of the securities in which the Fund invests directly and indirectly. Listed below are some of the principal risks associated with investing in the Fund.
General Investment Risk. Investors could lose all or a portion of their investment in the Fund. Investors should not invest in the Fund unless they can readily bear the consequences of such loss.
Suitability Risk. Investors are expected to select investments whose investment strategies are consistent with their financial goals and risk tolerance.
Market Risk. The prices of securities held by the Fund may go down due to general market and economic conditions.
Equity Securities Risk. Equity security prices change due to the earnings of the issuer, the value of its assets, economic conditions, interest rates, investor perceptions and market liquidity.
Real Estate Investment Risk. Because the Fund concentrates its assets in the real estate industry, an investment in the Fund will be closely linked to the performance of the real estate markets.
Industry Concentration Risk. The Fund will concentrate investment in a particular industry, so its share value may fluctuate in response to events affecting that industry.
Foreign Securities Risk. Non-U.S. securities have risks related to exchange rates, politics, economics, lack of information, low market liquidity and lack of strict financial controls.
Emerging Markets Risk. Emerging markets involve smaller sized, less liquid markets; unpredicatble inflation rates and political conditions; less stringent regulations; and lack of timely information.
Convertible Securities Risk. Convertible securities are affected by interest rates, the risk that the issuer may default, and the value of the common stock into which these securities may convert.
Derivatives Risk. For some derivatives, the Fund could lose more than the amount invested. If the Fund uses derivatives to ""hedge"" portfolio risk, the hedge may not succeed.
Leverage Risk. Leveraging magnifies changes, favorable or unfavorable, in the value of the portfolio's securities.
Interest Rate Risk. Bond prices fall as interest rates rise, and rise as interest rates fall. Bond portfolios are riskier when interest rates rise. Long maturity bonds have more interest rate risk.
Short Sales Risk. Short selling subjects the Fund to losses if the security's price goes up before the short position is closed, or if the Fund borrowed securities and has to make the lender whole.
Liquidity Risk. When the Fund has difficulty in selling an asset quickly, it faces liquidity risk.
Currency Risk. The U.S. dollar value of the Fund's foreign investments will be affected by changes in the exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the currencies in which investments are traded.
Securities Lending Risk. The Fund or the vehicles in which it invests may may participate in securities lending programs. The lending fund bears the risk of investment loss associated with any reinvestment of securities lending collateral held by the lending fund.
Increase in Expenses Risk. The actual cost of investing may be higher than the expenses listed in the expense table for a variety of reasons, including termination of a voluntary fee waiver or losing portfolio fee breakpoints if average net assets decrease. The risk of expenses increasing because of a decrease in average net assets is heightened when markets are volatile.
Not FDIC Insured Risk. The investment is not a deposit or obligation of, or guaranteed or endorsed by, any bank and is not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Federal Reserve Board, or any other U.S. governmental agency.
Accounts of Affiliates of the Investment Manager.   Affiliated managers may trade in securities at the same time as the Fund and, therefore, may potentially affect prices or available opportunities.
No Securities Registration. The Fund is exempt from registration with the SEC. Units of the Fund are exempt from registration with the SEC. Neither is registered with any state securities regulator.
No CFTC Registration.  The Fund is not registered as a commodity pool with the CFTC because the Trustee is exempt from having to register as a commodity pool operator under CFTC Rule 4.5.
