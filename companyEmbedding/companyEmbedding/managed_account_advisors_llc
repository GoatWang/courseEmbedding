Stadion
























Stadion Retirement









Managed AccountsTarget Date FundsRisk-Based Funds




Stadion Managed Accounts
Goal: Deliver satisfying returns with less volatility
Underlying Holdings: ETFs, cash/cash equivalents
Capabilities:

QDIA: Designed to fulfill the qualified default investment alternative requirements under the Pension Protection Act and provide a QDIA warranty
3(38) Fiduciary: Stadion acts as a 3(38) investment manager with discretionary control over participant accounts

Stadion has more than 100,000 retirement accounts and is the fifth-largest provider of 401(k) managed accounts.1


Investment Approach

Stadion’s money managers actively manage the 401(k) accounts for more than 100,000 individuals, making disciplined investment decisions based on what’s happening in the market. Our proprietary approach is designed to deliver satisfying returns while aiming to minimize losses—with the goal of helping employees prepare financially for retirement.
The Stadion Managed Account portfolios consist of three key components: core equity, “Flex” and core fixed income. They always maintain some level of market exposure while a portion—Flex—adjusts in response to market risk levels. Seeking to protect investors’ assets as they approach retirement, we move accounts into increasingly conservative portfolios over time. All markets rise and fall, which is why managing risk is the key to Stadion’s defensive money management. 
The illustration below compares a traditional balanced portfolio, using a static asset allocation strategy, with the Stadion Balanced Portfolio which utilizes a dynamic asset allocation strategy.


The allocated percentages are approximate, may change based on market conditions, and may vary based on retirement plan provider.
*Low-Risk Environment and High-Risk Environment refer to risk levels in equity markets as determined by Stadion's model.
