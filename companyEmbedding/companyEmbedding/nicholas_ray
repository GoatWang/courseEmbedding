Discover The $5 Solution to a Wrinkle Free Face - ALL EXPOSED TODAY!





Various sources across the internet have exposed a HUGE celebrity secret to erase wrinkles - without botox or surgery!

How do Hollywood starlets look so radiant and youthful well into 
thier 40's, 50's, and even 60's? Is it always expensive botox and 
dangerous  plastic surgery? According to various sources, the answer is NO! So if
 they aren't all using surgery to stay looking great, what is their 
secret? Keep reading, it's excitingly effective, safe, and cheap!
 
It is rumoured that some celebrities are aiming to look 10 to 15 years younger fast, but are scared of the potential risks of surgery or botox. Many online sources have expressed suprise over how shockingly simple, cheap, and effective his technique was! Read on...
 
“Countless aging celebs are reported to have admitted they avoided surgery and look 20 years younger thanks to the simple advice.”


The Best Skin Solution You’ve Never Heard Of

The wrinkle secret has been reserved for high paying celebrity clients...until now. Consumers have reported throwing away thousands of dollars on expensive anti aging products or dangerous surgical procedures that make big promises that often do far more harm than good. As a result, a few weeks ago this simple solution was shared!
 
This anti aging miracle was reportedly found when multiple celebrity friends were hoping for a solution to look younger to prolong their career without going in for surgery.






“She looked 15 years younger in literally 2 weeks!”

 
They were reported to have been thrilled when after months and months of pain staking tests and research, the team came across 2 products that when combined supposedly took 10 to 20 years off women’s appearance in just a month. More shockingly it is safe, and  costs next to nothing to try! The two products are Oveena Anti Aging Cream and Lumaglow Instant Lifting Cream.
  

“Possbily the best anti aging discovery of the decade.”
 
 
So what is it?



 2 Key Ingredients For Anti Aging:

1.  Vitamin C
  2.  Hyaluronic Acid



These are both natural ingredients that work together to erase 
wrinkles and fine lines at the cellular level – below the surface of the
 skin – which is why they’re so effective.
 
Vitamin C, The 1st Youth Discovery:
  The first piece of the anti aging puzzle discovered was Vitamin C.

 "Vitamin C is a secret anti aging trick”
Vitamin C penetrates deep into damaged skin and stimulates new 
collagen – a protein which makes skin appear plump and firm. It's all 
the rage in beauty circles, much in part because of a 2009 study 
stating, applying non-prescription  Vitamin C to your skin  caused a large reduction in fine lines and wrinkles. This is why Oveena Anti Aging Cream is so effective. It was one of the few products on the market that had Vitamin C in the right consistency and dosage.




Hyaluronic Acid:
  The second piece, when combined properly with Vitamin C, can make your face look two decades younger in weeks! Hyaluronic 
Acid works by binding to moisture. It can hold up to 1,000 times its 
weight in water, making it an excellent natural skin plumper. Hyaluronic
 acid helps your skin repair and regenerate itself after suffering from 
dryness, environmental stresses, or irritation. Products you can buy over the counter with an effective 
concentration of Hyaluronic Acid was found in Lumaglow Instant Lifting Cream . 





 




 
“What Vitamin C & Hyaluronic Acid do is get rid of all the old, dead layers of skin and help your skin 
    generate fresh new ones. Our research shows that you can erase almost 10 to 
    20 years off your face in less than 14 days. But the key is to choose 
    the creams and serums that contain the highest and purest quality 
    ingredients, since they’re not all the same. The only two we found during our research was Oveena Anti Aging Cream and Lumaglow Instant Lifting Cream. This is what my wife uses. This is what I recommend to all my celebrity clients.”



"How do I do it?"


It's actually very simple. You simply use both products before bed. Oveena Anti Aging Cream and Lumaglow Instant Lifting Cream.
    These two products both contain high concentrations of pure Vitamin C 
    and Hyaluronic Acid in just the right concentrations. His team is also reported to have discovered 
    that they contain all sorts of anti-oxidants, an ingredient called 
    Dermaxyl (also known as facelift in a jar) and Ester-C (the active 
    anti-aging compound in Vitamin C). 




“Getting older is rough for an actress. I feel like a new woman!”




Put to the Test!
As excited as we were, we wanted to find an example of real usage of these type of products. We found one test where a volunteer from the office was used. A 57 year old mother of 3 jumped at the chance to test this combo and the results were pulished online. Here is her story...
 
Brenda's Story & 14 Day Cell Revival Results:
"Brenda is a 57 year old mother of 3 from here in Chicago. Like most 
women her age, the years have started to give her unwanted lines and 
wrinkles. Brenda said she volunteered because she is so frustrated that 
nothing she has tried seems to work. She was even considered highly 
risky and very expensive facelift procedure. This was somewhat of a last
 resort for her." 

Here are the reported results from the source....
 




 


Day 1:

"After the first day of using Oveena Anti Aging Cream and Lumaglow Instant Lifting Cream together,
 I was surprised at how wonderful they both made my skin feel. It felt 
like every last pore on my face was being tightened and pulled by a 
gigantic vacuum cleaner.
 
I don't know how else to describe it! I could feel a warm tingling 
sensation on my cheeks, around my eyes, and on my forehead. I looked in 
the mirror and saw that my face looked a bit rosy - the result of 
revitalizing blood rushing to the surface of my skin to renew my face. 
 
After both products were absorbed into my skin, my face looked firmer and had a beautiful glow to it."



day 5:
 
"After five days of using Oveena Anti Aging Cream and Lumaglow Instant Lifting Cream, I was shocked at the drastic results.
The lines, dark spots, and wrinkles - without question - were visibly reduced in size right before my eyes!
I was astonished by the results, and literally felt 15 years younger 
again. It was like watching all my wrinkles and fine lines vanish right off!"




day 14:
 "After 14 days, not only had all my doubts and scepticism absolutely vanished - SO DID MY WRINKLES!

  The lines on my forehead, the loose, sagging skin on my neck, my crows’ feet – even the age spots on my face had 
COMPLETELY disappeared. I've never felt or seen anything tighten my skin
 with this kind of force before, no matter how expensive the product!
 
After the 2 weeks, my skin not only stayed that
way, it actually improved every day until it became as beautiful and 
radiant as it was 20 years ago. By this point, all my 
friends and family were shocked. They couldn't believe the difference, 
and were convinced I was lying about not getting botox!"










Pictures of Brenda Wright at day 1, day 5 & day 14. The picture at the bottom was taken after only 14 days of using Oveena Anti Aging Cream and Lumaglow Instant Lifting Cream.


The Verdict:
Using the Oveena Anti Aging Cream and Lumaglow Instant Lifting Cream combo,
 removed virtually 90% of all her wrinkles and problem areas. It 
tightened her face and neck, removing all signs of sagging, aging, and 
dehydrated skin.

Will This Work For You?

 ridiculously expensive. With so many options it’s only natural for you

Discover The $5 Solution to a Wrinkle Free Face - ALL EXPOSED TODAY!





Various sources across the internet have exposed a HUGE celebrity secret to erase wrinkles - without botox or surgery!

How do Hollywood starlets look so radiant and youthful well into 
thier 40's, 50's, and even 60's? Is it always expensive botox and 
dangerous  plastic surgery? According to various sources, the answer is NO! So if
 they aren't all using surgery to stay looking great, what is their 
secret? Keep reading, it's excitingly effective, safe, and cheap!
 
It is rumoured that some celebrities are aiming to look 10 to 15 years younger fast, but are scared of the potential risks of surgery or botox. Many online sources have expressed suprise over how shockingly simple, cheap, and effective his technique was! Read on...
 
“Countless aging celebs are reported to have admitted they avoided surgery and look 20 years younger thanks to the simple advice.”


The Best Skin Solution You’ve Never Heard Of

The wrinkle secret has been reserved for high paying celebrity clients...until now. Consumers have reported throwing away thousands of dollars on expensive anti aging products or dangerous surgical procedures that make big promises that often do far more harm than good. As a result, a few weeks ago this simple solution was shared!
 
This anti aging miracle was reportedly found when multiple celebrity friends were hoping for a solution to look younger to prolong their career without going in for surgery.






“She looked 15 years younger in literally 2 weeks!”

 
They were reported to have been thrilled when after months and months of pain staking tests and research, the team came across 2 products that when combined supposedly took 10 to 20 years off women’s appearance in just a month. More shockingly it is safe, and  costs next to nothing to try! The two products are Oveena Anti Aging Cream and Lumaglow Instant Lifting Cream.
  

“Possbily the best anti aging discovery of the decade.”
 
 
So what is it?



 2 Key Ingredients For Anti Aging:

1.  Vitamin C
  2.  Hyaluronic Acid



These are both natural ingredients that work together to erase 
wrinkles and fine lines at the cellular level – below the surface of the
 skin – which is why they’re so effective.
 
Vitamin C, The 1st Youth Discovery:
  The first piece of the anti aging puzzle discovered was Vitamin C.

 "Vitamin C is a secret anti aging trick”
Vitamin C penetrates deep into damaged skin and stimulates new 
collagen – a protein which makes skin appear plump and firm. It's all 
the rage in beauty circles, much in part because of a 2009 study 
stating, applying non-prescription  Vitamin C to your skin  caused a large reduction in fine lines and wrinkles. This is why Oveena Anti Aging Cream is so effective. It was one of the few products on the market that had Vitamin C in the right consistency and dosage.




Hyaluronic Acid:
  The second piece, when combined properly with Vitamin C, can make your face look two decades younger in weeks! Hyaluronic 
Acid works by binding to moisture. It can hold up to 1,000 times its 
weight in water, making it an excellent natural skin plumper. Hyaluronic
 acid helps your skin repair and regenerate itself after suffering from 
dryness, environmental stresses, or irritation. Products you can buy over the counter with an effective 
concentration of Hyaluronic Acid was found in Lumaglow Instant Lifting Cream . 





 




 
“What Vitamin C & Hyaluronic Acid do is get rid of all the old, dead layers of skin and help your skin 
    generate fresh new ones. Our research shows that you can erase almost 10 to 
    20 years off your face in less than 14 days. But the key is to choose 
    the creams and serums that contain the highest and purest quality 
    ingredients, since they’re not all the same. The only two we found during our research was Oveena Anti Aging Cream and Lumaglow Instant Lifting Cream. This is what my wife uses. This is what I recommend to all my celebrity clients.”



"How do I do it?"


It's actually very simple. You simply use both products before bed. Oveena Anti Aging Cream and Lumaglow Instant Lifting Cream.
    These two products both contain high concentrations of pure Vitamin C 
    and Hyaluronic Acid in just the right concentrations. His team is also reported to have discovered 
    that they contain all sorts of anti-oxidants, an ingredient called 
    Dermaxyl (also known as facelift in a jar) and Ester-C (the active 
    anti-aging compound in Vitamin C). 




“Getting older is rough for an actress. I feel like a new woman!”




Put to the Test!
As excited as we were, we wanted to find an example of real usage of these type of products. We found one test where a volunteer from the office was used. A 57 year old mother of 3 jumped at the chance to test this combo and the results were pulished online. Here is her story...
 
Brenda's Story & 14 Day Cell Revival Results:
"Brenda is a 57 year old mother of 3 from here in Chicago. Like most 
women her age, the years have started to give her unwanted lines and 
wrinkles. Brenda said she volunteered because she is so frustrated that 
nothing she has tried seems to work. She was even considered highly 
risky and very expensive facelift procedure. This was somewhat of a last
 resort for her." 

Here are the reported results from the source....
 




 


Day 1:

"After the first day of using Oveena Anti Aging Cream and Lumaglow Instant Lifting Cream together,
 I was surprised at how wonderful they both made my skin feel. It felt 
like every last pore on my face was being tightened and pulled by a 
gigantic vacuum cleaner.
 
I don't know how else to describe it! I could feel a warm tingling 
sensation on my cheeks, around my eyes, and on my forehead. I looked in 
the mirror and saw that my face looked a bit rosy - the result of 
revitalizing blood rushing to the surface of my skin to renew my face. 
 
After both products were absorbed into my skin, my face looked firmer and had a beautiful glow to it."



day 5:
 
"After five days of using Oveena Anti Aging Cream and Lumaglow Instant Lifting Cream, I was shocked at the drastic results.
The lines, dark spots, and wrinkles - without question - were visibly reduced in size right before my eyes!
I was astonished by the results, and literally felt 15 years younger 
again. It was like watching all my wrinkles and fine lines vanish right off!"




day 14:
 "After 14 days, not only had all my doubts and scepticism absolutely vanished - SO DID MY WRINKLES!

  The lines on my forehead, the loose, sagging skin on my neck, my crows’ feet – even the age spots on my face had 
COMPLETELY disappeared. I've never felt or seen anything tighten my skin
 with this kind of force before, no matter how expensive the product!
 
After the 2 weeks, my skin not only stayed that
way, it actually improved every day until it became as beautiful and 
radiant as it was 20 years ago. By this point, all my 
friends and family were shocked. They couldn't believe the difference, 
and were convinced I was lying about not getting botox!"










Pictures of Brenda Wright at day 1, day 5 & day 14. The picture at the bottom was taken after only 14 days of using Oveena Anti Aging Cream and Lumaglow Instant Lifting Cream.


The Verdict:
Using the Oveena Anti Aging Cream and Lumaglow Instant Lifting Cream combo,
 removed virtually 90% of all her wrinkles and problem areas. It 
tightened her face and neck, removing all signs of sagging, aging, and 
dehydrated skin.

Will This Work For You?

There are plenty of skincare gimmicks out there, and most of them are
 ridiculously expensive. With so many options it’s only natural for you 
to be skeptical about the results, and so we don't want to promise our 
readers anything, we simply want to challenge you to do what has been recommended: try it for yourself!

Overview



Based on an article in the New Yorker, Nicholas Ray's Bigger Than Life stars James Mason (who also produced the film) as elementary school teacher Ed Avery, a thoughtful, gentle man, with a loving wife, Lou (Barbara Rush), and a young son, Richie (Christopher Olsen), who loves him. Avery is successful and well liked in his community, but he is over-extended in his pursuit of the American dream -- he secretly works a second job to earn extra money, and doesn't dare break stride, despite the increasingly painful physical spasms that he suffers. He collapses one day, and the doctors inform him that he suffers from an arterial disease that will probably give him less than a year to live. But they also offer him one hope, with treatment using cortisone, which was then a new, not-fully-tested drug. Avery makes a seemingly full recovery and returns to work, but it soon becomes clear that he's not the same -- he has a new, cavalier attitude toward money, and then Lou becomes alarmed over his expressions of rage over seemingly insignificant annoyances. He starts expressing himself in grand, exalted terms, first to Lou and then to his colleagues at school, including his closest friend, Wally Gibbs (Walter Matthau). And matters only get worse when Wally determines that it is the cortisone -- which Ed has been taking in far greater doses than prescribed -- that is making him act this way. And his obsession w ith forcing Richie to live up to his full potential soon turns into a much darker fixation. Director Ray later offered regret over having used cortisone by name, as it was still not standard treatment and its benefits and drawbacks weren't known. But this did lend the movie a verisimilitude that was essential for what appeal it did hold for audiences. (Seven years later, screenwriter William Read Woodfield would incorporate Bigger Than Life's cortisone plot device into his script for the Voyage To The Bottom of the Sea episode \Mutiny\. Bigger Than Life's more immediate problem at the time lay in its broader plot -- with a story that brought drug addiction and fact-based psychological unhingement into a suburban American setting, it was a daring subject for its time, for which audiences were unprepared in 1956. It was also one of a group of offbeat pictures that Mason produced as well as starred in.

Editorial Reviews


All Movie Guide  - Mark Deming
Nicholas Ray's Bigger Than Life never achieved the critical or popular success of his Rebel Without a Cause, released the previous year, but it holds up as an equally powerful look at the dark and troubling underside of life in a "normal" American family. While Rebel Without a Cause explored the impact of a weak and ineffectual father on a teenager struggling to assert his maturity and masculinity, Bigger Than Life examined the other side of a similar situation, as Ed Avery (James Mason) slowly mutates into an aggressively domineering father willing to murder a child who can't live up to his high standards. While on the surface Bigger Than Life is a warning about the use of untested and possibly dangerous drugs (Avery's psychosis is brought on by dangerously high dosages of cortisone, still in the experimental stages at the time), what's most memorable about the film is Mason's superbly modulated performance (one of the best of his career), in which he gradually transforms from a typical high school teacher and suburban dad into a megalomaniac who refuses to accept anything less than perfection from his students or his family -- even going so far to suggest he can do better than God in his judgment of his son's worth. Mason and Ray took the typically over-ambitious father who pesters Junior for good grades and a home run in his next little league game, and exaggerated him into something truly terrifying; if Rebel Without a Cause made suggested that juvenile delinquency could happen in a "good" home, Bigger Than Life went even farther in suggesting just how sinister a "good" home could be.

Editorial Reviews


Publishers Weekly
Film biographer McGilligan (Oscar Micheaux) traces the rise of eccentric director Nicholas Ray in this slow-paced biography. Born Raymond Nicholas Kienzle Jr. in 1911, the charismatic Ray grew up in La Crosse, Wis., and became drawn to theater. He later organized agitprop theater in New York—though he'd give secret testimony to HUAC—before leaving for Hollywood with his friend and quasi-mentor, Elia Kazan. Ray's first film, They Live By Night, completed in 1947, wasn't released in America until 1949, after winning raves in Europe, where he'd been popular, especially with the French. Knock on Any Door (1949) and In a Lonely Place (1950)—both starring Humphrey Bogart—put him on the map, even as his shaky personal life threatened to destroy him. Yet even Ray's penchant for alcohol, coupled with a growing number of ex-wives, couldn't dampen the success of 1955's Rebel Without a Cause, his only Oscar-nominated film. But Rebel was the beginning of the end, and while Ray had later limited success, bizarre on-set behavior made him a virtual Hollywood pariah until his death in 1979. McGilligan, meticulous in the details, too often plods through the material without imbuing it with any of the director's signature flair. (July)

Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel
“[A] portrait of a filmmaker who managed over time to upstage the movies that made him celebrated.”

Booklist
“McGilligan limns the tragic trajectory of Ray’s career with insight and compassion.”

Kirkus Reviews
A veteran biographer of film legends records the sad career arc of Nicholas Ray (1911–1979),the director of one of Hollywood's most iconic films,Rebel Without a Cause(1955).McGilligan (Oscar Micheaux: The Great and Only, 2007, etc.), who has also written biographies of directors Altman, Cukor, Hitchcock and Eastwood, plunges into Ray's majestic and messy story with his customary assiduousness, creating a clear and balanced portrait of a most complex man. Born Raymond Nicholas Kienzle in Wisconsin, Ray soon drifted toward community theater, then radio, then the leftist, experimental theater that flourished in his youth. One of his teachers in Chicago was Thornton Wilder, and Ray, who soon moved to Hollywood, seemed to have met and befriended (and often betrayed) just about every showbiz notable in the third quarter of the 20th century, including Elia Kazan, John Houseman, Gloria Grahame, Howard Hughes, James Dean, Joan Crawford, Natalie Wood, John Wayne, Richard Burton, Gore Vidal, Charlton Heston and myriad others. He was, temporarily, an acolyte of Frank Lloyd Wright and worked with Alan Lomax, Pete Seeger and others in the folk-music scene. Although he never had total control of a film, he still directed about 20, including some that appear on critics' lists of notables—includingThey Live By Night,In a Lonely Place,On Dangerous Ground,Johnny Guitar,King of Kingsand others. His serial womanizing and several marriages (well chronicled here), his struggles with alcohol and drugs, his gambling addiction and his incessant tinkering with scripts all soon made himpersona non grataamong producers.The sad story, well and respectfully told, of an American original struggling with procrustean politics, timorous producers and personal demons.

  Nicholas Ray 
 The Glorious Failure of an American Director 
 By Patrick McGilligan 
 IT Books 
 Copyright © 2011   Patrick McGilligan All right reserved.
 ISBN: 9780060731373 
  Chapter One   Nicholas Ray was a kind of human jigsaw puzzle, the pieces of his mystery   scattered and lost over time.  Many of his films were haunted by bruised young people, threatened,   damaged, or twisted by events beyond their control. Their suffering often   begins in youth, its source a secret buried there.  Mementos of childhood crop up in Ray's films like missing pieces of   the puzzle. Sports trophies line the top of a dresser in the room of an   embittered detective in On Dangerous Ground. A broken-down rodeo   champion finds a rodeo handbill, cap pistol, and tobacco-can bank squirreled   away in a crawl space under his old homestead in The Lusty Men. ("I was   looking for something I thought I lost," he tells an old-timer carrying a   shotgun who interrupts his search.) Sprawled drunkenly on the ground,   James Dean pulls a scrap-paper blankie over a cymbal-banging monkey   toy during the opening credits of Rebel Without a Cause. ("Can I keep it?"   he pleads when arrested.)  Even so, the source of hurt is private and vague and remotenot, as in   the case of another Wisconsin filmmaker, as knowable as a certain   Rosebud sled.  In his films, Ray tended to load the blame on mother and father figures.  The parents in Rebel Without a Cause are fundamentally clueless. The   drug addicted father in Bigger Than Life tries to use a scissors to sacrifice   his young son to God. Fathers are faulted the most in Ray's films, while   mothers linger in the shadows, blurry and complicit.  His unorthodox "heroes" (the drug-addicted father is one) are destined  to fail. The obstacles they face are nothing compared to their own   neuroses. They are burdened above all by their integrity.  Ray's intense, searching visual style mirrored his personal struggles.   His best filmsa list that would arguably include They Live by Night, In   a Lonely Place, On Dangerous Ground, The Lusty Men, Johnny Guitar, Rebel   Without a Cause, Bigger Than Life, Bitter Victory, and Party Girlcan't   easily be categorized. They owe something to Hollywood, where he never   quite fit in, and everything else to his iconoclastic sensibility. First to the    influential French critics of Cahiers du Cinéma and Positif in the  1950s,   and to every succeeding generation of film fans since, Ray has become a   symbol of artistic purity and tragic flaws: a test case of auteurist worship.  In his life, as in his films, everything began at homehope and trouble,  strength and fissures.  .  Home sweet home for Nicholas Ray was an all American city that was   rugged and beautiful, as ideal on the surface as an airbrushed portrait of   the director at the peak of his fame.  Christened as a fur-trading post in 1841, La Crosse was settled on   the eastern banks of the Mississippi River, at the confluence of the Black   and La Crosse Rivers along what would become the border of Wisconsin   (which became a state in 1848) and Minnesota (which followed in 1858).   From a handful of houses, the town swiftly multiplied into a booming   gateway to the West for merchants and adventurers. Germans and Norwegians   swarmed in on packed trains and cattle cars from Milwaukee. By 1880, La    Crosse had grown into the fourth-largest community in Wisconsin.  "Here is a town," declared the former steamboat pilot Samuel Clemens.  a.k.a. Mark Twain, in his 1883 tall-tale memoir and travelogue Life on   the Mississippi, "with electric lighted streets, and blocks of buildings, which    are stately enough and also architecturally fine enough to command respect  in any city. It is a choice town." And a choice setting: With its lush   greenery and majestic bluffs spared by the Ice Age, surrounding fertile   farmlands, crystalline rivers and lakes, dense forests, and plentiful hunting  and fishing, the area was hailed locally as "God's Country."  By the early 1880s, members of a German clan named Kienzle had   reached God's Country. Nicholas Ray's German-born grandparents   stopped briefly in the Teutonic stronghold of Milwaukee before heading   to La Crosse, where they would eventually raise a brood of three sons and   five daughters. Their oldest son, Raymond Nicholas Kienzle, was born in    Milwaukee in 1863; he would wed twice, the first time at a tender age in     Milwaukee, before meeting Nicholas Ray's mother. Kienzle's second   marriage, in La Crosse in 1888, didn't last much longer than the first, though   it produced two daughters, who continued to live near their father after   their parents divorced.  An enigmatic, forbidding figure Raymond N. Kienzle was, as Ray   himself recalled him. In his earliest photographs he wears an ironic smile,   but later in life a walrus mustache and the El Producto cigar invariably   lodged in his mouth gave him the gravitas of a successful tradesman. The   Kienzles were building contractors, specializing in masonry, brick, and   stonework for public edifices and luxurious homes for rich clientele, and in   the 1890s Raymond, the oldest son, took over the family business.  Late in that decade, Kienzle got a big job renovating Gale College, a   Presbyterian institution recently absorbed by the Lutheran ministry, in   the town of Galesville, about twenty-five miles north of La Crosse. While   there he met a quiet and kindhearted woman eleven years his junior.   Slender and bespectacled Olene Toppen, known as Lena, had been raised on   a nearby farm, one of nine children born to parents who were natives of     Norway.  The couple married in 1898 and soon moved onto four acres near   Galesville. Their land included a brickyard factory where Kienzle   employed a handful of workers. Kienzle took local commissions, including   a cement archway entrance to Galesville's High Cliff Park, but also jobs   that took him away for weeks elsewhere in the Midwest and as far as the   Deep South.  All four of the couple's children were born in the small town of Galesville:  three girlsAlice (b. 1900), Ruth (b. 1903), Helen (b. 1905)and, at   last, a son. Raymond Nicholas Kienzle Jr. came bawling into the world on   time he would drop the name "Kienzle," reverse the order of his first and   middle names, and adopt "Nicholas Ray" as his identity.  After he turned fifty, Raymond Sr. decided to cut back on his factory   work and travel. He put the trappings of his businessthe brick machines,   molders and sanders, kiln, sheds and tools, and the Galesville land itself  up for sale, and in stages moved his family back to La Crosse, purchasing   a series of houses co-owned or shared by Kienzle relatives. By 1920 the   Kienzles had landed in a house at 226 West Avenue North, near the corner   of Vine, facing west toward downtown and, just about a mile away, the   river the Indians called "the Father of Waters."  .  Especially after Rebel Without a Cause, the mythology surrounding Nicholas     Ray tended to highlight stories of a misspent  youth, complete with   drinking, truancy, car thievery, brushes with the police, and flirtations   with his father's mistresses.  In many ways, however, his boyhood offers a scrapbook of an   American idyll.  Galesville wasn't far from La Crosse, and in the early years the Kienzles  made regular trips to the bigger city for shopping, holidays, and visits   to relatives. It was the city's first-rate public schools that eventually lured    the family to return there permanently. Although the countryside was still   dotted with a few tepees, and scattered steamboats continued to roam the     Mississippi, by 1920 Mark Twain's "choice town" had transformed itself   from prairie way station to glittering metropolis. La Crosse's streets were   lit with electricity and paved with stone, whizzing with automobiles and   streetcars; most neighborhoods had sidewalks and garbage collection, and   thousands of households had telephones.    La Crosse had cause for civic pride, though the lives of its citizens   were subject to the whims of extreme weather. The wind whipped across   the Mississippiperhaps not quite "like emery cloth tearing across their   faces," as René Hardy wrote of the searing ghibli in Bitter Victory, but    turbulently in the summers and frigidly in the winters. Those winters,   which brought snow and ice before Thanksgiving most years, were the   real endurance test. Yet La Crossians embraced the season with skiing   and skating and an annual winter carnival that featured dozens of floats   and fur-wrapped marching bands and employee clubs representing local   businesses. Ray must have remembered the strong wind, for it often blew   dramatically through key scenes of his filmssending up a murderous   sandstorm in Bitter Victory, howling outside as Mercedes McCambridge   makes her grand entrance in Johnny Guitar, blowing back the hair of the   mourning teenage rebels standing cliff-side in Rebel Without a Cause.  The Kienzles lived on a street with several other Kienzle aunts and   uncles, in a two-story house that was large but not architecturally fine: "a   big yellow barn," remembered Ferdinand Sontag, a neighbor and classmate   of Ray's. The living room featured a parquet floor and an Italian marble   fireplace; antlered heads decorated the walls, and the family's shelves were   crammed with books. There was a separate piano room; Lena Kienzle   played violin, and all her children learned to play at least one   instrument. For supper, the dining room was set with linen and lace; for   parties and holidays, the house filled with relatives, friends, and flowers.  By 1920, Ray's father was semi-retired, but he still took small jobs as   a bricklayer, cement man, and plasterer. He was active in the chamber of   commerce, while his wife earned plaques volunteering with the Red Cross   and Community Chest. Though raised as a Catholic, Raymond Sr. had   been excommunicated after his first divorce; for a time he joined the   Congregational Church, but eventually drifted away from organized religion.   His wife, brought up as a strict Lutheran, trended toward Methodism and   faithfully took her children to ser vices and Sunday school. Ray Jr. had   been steeped in the Bible, long before the temerity of his film King of Kings.  Ray Jr. was a Boy Scout, a good boy who delivered patriotic speeches in   grade school. On Election Day in 1924, as President Calvin Coolidge faced   off against Democratic candidate John W. Davis and Wisconsin Progressive  Robert M. La Follette Sr., the thirteen-year-old eighth-grader urged   his Lincoln Junior High School classmates to remind their parents to vote.  All three of Ray's sisters doted on their young brother, the only boy in   the family. His siblings were all pretty, with wavy hair like their mother's,   good-humored but serious-minded, anxious to leave home and La Crosse.  They also nursed ambitions beyond marriage. The eldest, Alice, had   already graduated from nursing school by the time of her young brother's   Election Day speech; after exchanging vows in the Kienzle living room,   she moved with her husband to Madison, the college town that was swiftly   surpassing La Crosse in size and prospects and glamour. The next-oldest   sister, Ruth, was on the verge of departing for Chicago. One by one the   girls leftwith Ray Jr.'s favorite, Helen, closest to him in age, the last to  go.  Ray felt particularly close to Helenclose enough that, in one of his   autobiographical jottings, he confessed that his first crush was on her.   "Ever since I was four and she was nine I've wanted to make it with my   sister Helen," he noted wryly, "because she was my sister." Years later,   reflecting on some of his adult relationships, he would joke about a history of    similar improprieties and feeling "bent towards incest with other people's   children and wives, ex-wives, and daughters and such."  By the time Ray was a freshman at La Crosse Central High School,   Helen too had graduated and was planning her escape. The table settings   dwindled at home. Ray felt abandoned and lonesome, and this loneliness,   which was with him from earliest memory, never abated. It was fundamental  to his character and the themes of his filmswhich were often preoccupied  with "the loneliness of man," he noted, peopled by characters who   suffer "much agony and much searching," culminating in a private despair.  In youth and manhood alike, Ray too was a soul-searcher in tortured   colloquy with himself.  .  His mother lavished attention on the girls, but when it came to Ray Jr. she   deferred to her husband.  Raymond N. Kienzle Sr. was tall, his size and erect carriage lending   him a larger-than-life air. The filmmaker romanticized his father later   in life, once boasting that Raymond Sr. had "built levees, docking areas   for steamboats and dykes against floods," as well as "colleges, creameries,   whorehouses, cathedrals, and breweries." Beyond his success as a contractor,  his father had other positive qualities: Raymond Sr. loved music and   literature, politically a Republican, he was known to speak out against   racial prejudice at the dinner table. In 1924 he may even have voted for the   spoiler La Follette, who carried only one stateWisconsin.  But Raymond Sr. cast a formidable shadow. His son's delinquency   started as early as his Boy Scout years, by which time he was already smoking  and drinking and playing hooky. A stern disciplinarian, the father had   an iron fist, punishing his son physically for his indiscretions. And there   was something else: As the director put it once, he was raised under "the   lash of alcoholism." Though Lena Kienzle was a teetotaler, her husband   was a dedicated alcoholic. Drinking was one way to imitate his father. "All   during childhood and Prohibition," the filmmaker recalled years later,   "there was booze in the house, and on the street. At home it was for stealing.  I stole my first pint at ten. On the street it was for buyinggrain alcohol  mixed with sugar and hot waterwith money stolen from home. . . .   "I learned about Aqua Velva long before I started shaving. No, I didn't   drink it. I poured it over the sheets or into the bathtub to clear the smell   of my puke."   The household was filled with tension. Ray's parents slept in separate   bedrooms, and after dinner Raymond Sr. often disappeared, prowling   a city that despite Prohibition was flush with speakeasies and saloons.   Sometimes he didn't come home until the next day.   "If he had the guts to knock Mom cold once," Jim Stark ( James Dean)   muses harshly in Rebel Without a Cause, "then maybe she'd be happy and   stop picking on him."   (Continues...)

  From award-winning biographer Patrick McGilligan comes an eye-opening life of the troubled filmmaker behind Rebel Without a Cause   Nicholas Ray spent the glory years of his career creating films that were dark, emotionally charged, and haunted by social misfits and bruised young people consumed by private anguishfrom his career-defining debut, They Live by Night (1948), to his enduring masterwork, Rebel Without a Cause (1955); from the noir thriller In a Lonely Place (1950), pairing his second wife, the blond bombshell Gloria Grahame, with Humphrey Bogart, to cult pictures like Johnny Guitar (1954) and Bigger Than Life (1956). Yet his work on-screen is more than matched by the passions and struggles of his personal storyone of the most dramatic lives of any major Hollywood filmmaker.   In Nicholas Ray: The Glorious Failure of an American Director, Patrick McGilligan offers a revelatory biography of Ray, a man whose troubled life was marked by creative peaks and valleys alike. As a young man, Ray personified the rambling spirit of twentieth-century America, learning from luminaries like Thornton Wilder and Frank Lloyd Wright; mingling with future legends like Elia Kazan, Joseph Losey, and John Houseman; and carousing with musicians like Lead Belly and Woody Guthrie. Notoriously self-destructive but irresistibly alluringto men and women alikeRay empathized with the broken and misunderstood, a talent that allowed him to create characters of true complexity on-screen.   His youthful association with radical politics nearly killed his nascent film careeruntil a secret agreement to cooperate with the House Committee on Un-American Activities saved him. His tumultuous second marriage, to Grahame, was shattered after Ray found her in bed with his teenage son from his first marriage. He romanced stars and starlets, including Marilyn Monroe, Shelley Winters, Joan Crawford, and the teenage Natalie Wood, but never enjoyed a stable home life.   The triumph of Rebel Without a Cause, his masterpiece of teenage angst, led to a burgeoning partnership with James Dean, but Deans untimely death devastated the filmmaker, who fell into a spiral of drinking and drug addiction. Less than a decade later, Rays career was effectively over . . . until the adoration of European critics, and a frantic last-ditch burst of creativity, nearly restored him to glory before his tragic early death in 1979.   Meticulously detailed and compulsively readable, this new biography reconstructs the tortuous journey of one of the most enduringly fascinating figures in American film.

This book does much to illuminate the trajectory of his life and career, placing it clearly and insightfully in the proletarian mindset of the 30s Depression. It does a lot to flesh out the enormous network of artists, actors, directors and leftwing provocateurs that were influential in and part of his life. He knew and worked with literally dozens, if not hundreds of people that are considered consecrated contributors to that zeitgeist. Also, I came to the reading of this book feeling closer than a mere film student's appreciation having known some of the people that were part of Ray's entourage when he was in Spain and Italy in the 50s -- members of the extended family surrounding his wife Betty Uitti (the correct Finnish spelling, not Uttey, the mispelling propagated in the book) -- as well as having heard Ray speak during his Chicago 7 trial days. A key draw for film students is McGilligan's development of the history of the production of Ray's first film, They Live By Night. McGilligan succeeds in making it an epic tale of artistic triumph over, not just studio mammon, but production code censorship as well as weaving it tightly into the framework of Ray's life to that point.I do not agree with the author's conclusion in the subtitle that Ray was a failure. He was emphatically not a failure, he just never won an Oscar and, thus, wasn't John Huston, much less John Ford, in his contributions and stature.Read more0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse4.0 out of 5 starsThe so so old daysByPaul Ehrmannon August 21, 2015Verified PurchaseGood story about an artist who let his personal life intrude on his creative arena.

Editorial Reviews


Publishers Weekly
Film biographer McGilligan (Oscar Micheaux) traces the rise of eccentric director Nicholas Ray in this slow-paced biography. Born Raymond Nicholas Kienzle Jr. in 1911, the charismatic Ray grew up in La Crosse, Wis., and became drawn to theater. He later organized agitprop theater in New York—though he'd give secret testimony to HUAC—before leaving for Hollywood with his friend and quasi-mentor, Elia Kazan. Ray's first film, They Live By Night, completed in 1947, wasn't released in America until 1949, after winning raves in Europe, where he'd been popular, especially with the French. Knock on Any Door (1949) and In a Lonely Place (1950)—both starring Humphrey Bogart—put him on the map, even as his shaky personal life threatened to destroy him. Yet even Ray's penchant for alcohol, coupled with a growing number of ex-wives, couldn't dampen the success of 1955's Rebel Without a Cause, his only Oscar-nominated film. But Rebel was the beginning of the end, and while Ray had later limited success, bizarre on-set behavior made him a virtual Hollywood pariah until his death in 1979. McGilligan, meticulous in the details, too often plods through the material without imbuing it with any of the director's signature flair. (July)

Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel
“[A] portrait of a filmmaker who managed over time to upstage the movies that made him celebrated.”

Booklist
“McGilligan limns the tragic trajectory of Ray’s career with insight and compassion.”

Kirkus Reviews
A veteran biographer of film legends records the sad career arc of Nicholas Ray (1911–1979),the director of one of Hollywood's most iconic films,Rebel Without a Cause(1955).McGilligan (Oscar Micheaux: The Great and Only, 2007, etc.), who has also written biographies of directors Altman, Cukor, Hitchcock and Eastwood, plunges into Ray's majestic and messy story with his customary assiduousness, creating a clear and balanced portrait of a most complex man. Born Raymond Nicholas Kienzle in Wisconsin, Ray soon drifted toward community theater, then radio, then the leftist, experimental theater that flourished in his youth. One of his teachers in Chicago was Thornton Wilder, and Ray, who soon moved to Hollywood, seemed to have met and befriended (and often betrayed) just about every showbiz notable in the third quarter of the 20th century, including Elia Kazan, John Houseman, Gloria Grahame, Howard Hughes, James Dean, Joan Crawford, Natalie Wood, John Wayne, Richard Burton, Gore Vidal, Charlton Heston and myriad others. He was, temporarily, an acolyte of Frank Lloyd Wright and worked with Alan Lomax, Pete Seeger and others in the folk-music scene. Although he never had total control of a film, he still directed about 20, including some that appear on critics' lists of notables—includingThey Live By Night,In a Lonely Place,On Dangerous Ground,Johnny Guitar,King of Kingsand others. His serial womanizing and several marriages (well chronicled here), his struggles with alcohol and drugs, his gambling addiction and his incessant tinkering with scripts all soon made himpersona non grataamong producers.The sad story, well and respectfully told, of an American original struggling with procrustean politics, timorous producers and personal demons.

  Nicholas Ray 
 The Glorious Failure of an American Director 
 By Patrick McGilligan

 ISBN: 9780060731373 
  Chapter One   Nicholas Ray was a kind of human jigsaw puzzle, the pieces of his mystery   scattered and lost over time.  Many of his films were haunted by bruised young people, threatened,   damaged, or twisted by events beyond their control. Their suffering often   begins in youth, its source a secret buried there.  Mementos of childhood crop up in Ray's films like missing pieces of   the puzzle. Sports trophies line the top of a dresser in the room of an   embittered detective in On Dangerous Ground. A broken-down rodeo   champion finds a rodeo handbill, cap pistol, and tobacco-can bank squirreled   away in a crawl space under his old homestead in The Lusty Men. ("I was   looking for something I thought I lost," he tells an old-timer carrying a   shotgun who interrupts his search.) Sprawled drunkenly on the ground,   James Dean pulls a scrap-paper blankie over a cymbal-banging monkey   toy during the opening credits of Rebel Without a Cause. ("Can I keep it?"   he pleads when arrested.)  Even so, the source of hurt is private and vague and remotenot, as in   the case of another Wisconsin filmmaker, as knowable as a certain   Rosebud sled.  In his films, Ray tended to load the blame on mother and father figures.  The parents in Rebel Without a Cause are fundamentally clueless. The   drug addicted father in Bigger Than Life tries to use a scissors to sacrifice   his young son to God. Fathers are faulted the most in Ray's films, while   mothers linger in the shadows, blurry and complicit.  His unorthodox "heroes" (the drug-addicted father is one) are destined  to fail. The obstacles they face are nothing compared to their own   neuroses. They are burdened above all by their integrity.  Ray's intense, searching visual style mirrored his personal struggles.   His best filmsa list that would arguably include They Live by Night, In   a Lonely Place, On Dangerous Ground, The Lusty Men, Johnny Guitar, Rebel   Without a Cause, Bigger Than Life, Bitter Victory, and Party Girlcan't   easily be categorized. They owe something to Hollywood, where he never   quite fit in, and everything else to his iconoclastic sensibility. First to the    influential French critics of Cahiers du Cinéma and Positif in the  1950s,   and to every succeeding generation of film fans since, Ray has become a   symbol of artistic purity and tragic flaws: a test case of auteurist worship.  In his life, as in his films, everything began at homehope and trouble,  strength and fissures.  .  Home sweet home for Nicholas Ray was an all American city that was   rugged and beautiful, as ideal on the surface as an airbrushed portrait of   the director at the peak of his fame.  Christened as a fur-trading post in 1841, La Crosse was settled on   the eastern banks of the Mississippi River, at the confluence of the Black   and La Crosse Rivers along what would become the border of Wisconsin   (which became a state in 1848) and Minnesota (which followed in 1858).   From a handful of houses, the town swiftly multiplied into a booming   gateway to the West for merchants and adventurers. Germans and Norwegians   swarmed in on packed trains and cattle cars from Milwaukee. By 1880, La    Crosse had grown into the fourth-largest community in Wisconsin.  "Here is a town," declared the former steamboat pilot Samuel Clemens.  a.k.a. Mark Twain, in his 1883 tall-tale memoir and travelogue Life on   the Mississippi, "with electric lighted streets, and blocks of buildings, which    are stately enough and also architecturally fine enough to command respect  in any city. It is a choice town." And a choice setting: With its lush   greenery and majestic bluffs spared by the Ice Age, surrounding fertile   farmlands, crystalline rivers and lakes, dense forests, and plentiful hunting  and fishing, the area was hailed locally as "God's Country."  By the early 1880s, members of a German clan named Kienzle had   reached God's Country. Nicholas Ray's German-born grandparents   stopped briefly in the Teutonic stronghold of Milwaukee before heading   to La Crosse, where they would eventually raise a brood of three sons and   five daughters. Their oldest son, Raymond Nicholas Kienzle, was born in    Milwaukee in 1863; he would wed twice, the first time at a tender age in     Milwaukee, before meeting Nicholas Ray's mother. Kienzle's second   marriage, in La Crosse in 1888, didn't last much longer than the first, though   it produced two daughters, who continued to live near their father after   their parents divorced.  An enigmatic, forbidding figure Raymond N. Kienzle was, as Ray   himself recalled him. In his earliest photographs he wears an ironic smile,   but later in life a walrus mustache and the El Producto cigar invariably   lodged in his mouth gave him the gravitas of a successful tradesman. The   Kienzles were building contractors, specializing in masonry, brick, and   stonework for public edifices and luxurious homes for rich clientele, and in   the 1890s Raymond, the oldest son, took over the family business.  Late in that decade, Kienzle got a big job renovating Gale College, a   Presbyterian institution recently absorbed by the Lutheran ministry, in   the town of Galesville, about twenty-five miles north of La Crosse. While   there he met a quiet and kindhearted woman eleven years his junior.   Slender and bespectacled Olene Toppen, known as Lena, had been raised on   a nearby farm, one of nine children born to parents who were natives of     Norway.  The couple married in 1898 and soon moved onto four acres near   Galesville. Their land included a brickyard factory where Kienzle   employed a handful of workers. Kienzle took local commissions, including   a cement archway entrance to Galesville's High Cliff Park, but also jobs   that took him away for weeks elsewhere in the Midwest and as far as the   Deep South.  All four of the couple's children were born in the small town of Galesville:  three girlsAlice (b. 1900), Ruth (b. 1903), Helen (b. 1905)and, at   last, a son. Raymond Nicholas Kienzle Jr. came bawling into the world on   time he would drop the name "Kienzle," reverse the order of his first and   middle names, and adopt "Nicholas Ray" as his identity.  After he turned fifty, Raymond Sr. decided to cut back on his factory   work and travel. He put the trappings of his businessthe brick machines,   molders and sanders, kiln, sheds and tools, and the Galesville land itself  up for sale, and in stages moved his family back to La Crosse, purchasing   a series of houses co-owned or shared by Kienzle relatives. By 1920 the   Kienzles had landed in a house at 226 West Avenue North, near the corner   of Vine, facing west toward downtown and, just about a mile away, the   river the Indians called "the Father of Waters."  .  Especially after Rebel Without a Cause, the mythology surrounding Nicholas     Ray tended to highlight stories of a misspent  youth, complete with   drinking, truancy, car thievery, brushes with the police, and flirtations   with his father's mistresses.  In many ways, however, his boyhood offers a scrapbook of an   American idyll.  Galesville wasn't far from La Crosse, and in the early years the Kienzles  made regular trips to the bigger city for shopping, holidays, and visits   to relatives. It was the city's first-rate public schools that eventually lured    the family to return there permanently. Although the countryside was still   dotted with a few tepees, and scattered steamboats continued to roam the     Mississippi, by 1920 Mark Twain's "choice town" had transformed itself   from prairie way station to glittering metropolis. La Crosse's streets were   lit with electricity and paved with stone, whizzing with automobiles and   streetcars; most neighborhoods had sidewalks and garbage collection, and   thousands of households had telephones.    La Crosse had cause for civic pride, though the lives of its citizens   were subject to the whims of extreme weather. The wind whipped across   the Mississippiperhaps not quite "like emery cloth tearing across their   faces," as René Hardy wrote of the searing ghibli in Bitter Victory, but    turbulently in the summers and frigidly in the winters. Those winters,   which brought snow and ice before Thanksgiving most years, were the   real endurance test. Yet La Crossians embraced the season with skiing   and skating and an annual winter carnival that featured dozens of floats   and fur-wrapped marching bands and employee clubs representing local   businesses. Ray must have remembered the strong wind, for it often blew   dramatically through key scenes of his filmssending up a murderous   sandstorm in Bitter Victory, howling outside as Mercedes McCambridge   makes her grand entrance in Johnny Guitar, blowing back the hair of the   mourning teenage rebels standing cliff-side in Rebel Without a Cause.  The Kienzles lived on a street with several other Kienzle aunts and   uncles, in a two-story house that was large but not architecturally fine: "a   big yellow barn," remembered Ferdinand Sontag, a neighbor and classmate   of Ray's. The living room featured a parquet floor and an Italian marble   fireplace; antlered heads decorated the walls, and the family's shelves were   crammed with books. There was a separate piano room; Lena Kienzle   played violin, and all her children learned to play at least one   instrument. For supper, the dining room was set with linen and lace; for   parties and holidays, the house filled with relatives, friends, and flowers.  By 1920, Ray's father was semi-retired, but he still took small jobs as   a bricklayer, cement man, and plasterer. He was active in the chamber of   commerce, while his wife earned plaques volunteering with the Red Cross   and Community Chest. Though raised as a Catholic, Raymond Sr. had   been excommunicated after his first divorce; for a time he joined the   Congregational Church, but eventually drifted away from organized religion.   His wife, brought up as a strict Lutheran, trended toward Methodism and   faithfully took her children to ser vices and Sunday school. Ray Jr. had   been steeped in the Bible, long before the temerity of his film King of Kings.  Ray Jr. was a Boy Scout, a good boy who delivered patriotic speeches in   grade school. On Election Day in 1924, as President Calvin Coolidge faced   off against Democratic candidate John W. Davis and Wisconsin Progressive  Robert M. La Follette Sr., the thirteen-year-old eighth-grader urged   his Lincoln Junior High School classmates to remind their parents to vote.  All three of Ray's sisters doted on their young brother, the only boy in   the family. His siblings were all pretty, with wavy hair like their mother's,   good-humored but serious-minded, anxious to leave home and La Crosse.  They also nursed ambitions beyond marriage. The eldest, Alice, had   already graduated from nursing school by the time of her young brother's   Election Day speech; after exchanging vows in the Kienzle living room,   she moved with her husband to Madison, the college town that was swiftly   surpassing La Crosse in size and prospects and glamour. The next-oldest   sister, Ruth, was on the verge of departing for Chicago. One by one the   girls leftwith Ray Jr.'s favorite, Helen, closest to him in age, the last to  go.  Ray felt particularly close to Helenclose enough that, in one of his   autobiographical jottings, he confessed that his first crush was on her.   "Ever since I was four and she was nine I've wanted to make it with my   sister Helen," he noted wryly, "because she was my sister." Years later,   reflecting on some of his adult relationships, he would joke about a history of    similar improprieties and feeling "bent towards incest with other people's   children and wives, ex-wives, and daughters and such."  By the time Ray was a freshman at La Crosse Central High School,   Helen too had graduated and was planning her escape. The table settings   dwindled at home. Ray felt abandoned and lonesome, and this loneliness,   which was with him from earliest memory, never abated. It was fundamental  to his character and the themes of his filmswhich were often preoccupied  with "the loneliness of man," he noted, peopled by characters who   suffer "much agony and much searching," culminating in a private despair.  In youth and manhood alike, Ray too was a soul-searcher in tortured   colloquy with himself.  .  His mother lavished attention on the girls, but when it came to Ray Jr. she   deferred to her husband.  Raymond N. Kienzle Sr. was tall, his size and erect carriage lending   him a larger-than-life air. The filmmaker romanticized his father later   in life, once boasting that Raymond Sr. had "built levees, docking areas   for steamboats and dykes against floods," as well as "colleges, creameries,   whorehouses, cathedrals, and breweries." Beyond his success as a contractor,  his father had other positive qualities: Raymond Sr. loved music and   literature, politically a Republican, he was known to speak out against   racial prejudice at the dinner table. In 1924 he may even have voted for the   spoiler La Follette, who carried only one stateWisconsin.  But Raymond Sr. cast a formidable shadow. His son's delinquency   started as early as his Boy Scout years, by which time he was already smoking  and drinking and playing hooky. A stern disciplinarian, the father had   an iron fist, punishing his son physically for his indiscretions. And there   was something else: As the director put it once, he was raised under "the   lash of alcoholism." Though Lena Kienzle was a teetotaler, her husband   was a dedicated alcoholic. Drinking was one way to imitate his father. "All   during childhood and Prohibition," the filmmaker recalled years later,   "there was booze in the house, and on the street. At home it was for stealing.  I stole my first pint at ten. On the street it was for buyinggrain alcohol  mixed with sugar and hot waterwith money stolen from home. . . .   "I learned about Aqua Velva long before I started shaving. No, I didn't   drink it. I poured it over the sheets or into the bathtub to clear the smell   of my puke."   The household was filled with tension. Ray's parents slept in separate   bedrooms, and after dinner Raymond Sr. often disappeared, prowling   a city that despite Prohibition was flush with speakeasies and saloons.   Sometimes he didn't come home until the next day.   "If he had the guts to knock Mom cold once," Jim Stark ( James Dean)   muses harshly in Rebel Without a Cause, "then maybe she'd be happy and   stop picking on him."   (Continues...)
