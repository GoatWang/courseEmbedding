Walter Woltosz
The professional career of Walter S. (Walt) Woltosz testifies to the potential of an engineering mind to impact the world. Combining his engineering knowledge with a problem-solving approach, Woltosz has established himself as an engineer who has improved the quality of life for people worldwide. His commitment to Auburn Engineering, and his recognition of the value of graduate education, led him to make a generous gift to the college’s graduate fellowship program. In recognition of his support, students who hold graduate fellowships within the college are known as Woltosz Fellows.
Woltosz holds bachelor’s and master’s degrees from Auburn University in aerospace engineering, 1969 and 1977, and a master's in administrative science from the University of Alabama in Huntsville. He worked as an electronics engineer with the Federal Aviation Administration and later with Northrop Services developing simulation/optimization computer programming for the space shuttle ascent trajectory. During his 13-year career in the aerospace industry, Woltosz pioneered and managed the development of software for the simulation and optimization of a wide range of solid propellant rocket motors and missile systems, including the space shuttle, Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM), Midgetman small intercontinental ballistic missile, and the Pegasus air-launched satellite booster.
In 1981, he established Words+, Inc., a company that designs, manufactures and sells computer-based communication systems. He is internationally known for being the first person to create an integrated communications system based on a personal computer, and his work in this area radically transformed the way in which people with disabilities communicate. In 1986, Woltosz and his team developed the first system with adaptive word prediction and developed the comprehensive ACES (Augmentative Communication Evaluation System) – the largest software development project undertaken in the field. His innovative communication systems have been used by people with disabilities throughout the world, including author Sir Stephen Hawking, the world-renowned astrophysicist who has suffered from Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) for decades.
Having developed an array of innovations for the augmentative communication field, Woltosz turned his attention to a broader scope, and in 1996, he created Simulations Plus, Inc., a leader in groundbreaking drug discovery and simulation software for conducting drug research. Simulations Plus is a major developer of absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) neural net and simulation software for the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. The company’s software allows pharmaceutical scientists to predict certain key potential drug dynamics, helping reduce multi-million dollar clinical trial failures and speeding up the time to market of effective new medications.
Woltosz holds the Distinguished Auburn Engineer Award and is a member of the State of Alabama Engineering Hall of Fame. He is a member of the Auburn Alumni Engineering Council, the Engineering Keystone Society, the Engineering Eagles Society, and the Engineering Ginn Society, as well as the 1856 Society and the All American Society. In addition to his support of the graduate fellowship program, he has provided funding for several endowed professorships and supports the college’s Formula and Baja SAE student competition teams.

Nomination Form




Walter Stanley WoltoszFirst Word in Computer SimulationInducted in 2008As a 12-year-old in western New York, Walt Woltosz learned Morse code to obtain a ham radio license; its dots and dashes communicated without speech. In adulthood, Woltosz made it his mission to help physically disabled people generate words they could not speak. University of Cambridge Professor Stephen Hawking gives lectures on astrophysics using technology Woltosz developed. Hawking’s fame means many of us have heard Woltosz’s “Words+ Equalizer,” though perhaps we had not heard of it. (Hawking wrote A Brief History of Time using the system.)
Woltosz, chief executive officer of Words+ and its parent company, publicly traded Simulations Plus Inc., entered engineering as an aerospace enthusiast. Having a love for flying, he joined the Air Force in 1963 and was tapped for a commissioning program and sent to Auburn in 1967 after four years in the Strategic Air Command. He completed his bachelor’s in aerospace engineering in 1969, his master’s coursework in 1970, and then received a National Science Foundation doctoral fellowship, which he declined because of the poor aerospace economy in 1970. Woltosz later became a recognized expert in simulating and optimizing rocket and missile performance.
Change came rocketing in 1981 with the incorporation of Words+, a company built on Woltosz’s effort to help his wife’s mother, who had Lou Gehrig’s disease. Woltosz shopped one evening for a home computer—new in stores then—determined to repurpose it for his mother-in-law’s needs. By morning, he had a first iteration; within two decades, its progeny was in the Smithsonian Institution.
Words+ offered the first personal-computer-based augmentative communication system. More life-changing firsts followed: first portable  speech synthesizer, first keyboard emulator with integrated speech, first use of word prediction, first picture-based system for preliterate users. Each advance signified a further unlocking of human potential—what had driven Woltosz from rocket science into a business with an old-fashioned key as its logo.
The passion he had developed in aerospace for computer simulation and modeling drove Woltosz to apply these technologies in health care, landing on “simulation of oral drug absorption,” a way to minimize animal testing, failed clinical trials, delays, and cost. Woltosz launched Simulations Plus in 1996. Eleven years later, nearly 100 firms license the company’s software, and Woltosz is an acknowledged leader in the emerging science of computational biopharmaceutics. The company’s flagship program, GastroPlus, shifted the paradigm in an industry that had invariably based decisions on empirical tests.
Simulations Plus also developed molecular-property-predicting software, which uses a molecule’s structure alone to anticipate its behavior. The staff of life scientists and engineers—most of whom program—saw their firm’s earnings rise 1,384 percent in the first six months of fiscal 2007.
Woltosz contributes generously to Auburn University engineering. He holds membership in the AU Engineering Keystone and Engineering Eagles societies, serves on the Alumni Engineering Council, and received the Distinguished Auburn Engineer Award. Words+ provides scholarships for disabled Americans and helped found CAMA, a group who sponsors conferences that bring together new products and disabled people who need them.
Woltosz and his wife, Ginger, are California residents. Ginger has a master of business administration and is a director of Simulations Plus.

This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 
Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.
What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.
