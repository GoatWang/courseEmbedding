The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

A book is the nearest thing we have to telepathy, sending thoughts from the author's mind directly to the readers even over a gap of two thousand years. Even with all our technology, there is no better way to make a brain to brain connection than by simply reading a book. Go Way Back to the BeginningAntique books and manuscripts offer an amazing look into history, you can see the thoughts of the past as they saw them themselves. Antiquarian and collectible books don't just look good on the shelf, they also grow in value. There is nothing like picking up an old book to really feel the past. Explore the Human ConditionThe beauty of fiction and literature is that it lets you explore the human condition in a way that mere recitations of fact can never duplicate. Rather than focusing on the mundane, these books bring out the emotional truth of human experience. They show you who you really are by exposing you to other experiences you could never have discovered yourself. These books are the underpinnings of human culture. See how someone else sees the world. Discover the World Around YouNon fiction books offer the widest range of human experience, joined only by their commitment to the truth. From self-help to space travel, they run the gamut of human thought. Learn how to deal with your family, how to save money for that trip, or how the Egyptians built the pyramids. Follow famous lives, or study esoteric philosophies. It's all there for you to find. Non fiction gives us the foundations of human civilization, the story of how everything works. Keep Learning for LifeEducation is the gateway to success, and textbooks are your key to that door. From elementary readers to calculus texts, these books are the doors to our full potential. Textbooks not only give us facts, they give us the tools to interpret and make use of those facts. They are the key to organizing our thoughts and making our brains work for us. It's not just academia either, mechanics textbooks can help you learn how to fix your car.Tell us what you think - opens in new window or tabSide Refine PanelShop by CategoryAntique Books and ManuscriptsAudiobooksBook & Magazine Wholesale & Bulk LotsSee all in Book & Magazine Wholesale & Bulk LotsBook Wholesale LotsOther Book & Magazine Wholesale & Bulk LotsWholesale AudiobooksWholesale MagazinesBook AccessoriesSee all in Book AccessoriesAddress BooksBlank Diaries & JournalsBook CoversBook LightsBook PlatesBook Stands & HoldersBookendsBookmarksOther Book AccessoriesCatalogsSee all in CatalogsAgriculture CatalogsArt & Exhibitions CatalogsAuction CatalogsClothing & Fashion CatalogsDepartment Stores CatalogsMusic & Instruments CatalogsOther CatalogsOwner's Manuals CatalogsToys & Hobbies CatalogsChildren & Young Adult BooksSee all in Children & Young Adult BooksChildren & YA Non-Fiction BooksChildren's Fiction BooksChildren's Picture BooksOther Children & Young Adult BooksYoung Adult Fiction BooksCookbooksFiction & Literature BooksMagazine Back IssuesNonfiction BooksOther BooksTextbooks & Educational Books

Fiction isn't about the facts of events, but rather about the emotional truths that come from being human. The best novels teach the reader things about themselves that they could never have learned from personal experience.Collect the Classics of LiteratureLiterature has been around almost as long as language has. The plays of Aeschylus and Aristophanes are thousands of years old, and even those of Shakespeare are over four hundred. Antiquarian books not only look impressive on your bookshelf, but they let you see literature the way it was meant to be seen. They also make great collectibles, often growing in value over the years.Horror's One True KingFew names conjure a sense of horror on the page quite like Stephen King. Maine's prodigal son is one of the best known authors of the last half-century having written such bestsellers as "The Stand," "It," and "Salem's Lot." Known best for horror, King has the ability to capture an era of small town America like no author before or since. With King you can read the stories behind such movies as "Stand by Me," and even "The Shawshank Redemption."It's Just a Matter of GenreFrom romance to fantasy, and mystery to science fiction, fiction comes in a wide variety of genres. The beauty of reading genre fiction is that you always know what you're going to get. Every category romance has a happy ever after ending; that's the defining feature of the genre. Every mystery can be figured out through logical reasoning. It's all about finding the right story.Find the Right FormatFiction and Literature books come in three major formats: hardcover, trade paperback, and mass market paperback. Hardcovers are the largest, traditionally sewn together and built to last. Trade paperbacks are almost the size of hardcovers, and provide a balance between the bulk of a hardcover and the portability of a mass market paperback. Mass market paperbacks are the smallest of the three formats, designed to provide portable and often disposable fiction.Tell us what you think - opens in new window or tabSide Refine PanelShop by CategoryBooksFiction & Literature BooksBook AccessoriesAntique Books and ManuscriptsAudiobooksCatalogsChildren & Young Adult BooksCookbooksMagazine Back IssuesNonfiction BooksTextbooks & Educational BooksBook & Magazine Wholesale & Bulk LotsOther BooksFormatsee allHardcoverPaperbackPublication Yearsee all1800-18991900-19491950-19992000-20102011-NowSubjectsee allAction, AdventureClassicsFantasyHorrorLiterature, ModernMystery, ThrillerRomanceScience FictionSpecial Attributessee all1st EditionDust JacketEx-LibraryIllustratedLarge PrintSignedLanguagesee allConditionsee allBrand NewLike NewVery GoodGoodAcceptableNot SpecifiedPricePlease provide a valid price range$-$Buying Formatsee allAll ListingsAuctionBuy It NowItem Locationsee allDefaultWithindistance2 miles5 miles10 miles15 miles20 miles50 miles75 miles100 miles150 miles200 miles500 miles750 miles1000 miles1500 miles2000 milesofGoUS OnlyNorth AmericaWorldwideDelivery Optionssee allFree ShippingFree In-store PickupShow onlysee allReturns AcceptedCompleted ItemsSold ItemsDeals & SavingsMore refinements...

How Sundial Brands CEO Richelieu Dennis Is Challenging Segregation In The Beauty Aisle

On a mission: SheaMoisture CEO Richelieu Dennis is persuading retailers to move his products off of the “ethnic” beauty shelves.
By Elizabeth Segran5 minute ReadThere are few places in American life where putting up a sign separating ethnicities is considered even remotely acceptable. So why should the beauty aisle at your local drugstore be an exception? There, you’re likely to find that shampoos and moisturizers for African-American women are not located in the main beauty section, but are on separate shelves marked “ethnic.” In April of this year, SheaMoisture, the natural beauty brand of choice for millions of black consumers, decided to rattle those shelves.advertisement

Related:



SheaMoisture Brings “Ethnic” Empowerment To The Beauty Aisle
SheaMoisture’s #BreakTheWalls campaign, created with Droga5, included an online call to action and its first national TV commercial. The 60-second spot took viewers through a store from the perspective of women of color, depicting how unpleasant the simple act of buying beauty products can be.“Is ‘ethnic’ not beautiful?” the narrator asks. “Am I not beautiful?” The video went viral, garnering 1 million views within the first 24 hours and more than 4 million views over the next three weeks, while the accompanying hashtag earned SheaMoisture 300 million impressions on social media.

Heritage brand: Dennis based his original shea butter products on his grandmother’s recipes.
The campaign’s architect was Richelieu Dennis, the founder and CEO of Sundial Brands, which includes SheaMoisture, Nubian Heritage, and the recently launched Madam C.J. Walker Beauty Culture, a premium hair-care line exclusively available at Sephora. Sundial pulled in an estimated $200 million in revenue in 2015, an increase of 31% year-over-year. Such growth caught the attention of Bain Capital, which in September 2015 acquired a minority stake in the family-owned company for an undisclosed amount, valuing it at an estimated $700 million.

It Takes A Village
A cornerstone of SheaMoisture’s operation is its fair-trade production program that helps benefit suppliers. Here’s how it works.
Find Female Suppliers
Sundial starts by identifying high-quality sources for its ingredients, including shea butter, shea soap, and baobab oil. The company currently buys from more than 2,500 women in Ghana and Turkey, and plans to add suppliers in Brazil, Jamaica, Kenya, and Morocco this year.
Put Community First
The company’s Community Commerce team works with suppliers to identify local needs. “We see what investments Sundial can make that will improve their lives, like making the process more environmentally friendly or bringing piped water into the area,” says Sean Hall, VP of Community Commerce.
Create The Products
After harvesting, ingredients are sent to Savannah Fruits, a Ghana-based company that weighs and tests them before shipping them to Sundial’s factories in New York and Amsterdam, where they undergo chemical-free refining and are added to products.
Complete The Circle
SheaMoisture creates nearly four dozen Community Commerce–labeled products, which are distributed to more than 20 leading retailers nationwide. Ten percent of the gross sales of these items are channeled back into Community Commerce initiatives.

Bain—and Dennis—are betting on the same thing: That Sundial’s multicultural products will have mass appeal when placed outside the ethnic aisle. And with SheaMoisture recently surpassing Burt’s Bees as the top-selling natural brand in the bath and body category in the U.S., their faith seems well-placed. With the investment from Bain, Dennis expects Sundial’s distribution footprint to grow from its current 25,000 stores, which include CVS, Walmart, and Target, to a total of 45,000 by next year. “People want ingredients they can pronounce, that have a history and a story to them,” says Dennis.The brand has come a long way from 25 years ago, when Dennis was living in New York City and hawking shea-butter shampoos by the pound on the streets of Harlem. At the time, Dennis was displaced in the United States as civil war broke out in his native Liberia. “Our home was destroyed,” he says. “We had to ask ourselves what to do to survive until we could return.” Dennis, his mother, and a close friend from college turned to the family business: In Africa, his grandmother had supported her children by crafting soaps and lotions from local plants. Using her recipes, Dennis’s family began making natural beauty products in their tiny Queens apartment. Dennis recalls struggling to convince potential buyers that they weren’t just selling snake oil. “There weren’t any natural beauty companies serving multicultural consumers,” he says.Natural is now becoming the norm. Over the past six years, the natural beauty market has seen double-digit growth; it’s currently worth $33 billion globally, making up 13% of the overall beauty market. Sundial has benefited from this trend and the explosive rise of multicultural beauty: A third of the U.S. population, after all, is not white, and this group has historically spent more on beauty products.As he grew Sundial from its cramped Queens digs to its current Amityville, New York, headquarters, Dennis anticipated these changes, adding brands and pushing out everything from lipsticks to baby shampoos. (In 2015, he also certified it as a B Corporation, confirming the company’s commitment to giving back to the communities where it sources ingredients; see “It Takes a Village.”) Just as important, he positioned his products not simply as multicultural but cross-cultural: Rather than explicitly targeting black women, the company sells items that can treat a broad range of conditions—from acne to eczema to frizzy hair—that transcend race. “We want women to have options and not be forced into somebody else’s idea of what their beauty needs ought to be,” says Dennis.advertisement

It’s an approach with significant potential, especially when it comes to hair care. “Certain products and certain natural ingredients, as well as clinical ingredients, are beneficial for many different hair types,” says Karen Grant, an analyst at market research firm NPD Group. “We need to move away from thinking that this is some little niche market. It’s an untapped opportunity in the hair-care market.”#BreakTheWalls was the first step. Today, Sundial is working with retail partners such as Target to move its products off specialty shelves, and encouraging them to rethink such aisles altogether. If it all goes according to plan, SheaMoisture will no longer be the dominant brand in the multicultural space, but will be going head-to-head with the likes of Procter & Gamble and L’Oréal. And then the next battle begins.advertisementRelated StoriesIdeasCRISPR Pioneer Jennifer Doudna On Gene Editing’s Potential For Good And EvilIdeasThe Ethics Of CRISPRMagazineThe CEO Of Flywheel Sports Wants You To Celebrate Your FailuresadvertisementVideoIdeasIdeasIs Your Country Ready For A Catastrophe?IdeasThe Philanthropy World Is Frightened That Trump’s Tax Plan Is Going To Slow DonationsIdeasCould Hawaii Be The First State To Offer A Basic Income?EntertainmentEntertainmentHere Are The Trailers You’ve Missed From San Diego Comic-Con So FarEntertainmentOpen Letter To SNL: Please Let Melissa McCarthy Do Spicey On TV Right NowEntertainment“Fairy Lives Don’t Matter”: Will Smith’s Fantasy Cop Movie On Netflix Is a Racial AllegoryCo.DesignProductGo Inside The ISS, The Most Expensive Structure Ever BuiltProductThis Rotary Phone Is A Delightfully Analog Way To Read The WebProductSomeday You Could Swallow This Wireless Robot Like A PillFast CompanyLeadershipSix Words And Phrases That Make Everyone Hate Working With YouEntertainmentHere Are The Trailers You’ve Missed From San Diego Comic-Con So FarLeadershipFour Work-Life Questions To Ponder On Vacation This Summer
