Wallet Insert Info
By adding a clear plastic insert to your wallet you will instantly increase your wallet's storage space. You will be able to add more credit cards and photos to your existing wallet without having to buy a new wallet. Plastic card holders for wallets can be carried in an open credit card slot, in an open pocket, or in your bill compartment to increase your wallet's space. Most wallet inserts have a plastic tab allowing it to fit inside an open credit card slot or pocket. 
Wallet windows come in many sizes and styles to fit the various wallet styles including the trifold, bifold, secretary, hipster, and zipper wallets. The accordion style inserts are seen in many television programs and movies. When someone is asked to see their family or showing of their variety of credit cards quickly you'll see the accordion wallet insert expand down as it unfolds.
The trifold and bifold inserts have various size options for credit cards and photos.
A secretary wallet insert has staggered pages down the spine to easily flip through. Made for secretary and checkbook wallets.
The popular double high hipster credit card holder is for wallets like the Double High Executive Men's Hipster Wallet

About Leather Wallets for Men & Women
Everyone has different preferences in mens wallets. From the size to the style will differ as well as where it is carried. One person might carry their wallet in their coat pocket, while another may carry it in their back or front pocket.
Some men might want a slim front pocket wallet so the wallet bulge in their pants is at a minimum. Others will want to carry as many credit cards, cash, coins, receipts, debit cards, rewards cards, credit card size address books, wallet magnifiers, and more with trifold wallets, coat wallets, or hipster wallets.
For those who do not like to carry wallets, there are other leather goods and wallet alternatives such as our popular money clips. There are a wide variety of money clip wallets such as magnetic money clips, hinged money clips, money clips with credit card cases, and many more. Some men prefer to carry credit card holders with their money folded to conserve space in their pockets. ID holders are nice alternative as well as you only carry the necessary items you need.
Women, too, can easily go through wallets. Whether it's simple checkbook wallets or multi-pocket credit card cases what they carry can vary for the perfect accessory for them.
Whatever the kind of wallet you need, find it at WalletGear. It doesn't matter if its wallets for men like the bifold wallets or zipper wallets to secure your cash in a full zip around wallet you will find the right style and size wallet for your needs here.

Add extra storage to your wallet with a credit card insert:

If you carry a bulky wallet in your back pocket then you should switch over to a thin front pocket wallet. It will be much more comfortable when sitting down. For health reasons you should carry your wallet in your front pocket. Not only will it be better for you, it makes it much easier to access and thwart off pick pocketers.
These wallets are slim but can still pack a punch. You will find they still have credit card slots, bill compartment or money clip, ID windows, and room for your other essentials. For additional money clips visit our Money Clips section.
