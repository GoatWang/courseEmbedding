Early life and education[edit]
Sweeney was born in Kingston, New York. She graduated with a B.A. degree from the College of New Rochelle and earned an Ed.M. degree from Harvard University.
Nickelodeon and Fox[edit]
Prior to her work at Disney/ABC she was chairman and CEO of FX Networks, Inc., from 1993 to 1996. During her tenure, she presided over the launch of two basic cable networks, FX, an entertainment network and FXM: Movies from Fox, Hollywood’s first studio-based movie network.
Before joining Fox, Sweeney spent 12 years at Nickelodeon/Nick at Nite in various executive positions, most recently as senior vice president of Program Enterprises. She oversaw Nickelodeon’s international expansion, including launching the channel in the United Kingdom, resulting in a joint venture with British Sky Broadcasting.
The Walt Disney Company[edit]
Sweeney joined The Walt Disney Company in February 1996 as president of Disney Channel and executive vice president of Disney/ABC Cable Networks.[1]
From October 2000 to April 2004, Sweeney served as president of ABC Cable Networks Group and The Disney Channel Worldwide. Continuing with the strategy that was begun by her predecessor John F. Cooke, The Disney Channel more than quintupled its subscriber base with its mix of original series and movies and acquired programming. It is now available on basic cable in more than 87 million homes in the United States.[citation needed] Disney Channel executives hoped to become more "boy friendly" in 2010; especially when Good Luck Charlie premiered and when Aaron Stone and Zeke and Luther joined the main program line-up.[citation needed]
In April 2004, she was named president of the Disney/ABC Television Group. In this role, Sweeney is responsible for Disney's entertainment and news television properties globally. These include the ABC Television Network, which encompasses ABC Entertainment, ABC Kids, ABC Daytime, ABC Sports and ABC News; ABC Studios, which is the television production division of the Disney-ABC Television Group; and Disney ABC Cable Networks Group, comprising The Disney Channel Worldwide—which has grown to 24 wholly owned international channels—Toon Disney, SOAPnet, ABC Family and Jetix. She oversees Walt Disney Television Animation, Buena Vista Worldwide Television and Walt Disney Television International, and has responsibility for managing Disney's equity interests in Lifetime Entertainment Services, and A&E Television Networks.
Sweeney also oversaw the successful launch of the 24-hour animation channel Toon Disney in April 1998, and built it to its current reach of more than 52 million homes in the United States.[citation needed] Less than two years later, in January 2000, she oversaw the launch of SOAPnet, the 24-hour soap opera network now seen in more than 61.4 million homes.[citation needed]
Awards and honors[edit]

Women in Cable & Telecommunications Executive of the Year (1994), Woman of the Year (1997), Advocate Leader Award (1998)
STAR Award from American Women in Radio and Television in 1995.
Inducted into the American Advertising Federation's Advertising Hall of Achievement in 1996.
Lucy Award from Women in Film Los Angeles in 2002.[2]
Muse Award from New York Women in Film & Television in 2004.
Inducted into the Broadcasting & Cable "Hall of Fame" in 2005.

She has also been awarded the Cable Television Public Affairs Association's President's Award, been named the "Most Powerful Woman in Entertainment" by The Hollywood Reporter, one of the "50 Most Powerful Women in Business" by Fortune, and one of "The World's 100 Most Powerful Women" by Forbes.
Personal life[edit]
Active in organizations both inside and outside of the cable industry, Sweeney is a board member of A&E Television Group, the Museum of Television & Radio, Special Olympics and an honorary chair of Cable Positive.
Sweeney is married to Philip Miller and they have two children, Christopher and Rosemary. Christopher is on the autism spectrum.[3]

               Connecticut Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development is celebrating its 50th anniversary during the 2007-2008 school year. "Celebrating 50 years is a tremendous benchmark for CASCD," says LeRoy Hay CASCD Historian. "Throughout the years CASCD has been recognized as a premier professonal organization for all educators" said Hay. Throughout the 2007-2008 year CASCD will be celebrating its 50 years of success as well as planning for the next 50 years. Our new website is a great first step in providing 21st century services for our members. Newly released is the first ever historical record of the first 50 years. Please take the time to download your copy of CASCD's First 50 Years! Below, please find the introduction to our 50 year history. We hope you will enjoy the introduction, it will intice you to read the entire history. As a member you can find the complete publication on the Handouts link on the CASCD Home page. Some time in the mid 1950's, a group of approximately twenty Connecticut educators who were members of the Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development (ASCD) met to discuss establishing a Connecticut affiliate of ASCD.Unfortunately, we have very few records from the early years and thus cannot be precise about the founding year.Records of both the 1950's and 1960's are very limited and very incomplete. From that small group of professional educators has evolved an organization that has not only grown significantly in numbers but also has provided exemplary service for and advocacy on behalf of educators across the state of Connecticut for over fifty years. his history attempts to trace that growth and to document the many contributions of CASCD to educators and education in our state. This history of CASCD has been pieced together from the available archives and from conversations with CASCD members who were leaders over the years. At various times during its first thirty years, it was noted in the minutes of the executive board that CASCD should be maintaining an archive of its history. pparently this was not done systematically until 1995 when the position of historian was added to the CASCD's Board of Directors, and Arthur Roberts was appointed as the first CASCD historian. rt was a CASCD leader for over 25 years in various capacities, including president. This history characterizes CASCD by the decade, highlighting its major accomplishments and noting some of the challenges to which it has had to respond. t also recognizes the hundreds of educators who have volunteered their time and talents to serve CASCD as well as the many CASCD members who have served in leadership roles for ASCD. CASCD has a long, rich history of providing professional development, products, and services to Connecticut educators.CASCD has always focused its offerings on the most important educational topics of the day and has brought to Connecticut some of the most prominent education experts from around the country.

Anne McSweeney to Retire After 25 Years












					Anne M. McSweeney, a remarkably successful development professional who over 25 years helped steer Columbia through two record-setting capital campaigns, has announced plans to retire from her position as Deputy Vice President and Special Advisor to the President for Development effective June 30th. McSweeney, who came to Morningside Heights in 1977 from a career in advertising and public relations, served under three University presidentsWilliam McGill, Michael I. Sovern, and George Ruppduring a period that saw annual fundraising totals climb from $32 million to an all-time high of $358.7 million last year.
					In that time, McSweeney has worked closely with the President, Trustees, and top volunteers, along with successive deans and administrators in the schools and divisions. Her extensive travels on behalf of Columbia have provided an opportunity to forge strong ties with prominent alumni, business leaders, and government officials around the globe. During the past eight years alone, she has accompanied President Rupp to alumni events organized in 26 cities across the United States and another 25 worldwide.
Anne has had an enormously positive impact on the University at a critical juncture in its history, said President Rupp in expressing gratitude for her accomplishments. So many of the new and renovated facilities that surround us on campus, along with the faculty chairs, scholarships, fellowships, and academic programs endowed over the years, are the products of the special relationships she has helped to build between the institution and our most generous benefactors. On top of everything else, Anne has been a consistently clearsighted and forthright advisor on a range of issues extending far beyond the usual purview of development and alumni relations.
According to Trustee Chair David J. Stern, who chaired the second half of the extended Campaign for Columbia, Working with Anne has been a real pleasure. She is smart and she is tough, and her success attests to the value of taking the direct approach. I appreciate her professionalism, integrity, and sense of commitment.
Private philanthropy has become increasingly important for attracting new resources to Americas colleges and universities over the past two decadesa period in which Columbia has been engaged in capital campaigns virtually non-stop. Through it all, McSweeney has been a driving force behind the Universitys unparalleled fundraising achievements. Following on the success of the original Campaign for Columbia, which raised $602 million between 1982 and 1987 under the leadership of former President Michael I. Sovern, she and her colleagues began laying the groundwork for another five-year effort to meet the growing list of needs. Together they planned and implemented a strategy for the historic $1.15 billion effort that had been announced by President Emeritus Sovern in 1990, and then was extended for another five years by President Rupp in 1995.
By the time the Campaign officially ended on December 31, 2000, it had generated a total of $2.84 billion in gifts and pledges.
On top of her fundraising and managerial duties, McSweeney oversees a range of other activities, including development communications, special events, and publications. 
Among the deans to have worked most closely with her through the years is Columbia Colleges Austin Quigley, who said, Annes professionalism and integrity are evident in the close relationships she has established with major benefactors, in their enduring loyalty to Columbia, and in the many ambitious University projects whose successful completion resulted directly from her efforts.
Added Meyer Feldberg, dean of Columbia Business School, Anne McSweeney is a classy lady with style and substance. I will miss her professionalism and wise counsel. 
Reflecting on her quarter century at Columbia, McSweeney noted, I am truly fortunate to have had the opportunity to work with some of the outstanding figures of our timetalented alumni, great New Yorkers, and so many others who have made a real difference. Every day has brought a fresh challenge, and today as much as ever I look forward to seeing what comes next.
McSweeney is a longtime resident of Manhasset, Long Island. She and her husband, John, have a grown son and a daughter, along with four grandchildren.
