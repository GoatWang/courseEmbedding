GENTLEMEN:
What is erectile dysfunction?






Erectile dysfunction is when a man has difficulty getting an erection. Or keeping it long enough for sex. It’s also known as ED or impotence. It happens when not enough blood flows to the penis, preventing an erection. It affects about 30 million men in the U.S. Some guys with ED find it difficult to either get or keep an erection every time they try to have sex. For others, ED symptoms can happen just once in a while. Either way, you should know that you’re not alone.
 ABOUT

1.1-50-percent.png




ED is not all in your head. It’s not just a part of aging that you have to accept. It’s a real medical condition, so it should be addressed like one. If you think you have ED symptoms, talk to a doctor.
*Data taken from the Massachusetts Male Aging Study. Of 1,290 respondents, 52% stated that they had some degree of ED.
 



What can cause ED?


ED is often caused by something physical, such as a disease, injury, or side effects from other drugs.
Medical Conditions





      
          Depression    

      
          Diabetes    

      
          Heart disease    

      
          High blood pressure    

      
          High cholesterol    

      
          Obesity    

      
          Prostate cancer treatment    

      
          Spinal cord injury    

 


Although most cases of ED have a physical cause, thoughts that lead to depression, worry, or anxiety can also cause ED.
Even when ED has a physical cause, it can be made worse if it leads to depression and worry.
 

Diabetes is a condition where there is too much sugar, or glucose, in the blood. Over time, high blood sugar levels can damage nerves and blood vessels—like the ones that produce erections. When this occurs, diabetes can lead to ED.
In a study, up to 83% of men with diabetes had some form of ED.
 

Heart disease can clog or narrow the arteries. This can stop blood from flowing to the penis, and may cause ED. Talk to your doctor to make sure your heart is healthy enough for sex.
 

High blood pressure makes the heart work harder. This puts strain on the blood vessels, which then harden and narrow. This can prevent blood from getting to the penis and lead to ED. In a study, more than 65% of men with high blood pressure also had ED.
Additionally, some medications used to treat high blood pressure can lead to ED. Make sure your doctor is aware of all medications you are taking.
 

High cholesterol can clog your arteries. This can slow blood flow to the penis. The result? It can affect the quality of your erections.
In a study, high cholesterol raised men's risk of erectile dysfunction by 80%.
 

Obesity can cause real harm to your health. For example, it's associated with medical conditions that can affect blood flow. And when blood flow is affected, it can cause ED.
 

The prostate is a small gland near your bladder. It's next to the nerves that are necessary for an erection to happen. For men with prostate cancer, surgical removal of the prostate can lead to ED.
 

An injury to the spine can affect many functions in the body. Erectile function is no exception.
Due to nerve damage, some men with spinal cord injuries can't get erections. Others can—but can't keep them hard enough or long enough for sex.
 


Medications
In some men, ED is a side effect of some medications. These medications might include drugs used to treat:
High blood pressure
Heart disease
Depression
 





Can your lifestyle have something to do with it?
 Yes. Some lifestyle and psychological factors can play a role in causing ED, such as smoking, drinking, and stress because they may lead to conditions that affect blood circulation. 
There are things you can do each day to improve your circulation and avoid some of the conditions that can lead to ED:
Find ways to stay more active (mowing the lawn, walking the dog)
Help manage your weight by eating healthy and watching your portion size
Drink less alcohol
Quit smoking. The results can be significant
Look for ways to reduce stress in your daily life
 





GENTLEMEN:
VIAGRA helps guys with ED get and keep an erection.

And it’s been shown to effectively treat ED in guys who have certain other medical conditions. So be sure to tell your doctor about your medical conditions and medications so he can choose the right dose for you.
 
 
 
 















          NEXT:        
Learn how VIAGRA works. 





















 
GENTLEMEN:
How does VIAGRA work?






VIAGRA works for men with erectile dysfunction (ED) by increasing blood flow to the penis so you can get and keep an erection hard enough for sex. Individual results may vary. It’s been proven to help guys with all degrees of ED. VIAGRA usually starts to work within 30–60 minutes. And you only take it when you need it.

1.1-watch-1.png




VIAGRA works only when you are sexually stimulated. You may take it up to 4 hours before sexual activity. So don’t worry. There's no need to rush.
After sex? Your erection should go away. In the rare event of an erection lasting more than 4 hours, seek immediate medical help to avoid long-term injury.
 APPROXIMATELY

1.2-four-fifths.png




†Seventy-two percent, 80%, and 85% of the patients on 25 mg, 50 mg, and 100 mg of VIAGRA, respectively, achieved erections hard enough for sex, compared to 50% on placebo. Also, men taking VIAGRA showed an improvement in their ability to get and keep an erection versus those who took placebo.
 












          NEXT:        
Is VIAGRA right for me? 





















 
GENTLEMEN:
Want to know if it's right for you?






Only your doctor can decide if VIAGRA is right for you. VIAGRA isn't right for everyone. If you have trouble getting or keeping an erection hard enough for sex, VIAGRA may help.

            MORE THAN          
23 

million men
 have been prescribed VIAGRA.
 



 








Who should not take VIAGRA?
Do not take VIAGRA if you:
Take medicines called “nitrates” (such as nitroglycerin)
Use street drugs called “poppers” such as amyl nitrate or amyl nitrite, and butyl nitrate
Take medicines called guanylate cyclase stimulators such as Adempas (riociguat)
Are allergic to sildenafil, as contained in VIAGRA and REVATIO, or any of the ingredients in VIAGRA. See the Patient Information for a complete list of ingredients in VIAGRA
 VIAGRA and drug interactions.
Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements.
VIAGRA may affect the way other medicines work, and other medicines may affect the way VIAGRA works, causing side effects. Especially tell your healthcare provider if you take any of the following:
medicines called nitrates
medicines called guanylate cyclase stimulators such as Adempas (riociguat)
medicines called alpha-blockers such as Hytrin (terazosin HCl), Flomax (tamsulosin HCl), Cardura (doxazosin mesylate), Minipress (prazosin HCl), Uroxatral (alfuzosin HCl), Jalyn (dutasteride and tamsulosin HCl), or Rapaflo (silodosin). Alpha-blockers are sometimes prescribed for prostate problems or high blood pressure. In some patients, the use of VIAGRA with alpha-blockers can lead to a drop in blood pressure or to fainting
medicines called HIV protease inhibitors, such as ritonavir (Norvir), indinavir sulfate (Crixivan), saquinavir (Fortovase or Invirase), or atazanavir sulfate (Reyataz)
some types of oral antifungal medicines, such as ketoconazole (Nizoral) and itraconazole (Sporanox)
some types of antibiotics, such as clarithromycin (Biaxin), telithromycin (Ketek), or erythromycin
other medicines that treat high blood pressure
other medicines or treatments for ED
VIAGRA contains sildenafil, which is the same medicine found in another drug called REVATIO. REVATIO is used to treat a rare disease called pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). VIAGRA should not be used with REVATIO or with other PAH treatments containing sildenafil or any other PDE5 inhibitors (such as Adcirca [tadalafil])

Possible side effects of VIAGRA. 





















 
Wondering about possible side effects?






Safety is important. And it helps to know about possible side effects. 
VIAGRA can cause serious side effects. Rarely reported side effects include:

Other important information:

VIAGRA can help a man get and keep an erection when he becomes sexually stimulated. It’s not right for everyone. Here are some other things you should know:
Do not take VIAGRA if you:

take any medicines called nitrates, often prescribed for chest pain, or guanylate cyclase stimulators like Adempas (riociguat) for pulmonary hypertension. Your blood pressure could drop to an unsafe level.
are allergic to sildenafil, as contained in VIAGRA and REVATIO, or any of the ingredients in VIAGRA. 
Discuss your health with your doctor to ensure that you are healthy enough for sex. If you experience chest pain, dizziness, or nausea during sex, seek immediate medical help.
 The most common side effects of VIAGRA are:
headache
flushing
upset stomach
abnormal vision, such as changes in color vision (such as having a blue color tinge) and blurred vision
stuffy or runny nose
back pain
muscle pain
nausea
dizziness
rash
In addition, heart attack, stroke, irregular heartbeat and death have happened rarely in men taking VIAGRA. Most, but not all, of these men had heart problems before taking VIAGRA. It is not known if VIAGRA caused these problems.
Tell your healthcare provider if you have any side effect that bothers you or does not go away.
These are not all the possible side effects of VIAGRA. For more information, ask your healthcare provider or pharmacist.
 





Talk to your doctor.
Discuss your general health and ED symptoms with your doctor to see if VIAGRA is right for you.

Need help starting the conversation?


You can expect that once you bring up the topic of ED, your doctor can take it from there. So here are some ways to break the ice when he asks how everything’s going: 
1. "I have trouble sometimes in bed. Could it be ED?"
2. "I think I might have ED. What can I do about it?"
3. "Could VIAGRA work for me?" 
Help make the most of your VIAGRA Talk.
By asking questions about VIAGRA and ED, you can help your doctor get the information he needs to find out if you have ED and to decide if VIAGRA is right for you.

Watch out for VIAGRA offers with “no prescription.”  





















 
Don't be fooled by counterfeit VIAGRA.






Counterfeits aren’t just a cheap knock-off of a proven product; they’re illegal, potentially harmful fakes. It’s hard to tell where or how they were made—or even what’s inside them.
 









WATCH:
A counterfeit epidemic
 










VIAGRA is one of the most counterfeited drugs in the world. 
In March 2011, Pfizer Global Security studied the search results for the term "buy VIAGRA" to see how many online pharmacies were selling counterfeit VIAGRA. 
The study was conducted using the top 2 search engines over a 5-day period. During this time, 22 unique sites consistently appeared among the top search results claiming to sell VIAGRA manufactured by Pfizer. Pfizer Global Security then ordered VIAGRA from these sites and tested the chemical composition of the pills.

Warning: Counterfeit medications can be dangerous.


3.2-warning-1.png



 
Blue printer ink
Amphetamines, also known as “speed”
Metronidazole, a powerful antibiotic that could cause an allergic reaction, diarrhea, or vomiting
Too much active ingredient (or not enough), which may cause you harm
Binding agents, such as drywall, that prevent the tablet from breaking down in your system



3.2-warning-2.png



 
Toxic ingredients, such as boric acid, floor wax, brick dust, rat poison, and road paint
Ingredients that can have dangerous interactions with other medications you may be taking
A completely different medication with potentially harmful side effects

 
 









WATCH:
Recipe for a fake
 










Learn how to safely buy online.
Make sure that when you buy VIAGRA online, you get real VIAGRA. Many of the sites that claim to sell VIAGRA online are actually selling potentiallydangerous counterfeits.


3.2-watch-online-scams.jpg





 Follow these steps: 
1 Make sure the website requires a valid prescription. It’s illegal to sell VIAGRA without a prescription from a qualified healthcare professional.
2 Make sure you see a U.S. address and phone number. This can help you make sure the website is not selling unregulated medication from overseas.
3 Check if they claim to sell “generic VIAGRA” for ED. The FDA has never approved the so-called “generic VIAGRA” for ED you see for sale online. It could be counterfeit and may cause you harm.
4 VIAGRA only comes in 3 doses. 25 mg, 50 mg, and 100 mg. VIAGRA is a tablet. Any other form, like “fast-dissolving,” “extra-strength,” “soft-tab,” or “VIAGRA for Women” is not FDA-approved.
5 Look for Verified Internet Pharmacy Practice Sites® (VIPPS®). A VIPPS® accreditation ensures the website you are purchasing from is secure and reliable.
