Brewing Industry
 In its early development period, the industry consisted of small, independent breweries scattered throughout the country.




















Brewing Industry

 Brewing began in Canada with the first settlers and traders. In the beginning, beer making was a cottage industry, but in 1668 Canada's first commercial brewery was built by the Intendant Jean Talon at Québec City. The enterprise was undertaken for three purposes: to promote temperance by offering an alternative to strong imported French liquors; to reduce the amount of currency leaving the country for the purchase of imported beverages; and to utilize the abundance of grain available in the New World.


	  In its early development period, the industry consisted of small, independent breweries scattered throughout the country. With the advent of modern distribution systems, technological advances to improve quality control and rising costs, production became more centralized and most local breweries disappeared. However, during the 1980s a resurgence of smaller breweries, commonly called microbreweries, began to appear in Canada. They tend to serve local or regional markets.


	 Today Canada's brewing industry comprises two national companies, Labatt Breweries of Canada (8 plants) and Molson Breweries (8 plants), and six regional breweries located in different areas of Canada: Big Rock Brewery and Drummond Brewing (Alberta), Lakeport Brewing Corporation, Northern Breweries and North Algonquin Breweries (Ontario), Moosehead Breweries Limited (New Brunswick), Pacific Western Brewing Company (British Columbia) and Sleeman Brewing and Malting Company Limited (Ontario and British Columbia ). Additionally, there are 40 microbreweries in every area of Canada except New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island and the Yukon and Northwest Territories.


	  In a little more than a decade, the Canadian brewing trade has changed dramatically. For example, there has been the emergence of the brew pub, a combined brewery and licensed pub selling beer for on-premise consumption only. These establishments enjoyed a renaissance as a result of the "real ale" movement in Europe. Brew pubs have been operating in Canada since 1983.

Types of Beer

	 Beer is used as a generic term and includes both lager and ale. Of the range of beer types available to consumers, today lager is preferred by most Canadians (56%) followed by ale (34%).


	 The difference between the two is that lager is lighter in taste and is made with a type of yeast that drops to the bottom of the fermenting tank. More hops are used to brew ale and the yeast rises to the top of the tank. Less than 1% of the market is sold as stout (heavy-bodied darker and sweeter beer brewed with roasted malt and more hops) and porter (a weaker version of stout).


	 Light beers, containing up to 4% alcohol by volume, were introduced in Canada in the late 1970s. Regular-strength Canadian beers contain 5% alcohol by volume. In the past several years, both large and small brewers have expanded their range of products to offer consumers more selection to meet different tastes. New brewing technologies and processes have produced the following types of beer: extra light, dry, extra dry, dry light, strong, extra strong, ice, wheat, beer coolers, packaged unpasteurized and no-alcohol beers and beer coolers.

Regulation and Taxation

	 The brewing industry is one of the most heavily regulated in Canada. Breweries must obtain licences to operate from both the federal and provincial governments. Generally, the provinces have control over distribution and retail systems, labelling, advertising and marketing practices, importation and pricing. They may, as well, control the number and types of beers available for sale. The federal government regulates ingredients, packaging and labelling and broadcast advertising.


	 Taxes represent the single largest component of the price of beer. On average 53 cents of every dollar spent on beer for home consumption is made up of federal and provincial taxes. At this level, Canada ranks with Norway as having the highest taxes of 23 leading industrialized countries. Canadian taxes are about three times higher than on beer bought in the United States, where only 18 cents on each dollar goes to taxes.

Economic Contributions

	 In 1996, the beverage industries produced $8.1 billion and grew at an average compounded annual rate of almost 5.3% over the 1990 to 1996 period. In 1996, the brewery products industry segment represented almost 48.8% of total beverage industries shipments. Canadian domestic exports of beer (primarily to the US) totalled $217.7 million in 1996. Over the 1990 to 1996 period, domestic exports in this industry had an average growth rate of 4.21%. Over 98% of the beer consumed in Canada is produced by Canadian breweries.


	 Over the 1990 to 1996 period, total employment within Canada's brewing industry declined from 12 636 to 9937, an average annual drop of 4.4%.


	 Revenue to all levels of government generated by the brewing and marketing of beer amounted to roughly $4.9 billion in 1994. About $3.2 billion came from federal excise duty and sales tax and provincial liquor board profits and sales taxes. The remainder represented various taxes paid to the different levels of government by the employees and companies involved.


	 Over 19 million hectolitres of Canadian beer were sold for Canadian consumption in 1995, or 66.5 litres per person. Beer sales have shown little or no growth over the last five years and remain down from a peak of 20.7 million hectolitres in 1987.

Brewing and the Environment

	 On the retail end, vendors not only sell beer but handle bottle returns. More than 78% of all beer sold domestically by the industry is in returnable and reusable bottles. Ninety-seven out of every 100 of those bottles come back for cleaning and refilling. A bottle can be reused 15 to 20 times, preventing enormous wastage. Once a bottle is spent, it is crushed and sent to glass-makers for the manufacture of new bottles.


	 Aluminum beer cans (which account for 15% of all sales) are also crushed and recycled, as are the beer cartons. Draught beer is sold in reusable kegs that can last 15 to 20 years before they too are also crushed and recycled. Even the husks of the spent grain used in the brewing process are recycled. After use in the brewing process, they are collected and sold as animal feed.

Responsible Use

	 The Canadian brewing industry was one of the first among brewers internationally to address the issue of responsible use and continues to fund a number of programs aimed at discouraging misuse. In the past decade alone, the industry has provided funding of over $95 million to raise public awareness of the risks of alcohol misuse, to mount educational programs aimed at altering risky attitudes and behaviours with respect to alcohol use and to foster bio-medical and social and behavioural research into alcohol misuse.

	PharmAthene Reports First Quarter 2017
	Financial and Operational Results




	 




	ANNAPOLIS, MD – May
	3, 2017

	– PharmAthene, Inc. (NYSE MKT: PIP), a biodefense company developing medical countermeasures against anthrax,
	today reported its financial and operational results for the first quarter of 2017.


	 


	First quarter and subsequent
	highlights include:


	 







	·



	On February 3, 2017, PharmAthene paid a one-time special cash dividend of
	$2.91 per share of PharmAthene common stock. The special dividend, totaling an aggregate payment of approximately $200 million,
	represents approximately 98% of the after tax net cash proceeds, received from SIGA Technologies, Inc. in satisfaction of a judgment
	owed to PharmAthene by SIGA.




	 







	·



	On March 13, 2017, PharmAthene established a record date and meeting date
	for a special meeting of stockholder to vote upon, among other things, the proposal to adopt the agreement and plan of merger and
	reorganization involving PharmAthene and Altimmune, Inc. PharmAthene stockholders of record at the close of business on March 22,
	2017, will be entitled to receive the notice of, and to vote at, the PharmAthene special meeting which will be held on May 4, 2017.




	 


	For the three months ended March
	31, 2017, PharmAthene recognized revenue of $0.8 million compared to $1.0 million for the corresponding period in 2016. Revenue
	was derived from an existing contract with National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) for the development of
	SparVax-L, a next generation lyophilized anthrax vaccine. Revenue recognized to date under this contract is $10.3 million.


	 


	Research and development expenses in the
	first quarter of 2017 were $0.7 million compared to $1.0 million for the corresponding period in 2016. The decrease was primarily
	due to efforts associated with a stability program related to the NIAID program which were no longer active during the same period
	in 2017. Similarly, research and development expenses for a tech transfer and the preparation of an engineering batch were at a
	point of high activity during the first quarter of 2016.


	 


	Expenses associated with general and administrative
	functions were $3.2 million in the first quarter of 2017 compared to $1.2 million in the first quarter of 2016. The increase was
	primarily due to transaction costs relating to the proposed merger transaction involving Altimmune, Inc., professional fees, and
	labor costs.

	For the first quarter of 2017, the Company’s
	net loss was $2.2 million, or $(0.03) per share, compared to a net loss of $1.2 million, or $(0.02) per share, for the corresponding
	period in 2016.


	 


	Cash and cash equivalents at the end of
	the first quarter of 2017 were $15.8 million compared to $154.0 at the end of fiscal year 2016.


	 


	On September 9, 2014, PharmAthene entered
	into an incrementally funded contract with the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (“NIAID") for
	the development of a next generation lyophilized anthrax vaccine (“SparVax-L”) which provided for potential aggregate
	funding of up to approximately $28.1 million, if all technical milestones were met and all eight contract options were exercised
	by NIAID. NIAID has exercised four options under this agreement providing for performance through December 31, 2017. PharmAthene
	has been informed by NIAID that it will exercise only one of the additional remaining options under the contract to provide funding
	for a non-human primate challenge study which PharmAthene believes may be used to support an advanced development funding proposal
	to the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (“BARDA”). Work under all exercised options will continue
	bringing total committed and final funding under the NIAID contract to $15.1 million.


	 



	About PharmAthene



	 


	PharmAthene is engaged in the development
	of a next generation anthrax vaccine that is intended to improve protection and safety while having favorable dosage and storage
	requirements compared to other anthrax vaccines.


	 



	The Proposed Merger



	 


	On January 18, 2017, PharmAthene entered
	into an agreement and plan of merger and reorganization pursuant to which its wholly-owned subsidiary, Mustang Merger Sub, Inc.,
	will be merged with and into Altimmune, Inc., with Altimmune as the surviving subsidiary, and immediately thereafter, Altimmune
	will be merged with and into Mustang Merger Sub LLC, with Mustang Merger Sub LLC as the surviving entity in such merger. Following
	the consummation of the mergers, PharmAthene will change its name to “Altimmune, Inc.” PharmAthene’s Board of
	Directors has established a record date of March 22, 2017 for a Special Meeting of Stockholders scheduled for May 4, 2017 at which
	stockholders of PharmAthene will have an opportunity to approve the proposals relating to the mergers.
