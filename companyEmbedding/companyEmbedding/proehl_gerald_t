Sophiris Adds Gerald T. Proehl to its Board of Directors

 SAN DIEGO & VANCOUVER, British Columbia--(BUSINESS WIRE)--

      Sophiris

      Bio Inc. (NASDAQ: SPHS) (the "Company" or "Sophiris"), a

      biopharmaceutical company developing a clinical stage, targeted

      treatment for the symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) or

      enlarged prostate, today announced the appointment of Gerald T. Proehl

      to its board

      of directors effective March 19, 2014.

    

Mr. Proehl most recently served as the president, chief executive

      officer and director of Santarus, Inc. until its acquisition by Salix

      Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in January 2014. Mr. Proehl had served in these

      capacities since January 2002. From March 2000 through December 2001,

      Mr. Proehl was the president and chief operating officer of Santarus.

      From April 1999 to March 2000, Mr. Proehl served as vice president,

      marketing and business development of Santarus. Prior to joining

      Santarus, Mr. Proehl was with Hoechst Marion Roussel, Inc., a global

      pharmaceutical company, for 14 years. At Hoechst Marion Roussel, he

      served in various capacities in multiple therapeutic areas and was

      responsible for the marketing of gastrointestinal products Carafate and

      Pentasa, among products in several other therapeutic areas. Mr. Proehl

      holds a B.S. in education from the State University of New York at

      Cortland, an M.A. in exercise physiology from Wake Forest University and

      an M.B.A. from Rockhurst College.

    


      "Gerry brings a wealth of relevant experience to our board of directors

      especially in the areas of commercialization, business development and

      strategic planning," said Randall

      E. Woods, president and CEO of Sophiris. "These areas are especially

      important for a company at our stage of development as we continue to

      execute on our long term strategic plan."

    

Sophiris Bio Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company developing a

      clinical-stage, targeted treatment for the symptoms of benign prostatic

      hyperplasia (BPH) or enlarged prostate, which it believes is an

      unsatisfied market with significant market potential. Sophiris' lead

      candidate for BPH, PRX302, is designed to be as efficacious as

      pharmaceuticals, less invasive than the surgical interventions, and

      without the sexual side effects seen with existing treatments. Sophiris

      initiated its first Phase 3 clinical trial of PRX302 in October 2013.
