 Biography




 




Updated Jan. 29, 2011 12:01 a.m. ET


Charles Clough is best known as Merrill Lynch's long-time chief stock-market strategist whose bearishness in 2000 didn't sit well with a brokerage firm that proclaimed itself "bullish on America." Clough was right, of course; the dot-com-driven market soon failed spectacularly. His track record since parting ways with Merrill has been pretty good, too.  Now in its 11th year, Boston-based Clough Capital Partners oversees $3.6 billion, including hedge funds, mutual funds and institutional accounts. His flagship...

Clough Jr. is a powerful and visible force, the chief investment strategist for mighty Merrill Lynch Pierce Fenner & Smith Inc., the world's largest brokerage. Clough's decisions move markets, Clough's comments on the market pepper the pages of newspapers and magazines and Clough's face is familiar to some television viewers, such as those who saw him trading puns with Louis Rukeyser on public television's ''Wall Street Week.'' But few colleagues or investors know the other side of Chuck Clough. Almost every Sunday, Clough is in West Concord, Mass., tending to the spiritual needs of the 2,000 members of Our Lady Help of Christians parish. He'll spend much of the day, as usual, leading a confirmation instruction class and visiting nursing homes and hospitals. It's not unusual, of course, for busy executives to serve their churches or synagogues, but few combine such high-powered professional lives with such demanding religious duties. One recent Sunday, Clough, in the white robes of a Catholic cleric, spent the morning preaching and assisting at liturgies and then performed one of the dozens of baptisms, marriages and burials he'll handle this year. ''David Anthony is now a card-carrying Catholic,'' he joked as he handed a happily snoozing infant back to his parents, Anita and Hogas Tekle, after a 20-minute ceremony. Clough (his name rhymes with cow, or more appropriately, Dow) is one of 170 permanent deacons in the Boston diocese, men authorized to carry out nearly all church rites. The position, after centuries of disuse, was reinstituted by the Vatican II Council of bishops of 1963 to 1965. He is assigned to assist the Rev. John F. Curley at Our Lady Help of Christians. The parish in West Concord is where Clough, 47, lives with his wife, Gloria, and four children. She is studying for an advanced theology degree, planning to use it with her nursing experience in a hospital ministry. When Merrill Lynch approached him in 1987, Clough, who is strictly fast track in his business life, said he was eager to join the Thundering Herd. But he refused to leave his job at Cowen & Co. in Boston to move to New York. ''Merrill said okay, as long as I didn't mind seeing a lot of the {Trump} shuttle,'' Clough said recently in his auxiliary office on the 37th floor of Boston's One Financial Place. And he's seen a lot of the shuttle. Clough's week almost always begins at 5 a.m. on Monday, when he piles out of bed in Concord and heads for the airport and the 6:30 a.m. shuttle flight to New York. By 8:30 he's at his primary office on Wall Street, deep into meetings with clients and strategy sessions with Merrill Lynch figures such as his friend Robert Farrell, the well-known technical specialist. ''Bob's in charge of the charts and squiggles and I look at fundamentals and we check each other,'' said Clough. Clough's work is directed mostly to the 12,000 Merrill Lynch brokers and institutional clients. Merrill's enormous weight with small investors gives Clough pause as a strategist. ''I think we tend to be a little more cautious than strategists for the big institutional houses like Morgan,'' Clough explained. ''Our basic philosophy is: 'Don't lose money.' '' As chief strategist, Clough decides on asset allocation and what sectors Merrill portfolios should include. Right now, for example, energy is in and technology is out. ''I determine company investment strategy and implement it. If Merrill moves from stocks to bonds, I'm the guy who does it,'' he said. At last count, Merrill Lynch had $417 billion in assets under management, one of the biggest pots of money under one company's management anywhere. Clough also serves as Merrill's public spokesman, appearing on television, making himself available to financial writers looking for a fast quote, starring in in-house videos such as a recent talk on cash liquidity filmed in a meat-packing house called Where's the Beef? A natural talker, the boyish-looking Clough didn't get much chance to hone his public skills until he joined Merrill. Clough's job generally calls for him to be in New York on Mondays and part of Tuesday, usually somewhere else in the country through Wednesday and back in Boston Thursday and Friday, where's he's at work downtown, but on call at the parish because these are Curley's days off. His routine is broken regularly. Clough travels to Europe and Asia as Merrill Lynch's spokesman, bringing the company gospel to the important foreign market. He is a tireless traveler around the United States, but almost always he finds himself on Saturdays and Sundays back at Our Lady parish. Once after a Friday night appearance on ''Wall Street Week,'' he got back to Logan International Airport at 3 a.m. Saturday after fog delays, just hours before officiating at a burial service. It wasn't always this way with Clough, who concedes he once was a ''time-punch Catholic,'' a believer who gave 45 minutes a week to the church as a duty, but that was about it. Born in Boston, Clough breezed through economics at Boston College, where classmates recall his leadership and amiability. Clough then went to the University of Chicago, where he earned a master's degree in business and fell under the spell of monetarists Milton Friedman and Nobel Prize winner George Stigler, best known for his works on regulation. Monetarism has influenced his approach to strategy. He pays a lot of attention to money-supply figures, pricing moves, bank reserve trends and other fundamentals. After Chicago he moved to New York and joined the hot investment group of the time, Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette Inc., where he made a lot of money fast and cultivated a high-income lifestyle with a big house and plenty of trinkets. He lost a lot of money when the investment firm's stock plunged, but continued his investment career in Boston, where he worked for the Boston Co., Colonial Management Associates and Cowen, sharpening the analytical skills that attracted Merrill Lynch. For a while he was deep into Democratic politics, an ally of then-County Commissioner Paul Tsongas in Middlesex County government reform. He was a state party elector in 1972 who actually cast one of the few electoral college votes won by presidential candidate George McGovern. But then, with a growing brood of his own, he began working with young people in Our Lady parish and gradually underwent what he described as a conversion experience based on his growing involvement with youth and the church. Politics lost out. He poured his energies into the church. Boston lawyer John Mee, an active Our Lady Help of Christians layman, recalls times when more than 100 children would cram into the Clough basement and Clough would lead a program and there would be a service, followed by pizza. Parishioner Joe Colman added, ''You can't say enough about his work here week in and week out. He's especially good with teenagers. And you know, most people here don't realize he's an important figure on Wall Street.'' Clough has consistently shown a concern for the church and the world. One Sunday, for example, he planned to talk to children at the parish about injustice in El Salvador and the sacrifice of church men and women. A recent field trip for seventh graders at the parish was to see the movie ''Romero,'' about the martyred church leader Oscar Romero. Clough joined Merrill Lynch in the spring of 1987, a year after completing four years of night and weekend study at St. John's Seminary that led to his ordination as permanent deacon. A few weeks later the giant brokerage was rocked by a trading scandal involving mortgage-backed securities. A $250 million loss, caused by the unauthorized activity by a single trader, who was fired, smacked the brokerage with one of the largest bond losses ever recorded. It gave the company's new chief investment strategist a chance to put his ethics into practice. ''We put together airtight trading and business controls and when the Oct. 19 {1987} crash came we were ready,'' he said. Clough's role in coordinating company policy from a strategic point of view helped alert the company to the liquidity perils involved in real estate and played a part in Merrill's decision to deemphasize real-estate activities. Clough regards his vows to undertake a permanent ministry of service as extending to Wall Street, but he doesn't do a lot of preaching to his colleagues. ''I let the Holy Spirit guide me in my work,'' he said. ''I make it known I am a Catholic deacon. It's not fair to surprise somebody after they've told a dirty joke.'' Clough noted that colleagues on the street sometimes seek his counsel and he said he welcomes the opportunity to extend his ministry to the workplace. ''He is just as much a deacon working on Wall Street as in Concord when he's baptizing babies and burying the dead,'' said the Rev. Frank J. Silva, director of the office of the permanent diaconate in Boston. ''I am sure he wrestles a lot with conflicts between Christian principles and Wall Street practices.'' Still, people occasionally ask him what on earth he's doing on Wall Street, which to some is a worldwide symbol of greed. Clough's response: ''I say to them Wall Street is a center of immense power and with its control of vast capital flows, a potential for good. I see no conflict in a parish deacon working on Wall Street.''           business   Get 2016 Olympics updates by email Our best news and analysis from Rio, delivered to your inbox. post_newsletter333 magnet-olympics2016 false after3th false          Please provide a valid email address.
