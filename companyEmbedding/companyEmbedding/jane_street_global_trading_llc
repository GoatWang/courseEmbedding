Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35
50
100




Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year




How many days after the end-of-quarter date before doing the backtest? (0 - 60) 

DAYS





      Or use day whenever the filing was submitted to the SEC
      (or the last filing when using a group of funds):
Starting Quarter

      By default backtester will test your strategy using all available dates going back to 2001 (for subscribers only).
      You can optionally adjust when the backtest actually starts.

                          Stock prices used are the "total returns" stock price and will include

Paths with
purpose


Any of Jane Street’s main career paths can be pursued in New York, London, or Hong Kong.


Quantitative Trading
Technology
Quantitative Research
Infrastructure




Quantitative Trading
Traders work in teams to seek out and take advantage of pricing inefficiencies, develop models, manage risk, investigate new products, and push into new business areas. Experienced traders mentor newer colleagues, whose responsibilities increase with their capability.





Ideal candidates will be:

Excellent quantitatively, with a strong understanding of probability and statistics
Effective communicators in close-knit team settings
Motivated, competitive, and eager to learn and teach
Excited to engage in impromptu and exploratory debate on trading strategy and risk






Previous experience or coursework in finance, business, or economics is not required. We’re more interested in how you think and learn than what you know.





View Open Quantitative Trading Positions
					  














Technology


The technology group is actively hiring in multiple different areas. For all of these, no previous experience or coursework in finance, business, or economics is required. We’re more interested in how you think and learn than what you already know.






Software Development
The software development team works closely with the rest of the firm, building tools, exploring trading ideas, and designing and maintaining the firm’s software systems.




For dev roles, you should have:

Top-notch programming skills, with an interest in (but not necessarily experience with) functional programming languages.
Deep experience with—and love for—technology. There’s no specific checklist; we use software to attack a variety of problems, so we’re interested in everything from machine learning to systems administration to programming language design.
Strong interpersonal skills. Software development at Jane Street is highly collaborative, and we are looking for people who can work effectively in small, close-knit teams.
A commitment to the practical. We produce production software on a continuous basis, affecting day-to-day operations in every area of the firm.






Information Technology
and Networking
This group builds and maintains the firm’s technological nervous system. Group members keep our networks fast and robust, manage counterparty connectivity, and provide the glue to hold together the firm’s far-flung activities.




For information technology and networking roles, you should have:

A love for automation. We don’t like solving the same problem manually over and over, and we generally try to program our way out of it.
A careful approach. The systems we manage trade billions of dollars a day, so the stakes are high. We need people who can make quick decisions when necessary, but at the same time maintain a sense of humility about the limits of their own knowledge.
Strong interpersonal skills. Jane Street is a highly collaborative place, and we are looking for people who can work effectively with people across the firm.

View Open IT & Networking Positions
					  














Quantitative Research


Researchers at Jane Street are responsible for building models, strategies, and systems that price and trade a variety of financial instruments. As a mix of the trading and software developer roles, this work involves many things: analyzing large datasets, building and testing models, creating new trading strategies, and writing the code that implements them.






Researchers at Jane Street care about:

Deploying the right tool (mathematical, statistical, computational) for the job. We see ourselves as generalists.
Writing quality production-level code. Researchers spend most of their day writing code.
Thinking and communicating precisely and openly. We believe great solutions come from the interaction between diverse groups of people across the firm.
Having a real impact on the firm by always striving to keep our work relevant.






We’re looking for:

An ability to apply logical and mathematical thinking to all kinds of problems. Asking great questions is more important than knowing all the answers.
A desire to write great code, mostly in OCaml. You don’t need functional programming experience, but you should want to learn.
Good taste in quantitative research. The problems we work on rarely have clean definitive answers. You should be comfortable pushing in new and unknown directions while maintaining clarity of purpose.
Smart and curious people–previous experience or coursework in finance, business, or economics is not required. We’re more interested in how you think and learn than what you know.

Infrastructure


Our infrastructure areas are key to the firm’s success. Roles in these areas offer endless opportunities to contribute directly and tangibly to our business. Everyone at Jane Street sits together on one trading floor, collaborating closely with each other to ensure that the firm’s critical functions operate efficiently while at the same time being constantly improved.





The specific skill set for each infrastructure position varies, but all include strong organizational, interpersonal and communication skills, detail orientation, and the desire to work in a team-based environment.





Positions include:

Business Development: documenting and solving problems related to the implementation of complex trading strategies within regulatory rules and under operational and technological constraints
Operations: P&L reconciliation, clearing & settlements (some other financial institutions describe this as back office)
Finance: accounting, regulatory capital finance, accounts payable/receivable
Tax
Human Resources
Recruiting
Legal & Compliance

Solution


Show me the answer

\(\def\V{\mathrm{Var}}\)
    Overview: the self-symmetry of the Sierpinski triangle leads to a linear equation that the covariance matrix \(\Sigma\) must satisfy; specifically,
      \(\Sigma = \tfrac{1}{4}\Sigma + \tfrac{1}{24}I\), which gives
    \(\fbox{\(\Sigma = \tfrac{1}{18}I\)}\).  
      

    Without rigorously defining the uniform distribution over the
    Sierpinski triangle, we can at least recognize that there are
    certain properties it should have.  The first relevant property is
    that it's invariant under rotation by 120°;
    it follows that \(\Sigma = kI\) for some \(k\).  (Consider:
    The ellipse \(\mathbf{x}^*\Sigma^{-1} \mathbf{x} = 1\) will be invariant under this
    rotation, and the only ellipses invariant under this rotation
    are circles.)  We have \(k = \Sigma_{11} = \V(X_1)\), so we
    have reduced the problem to finding \(\V(X_1)\).
    

      The next relevant property of the distribution is that it's
      equal to a mixture of 3 equally weighted copies of itself, with
      each copy scaled by 1/2 and translated by
      \((1/4,\text{something}),(-1/4,\text{something})\), or
      \((0,\text{something})\).  (The somethings are respectively
      \(-\sqrt{3}/12,-\sqrt{3}/12,\sqrt{3}/6\), but we don't need
      them.)  In particular, if \(T\) is uniform over
      \(\{-1/4,0,1/4\}\) (and independent of \(X_1\)), then \(X_1\)
      has the same distribution as \(\tfrac{1}{2}X_1 + T\).  We can
      directly compute \(\V(T) = 1/24\), and we then have
      \[
      \begin{align}
      k = \V(X_1) &= \V(\tfrac{1}{2}X_1 + T)\\
      &= \tfrac{1}{4}\V(X_1) + \V(T)\\
      &= \tfrac{1}{4}k + 1/24,
      \end{align}
      \]
      and solving for \(k\) now yields \(k = 1/18\), so \(\Sigma = \tfrac{1}{18}I\).
    
A similar approach is to write \(X_1 = \sum_{n=0}^\infty
      \frac{1}{2^n}T_n\) where the \(T_n\) are independent copies of \(T\).
      Then \(\V(X_1) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \V(\frac{1}{2^n}T_n) =
      \frac{1}{24} \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{1}{4^n} = 1/18\).

Work where
your mind matters


Jane Street’s internships offer an exceptional opportunity to learn about the firm and the world’s financial markets.






Insight
While proximity to graduation is an advantage, we hire students of all tenure, from freshmen to post-doctoral scholars.
Internships take place in all three of Jane Street’s offices. Most summer interns also get a chance to visit a foreign office during their experience.
Past interns have reported that the best part of the internship is the rich educational experience. Every week brings a mix of finance theory and technology classes, mock trading sessions, and guest speakers, on top of careful one-on-one mentoring with experienced traders and technologists.











Internships We Offer


All of our offices follow a slightly different internship schedule, but no matter where you’re based we will always do our best to work around your academic commitments.
Typically our summer internships run for 10-12 weeks between May and September. Our winter internships vary a bit more office to office. New York offers a one month winternship during January, while London and Hong Kong have longer winternship programs (usually 10-16 weeks) that run between November and May. For Australasia students, we have a summer internship program in Hong Kong which takes place from late November to late February.
These schedules are flexible, so if this timing isn’t exactly what you had in mind, don’t worry; we can work out the details later. You’ll also notice that we have an off-cycle internship application for our London and Hong Kong offices. If you’re not exactly sure what to apply for, selecting this option will allow you to specify your exact availability. We can help you sort it out from there.





Trading Interns
Work with experienced traders to find and analyze arbitrage strategies, hedge risk, and search for new opportunities. Trading interns usually split their summer between two different trading desks, and spend a week in one of our overseas offices.




Apply Here




Business Development Interns
Work with our business development, compliance, and operations teams to understand the regulatory and operational frameworks of various financial markets, and how they impact the implementation of the firm’s systems, processes, and trading strategies.  Business development interns rotate through projects and mentors over the summer, and spend a week in our London office.




Apply Here





Developer Interns
Work with experienced dev mentors on projects that are wide-ranging and have real impact. Learn about trading through classes and build bots that compete on a simulated exchange. Past interns have built protocol compilers, hacked on the internals of our concurrency library, and built real-time visualization tools. Many intern projects are subsequently released as open-source.

On a busy day, we engage in over a million trades.






Our trading is based on our own proprietary models.
Quantitative analysis and insights into related markets enable us to make competitive markets in even the most complicated products. Technology is at the core of how we approach trading, and we consider ourselves as much a technology company as a trading firm.

Our History


Jane Street was founded In 2000 by three traders and a technologist with a common vision:

















Jane Street has grown every year in its team, capital, and global presence, while enhancing its expertise in technology, operations, and trading. We safely navigated the dotcom and subprime excesses, staying true to our core focus rather than following the herd.





Jane Street’s team is now over 600 strong, and our trading volumes have skyrocketed as we’ve refined our understanding of how to value, trade, and hedge complex securities.
