The broadcast features several prominent guests and their reactions to Kerry's acceptance speech. Former U.S. Senator George Mitchell, Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi, Lawrence O'Donnell - a writer and former assistant to Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan - and Mitchell Gold, a delegate from North Carolina, all give their thoughts on Kerry's speech and the upcoming election.This product is manufactured on demand using DVD-R recordable media.
