Personal & Companion Care for Seniors | Starlight Caregivers










 
 
 
 
 

















Personal & Companion Care
Descriptions of StarLight CareGivers Companion Care and Personal Care Services.
What is Personal Care?
Oftentimes, seniors and the disabled are uncomfortable having family members support them with highly personal tasks like bathing and toileting. Having a caregiver outside the family network to help with these duties allows these individuals to maintain his or her sense of dignity. Some personal care examples include:

Bathing and Hygiene 


It's no surprise that good personal hygiene is very important to the physical and mental well-being of all of us. Our caregivers are specially trained in personal hygiene and other personal care services, and always focus on preserving the dignity, comfort, and health of each client.


Walking Assistance, Mobility, and Posture Positioning

Our clients benefit from regular movement which results in improvements physically and mentally. This movement helps with digestion and circulation, and stimulates the mind with new sights and sounds of different rooms or the fresh air of outdoors Our caregivers carefully consider the physical limitations and comfort of each individual's ability to walk, climb stairs, get in and out of vehicles, chairs, beds, bathrooms and other routine movements. We also make sure each client maintains proper posture for eating or while sitting and reading or watching television.


Toileting Care

Our specialized caregivers are trained and experienced in assisting with urinary and bowel care, with the utmost attention given to a client's comfort and self-esteem.


Oral Hygiene

Our caregivers can help our clients with mouth, gum, and denture care to encourage better overall oral hygiene. Caregivers will carefully brush and floss teeth, gums, and the tongue, as well as the removal and replacement of dentures.




What is Companion Care?
We offer wide range of companion care services which can be carried out in the home, in the hospital, or in various healthcare facilities.


Regular Visits, Conversation, and Company

Having a regular visitor with common interests or other special qualities can be something to look forward to on a daily basis, and this can make all the difference in the world to someone living alone or home alone during the day or night. This can be as simple as walking and talking, watching movies together, or even a trip to the bowling alley for the adventurous. We match the caregiver to the clients' interests.


Medication Reminders


Our caregivers cannot administer medications, but they can provide regular reminders for oral medications or injections and the monitoring of side effects or other medical issues. We also offer a video-based monitoring solution where loved-ones can participate through an internet connection.


Special Diets, Meal Preparation, Eating Assistance

Cooking and cleaning up is our job. Our caregivers can prepare regular meals focused on maintaining a healthy diet and sufficient nutrition. We are happy to do the shopping and prepare meals per the client's specific direction or meal plan, or we can get creative with other healthy options. In fact, we encourage and provide incentive to our caregivers to take cooking classes. Due to some of our client's physical and emotional challenges in the ability to perform basic functions, like the act of eating, our caregivers provide exceptional sensitivity, care, and safety for these challenges.


Light Housekeeping


Leave the cleaning to us! Safety and cleanliness in the home are very important, and our caregivers provide services including vacuuming, dusting, trash removal, organizing and tidying, and the thorough cleaning of kitchens and bathrooms. We cannot do such tasks as lifting or moving furniture, or washing windows, but we are happy to provide quality referrals when asked.


Laundry Services

We clean and organize clothes and linens. Our caregivers can do the wash, dry, fold, iron and organize clothing, bed linens, and towels into closets and drawers. Laundry can pile up fast, and can be difficult to manage for people due to physical restrictions. Let us help keep the home clean and safe.


Shopping, Errands, and Transportation

Stocking the refrigerator with fresh goods from the grocer, getting medications at the pharmacy, and a trip to the doctor are typical services in this category. But some customers also need a ride to a friend's home, a movie theatre, or various other social and recreational activities. Our caregivers provide a safe journey using their own vehicle, or if required, the client's vehicle. Proper insurance and clean driving records are checked and mandatory.


Mail and Paperwork Organization


We can help when the mail is piling up and bills are not being paid. At the specific direction of our clients, our caregivers can assist with opening and reading mail, keep track of bills and other important documents, and help to organize household mail and other paperwork.


Live-In Services

Clients and their families may need to have regular care administered by a caregiver who resides in the home. We provide these special 24-hour care arrangements whether it be temporary or more permanent. Call for details.


Technology Services

We also offer unique technology to supplement our caregiving service which can bring loved ones piece of mind. Client's families can see exactly when caregivers have checked into and out of the home, and review any notes the caregiver may have taken. The caregiver can also receive specific notes from loved ones on what to watch for or relay special needs for the day.
We also offer a unique web-based video service that is user friendly for seniors, and a variety of emergency response devices in case of a fall or other special conditions.


Respite Care

Families need a break to maintain their own health. This is critical as caregiving can be immensely stressful. We can help relieve this stress of caring for a loved one by providing a much-needed break to primary caregivers.

Experienced Professional Insured Caregivers | Starlight Caregivers










 
 
 
 
 

















About Our Caregivers
Join our Team

StarLight CareGivers are our direct employees, not contractors. They are fully insured, including workers compensation and liability insurance, and they are bonded by us. This totally protects clients and places full responsibility on the agency. Do not be misled by a registry service that may send an unqualified, un-insured stranger into your loved ones home. StarLight is also responsible for all caregiver benefits, tax withholding, and employer contributions for federal and state unemployment insurance.


We differentiate from other home care services by selecting only the best and experienced caregivers, and that means roughly 5% of applicants are hired, most of which are certified nurse assistants (CNA) or certified home health aides (HHA). A rigorous 12 step interview process focuses on both personality and qualifications combined. This process includes hiring only experienced caregivers, training and re-training to our standards, checking references, doing national criminal background checks, reviewing driving records and proof of auto insurance, drug testing, screening for tuberculosis (TB), fingerprinting, and using E-Verify. We also provide our caregivers with continuous education on the latest developments in elder care.
Our caregivers are our employees and greatest asset, we manage all aspects of taxes, benefits, and workers compensation – all of these elements are critical in protecting and shielding our customers and allows StarLight CareGivers to provide these premium services.
We carefully select a perfect match caregiver for our clients and guarantee the right person for the job is on the job. These unique profiles are set up during our detailed assessment process with clients to understand their care needs and special interests, and also during the hiring process with our caregivers to characterize their skills and interests. These matching models are represented in our custom care plan.
