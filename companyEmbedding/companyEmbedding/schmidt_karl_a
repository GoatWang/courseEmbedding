You are here: Services > Transport > Container Fleet
The SCHMIDT Container FleetThe use of intermodal carriers such as rail and sea is ever increasing in significance.   It is unthinkable that they will not be part of the world of transport.Operating a network of intermodal transports on rail and road, deploying state-of-the-art transport units and handling equipment as well as by means of their long-term expertise in bulk transportation, SCHMIDT is capable to provide an efficient and reliable alternative to traditional road transportation.By developing an intermodal infrastructure, container transports for international and national traffic volumes could be designed.
Containers as unaccompanied transport units are particularly suitable for long-distance destinations.  
 
 
Advantages:
  Utilization for transport and / or storage Utilization as emergency/safe storage Flexible supply of raw material to consignee to realize “just-in-time” concepts Economic implementation of one-way traffic Consequent utilization of environmentally friendly transport modes such as rail, barge and vessel  
Our own container transport vehicles with their special technical equipment such as tilting, compressor and rotary feeder ensure safe and reliable processing of the transport activities.
 
Based on our longterm experience in container traffic and the acquired technical knowledge, the container fleet meanwhile has been expanded to more than 1100 transport units. 
 
Strengths:
  SCHMIDT’s corporate logistics centers providing a container infra-structure (occasionally providing their own railway siding) SCHMIDT’s corporate European chassis fleet 5000 state-of-the-art SCHMIDT bulk containers Close cooperation with railway and maritime carriers Designing individual block train concepts  
The following containers are available to meet individual requirements:30’ pressurized tank container
 
Pressurized containers are suitable for nearly any free-flowing, dry bulk material.Un-/loading of these tank containers is identical to that of conventional road tankers.
    Capacity: 42 - 50 m³   Dead weight: 2.4 - 2.5 t    Outer dimensions:   Length 9152 mmWidth 2500 mmHeight 2600 mmOperating pressure 2.0 bar    40’ pressurized tank container
 
Its large volume and relatively low dead weight allow for optimum loads of nearly any dry bulk material into 40’ pressurized containers. SCHMIDT provides the appropriate equipment for un-/loading.
    Capacity: 56  m³   Dead weight: 2.0 - 3 t    Outer dimensions:   Lenth 12,192 mmWidth 2500 mmHeight 2600 mmOperating pressure 2.0 bar    30’ aluminum box container
 
This container type is especially suitable for granulated products of the petrochemical industry. Special rotary feeders necessary for unloading are available at most SCHMIDT logistic centers or available on site on stand-by.
    Capacity: 56 m³   Dead weight: 1.8 - 2.1 t    dimensions Outer:   Length 9152 mmWidth 2500 mmHeight 2743 mm    30’ high-cube aluminum box container
 
These containers are somewhat wider and higher than the regular aluminum box containers and are also suitable for nearly any dry bulk goods.
Un-/loading is identical to that of conventional road tankers.
    Capacity: 59 m³   Dead weight: 2,3 t    Outer dimensions:   Length 9152 mmWidth 2550 mmHeight 2895 mm    30’ bag-in-box container
 
Inside these containers, so-called ”inliners” are fixed to the walls and filled with the material to be transported or stored.
This container type is suitable for free-flowing granulated and powdery bulk goods. Food raw materials such as rice, sugar, corn etc. are subject to stringent hygiene requirements being complied with as the inliner is only used once. Unloading via rotary feeder/s.
Special free-flow inliners and special rotary feeders are used for powdery products.
    Capacity: 56 m³   Dead weight: 2.8 - 2.9 t    Outer dimensions:   Length 9152 mmWidth 2500 / 2550 mmHeight 2743 mm

Karl W. Schmidt, founder of Karl W. Schmidt (KWS) & Associates, Commerce City, Colorado, has announced his upcoming retirement and the sale of his business, which provides consulting, engineering and manufacturing of custom recycling systems. He will stay on with the company, which now will be known as Karl Schmidt Manufacturing, to consult. “I don’t have children; KWS & Associates Inc. is my legacy, and I am excited to pass it on and happy that my conveyors and business will continue to serve others,” Schmidt says.  Chad TeBeest has purchased KWS & Associates. He is an experienced manufacturing business owner, according to a news release from the company. TeBeest earned a bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering and a master’s degree in engineering technology management. He currently owns Protocast Inc., a foundry and machine shop in Denver. Since being hired by Protocast in 2005, TeBeest has worked his way up from machinist to owner and has grown the company from 12 employees to 30. Innovation and creativity that is focused on clean, efficient manufacturing has led to Protocast’s success and will benefit Karl Schmidt Manufacturing, the company says.“We are excited about the business and look forward to serving our clients’ needs,” TeBeest says. Schmidt will continue to work with the company that he founded 38 years ago, passing on his knowledge and customer relationships. He says he is looking forward to being able to relax somewhat and to see the legacy of excellence that he has built over the past 38 years continue.  KWS & Associates says it has enabled clients in more than 35 countries to operate effectively and stay competitive through innovation and sustainable technologies.
