Parametric Expands Institutional Consultant Relations Team

Jan 27, 2015, 09:00 ET
		  		  					
						 from   Eaton Vance Corp. 











 
















































 

 




















 


SEATTLE, Jan. 27, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Parametric Portfolio Associates LLC ("Parametric"), a subsidiary of Eaton Vance Corp.(NYSE:   EV), today announced it has added depth to its institutional sales team with the hiring of Consultant Relations professional William A. "Bill" Busch Jr. In his new role, Mr. Busch is responsible for developing and maintaining relationships within the institutional investment consultant community, and will report to James Barrett, Parametric's Managing Director of Institutional Sales and Client Service.
Parametric is a leading provider of engineered investment strategies and implementation services to institutions, family offices and individual investors. Mr. Barrett, who leads the effort to expand Parametric's internal institutional sales and client service team, comments, "Bill is the fourth member to join our institutional consultant relations group since we began to build the team in 2013. He brings additional depth to our experienced and talented team and will work closely with the broader institutional effort at Parametric as we continue to focus on building long-term consultant relationships."
Among Parametric's engineered solutions for institutional clients are risk management strategies and overlay services that employ futures, options and similar instruments to help clients enhance risk-adjusted returns. 
Parametric's Chief Executive Officer, Brian Langstraat, emphasizes the growing role of institutional asset management at Parametric. "Parametric is committed to offering industry-leading portfolio implementation, risk management, and engineered investment strategies to institutional investors around the globe. Our ability to serve institutional clients dovetails well with our existing capabilities and technology, and continues to add meaningfully to our product offerings."
Mr. Busch will be based in Boston, MA. Prior to joining Parametric, he held positions at State Street Global Advisors in Consultant Relations and as a Product Analyst. He holds a B. A. in Sociology and Spanish from Bowdoin College, and an M.B.A. from the Carroll School of Management at Boston College.
Parametric, headquartered in Seattle, WA, is a leading global asset management firm, providing investment strategies and customized exposure management to institutions and individual investors around the world. Parametric offers a variety of rules-based, risk-controlled investment strategies, including alpha-seeking equity, alternative and options strategies, as well as implementation services, including customized equity, traditional overlay and centralized portfolio management. Parametric is a majority-owned subsidiary of Eaton Vance Corp. and offers these capabilities through investment centers in Seattle, WA, Minneapolis, MN and Westport, CT (home to Parametric subsidiary Parametric Risk Advisors LLC, an SEC-registered investment adviser). As of December 31, 2014, Parametric and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Parametric Risk Advisors LLC, managed $136.5 billion in client assets.
