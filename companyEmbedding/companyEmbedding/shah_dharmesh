The 5 Whys Of Feature Bloat

                                         Mar 1, 2016 
                                         
                                             / by Dharmesh Shah





It seems that just about everyone knows that a product that is a large heap of stinkin’ features is a Not Great Thing. There are hundreds of articles written on the topic of good product management and why it’s so important to fight the good fight against feature bloat.

                                         Apr 25, 2013

STOP! Before You Add That Feature, Do You Know The Real Cost?

                                         Feb 7, 2013 
                                         
                                             / by Dharmesh Shah





You're excited! And, why wouldn't you be? This could be the one. This could be that feature that unlocks the holy grail of viral user acquisition. This could be the one that drives your cancellation rates down to microscopic levels. This could be the one that the tech press writes about. This could then cause random strangers to give you a small, congratulatory smile as they pass you on the street, acknowledging your brilliance.

Lessons and Projects From The HubSpot Open Source Hack Night

                                         Feb 1, 2013 
                                         
                                             / by Dharmesh Shah





Have you ever run into a challenging technical issue and found the perfect answer over on Stack Overflow?  Or, come across an open source library that already does almost exactly what you were about to spend a bunch of time on?  Yep.  Me too.  Every day.  In fact, if there's a day that I don't have this experience, it means I'm freakin' working on PowerPoint slides instead of writing code. In any case, that's the beauty of an open system.  I'm continually amazed and grateful for the culture of openness that permeates the development and technical community.

Evolution of a Web Developer: From PHP Newbie To Python Ninja

                                         Apr 13, 2012 
                                         
                                             / by Dharmesh Shah





Apologies for the title.  Here's what I wanted the title to be:
Evolution of a Web Developer: From Newbie to Ninja Not-So-Newbie
because I don't like using the term ninja (or rockstar or guru).  But, putting the striketrhough in an article title is ill-advised.

 Secret To SaaS Success: Recognize That You're Not Selling Software


I've been working in the software industry for over 25 years. Pretty much my entire professional career (if you don't count that stint as a night clerk at Red Roof Inn). 
Back in the late 1900s, when you sold software, you sold software. What your company produced was a large set of properly aligned bits (software). You then got those bits to your customers somehow (floppy disk, DVD, FTP, whatever). And, then those customers installed those bits on a computer of their choosing and if a

 Why This New Chatbot Is More Likely To Get You Promoted Than Fired


Confession: For the past several months I've been furiously coding away on a new project as part of HubSpot Labs. It's called GrowthBot. It's a chatbot for marketing and sales people -- and anyone looking to grow a company (like startup folks). 
The launch has gone well, and my bot is currently happily handling thousands of messages. Things like "show me companies in california that use HubSpot" and "who are the top influencers about landing pages". GrowthBot can an

 Insightful Study of 386 SaaS Startup Pricing Pages


Late last year, I combed through the Montclare SaaS 250 — a directory of the biggest SaaS companies in the world — to find common trends in what I thought would be a significant dataset. As it turned out, 80% of the 250 biggest SaaS companies didn’t have a pricing page at all. 
Expecting to find a set of data more representative of what I’m used to seeing around (essentially startups), I turned to a bigger sample, scraping information from the first 400 startups in

 Zero to IPO: Lessons From The Unlikely Story of HubSpot


HubSpot has had a pretty good run.  Went from zero to IPO.  What's not known is how unlikely the story of our success is.

 The First Rule Of Disruption


Working on a startup?  Have a 800 pound gorilla you're trying to disrupt?  That's awesome.  But here's a tip:  Don't talk about disrupting them.   
The first rule of disruption is: You do not talk about disruption.  
 Why is this so important?  Why shouldn't you declare to the world (and the tech press) that you're going after the big kahuna?  Doesn't the media love a great David and Goliath story? 
Here are my reasons.  I

 Do Fewer Things, Better


I'm going to tell you a secret.  I have a very simple, 4-word strategic plan (devised it a few years ago). 
Here it is... 
Do fewer things, better. 
This has made my life -- and my work, dramatically better. 
Here's how I execute on my strategic plan: 
1. Decide on what matters the most. 
2. Say no to everything else. 
3. When something falls in the gray area, re-read #2. 
Of course, that's easier to say than do. I fail at it all th

 Happy Birthday HubSpot! 9 Lessons From Our First 9 Years


9 years ago today, on June 9th 2006, HubSpot was officially started. I remember the day, because it was also the day I graduated.  (I had promised myself I'd enjoy my 2 years in grad school without too much distraction, so deliberately picked graduation day as the official start-date for HubSpot.) 
So far, we've had a pretty good run.  HubSpot is now public [NYSE:HUBS] and still growing fast.  More importantly (at least to me), I'm still having a great time.

23 Amazing Facts About HubSpot's Dharmesh Shah


How much do you know about super successful entrepreneur and angel investor Dharmesh Shah?

WRITE A COMMENT

He's a successful entrepreneur whose Boston-based company has raised over $65 million in venture capital and was the subject of tech writer Dan Lyons' book Disrupted. But what helped shape Dharmesh Shah into an inbound marketing powerhouse?
Check out these incredible facts about the co-founder and CTO of HubSpot:
1.  A pioneer of inbound marketing, Dharmesh Shah met his HubSpot co-founder Brian Halligan when they were grad students at M.I.T.  The two set out to create an online marketing platform, driven by the flagging success of direct mail and other old school marketing tactics.
2.  Shah graduated M.I.T. with an MS in the Management of Technology, which he once described as, "... this weird kind of engineering mixed with like an MBA kind of thing... Essentially, an MBA with some technical geeky stuff thrown in."
3.  His first startup, Pyramid Digital Solutions, launched in 1994 when Shah was 24 years old. After bootstrapping it with less than $10,000, he sold it for millions to SunGard Data Systems, the company he'd worked for when he originally came up with the idea, in 2005. HubSpot is Shah's third company.
4.  Because he didn't like selling, Shah had a genius idea and convinced SunGard Data Systems to actually sell that first software he left their company to startup. Without even realizing what it was at the time, he struck a distribution partnership with a major player in software sales.
5.  Shah founded that first company with a co-founder: his brother, who was only 17 and just out of high school when Pyramid Digital Systems launched.
6.  He landed his brother a job at SunGard alongside him by convincing a manager that hiring a $75/hr consultant was a waste when the job was something his teenaged brother, then a grocery store clerk, could do just as well.
7.  Before co-founding HubSpot in July 2006, Shah had promised his wife he wouldn't start another company and would be an angel investor, instead. He started investing in other companies while at M.I.T. On his decision to start another company after promising not to, he's said, "I could not help myself. It's just a genetic flaw!"
8.  Shah counts Innovator Of The Year, Mass. TLC, 2009; Inc. 500 Award, 2000, 2001 & 2002; Boston Globe, #1 Hi-Tech Innovator, 2011; and Social Media Allstar, MITX, 2009 among his awards.
9.  From year one, HubSpot has had an internal wiki that gives employees access to all kinds of company information including cash balance, board decks, bank balance, sales figures, burn rate and more. Shah believes people do well within his company because of this transparency and other aspects of HubSpot's culture.
10.  He founded and writes for OnStartups.com, which has more than 350,000 members in its online community.
11.  Shah has identified blogging and social media as the two accelerants that helped HubSpot grow as quickly as it did.
12.  He still tries to write code every day and says it "keeps me in touch with reality and makes me a better entrepreneur.  Plus, I enjoy it."
13.  Before the HubSpot market product was even written or launched, Shah and Halligan started the HubSpot blog. They used it to position their software as an inbound marketing solution before it existed in the marketplace.
14.  According to Shah, insecurity is one of the worst fates to befall an entrepreneur. "If you could manage to take insecurity out of a team, amazing things happen. If you could take insecurity out of yourself, amazing things start to happen," he's said.
15.  Dharmesh Shah is the co-author of both Inbound Marketing: Get Found Using Google, Social Media, and Blogs, and Inbound Marketing: Attract, Engage, and Delight Customers Online.
16.  Shah said he faced his darkest entrepreneurial days in his first business, with the hiring of their first employees and facing down cash flow issues. By 2013, he said, "The thing that I worry about is that sometimes it's a matter of how you define success. For us it's like living up to the potential of the team that's here... That's what really keeps me up."
17.  Shah wrote his thesis on... you guessed it, software startups!
18.  Now an angel investor, Shah has said he tends to be slightly biased towards entrepreneurs who "have a point to prove" or even have a "small" chip on their shoulder.
19.  Shah has publicly stated that he hates enterprise software despite (or maybe because of?) the fact that his first company was an enterprise software brand. He explains why: "It's particularly bad now. Back in the 90s it wasn't so bad. It's  revenue concentration so you have a few number of customers that are writing you really big checks. Which then impacts your product road map. Because OK, if they're writing big enough checks you do what they ask you to do. We can not do that... People don't realize this but the feedback loop and the shortness of it has such a high impact on your overall success and happiness."
20.  In his first several dozen angel investing deals, which coincided with his founding and early growth of HubSpot, Shah was so pressed for time that he never met or even spoke on the phone with half the entrepreneurs he funded.
21.  Shah met a number of entrepreneurs online through his Onstartups blog and, when inspired, would decide to fund their projects. He was an early investor in Backupify, Shareaholic and Buffer, among others.
22.  He counts PHP, Codeigniter, MySQL, Python and Django  among his skills.
23.  One of the first things he does as an "introverted angel" is Shah Google searches an entrepreneur who's caught his attention.
He's said, "I'm going to find everything you've ever said, written or shared, essentially. I think the mark of a great entrepreneur today is that someone is in the game. It's not just a matter of, 'Oh, I woke up this morning and said this was a great idea. I'm going to go build a start-up.' You need to put yourself out there a little bit and give me evidence that you actually care."
Dharmesh Shah showcased his ability to roll with the punches in his company's response to the controversy created by the release of Disrupted.
There's much to be learned from the successes of entrepreneurs like Shah, but even more from the way they handle themselves when the chips are down!

Biography
Dharmesh Shah, Agile Coach
Seeing many companies struggling with the implementation of the Agile methodology, decided to move to Training and Coaching to help teams adopt Lean and Agile principles and reap the benefit. As I see, the problem is not the lack of Will on part of the company, but while implementing only few processes and the focus on the Principles is lost. This is due to the lack of in-depth knowledge of Lean and Agile along with poor training.
Here’s summary of overall experience,
•    Firm believer and applying Lean and Agile principles since 8 years and Certified Scrum Master since 6 years. 
•    Championed and transitioned multiple product groups to Agile Methodology using Scrum. The teams were spread across geographies of sizes 100 to 800 people and revenues ranging from $20 to $500 million. This resulted in improved quality, predictability and team morale.
•    Experienced in conducting practical based Agile and Lean trainings from Engineers to the Top Management.
•    In addition to being a Scrum Master, have been the Scrum Coach for 4 years guiding Scrum Masters and Team in implementing Lean and Agile principles
•    20+ years of diverse software industry experience with start-ups as well as large companies globally.
•    The Career journey started as a programmer and moving up the ladder, to Technical Lead, Architect, Manager and Program Manager while working on various different technologies and domains.
