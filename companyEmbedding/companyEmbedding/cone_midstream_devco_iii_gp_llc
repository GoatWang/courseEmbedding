I LP, during the period from the closing of the initial public
offering of the Partnership to the Effective Time (collectively,
the “ Excluded Liabilities ”) are not part of
the Assumed Liabilities.

2.6 Transaction Taxes

fifty percent (50%) by CONE Gathering and fifty percent (50%) by
the Partnership. To the extent under applicable law the
transferee is responsible for filing Tax Returns in respect of
Transaction Taxes, the Partnership shall prepare and file all such
Tax Returns. The Parties shall provide such certificates and
other information and otherwise cooperate to the extent reasonably
required to minimize Transaction Taxes. The Party that is not
responsible under applicable law for paying the Transaction Taxes
shall pay its share of the Transaction Taxes to the responsible
Party prior to the due date of such Taxes.

ARTICLE III.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF
CONE GATHERING

CONE Gathering hereby represents and
warrants to the Partnership Parties that, as of the date hereof and
as of the Closing:

3.1 Organization and
Existence . CONE Gathering has been duly formed and is
validly existing as a limited liability company and is in good
standing under the laws of its state of formation, with full
limited liability company power and authority to own, lease and
operate its properties and to conduct its business as and where
such properties are owned, leased and operated and such business is
conducted as of the date of this Agreement. CONE Gathering is
duly qualified as a foreign limited liability company to transact
business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which such
qualification is required, whether by reason of the ownership or
leasing of property or the conduct of business, except where the
failure so to qualify or to be in good standing would not,
individually or in the aggregate, result in a Sponsor Material
Adverse Effect.

3.2 Authority and Approval;
Enforceability . CONE Gathering has the limited liability
company power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement
and any other Transaction Document to which it is or will be a
party, to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby and to perform all the terms and conditions hereof and
thereof to be performed by it. The execution and delivery by
CONE Gathering of this Agreement and any other Transaction Document
to which it is or will be a party, the performance by it of all the
terms and conditions hereof and thereof to be performed by it and
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby have been duly authorized and approved by all
 
4


requisite limited liability company action of
CONE Gathering. Each of this Agreement and any other
Transaction Document to which CONE Gathering is or will be a party
constitutes or will constitute, upon execution and delivery by CONE
Gathering, the valid and binding obligation of CONE Gathering,
enforceable against CONE Gathering in accordance with its terms,
except as such enforcement may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws
affecting enforcement of creditors’ rights generally and by
general principles of equity (whether applied in a proceeding at
law or in equity).

3.3 No Conflict . Each
of this Agreement, the other Transaction Documents to which CONE
Gathering is or will be a party and the execution and delivery
hereof and thereof by CONE Gathering do not, and the fulfilment and
compliance with the terms and conditions hereof and thereof and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby
will not:

(a) conflict with any of the
provisions of the certificate of formation or limited liability

binding obligation of such Partnership Party, enforceable against
such Partnership Party in accordance with its terms, except as such

the Partnership Parties, threatened Proceedings against any
Partnership Party that would individually, or in the aggregate,

The Conflicts Committee engaged Evercore Partners to act as its independent financial advisor and to render a fairness opinion, and Locke Lord LLP to act as its legal advisor.  _______________  (1) The Partnership's revolving debt facility has an accordion feature which provides for an increase in potential total borrowing capacity to $500 million.

CONE Midstream to Acquire Remaining 25% Additional Interest in Anchor Systems
























CANONSBURG, Pa., Nov 16, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE via COMTEX) --


                                        








CONE Midstream Partners LP

 (the "Partnership") today announced it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire an additional 25% ownership interest in CONE Midstream DevCo I LP, commonly referred to as the "Anchor Systems".  The transaction, which is expected to close before the end of the fourth quarter, is for a total purchase consideration of $248 million, comprised of $140 million in cash and issuance of approximately 5.2 million common limited partnership units to our Sponsors.  The cash portion of the purchase consideration will be funded through borrowings under the Partnership's $250 million revolving credit facility
		[(1)]
	, which had $41 million drawn as of September 30, 2016.  The Partnership currently owns a 75% interest in the Anchor Systems, and acquisition of the remaining 25% ownership interest will increase the Partnership's ownership share of the Anchor Systems to 100%
		[(2)]
	.  The interest is being acquired from CONE Gathering LLC, which is jointly owned by subsidiaries of our Sponsors, CONSOL Energy Inc.

John T. Lewis, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive officer of CONE Midstream GP LLC, said, "We are pleased to announce our first dropdown transaction.  This acquisition demonstrates our commitment to grow CNNX over the long term, the supportive nature of our relationship with our Sponsors, and our Sponsors' confidence in the continued future growth of CONE.


                                        








"We project acquisition of the remaining 25% ownership interest in the Anchor Systems will be immediately accretive to our unitholders," continued Mr. Lewis.  "The financial impact of the acquisition is not included in our current EBITDA or DCF guidance and, depending on the timing of transaction closing, will be additive to those projected results.  The anticipated increase in distributable cash flow is expected to increase our future cash distribution coverage and enhance our ability to continue to grow our quarterly cash distributions over time.  Using a combination of debt and equity financing for this transaction keeps our balance sheet strong and leaves additional debt capacity for financing growth through new organic projects and third party opportunities.  We continue to view our very robust distribution coverage and low leverage as important positive attributes that set CONE Midstream apart from others in the industry."


                                        








The terms of the transaction were approved by the Board of Directors of CONE Midstream GP LLC (the "General Partner") following prior approval by the Board of Director's Conflicts Committee, which consists entirely of independent directors. The Conflicts Committee engaged Evercore Partners to act as its independent financial advisor and to render a fairness opinion, and Locke Lord LLP to act as its legal advisor.
