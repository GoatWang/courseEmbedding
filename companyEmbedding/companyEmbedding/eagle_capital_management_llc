Eagle Capital Management Philosophy
The investment team seeks to build a portfolio of businesses that are fairly valued based on their current franchise and where there appears to be limited market recognition of their long-term potential for growth. Over a long holding period, these opportunities can be the point of greatest return and lowest risk. The team seeks to avoid high expectation stocks where the future opportunity has been discounted and the cost of disappointment high.

The strategy invests primarily in large cap equity securities and employs a low turnover/long-term investment time horizon.
