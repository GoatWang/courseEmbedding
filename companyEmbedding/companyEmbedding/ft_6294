                    Every summer on Thursday nights in our beautiful town of Oxford, Ohio, you can come and listen to free music in the park!  It is always so much fun.  Folks in lawn chairs, kids on blankets, music in the air, kids playing in the fountains, dancing in front of the stage ... just so much to do and see.  If you are looking for a fun night, come on out.  The first night is June 1st and the music starts at 7:00 p.m.  Come early and get something to eat at our many fabulous restaurants!  Great way to spend the evening with family, friends, and neighbors!
