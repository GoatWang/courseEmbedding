Additionally, Mr. Piccirillo continues to work with a number of families out of the firms offices in his hometown of Erie, Pennsylvania. Mr. Piccirillo directs and works closely with several licensed, credentialed professionals on his client service team to help these high net-worth clients and their families manage their assets and organize their finances to meet their long-term objectives.

Mr. Piccirillo brings a vast range of experience and expertise to his work helping clients grow and preserve their wealth.

As managing principal and chief executive officer of Hill, Barth & King LLC, Chris Allegretti provides strategic direction to the firm with a focus on enhancing the quality and depth of its services to provide the greatest value to HBKS clients. He works with the 10 HBKS offices in Ohio, Pennsylvania and Florida to ensure the firms investment in people and resources is focused on client goals and that services are rooted in the firms commitment to long-range planning and superior client service.
Mr. Allegretti joined HBK in 1985, serving in various staff, supervisory and management positions through 1993. He was named a principal in 1994. In 1999, with the intention of creating a holistic financial services organization to serve the broader financial interests of HBK clients, he co-authored the firms strategy to develop a wealth management firm, and in 2000, consummated the process with the acquisition of The Sorce Financial Group and the resulting establishment of HBKS Wealth Advisors.

Joseph Kloecker offers his clients broad financial expertise amassed over more than 35 years  as a senior financial accounting officer in a large bank and as a financial planning and wealth management professional. Mr. Kloecker has an MBA and is also a CPA. Based in the Erie, Pennsylvania office of HBKS® Wealth Advisors (HBKS), he works exclusively with his clients, many of whom he has known for years through his extensive experience as senior vice president and controller of Northwest Pennsylvanias largest bank and through his varied and significant service to the community in a volunteer capacity.
Upon graduating from Gannon University, he began his accounting career in a staff accounting position at Marine Bank, which ultimately merged with PNC Bank. Marine Bank was the first bank acquired by PNC in the initial phase of deregulation of the banking industry in Pennsylvania. Mr. Kloecker served in a senior capacity for 20 years and was instrumental in the transition to PNC both at the local level and at the PNC Corporate Accounting level. In 1996, he left the bank to join The Sorce Financial Group, now HBKS Wealth Advisors since the firms merger with Hill, Barth & King, LLC, in 2001.
As a senior financial advisor, Mr. Kloecker works holistically with clients helping them preserve and grow wealth, developing investment and wealth protection plans that meet their financial goals and achieve the objectives for themselves and their families provided for by that wealth. His client base is characterized by long-term collaborative relationships. Most of his clients are business people in or near retirement and their families, including many colleagues from his banking days as well as clients introduced to him by HBKS Partners and Staff.
As a CPA, Mr. Kloecker brings a culture of attention to detail and a facility with the complex financial issues that are common to the finances of higher net-worth individuals and their families. He combines the analytical skills gained through his vast depth and breadth of experience with a commitment to personal financial planning and effective client communication and service. As HBKS Wealth Advisors is an independent Registered Investment Advisory firm, Mr. Kloecker and his colleagues provide independent and objective direction to clients.
Mr. Kloecker earned a B.S. in Accounting and an M.B.A. from Gannon University. He has always been very active in the local community, serving in leadership positions for a wide variety of professional and nonprofit organizations.

As principal of HBKS, Mr. Sorce collaborates with the firms partners and senior financial advisors to plan the firms strategic direction. As a senior financial advisor, he leads a team of HBKS licensed advisors and administrators working directly with clients in Pennsylvania, Florida and across the country to plot their financial course and help them achieve their financial objectives.
Mr. Sorce began his career in financial services in 1982 as an advisor with Investor Diversified Services in his hometown of Erie, Penn., where his father had been providing financial advice to Western Pennsylvanians since 1950. He continued with the firm, which was acquired by American Express Financial Group, until 1995, when he and his brother, Christopher N. Sorce, CFP®, also with American Express Financial Group, purchased an historic building in downtown Erie and established their own financial advisory firm. Over the next five years, Mr. Sorce served as president, chief compliance officer and managing principal of HBKS Wealth Advisors, which distinguished itself for an exhaustive planning process and subsequent investment counsel independent of the proprietary product-driven approach typical of large institutional firms.
As developing a sound financial plan for their clients required collaboration with other professional advisors, in particular CPAs, whose direction was critical in addressing the ubiquitous tax ramifications associated with planning and investing, Mr. Sorce spearheaded the Sorce Financial Group merger in 2000 with HBK CPAs & Consultants, one of the nations largest and most prestigious accounting firms. Mr. Sorce is a founding principal and senior financial advisor for the resulting HBKS Wealth Advisors, and continues his work with clients out of his offices in Erie and Pittsburgh.
Widely recognized for his expertise in financial planning and investing, Mr. Sorce is frequently called upon by Pittsburgh and Erie media for insights on local and national financial matters. He hosted the weekly radio call-in show, Money Matters for four years for WLKK-AM and the nightly Money Matters news segment for Eries CBS-affiliate television station. 
Mr. Sorce received his Bachelor of Arts degree from Boston University in 1977, his Certified Financial Planner designation in 1987 from the College for Financial Planning, and his Masters in Financial Services from The American College in 2007. He is active in his professional and local communities, a member of the Financial Planning Association, and past chairman of the St. Vincent Hospital Foundation and past member of the board of directors of Saint Vincent Hospital. He has served on numerous boards throughout his career.

Capital One® Secured Mastercard®


                                            I never had played in credit before, and someone suggested this card to me to build credit for the first time. I've been really satisfied for the most part. They report quickly and accurately, remind me when my bill is due, and the customer service has been kind and thorough....show more

                                            When I refinanced my car with them I had a great experience. When I opened a credit card with them the person who wrote a check to my current credit card company to transfer the balance left off a digit.

AAA Insurance


                                            I submitted a claim for a burglary in April. The beginning of this joke is that the girl that answered the 800 number didn't know where claims were sent.

                                            While the card offers nice perks, just like every other crappy card, there are hidden fees.

Wells Fargo


                                            I find it quite disturbing to see 24 one star, the lowest, ratings on the first page of Wallet Hub's most recent reviews of Wells Fargo. Somehow, in its overall summary, Wallet Hub still gives the impression Wells Fargo is a good banking option. What's going on here?

Christopher N. Sorce
Gregory J. Sorce




As principal of HBKS, Mr. Sorce collaborates with the firms partners and senior financial advisors to plan the firms strategic direction. As a senior financial advisor, he leads a team of HBKS licensed advisors and administrators working directly with clients in Pennsylvania, Florida and across the country to plot their financial course and help them achieve their financial objectives.
Mr. Sorce began his career in financial services in 1982 as an advisor with Investor Diversified Services in his hometown of Erie, Penn., where his father had been providing financial advice to Western Pennsylvanians since 1950. He continued with the firm, which was acquired by American Express Financial Group, until 1995, when he and his brother, Christopher N. Sorce, CFP®, also with American Express Financial Group, purchased an historic building in downtown Erie and established their own financial advisory firm. Over the next five years, Mr. Sorce served as president, chief compliance officer and managing principal of HBKS Wealth Advisors, which distinguished itself for an exhaustive planning process and subsequent investment counsel independent of the proprietary product-driven approach typical of large institutional firms.
As developing a sound financial plan for their clients required collaboration with other professional advisors, in particular CPAs, whose direction was critical in addressing the ubiquitous tax ramifications associated with planning and investing, Mr. Sorce spearheaded the Sorce Financial Group merger in 2000 with HBK CPAs & Consultants, one of the nations largest and most prestigious accounting firms. Mr. Sorce is a founding principal and senior financial advisor for the resulting HBKS Wealth Advisors, and continues his work with clients out of his offices in Erie and Pittsburgh.
Widely recognized for his expertise in financial planning and investing, Mr. Sorce is frequently called upon by Pittsburgh and Erie media for insights on local and national financial matters. He hosted the weekly radio call-in show, Money Matters for four years for WLKK-AM and the nightly Money Matters news segment for Eries CBS-affiliate television station. 
Mr. Sorce received his Bachelor of Arts degree from Boston University in 1977, his Certified Financial Planner designation in 1987 from the College for Financial Planning, and his Masters in Financial Services from The American College in 2007. He is active in his professional and local communities, a member of the Financial Planning Association, and past chairman of the St. Vincent Hospital Foundation and past member of the board of directors of Saint Vincent Hospital. He has served on numerous boards throughout his career.
