Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/23/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

Anacor Pharmaceuticals Appoints Wendell Wierenga To Its Board Of Directors






Business Wire




Sep 12, 2014 8:30 AM EDT













 


















































  “I am very pleased to become a member of the Anacor Board,” said Wendell Wierenga. “Anacor recently achieved a significant milestone with FDA’s approval of KERYDIN TM and I look forward to contributing to the continued success of the company.”    About Anacor Pharmaceuticals   Anacor is a biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering, developing and commercializing novel small-molecule therapeutics derived from its boron chemistry platform. Anacor’s first approved drug, KERYDIN TM (tavaborole) topical solution, 5%, is an oxaborole antifungal approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in July 2014 for the topical treatment of onychomycosis of the toenails. In July 2014, Anacor entered into an exclusive agreement with Sandoz Inc., a Novartis company, pursuant to which Sandoz will distribute and commercialize KERYDIN in the United States. Anacor’s lead product candidate is AN2728, an investigational anti-inflammatory PDE-4 inhibitor in development for the potential treatment of mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis and psoriasis. Beyond KERYDIN and AN2728, Anacor has discovered, synthesized and is developing six molecules. These include three wholly-owned investigational product candidates. AN2718 is an investigational topical antifungal, AN2898 is a backup compound to AN2728 and AN3365 is an investigational antibiotic for the potential treatment of infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria. Anacor has also discovered three other investigational compounds that it has out-licensed for further development. The first compound is licensed to Eli Lilly and Company for the potential treatment of an animal health indication. The second compound, AN5568, is licensed to Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative for the potential treatment of human African trypanosomiasis (HAT, or sleeping sickness) and the third compound is licensed to GlaxoSmithKline LLC for development in tuberculosis. Anacor also has a pipeline of other internally discovered topical and systemic boron-based compounds in earlier stages of research and pre-clinical development. For more information, visit http://www.anacor.com.   Forward-Looking Statements   This press release contains forward-looking statements, including statements regarding the progress, timing and results of Anacor’s clinical trials, safety and efficacy of Anacor’s product candidates, timing and potential approval of Anacor’s product candidates and timing and potential commercial success of Anacor’s products. These statements constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The words “may,” “might,” “will,” “should,” “estimate,” “project,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “expect,” “intend,” “outlook,” “believe” and other similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this release and Anacor undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement in this press release except as required by law. These forward looking statements are based on estimates and assumptions by Anacor’s management that, although believed to be reasonable, are inherently uncertain and subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. The following represent some, but not necessarily all, of the factors that could cause actual results to differ from historical results or those anticipated or predicted by Anacor’s forward-looking statements: the timely and successful launch of KERYDIN pursuant to Anacor’s distribution and commercialization agreement with Sandoz; any issues or delays arising during the course of Anacor’s Phase 3 studies or other studies relating to AN2728; any delay or failure by the FDA to approve AN2728; Anacor’s ability to timely and successfully launch, either alone or with a partner, AN2728; and the other risks identified in Anacor’s periodic filings, including Anacor’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2014.
