Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.
      

        Pro subscription required to use hedging strategies

Hedging %:
      

25%

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35
50
100




Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year




How many days after the end-of-quarter date before doing the backtest? (0 - 60) 

DAYS





      Or use day whenever the filing was submitted to the SEC
      (or the last filing when using a group of funds):
Starting Quarter

      By default backtester will test your strategy using all available dates going back to 2001 (for subscribers only).
      You can optionally adjust when the backtest actually starts.
    
Starting Quarter:
      
All Available Dates


  Ending Quarter:

What is a Hedge Fund? A Closer Look at Hedge Funds.
There are plenty of investment vehicles that financially savvy individuals can think about investing in or tracking. The hedge fund is just one of those, but it is also the one that is worth looking at. There’s an air of mystery about this type of investment vehicle, but it is not always a tough nut to crack. What investors need to do is to educate themselves on what hedge funds are and to understand what risks they should expect to expose their investments to.
How Do Hedge Funds Work?
Hedge funds are considered as viable alternatives to the existing forms of investment on the financial markets. However, it is not open to every individual investor. Rather, the funds are more ideal for people and institutions that have significant amount of assets that they want to be managed and grown. Managers typically pool together the assets of their clients to create a unified fund, and then they make their trades and investments using that single fund.
It is theoretically similar to mutual funds, but they differ in the techniques. That’s the reason why it’s not open to individual investors. There are significant risks involved – aside from traditional investment vehicles like the popular mutual funds and stock market options as well as bonds, hedge fund managers lean more towards high risk but sophisticated trading techniques to realize significant profits for their clients’ portfolio.
Adding to the risk exposure is the fact that hedge funds are not as closely regulated as the other financial instruments. Hedge fund managers are not always required to make filings and reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission, but that’s on a case to case basis. If the assets are large enough, the SEC will require reports. Hedge fund managers, however, are bound by law to protect their clients’ investments or face anti-fraud measures.
A Brief History of Hedge Funds
Hedge funds have a very long history. People and institutions began investing in this vehicle at the early 21st century. The funds never lost popularity over time. Before the recession hit, there was a total value of US$1.93 trillion being managed by hedge fund managers worldwide. The industry had a brief hiccup afterwards, because of the sub-prime mortgage crisis, but it eventually recovered. This is a testimony to how popular hedge funds really are, and how much investors are willing to trust their assets to managers.
Hedge fund assets totaled $2 trillion worldwide by April 2011, just three years after the crisis burst. By the third quarter of 2014, the worldwide value of assets under management or AUM is at $2.38 trillion and may continue to grow in the next years.
Hedge Fund Strategies
Hedge fund managers do not subscribe to a single strategy but, rather, they employ a combination of various strategies. It is not uncommon to find hedge fund managers putting some of the money in their management to purchase securities derivatives.
There are, however, some popular strategies that hedge fund managers acknowledge and use. Hedge fund managers will exercise any strategy and option within their discretion in response to several factors in the market.
Here are some of the strategies that hedge fund managers could use, either by itself or in tandem with other techniques in managing assets:

Global macro

This type of strategy relies on identifying macroeconomic events that take place around the world to make investment decisions. Managers generally look at the big picture globally to identify potential entry points for profitable investments. The Global Macro approach leverages multiple markets, and managers will employ long and short investment strategies to maximize profits from volatile market movements. This approach is very flexible, and very diversified as well because there are many variations of sub-strategy under this umbrella.

Directional

The directional strategy does not pay too much attention to what is happening to markets on a global basis. Instead, directional strategy dictates that fund managers look at each individual market movement when picking ideal investments. A typical action under this strategy is to invest in equities with an eye for the long term, and to couple that position with short-term buying and selling to hedge against risk.

Event-driven

Hedge fund managers following this philosophy are focused in following corporate events and leveraging their assets to earn from the market movement influenced by these occurrences. For instance, company consolidations and mergers can make possible upward movements in price. Event-driven hedge fund management will typically take positions before or after such events take place in order to leverage and earn profits from the price movements that occur. Even bankruptcy declarations can also spur action from event-driven hedge fund managers.

Relative value

Relative event hedge fund management focuses on finding price discrepancies and investing on those. This is the most technical of all the four management strategies discussed so far. Analysis is very comprehensive and somewhat holistic, as there are many types of analysis carried out under this strategy to identify the profitable price discrepancies.
How Do Hedge Fund Managers Approach Risk?
As mentioned above, hedge funds are not advisable for all types of investors because of the amount of risk involved in their operation. That is where risk mitigation comes in. In fact, managers operating in the hedge fund industry are described as being the most meticulous – they use the most stringent and the most precise means of protecting investments against the risks that the volatility of the market brings.
The most common method of reducing the risk exposure of managed assets is to diversify. The entirety of the funds used to set up the hedge funds are split between various investments, and varying investment positions. For instance, some of the funds may be put into long-term positions in low-risk, low-return funds that can steadily gain in the passage of time.
A portion of the funds may be invested in high-risk, high-return investment positions that the hedge fund manager may monitor in the short term, taking into consideration the risk factor and market environment.
In addition, hedge fund companies may employ risk officers. These are not people who are directly involved in trading, but have knowledge in how markets work. These risk officers will focus on identifying long and short-term risks to the assets under management, and will then work on creating a comprehensive risk management strategy that will be applied by the hedge fund managers for their managed assets.
Other techniques for managing risk in hedge funds include using risk management methodologies as well as operational due diligence.
Offshore and Onshore Hedge Funds
Because of their popularity and the global nature of their investment, hedge fund managers can be found all over the world. There are two types of hedge fund management companies, and they are the onshore and offshore hedge fund managers. Their differences lie mainly in the levying of tax on the investors’ earnings.
Offshore hedge fund managers give their investors the advantage of minimal tax consequences. For example, US-based investors who enjoy tax exemptions on their investments, particularly in retirement funds, will turn to offshore hedge funds. This helps them avoid being taxed for their income from the hedge funds.
On the other hand, if offshore hedge funds invest in instruments and securities in the United States, they can expect the US government to slap withholding taxes on their investments. However, there are no capital gains tax involved here – this is to make sure that offshore investors are not double-taxed for any increase on the value of their assets. Only their local jurisdiction has the legal right to levy any taxes on the investors for gains they see from their investments.
The presence of both onshore and offshore hedge management funds make the taxation more flexible and more personalized according to each investor’s personal expectations in taxation. In addition, it encourages global investment because of the measures imposed specifically to avoid the horrors of double-taxation – a common fear among investors who have eyes on diversifying globally.
Prominent Centers of Investment
The United States remains the center of global hedge fund management. 70% of the hedge fund managers that oversee the progress of global funds are based in the United States. The Securities and Exchange Commission has in its registry nearly 4,000 financial experts, as of April 2012, who handled management of hedge funds. These are found across the US, but most of them are based in New York City and Connecticut’s Gold Coast.
As for European hedge funds, London is the home of the managers with over 800 of them found in the city. In 2011, these firms were responsible for managing 85% of the hedge fund assets from continental Europe.
There is a growing market in Asia, particularly in Japan. Growing economic centers Hong Kong and Singapore are also experiencing a growth in hedge fund assets under management, but it will be some time before they achieve the demand in hedge fund managers enjoyed by the US and London in Europe. In fact, most of the hedge funds from Asia are managed by offshore companies based in these two centers.

Hedge Funds are not the only alternative way to invest in the investment universe. A different class of investment are Managed Futures.

 
Commodity trading advisors are these that provide managed futures accounts or funds and they have very different return profile and correlations than hedge funds. Managed Futures offer a good way to diversify hedge fund or other traditional investments and in some cases could also offer lower minimum investment requirements. Because hedge funds are usually stock picking and don’t provide crisis alpha, managed funds which do, are a good way to avoid painful market correction.

NEW YORK, Jan. 13, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- American Securities, LLC, a leading U.S. private equity firm, today announced the first and final closing of American Securities Partners VII, L.P. (ASP VII) with total capital commitments of $5 billion.  As a result of strong investor interest, American Securities closed the fund above the $4 billion target and at the hard cap the firm established at the outset of fundraising in September 2014.
"American Securities greatly appreciates the interest expressed in ASP VII by many long-standing relationships, as well as new investors, from the US and global investing community," said Michael G. Fisch, President and CEO of American Securities.  "This new partnership provides us with further equity capital to support management teams in growing their businesses."
American Securities invests in partnership with existing management teams of market-leading businesses, generally having $200 million to $2 billion of revenues and/or $50 million to $200 million of EBITDA.  The firm strives to be a long-term, value-added partner to the CEOs and management teams of the companies in which it is privileged to invest.  In deploying ASP VII, American Securities will pursue the same disciplined investment approach developed over the past 20 years and will aim to invest $200 million to $500 million of equity capital in each situation, although larger investments are also possible.
"ASP VII maintains the 25-year fund life potential of prior American Securities funds, thus permitting American Securities to remain invested in a company for many years and allowing management teams the flexibility to always act in the best long-term interest of their businesses," stated David L. Horing, a Managing Director of American Securities, who along with Mr. Fisch is a Managing Member of ASP VII's general partner. 
American Securities also plans to continue its tradition of investing with conservative financial structures.  CEOs of companies partnered with American Securities often comment that these aspects are beneficial to their businesses.  "We are a company with a long history of employee and management ownership, and American Securities has been a strong partner for us because of their long-term perspective coupled with their willingness to utilize lower leverage, which has provided greater flexibility to our business," said Joe Chlapaty, Chairman and CEO of Advanced Drainage Systems, Inc. (NYSE:   WMS).
The firm is led by an experienced and cohesive team.  The Managing Directors on the Investment Team average more than 13 years at American Securities.  Bill Redmond, former President and CEO of General Chemical Corporation, commented on the capabilities and support that American Securities provides, "During our partnership, we benefitted greatly from the stability and insight of the American Securities team.  They helped us create value for all of our stakeholders."  
In addition to the Investment Team, American Securities supports management teams with the Firm's Resources Group, a team of functional experts available upon request by CEOs.  George Thanopoulos, CEO of Metaldyne Performance Group Inc. (NYSE:   MPG) explained, "American Securities has been a truly value-added partner.  We have been able to continuously access the Resources Group, particularly in the areas of information technology and human capital.  American Securities brought MPG talent and unique capabilities that we've not seen in other private equity firms."  Since 2006, the Resources Group has included a strong China office to support management teams' Asia-Pacific activities.  Dave Brooks, President and CEO of Unifrax Corporation, observed, "We chose to work with American Securities a second time because of the strong relationships we built with their team initially.  In addition, we wanted to expand our footprint in China and felt that American Securities' local team in Shanghai provided valuable specialized expertise."  
American Securities LLC
Based in New York with an office in Shanghai, American Securities is a leading U.S. private equity firm that invests in market-leading North American companies with annual revenues generally ranging from $200 million to $2 billion and/or $50 million to $200 million of EBITDA.  American Securities and its affiliates have approximately $15 billion under management.

How to Maintain and Protect Your Motorcycle Battery One of the most over-looked aspects of motorcycles is battery maintenance. For many, there is a time during the year you put your motorcycle away for storage for a few months. Or even let it sit inactive for a longer period of time. This can be a huge problem, as batteries don't respond well to inactivity. Motorcycle batteries that sit for longer periods of time will build up sulphation on the battery plates. The sulphation will cause your battery's run-time, performance, and life to noticeably decrease. In the more advanced stages, the battery can be difficult (or even impossible) to charge or start your motorcycle. However, you can prevent this from happening and ensure that your battery holds up after inactivity: Use an automatic battery charger/maintainer: These units plug into standard 120VAC outlets and provide your battery with a charge current. This will keep the battery fully charged and maintained so that sulphation never builds up. It also helps towards breaking up loose sulphation that already may be present. Automatic chargers like the BatteryMINDer by VDC or Battery Tender by Deltran are perfect for these applications. Both of these brands can maintain your batteries in ways that prevent damage to your battery. It is always recommended if you're using a maintainer on any wet battery to make sure you monitor the water level of the battery. These chargers are fully automatic and can be left connected to your battery all the time. Keep your motorcycle battery in top shape: There are many types of batteries, and the two most common types for motorcycles are conventional (wet) and dry AGM (absorbed glass mat) batteries. In some cases BMW motorcycles use Gel batteries. In these cases a specific Gel charger must be used as standard chargers will not work on Gel batteries. If you have a conventional battery, you'll need to keep an eye on your fluid levels and add distilled water as needed. You should also clean your terminals with cleaning chemicals and protect them with a corrosion preventative. Do not let your motorcycle battery freeze: Whenever you decide to store your bike's battery, be sure it's in a place that does not consistently fall below freezing. This is an extremely quick way to find yourself with a cracked battery. If you keep a battery maintainer connected to your battery, this also helps work towards keeping the battery from freezing. If you'd like to look a little more in-depth or see some recommendations, please check out our article on the subject. If you have any questions about battery maintenance and would like to speak with one of our battery specialists, please give us a call at 1-800-405-2121.   Keeping Your Motorcycle Battery in Top Condition Motorcycle batteries tend to last between 3 and 5 years before needing to be replaced as long as the batteries are properly maintained. As with any battery that sits for longer periods of time without being used such as sitting through the winter months, the battery naturally lose their charge over time & will build up sulphation on the battery plates. This is the number one reason for premature battery failure. In spite of various opinions once enough heavy sulphation builds up on the battery plates it is very difficult if not impossible to reverse this process. Thus the reason for using a battery maintainer so the sulphation process never starts to begin with and the battery is kept fully charged. If your motorcycle battery is going to sit unused for longer than a month it is always recommended to use any 1-2 amp fully automatic battery maintainer such as the Battery Tender or Battery Minder. There are two reasons for this: Keep sulphation from building up on the battery plates.Keep the battery fully charged. It is also advantageous to remove battery cables from the battery as this eliminates any possible draws from the battery. There are three types of motorcycle batteries. Wet, Gel, and AGM (Absorbed Glass Mat). Most manufacturers use Wet or AGM batteries. The biggest issue with Gel batteries is they charge at a lower rate then Wet or AGM batteries. Wet and AGM batteries have the same charging characteristics. If you're using a Gel battery, the charging system must be set up specifically for Gel batteries as with any battery maintainer which also must be set to do Gel batteries. A Wet battery's biggest draw back is the battery acid which can evaporate if it sits for longer periods of time, especially if connected to a battery maintainer for that time. If you have a Wet battery where you can check the fluid levels then you should always do so and keep the fluid levels topped off. The positive and negative connections on any battery should always be kept cleaned to ensure maximum transfer of electrical charge. There are special products that are made just for this type of maintenance, although using water and baking soda is effective for most people. By properly maintaining any battery you can greatly enhance battery life which can result in having a working battery for years to come.

It is always recommended if you're using a maintainer on any wet battery to make sure you monitor the water level of the battery. These chargers are fully automatic and can be left connected to your battery all the time. Keep your ATV battery in top shape: There are many types of batteries, and the two most common types for ATVs are conventional (wet) and dry AGM (absorbed glass mat) batteries. If you have a conventional battery, you'll need to keep an eye on your fluid levels and add distilled water as needed. You should also keep your terminals protected with a corrosion preventative. Do not let your ATV battery freeze: Whenever you decide to store your ATV battery, be sure it's not exposed to extremely low temperatures. Below-freezing temperatures can leave your battery cracked. If you keep a battery maintainer connected to your battery, this keeps the molecules moving and works towards keeping the battery from freezing.

Laptop battery reconditioning is more than just possible and there are a lot of different ways to achieve that, but some of them may be time consuming. In any case, it is the best choice to try simply because a new laptop battery is expensive and it may cost more than a new laptop.

You are going to need the flash camera capacitor. There are a lot of cheap cameras of this type that you can disassemble and use their parts. You will know what a capacitor is, due to the fact it is a big cylinder part.
Add a battery holder and a switch to the capacitor. Stick the wires to the big black cylinder and connect them with the battery holder and a switch.
Make sure all wires are insulated and they don’t touch anything that can conduct electricity.
Place an alkaline battery into the capacitor and the NiCad battery into the holder you added before.
Then, press the switch and wait the LED to glow. Then repeat the step. Keep in mind that you should hear a sound, that’s meansthat the sulfur crystals are destroyed and your battery can be used again.

Once you make this ‘’gadget’’ you can use it for reconditioning NiCad batteries for ever. It may sound complicated, but it is very simple, and you cannot make a mistake. In addition, it is possible to buy a capacitor for this application, but it is too much expensive and it won’t do the job better than this device.

[Video] bring your old batteries back to life instead of buying new ones1. Remove the battery and open the caps. Some batteries have rubber protection, but you can easily remove it as well. Remove all the caps and do not place them back until you are done.
2. In most cases, a battery won’t have enough distilled water and this is the main issue. In that case, add the distilled water and recharge the battery. Once again, do not place the caps back. Keep in mind that the battery must have between 13 and 14 volts when you measure it with a voltmeter.
3. If this doesn’t solve the problem, you can try a more aggressive method. You should get an acid pack and replace the acid and add new distiller water. In that case, repeat the procedure with charging and you should get a new battery.
Don’t forget that the charging battery should be between 10 and 12 hours, if you use a slow charger. On the other side, if you use a quick charger you can recharge it in less than 6 hours. It is a much better choice to measure the battery levels with a voltmeter, while charging in order to get the best results.
Keep in mind that this type of acid can be dangerous, so it isn’t a very safe procedure, but you can manage it and be completely protected if you wear goggles and gloves. The situation is the same if you are planning to completely replace the battery acid.
In some cases, if the battery cells are damaged, you won’t get the 100% capacity from the battery, as when it was new. On the other side, you will get more than 70% of the power the battery had when it was new. This is enough for most batteries, simply because it is enough power for their applications.
Learning yourself how to recondition batteries will have a positive effect on the environment and the planet in general. At the same time, you will save money and you will be able to prolong the life of your batteries. On the other side, all these procedures are very simple.
