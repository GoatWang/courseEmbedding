      Fitch Rates Fifth Third Auto Trust 2014-3
    





October 29, 2014 11:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings assigns the following ratings to the notes issued by Fifth 
      Third Auto Trust 2014-3:
    

      --$218,000,000 class A-1 notes 'F1+sf';
    

      --$170,000,000 class A-2-A notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$170,000,000 class A-2-B notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$340,000,000 class A-3 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$102,000,000 class A-4 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS:
    

      Strong Collateral Quality: The pool is consistent with that of recently 
      issued Fifth Third Auto Trust (FITAT) transactions exhibiting a weighted 
      average FICO score of 759 with no scores below 650. The pool also 
      benefits from 15 months of seasoning and is diverse from a make/model 
      and geographic perspective.
    

      Extended Term/Used Vehicle Exposure: The pool does include heavy 
      concentrations in loans over five years (77.1%), including those 
      financing used vehicles, which could expose the pool to higher loss 
      severity.
    

      Sufficient CE Structure: Initial hard credit enhancement (CE) for the 
      class A notes is 4.25% with a target level of 4.75%. Excess spread is 
      expected to be 1.93%. Under Fitch's analysis, the structure is able to 
      support stressed losses commensurate with the expected ratings. The 
      seasoning adjusted base case loss proxy is 1.00%.
    

      Improved Loss Performance: Losses on Fifth Third's auto loan portfolio 
      and recent securitizations have declined significantly from peak levels 
      in 2006 to 2008 due to strong underwriting standards and improved credit 
      quality.
    

      Evolving Wholesale Market: The U.S. wholesale vehicle market is 
      normalizing following strong performance in recent years. Fitch expects 
      increasing used vehicle supply from off-lease vehicles and trade-ins to 
      pressure ABS recovery rates leading to moderately higher loss rates. 
      Fitch's analysis accounts for this risk by including periods of weak 
      wholesale vehicle market performance in the derivation of its base case 
      loss expectation.
    

      Stable Origination, Underwriting, and Servicing: Fitch believes Fifth 
      Third demonstrates adequate abilities as originator, underwriter, and 
      servicer to service FITAT 2014-3.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES:
    

      Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity 
      on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base 
      case. This could result in potential rating actions on the notes. Fitch 
      evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to class A notes of 
      Fifth Third Auto Trust 2014-3 to increased losses over the life of the 
      transaction. Fitch's analysis found that the class A notes display minor 
      sensitivity to increased defaults and losses under Fitch's moderate 
      (1.5x base case loss) scenario; however, the class A notes could 
      experience a downgrade of up to one rating category under Fitch's severe 
      (2.5x base case loss) scenario.
    

      Key Rating Drivers and Rating Sensitivities are further described in the 
      presale report dated Oct. 16, 2014. Fitch's analysis of the 
      Representations and Warranties (R&W) of this transaction can be found in 
      Fifth Third Auto Trust 2014-3 --Appendix'. These R&Ws are compared to 
      those of typical R&W for the asset class as detailed in the special 
      report 'Representations, Warranties, and Enforcement Mechanisms in 
      Global Structured Finance Transactions' dated April 17, 2012.
    

      The presale report is available to all investors on Fitch's website at 'www.fitchratings.com'.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

Planning for retirement is one of the most important things you can do in life. And it’s never too early—or too late—to start. So tell us where you are today. We’ll help you get to the right retirement tomorrow.

Start Planning

              Plan For Education

Planning for the costs of education
It’s smart to go to college. It’s even smarter to plan ahead. If you have a child or grandchild and you want to start saving for their education, you’re in the right place. A 529 savings account is a great way to help pay for higher education. It allows your money to grow over time with the security of FDIC insurance and 529 tax advantages.

Student Planning


              Buy A Home

Buying a home
Buying a house is a big deal. And finding the home of your dreams is only part of it. You’ll also want to find the loan that fits your finances.
At Fifth Third, our Mortgage Loan Originators are here to listen to you, learn about your unique needs, and answer all of your questions. Then, we will find the loan that's right for you.

Life Events
Life is full of surprises. Some are great—like suddenly falling in love and planning a wedding. Others are not so great. But whatever life has in store, it’s important to be financially prepared. We can help you and your personal bank accounts get ready.

Life Events


              Consolidate Debt

Consolidate Debt
Credit cards, auto loans, money borrowed for college—paying all those bills every month can be a real hassle. Why not consolidate your debts with someone you can trust?
Consolidating with Fifth Third can help simplify your life by giving you one simple monthly payment. Plus, our competitive rates can really help you put more of your money in your personal bank account.
