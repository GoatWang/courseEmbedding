 One Man's 9-Minute Secret to Retiring Rich  by Investing Daily Staff - May 1, 2017     Years ago Jim Fink knew he’d need to make a change if he was ever going to retire.
It's a similar problem a lot of Americans are dealing with as they approach retirement.
He had a good job, was squirreling away money in his IRA, and investing in stocks—but wasn’t really getting anywhere.
The piddly returns he was making that way seemed like a waste of time. He needed something better.
Luckily Jim worked at an office building in Chicago, close to the financial district.
One day he ran into a "trader" who shared an approach that would go on to change Jim's life forever.
So Jim started experimenting with the approach he learned...
Before long he was generating extra monthly income like $1,200, $1,800, and $2,100... and all in a matter of weeks!
His nest egg began to grow exponentially, and before long he had turned a mere $50,000 into a massive $5.3 million.
Now, years later, Jim trades full-time—and lets independent-minded investors follow the exact approach he's now perfected.
It’s an easy, step-by-step process that takes just 9 minutes to per week.
Best of all, unlike many risky approaches to making money, there's a built-in safety net unique to his strategy that can make it safer than traditional investing.
In fact, safety-loving Warren Buffett pulled in $4.7 billion following this exact approach not too long ago.
The full story behind how Jim makes his trades is right here.

Alternative Strategies

An alternative future
What is alternative investing?












If you're looking for options beyond the traditional 60% stock/40% bond portfolio, consider the alternatives.
Alternatives span a diverse range of asset classes that may help you construct a more diversified portfolio. Plus, the increased availability of liquid alternative investment vehicles means that you can easily access
these strategies.
Investing in alternative strategies requires a comprehensive understanding of:

An extremely broad category of diverse investments ranging from soybeans
to real estate to bank loans.
The role that various alternative strategies can play in your portfolio.

Invesco believes portfolios should be robust and diversified with the ability to perform in the widest possible array of market environments. We believe this strategy is better able to help investors achieve their timeless goals:

1 Invesco as of Dec. 31, 2016. Includes private real estate, alternative credit, liquid inflation hedges, hedged and macro strategies, and private equity.
Diversification does not guarantee a profit or eliminate the risk of loss.
Liquid alternatives (liquid alts) are alternative investment strategies that are available through alternative investment vehicles such as mutual funds, ETFs, closed-end funds, etc. that provide daily liquidity.
Alternative products typically hold more non-traditional investments and employ more complex trading strategies, including hedging and leveraging through derivatives, short selling and opportunistic strategies that change with market conditions. Investors considering alternatives should be aware of their unique characteristics and additional risks from the strategies they use. Like all investments, performance will fluctuate. You can lose money.

            Investing In The Fund
        

What Are the Risks?

All investments involve risks, including possible loss of principal.
The Fund's performance depends on the skill in selecting, overseeing, and allocating Fund assets to the sub-advisors.
The Fund is actively managed and could experience losses if the investment manager's and sub-advisors' judgment about particular investments made for the Fund's portfolio prove to be incorrect.
Some sub-advisors may have little or no experience managing the assets of a registered investment company.
Foreign investments are subject to greater investment risk such as political, economic, credit and information risks as well as risk of currency fluctuations.
Investments in derivatives involve costs and create economic leverage, which may result in significant volatility and cause the Fund to participate in losses (as well as gains) that significantly exceed the Fund's initial investment.
Lower-rated or high yield debt securities involve greater credit risk, including the possibility of default or bankruptcy.
Currency management strategies could result in losses to the Fund if currencies do not perform as the investment manager or sub-advisor expects.
The Fund may make short sales of securities, which involves the risk that losses may exceed the original amount invested.
Merger arbitrage investments risk loss if a proposed reorganization in which the fund invests is renegotiated or terminated.
Liquidity risk exists when securities have become more difficult to sell, or are unable to be sold, at the price they have been valued.
Please see the prospectus and summary prospectus for information on these as well as other risk considerations.

Important Legal Information

CFA® and Chartered Financial Analyst® are trademarks owned by CFA Institute.
Total Returns include change in share price, assume reinvestment of all distributions, and reflect the deduction of fund expenses and applicable fees. Total Returns With Sales Charge: returns reflect the deduction of the stated sales charge. Total returns, distribution rate, and yields reflect any applicable expense reductions, without which the results for those impacted funds would have been lower.
All investments involve risks, including possible loss of principal. The market values of securities owned by the Fund will go up or down, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably. The Fund's performance depends on the manager's skill in selecting, overseeing, and allocating Fund assets to the sub-advisors. The Fund is actively managed and could experience losses if the investment manager's and sub-advisors' judgment about particular investments made for the Fund's portfolio prove to be incorrect. Some sub-advisors may have little or no experience managing the assets of a registered investment company. Foreign investments are subject to greater investment risk such as political, economic, credit and information risks as well as risk of currency fluctuations. Investments in derivatives involve costs and create economic leverage, which may result in significant volatility and cause the Fund to participate in losses (as well as gains) that significantly exceed the Fund's initial investment. Lower-rated or high yield debt securities involve greater credit risk, including the possibility of default or bankruptcy. Currency management strategies could result in losses to the Fund if currencies do not perform as the investment manager or sub-advisor expects. The Fund may make short sales of securities, which involves the risk that losses may exceed the original amount invested. Merger arbitrage investments risk loss if a proposed reorganization in which the fund invests is renegotiated or terminated. Liquidity risk exists when securities have become more difficult to sell, or are unable to be sold, at the price at which they have been valued. Please see the prospectus and summary prospectus for information on these as well as other risk considerations.
For more information on any of our funds, contact your financial advisor or download a free prospectus. Investors should carefully consider a fund's investment goals, risks, sales charges and expenses before investing. The prospectus contains this and other information.  Please read the prospectus carefully before investing or sending money.
Most Franklin Templeton funds offer multiple share classes. Share classes are subject to different fees and expenses, which will affect their performance. In general, Class A shares have a maximum initial sales charge; Class C shares have a 1% contingent deferred sales charge; Class Z, Advisor Class and Class R6 shares have no sales charges nor Rule 12b-1 fees; Class R shares have no sales charges, but do have a Rule 12b-1 fee.
Performance data represents past performance, which does not guarantee future results. Current performance may differ from figures shown. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate with market conditions, and you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.

Footnotes

A statistical measurement of a fund's historical risk-adjusted performance. It is calculated by taking a fund's excess return over that of the three-month Treasury bill divided by its standard deviation. Higher values generally indicate better historical risk-adjusted performance. Based on the 3 years ended as of the date of the calculation.
The annualized percentage difference between a fund's actual returns and its expected performance given its level of market risk, as measured by beta.  Based on the 3-year period ended as of the date of the calculation.
A measure of the fund's volatility relative to the market, as represented by the S&P 500 Index. A beta greater than 1.00 indicates volatility greater than the market. Based on the 3-year period ended as of the date of the calculation.
Percentage of the fund's returns explained by movements in the S&P 500 Index. 100 equals perfect correlation to the index. Based on the 3-year period ended as of the date of the calculation.
The Gross Expense Ratio does not include an expense reduction contractually guaranteed through 9/30/17.  Fund investment results reflect any expense reduction and fee waiver, as applicable.  Without these reductions, the results would have been lower. Please see the prospectus for additional information.
Public Offering Price — Purchase price for each share of the fund on a given day. It includes the maximum initial sales charge, if any.
Net Asset Value — The amount per share you would receive if you sold shares that day.
Source: Morningstar®. For each mutual fund and exchange traded fund with at least a 3-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating™ based on how a fund ranks on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure against other funds in the same category. This measure takes into account variations in a fund's monthly performance, and does not take into account the effects of sales charges, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The weights are: 100% 3-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% 5-year rating/40% 3-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% 5-year rating/20% 3-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent 3-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods. Morningstar Rating™ is for the named share class only; other classes may have different performance characteristics. Past performance is not an indicator or a guarantee of future performance.

The information contained herein: (1) is proprietary to Morningstar and/or its content providers; (2) may not be copied or distributed and (3) is not warranted to be accurate, complete or timely. Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information.
The investment manager has contractually agreed to waive or assume certain expenses so that the total annual fund operating expenses (excluding 12b-1 fees; acquired fund fees and expenses; expenses related to securities sold short; and certain non-routine expenses) for each class of the fund do not exceed (and could be less than) 1.95% until September 30, 2017. This rate differs from the fund's "Net Expense Ratio," which reflects the full costs associated with an investment in the fund minus the contractual waivers/reductions, and is the figure that is used to calculate a fund's total returns.
Reference Benchmark: S&P 500 Index. The S&P 500 Index is solely utilized as a reference benchmark to illustrate difference in behavior between U.S. equity markets and the fund. However, the S&P 500 Index is not fully reflective of the risk profile of the fund, which is not limited to investing solely for long U.S. equity market exposures.
Correlation is a statistical measure of how two investments move in relation to each other. Negative correlation indicates a relationship in which one increases as the other decreases. 1 = Positive Correlation; 0 = No Correlation; -1 = Perfect Negative Correlation.
A statistical measurement of the range of a fund's total returns. In general, a higher standard deviation means greater volatility. Based on the fund's monthly returns over the 3-year period ended as of the date of the calculation.
Indices are unmanaged and one cannot invest directly in them. Index returns do not reflect any fees, expenses or sales charges.
For performance reporting purposes, the inception date for Classes A, R, R6, Z, and Advisor Class shares of all Franklin Templeton Funds is the date of effectiveness of the fund's registration statement or the first day the fund commenced operations. For Class C shares, generally the inception date is the first day the fund commenced offering such shares. Exceptions: Templeton Global Balanced Fund Classes A and C use the inception date of the old Class A and C shares, renamed Class A1 and Class C1. For Franklin Mutual Series Funds, Franklin International Small Cap Growth Fund and Franklin Pelagos Commodities Strategy Fund, the inception date for Classes A, C, R and R6 shares is the funds' oldest class', Z or Advisor, inception date. Franklin U.S. Government Money Fund Class R6 inception date is the first day it commenced offering such shares. For Franklin California Ultra-Short Tax-Free Income Fund Classes A1 and Advisor Class use the inception date of its predecessor, Franklin California Tax-Exempt Money Fund.

SUB-ADVISER        


Aegon USA Investment Management, LLC (AUIM) is an SEC Registered Investment Adviser. AUIM is an experienced credit-focused institutional fixed income manager with global resources and the ability to leverage expertise across a geographically diverse organization. The firm manages assets across a fixed income spectrum including cash, investment grade, high yield, distressed corporate debt, structured finance debt, leveraged loans, emerging markets and quantitative strategies.













30-DAY SEC YIELD

The 30-Day SEC Yield is computed in accordance with a standardized method prescribed by rules of the SEC. The 30-day SEC Yield is computed by dividing the fund's investment income per share earned during a particular 30-day base period by the maximum offering price per share on the last day of the base period, and then annualizing the result. The 30-day SEC Yield is calculated at each month end and updated within the first ten business days of the following month. These yields reflect the reimbursements or waivers of certain expense. Had fees not been waived and/or expenses reimbursed, the yields would have been lower.            

12-MONTH DISTRIBUTION YIELD

The 12-Month distribution yield is calculated by taking the sum of all distributions occurring over the previous twelve calendar months and dividing the result by the Fund's Net Asset Value (NAV) as of the date of the previous month-end. The distribution yield represents a 12-month historical distribution and does not represent the total return of the Fund and is not necessarily an indication of future distributions or yield. For Funds that have been in operation for less than one year, an annualized distribution yield is calculated by annualizing the Fund's historical distributions to date and dividing the result by the Fund's Net Asset Value (NAV) as of the date of the previous month-end. The annualized distribution yield represents an estimated 12-month distribution from the Fund based on the limited distribution history of the Fund to date and does not represent the total return of the Fund and is not necessarily an indication of future distributions or yield. Past performance does not guarantee future results.            

FUND PERFORMANCE

*Expense ratios are as-of the most recent prospectus. Contractual arrangements have been made with the fund’s investment manager, Transamerica Asset Management, Inc. (“TAM”), through March 1, 2017.

**Reflects average annual returns. Returns for funds that are less than one year old are not annualized.
The performance data presented here represents past performance; Past performance is not indicative of future results. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted. The investment return and principal value will fluctuate so that an investor's shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than the original cost. Performance may not be available for all periods indicated. Net Asset Value (NAV) returns include reinvestment of dividends and capital gains, but do not reflect any sales charges. If a sales charge had been deducted, the results would have been lower. Public Offering Price (POP) returns include reinvestment of dividends and capital gains, and reflect the maximum sales charge.Maximum sales charge for Class A shares is 5.50%.Purchases of Class C Shares are subject to a 1.00% contingent deferred sales charge if redeemed during the first 12 months of purchase.
There are no sales charges on Class I shares. Class I shares are currently primarily offered for investment to institutional investors including, but not limited to, fee-based programs, pension plans, and certain endowment plans and foundations.

There are no sales charges for Class R6 shares. Class R shares are available only to eligible retirement plans.

Performance figures reflect any fee waivers and/or expense reimbursements by the Investment Manager. Without such waivers and/or reimbursements, the performance would be lower. Future waivers and/or reimbursements are at the discretion of the Investment Manager.

1 Year returns reflect total return.            

RISK MEASURES

Risk measures are in comparison to the Bank of America Merrill Lynch 3-Month Treasury Bill + 3% Wrap Index. Standard Deviation is a statistical measurement that helps to gauge the fund's historical volatility. Historical Beta illustrates a fund’s sensitivity to price movements in relation to a benchmark index. Alpha is a coefficient measuring the portion of a fund’s return arising from specific (non-market) risk. Tracking Error is the difference between the price behavior of a fund and the price behavior of a benchmark. R-Squared is a statistical measure that represents the percentage of a fund’s movements that can be explained by movements in a benchmark index. Sharpe Ratio is a risk-adjusted measure calculated by using standard deviation and excess return to determine reward per unit of risk. Information Ratio is a ratio of portfolio returns above those of a benchmark compared to the volatility of those returns.U.S. allocations may include U.S. territories and possessions.The Net Other Assets (Liabilities) category may include, but is not limited to, repurchase agreements, reverse repurchase agreements, security lending collateral, forward foreign currency contracts, and cash collateral. 

HOLDINGS

Each portfolio allocates its assets among Class I2 shares of various underlying funds of Transamerica Funds. Not all classes are available to investors.            



The BofA Merrill Lynch 3-Month Treasury Bill +3% Wrap and HFRX Global Hedge Fund Index are unmanaged indexes used as general measure of market performance.

The HFRX Global Hedge Fund Index is a passively-managed index that is compiled by Hedge Fund Research, Inc. It is designed to measure the daily performance of the overall composition of the hedge fund universe. It is comprised of all eligible hedge fund strategies; including but not limited to convertible arbitrage, distressed securities, equity hedge, equity market neutral, event driven, macro, merger arbitrage, and relative value arbitrage. The strategies are asset weighted based on the distribution of assets in the hedge fund industry. Returns presented are net of underlying manager fees, but do not reflect the deduction of management fees, taxes and other expenses. Calculations assume dividends and capital gains are reinvested and do not include any managerial expenses. It is not possible to invest directly into an index.

Alternative strategies may not be suitable for all investors. Many alternative strategies tend to use sophisticated and aggressive investment techniques. Certain alternative strategies may be tied to hard assets such as commodities, currencies and real estate and may be subject to greater volatility as they may be affected by overall market movements, changes in interest rates or factors affecting a particular industry, commodity or currency, and international economic, political, and regulatory developments.

Diversification does not guarantee a profit or protect against a loss.

The fund intends to utilize individual strategies and hedging techniques in matched combinations that may have lower correlation to broader equity and fixed income markets. Some of these strategies include long/short equity and tactical investment strategies (debt and/or equity); global real estate securities; commodities; managed futures, global macro and non-traditional investments (such as emerging market stocks). There is no assurance that these strategies will protect against losses. Certain hedging techniques and leverage employed in the management of the fund may accelerate the velocity of possible losses.Shares may be sold (or “redeemed”) on any day the New York Stock Exchange is open for business. Proceeds from the redemption of shares will usually be sent to the redeeming shareholder within three business days after receipt in good order of a request for redemption. However, Transamerica Funds has the right to take up to seven days to pay redemption proceeds, and may postpone payment under certain circumstances, as authorized by law.
Due to rounding, not all of the percentages will equal 100%.Mutual funds are subject to market risk, including the loss of principal. Past performance is not indicative of future results.Shares of the funds may only be sold by offering the funds’ prospectus. You should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses of the funds carefully before investing. The prospectus contains this and additional important information regarding the fund. To obtain the prospectus and/or summary prospectus, please contact your financial professional or click here. The prospectus should be read carefully before investing.
Transamerica Funds are advised by Transamerica Asset Management, Inc. and distributed by Transamerica Capital, Inc.

Not insured by FDIC or any federal government agency. May lose value. Not a deposit of or guaranteed by any bank, bank affiliate, or credit union.

Performance Metrics





Main Risks

					Commodities Risk: Exposure to the commodities markets may subject the fund to greater volatility than investments in traditional securities. The values of commodities and commodity-linked investments are affected by events that might have less impact on the values of stocks and bonds. Investments linked to the prices of commodities are considered speculative. Prices of commodities and related contracts may fluctuate significantly over short periods for a variety of factors.Derivatives Risk: A small investment in derivatives could have a potentially large impact on the fund's performance. The use of derivatives involves risks different from, or possibly greater than, the risks associated with investing directly in the underlying assets. Derivatives can be highly volatile, illiquid and difficult to value.Equity Risk: Equity funds are subject generally to market, market sector, market liquidity, issuer and investment style risks, among other factors, to varying degrees, all of which are more fully described in the fund's prospectus.Foreign Currency Risk: Investments in foreign currencies are subject to the risk that those currencies will decline in value relative to the U.S. dollar, or, in the case of hedged positions, that the U.S. dollar will decline relative to the currency being hedged.Foreign Investment Risk: To the extent the fund invests in foreign securities, its performance will be influenced by political, social and economic factors affecting investments in foreign companies. These special risks include exposure to currency fluctuations, less liquidity, less developed or less efficient trading markets, lack of comprehensive company information, political instability, and differing auditing and legal standards.Leverage Risk: Additionally, some derivatives involve economic leverage, which could increase the volatility of these investments as they may fluctuate in value more than the underlying instrument. Certain derivatives have the potential for unlimited loss, regardless of the size of the initial investment.Real Estate Sector Risk: Because the fund's investments are concentrated in the securities of companies principally engaged in the real estate sector, the value of the fund's shares will be affected by factors particular to the real estate sector and may fluctuate more widely than that of a fund which invests in a broader range of industries. The securities of issuers that are principally engaged in the real estate sector may be subject to risks similar to those associated with the direct ownership of real estate. These include declines in real estate values and defaults by mortgagors or other borrowers.Short Sales Risk: May involve substantial risk and 'leverage.' Short sales expose the fund to the risk that it will be required to buy the security sold short at a time when the security has appreciated in value, thus resulting in a loss.

Important Information

 

Carefully consider the Funds' investment objectives, risk factors, and charges and expenses before investing. This and other information can be found in the Funds' prospectuses or, if available, the summary prospectuses which may be obtained by visiting the iShares Fund and BlackRock Fund prospectus pages. Read the prospectus carefully before investing.


The fund is actively managed and its characteristics will vary. Stock and bond values fluctuate in price so the value of your investment can go down depending on market conditions. International investing involves special risks including, but not limited to political risks, currency fluctuations, illiquidity and volatility. These risks may be heightened for investments in emerging markets. Fixed income risks include interest-rate and credit risk. Typically, when interest rates rise, there is a corresponding decline in bond values. Credit risk refers to the possibility that the bond issuer will not be able to make principal and interest payments. Principal of mortgage- or asset-backed securities normally may be prepaid at any time, reducing the yield and market value of those securities. Obligations of US govt. agencies are supported by varying degrees of credit but generally are not backed by the full faith and credit of the US govt. Non-investment-grade debt securities (high-yield/junk bonds) may be subject to greater market fluctuations, risk of default or loss of income and principal than higher rated securities. Investments in emerging markets may be considered speculative and are more likely to experience hyperinflation and currency devaluations, which adversely affect returns. In addition, many emerging securities markets have lower trading volumes and less liquidity. The fund may use derivatives to hedge its investments or to seek to enhance returns. Derivatives entail risks relating to liquidity, leverage and credit that may reduce returns and increase volatility.  Morningstar Analyst Rating™is not a credit or risk rating. It is a subjective evaluation performed by Morningstar’s manager research group, which consists of various Morningstar, Inc. subsidiaries (“Manager Research Group”). In the United States, that subsidiary is Morningstar Research Services LLC, which is registered with and governed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The Manager Research Group evaluates funds based on five key pillars, which are process, performance, people, parent, and price. The Manager Research Group uses this five pillar evaluation to determine how they believe funds are likely to perform relative to a benchmark, or in the case of exchange-traded funds and index mutual funds, a relevant peer group, over the long term on a risk-adjusted basis. They consider quantitative and qualitative factors in their research, and the weight of each pillar may vary. The Analyst Rating scale is Gold, Silver, Bronze, Neutral, and Negative. A Morningstar Analyst Rating of Gold, Silver, or Bronze reflects the Manager Research Group’s conviction in a fund’s prospects for outperformance. Analyst Ratings ultimately reflect the Manager Research Group’s overall assessment, are overseen by an Analyst Rating Committee, and are continuously monitored and reevaluated at least every 14 months. For more detailed information about Morningstar’s Analyst Rating, including its methodology, please go to global.morningstar.com/managerdisclosures/. The Morningstar Analyst Rating (i) should not be used as the sole basis in evaluating a fund, (ii) involves unknown risks and uncertainties which may cause Analyst expectations not to occur or to differ significantly from what they expected, and (iii) should not be considered an offer or solicitation to buy or sell the fund.


Performance results reflect past performance and are no guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value of shares will fluctuate so that shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. All returns assume reinvestment of all dividends. Performance information shown without sales charge would have been lower if the applicable sales charge had been included. Performance during periods of exceptional market conditions should not be expected to be repeated in a normal market environment. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted. Investing involves risk, including possible loss of principal.Fund details, holdings and characteristics are as of the date noted and subject to change. Yields are based on income earned for the period cited and on the Fund's NAV at the end of the period. Some BlackRock funds make distributions of ordinary income and capital gains at calendar year end. Those distributions temporarily cause extraordinarily high yields. There is no assurance that a fund will repeat that yield in the future. Subsequent monthly distributions that do not include ordinary income or capital gains in the form of dividends will likely be lower.

Morningstar details

Source: Morningstar Inc. Ratings are based on a risk-adjusted return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. Open-end mutual funds and exchange-traded funds are considered a single population for comparison purposes. Ratings are calculated for funds with at least a three year history. The overall rating is derived from a weighted average of three-, five- and 10-year rating metrics, as applicable, excluding sales charges and including fees and expenses. ©2017 Morningstar Inc. All rights reserved. The information contained herein is proprietary to Morningstar and/or its content providers. It may not be copied or distributed and is not warranted to be accurate, complete or timely. Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The top 10% of funds in a category receive five stars, the next 22.5% four stars, the next 35% three stars, the next 22.5% two stars and the bottom 10% one star. Ratings are subject to change monthly. Had fees not been waived and/or expenses reimbursed currently or in the past, the Morningstar rating would have been lower. Ratings for other share classes may differ due to different performance characteristics.

 About risk
			 


Fund of Funds Risk. The Fund’s performance depends on that of the
underlying funds in which it invests. Accordingly, the risks associated with
an investment in the Fund include the risks associated with investments in
the underlying funds. The Fund will indirectly pay a proportional share of the
fees and expenses of the underlying funds in which it invests. There are
risks that the Fund will vary from its target weightings (if any) in the
underlying funds, that the underlying funds will not achieve their investment
objectives, that the underlying funds’ performance may be lower than their
represented asset classes, and that the Fund may withdraw its investments
in an underlying fund at a disadvantageous time.

Allocation Risk. The Fund’s investment performance depends, in part,
on how its assets are allocated among the underlying funds or asset
classes. The Adviser’s evaluations and assumptions regarding the asset
classes or the underlying funds in which the Fund invests may be incorrect,
causing the Fund to be invested (or not invested) in one or more asset
classes or underlying funds at an inopportune time, which could negatively
affect the Fund’s performance.

Exchange-Traded Funds Risk. In addition to the risks associated with
the underlying assets held by the exchange-traded fund, investments in
exchange-traded funds are subject to the following additional risks: (1) an
exchange-traded fund’s shares may trade above or below its net asset
value; (2) an active trading market for the exchange-traded fund’s shares
may not develop or be maintained; (3) trading an exchange-traded fund’s
shares may be halted by the listing exchange; (4) a passively-managed
exchange-traded fund may not track the performance of the reference
asset; and (5) a passively managed exchange-traded fund may hold
troubled securities. Investment in exchange-traded funds may involve
duplication of management fees and certain other expenses, as the Fund or
an underlying fund indirectly bears its proportionate share of any expenses
paid by the exchange-traded funds in which it invests. Further, certain
exchange-traded funds in which the Fund or an underlying fund may invest
are leveraged, which may result in economic leverage, permitting the Fund or an underlying fund to gain exposure that is greater than would be the
case in an unlevered instrument, and potentially resulting in greater
volatility.

The principal risks of investing in the Fund also include the risks of each
underlying fund. These risks include the following:

Active Trading Risk. Active trading of portfolio securities may result in
added expenses, a lower return and increased tax liability.

Bank Loan Risk. There are a number of risks associated with an
investment in bank loans including, credit risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk
and prepayment Risk. Lack of an active trading market, restrictions on
resale, irregular trading activity, wide bid/ask spreads and extended trade
settlement periods may impair an underlying fund’s ability to sell bank loans
within its desired time frame or at an acceptable price and its ability to
accurately value existing and prospective investments. Extended trade
settlement periods may result in cash not being immediately available to an
underlying fund. As a result an underlying fund may have to sell other
investments or engage in borrowing transactions to raise cash to meet its
obligations. The risk of holding bank loans is also directly tied to the risk of
insolvency or bankruptcy of the issuing banks. These risks could cause an
underlying fund to lose income or principal on a particular investment, which
in turn could affect the underlying fund’s returns. The value of bank loans
can be affected by and sensitive to changes in government regulation and
to economic downturns in the United States and abroad. Bank loans
generally are floating rate loans, which are subject to interest rate risk as
the interest paid on the floating rate loans adjusts periodically based on
changes in widely accepted reference rates.

Borrowing Risk. Borrowing money to buy securities exposes an
underlying fund to leverage and will cause an underlying fund’s share price
to be more volatile because leverage will exaggerate the effect of any
increase or decrease in the value of an underlying fund’s portfolio securities. Borrowing money may also require an underlying fund to liquidate positions
when it may not be advantageous to do so. In addition, an underlying fund
will incur interest expenses and other fees on borrowed money. There can
be no assurance that an underlying fund’s borrowing strategy will enhance
and not reduce the underlying fund’s returns.

Cash/Cash Equivalents Risk. In rising markets, holding cash or cash
equivalents will negatively affect an underlying fund’s performance relative
to its benchmark.

Changing Fixed Income Market Conditions Risk. The current low interest
rate environment was created in part by the Federal Reserve Board (FRB)
and certain foreign central banks keeping the federal funds and equivalent
foreign rates at or near zero. Increases in the federal funds and equivalent
foreign rates may expose fixed income markets to heightened volatility and
reduced liquidity for certain fixed income investments, particularly those with
longer maturities. In addition, decreases in fixed income dealer
market-making capacity may also potentially lead to heightened volatility
and reduced liquidity in the fixed income markets. As a result, the value of
an underlying fund’s investments and share price may decline. Changes in
central bank policies could also result in higher than normal shareholder
redemptions, which could potentially increase portfolio turnover and an
underlying fund’s transaction costs.

Collateralized Loan Obligations Risk. CLOs are subject to the risks of
substantial losses due to actual defaults by underlying borrowers, which will
be greater during periods of economic or financial stress. CLOs may also
lose value due to collateral defaults and disappearance of subordinate
tranches, market anticipation of defaults, and investor aversion to CLO
securities as a class. The risks of CLOs will be greater if an underlying fund
invests in CLOs that hold loans of uncreditworthy borrowers or if an
underlying fund holds subordinate tranches of the CLO that absorbs losses
from the defaults before senior tranches. In addition, CLOs are subject to
interest rate risk and credit Risk.

Commodities Tax Risk. The tax treatment of commodity-linked derivative
instruments may be adversely affected by changes in legislation, regulations
or other legally binding authority. If, as a result of any such adverse action, the income of an underlying fund from certain commodity-linked derivatives
was treated as non-qualifying income, an underlying fund might fail to
qualify as a regulated investment company and be subject to federal income
tax at the fund level. Should the Internal Revenue Service issue guidance, or
Congress enact legislation, that adversely affects the tax treatment of an
underlying fund’s use of commodity-linked notes or a wholly-owned
subsidiary (which guidance might be applied to the underlying fund
retroactively), it could, among other consequences, limit the underlying
fund’s ability to pursue its investment strategy.

Commodity Risk. An underlying fund will concentrate its investments in
commodities markets and will therefore have investment exposure to the
commodities markets and one or more sectors of the commodities markets,
which may subject an underlying fund to greater volatility than investments
in traditional securities, such as stocks and bonds. Volatility in the
commodities markets may be caused by changes in overall market
movements, domestic and foreign political and economic events and
policies, war, acts of terrorism, changes in domestic or foreign interest rates
and/or investor expectations concerning interest rates, domestic and foreign
inflation rates, investment and trading activities of mutual funds, hedge
funds and commodities funds, and factors such as drought, floods, weather,
livestock disease, embargoes, tariffs and other regulatory developments, or
supply and demand disruptions. Because an underlying fund’s performance
is linked to the performance of volatile commodities, investors should be
willing to assume the risks of potentially significant fluctuations in the value
of an underlying fund’s shares.

Commodity-Linked Notes Risk. In addition to risks associated with the
underlying commodities, investments in commodity-linked notes may be
subject to additional risks, such as non-payment of interest and loss of
principal, counterparty risk, lack of a secondary market and risk of greater
volatility than traditional equity and debt securities. The value of the
commodity-linked notes an underlying fund buys may fluctuate significantly
because the values of the underlying investments to which they are linked
are themselves volatile. Additionally, certain commodity-linked notes employ
“economic” leverage by requiring payment by the issuer of an amount that
is a multiple of the price increase or decrease of the underlying commodity,
commodity index, or other economic variable. Such economic leverage will
increase the volatility of the value of these commodity-linked notes and an
underlying fund to the extent it invests in such notes.

Convertible Securities Risk. The market values of convertible securities
are affected by market interest rates, the risk of actual issuer default on
interest or principal payments and the value of the underlying common
stock into which the convertible security may be converted. Additionally, a
convertible security is subject to the same types of market and issuer risks
as apply to the underlying common stock. In addition, certain convertible
securities are subject to involuntary conversions and may undergo principal
write-downs upon the occurrence of certain triggering events, and, as a
result, are subject to an increased risk of loss.

Correlation Risk. Because an underlying fund’s investment strategy
seeks to balance risk across the four sectors of the commodities market
and, within each commodity sector, to balance risk across different
commodities, to the extent either the sectors of the commodities markets or
the selected commodities become correlated in a way not anticipated by an
underlying fund’s adviser an underlying fund’s risk allocation process may
result in magnified risks and loss instead of balancing (reducing) the risk of
loss.

Credit Linked Notes Risk. Risks of credit linked notes include those risks
associated with the underlying reference obligation including but not limited
to market risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, default risk and, in some cases,
foreign currency Risk. An investor in a credit linked note bears counterparty
risk or the risk that the issuer of the credit linked note will default or become
bankrupt and not make timely payment of principal and interest of the
structured security. Credit linked notes may be less liquid than other
investments and therefore harder to dispose of at the desired time and
price. In addition, credit linked notes may be leveraged and, as a result, small changes in the value of the underlying reference obligation may
produce disproportionate losses to an underlying fund.

Debt Securities Risk. The prices of debt securities held by an underlying
fund will be affected by changes in interest rates, the creditworthiness of
the issuer and other factors. An increase in prevailing interest rates typically
causes the value of existing debt securities to fall and often has a greater
impact on longer-duration debt securities and higher quality debt securities. Falling interest rates will cause an underlying fund to reinvest the proceeds
of debt securities that have been repaid by the issuer at lower interest rates. Falling interest rates may also reduce an underlying fund’s distributable
income because interest payments on floating rate debt instruments held by
an underlying fund will decline. An underlying fund could lose money on
investments in debt securities if the issuer or borrower fails to meet its
obligations to make interest payments and/or to repay principal in a timely
manner. Changes in an issuer’s financial strength, the market’s perception
of such strength or in the credit rating of the issuer or the security may
affect the value of debt securities. The Adviser’s credit analysis may fail to
anticipate such changes, which could result in buying a debt security at an
inopportune time or failing to sell a debt security in advance of a price
decline or other credit event.

Defaulted Securities Risk. Defaulted securities pose a greater risk that
principal will not be repaid than non-defaulted securities. Defaulted
securities and any securities received in an exchange for such securities
may be subject to restrictions on resale.

Derivatives Risk. The value of a derivative instrument depends largely on
(and is derived from) the value of an underlying security, currency,
commodity, interest rate, index or other asset (each referred to as an
underlying asset). In addition to risks relating to the underlying assets, the
use of derivatives may include other, possibly greater, risks, including
counterparty, leverage and liquidity risks. Counterparty risk is the risk that
the counterparty to the derivative contract will default on its obligation to pay
the underlying fund the amount owed or otherwise perform under the
derivative contract. Derivatives create leverage risk because they do not
require payment up front equal to the economic exposure created by owning
the derivative. As a result, an adverse change in the value of the underlying
asset could result in the underlying fund sustaining a loss that is
substantially greater than the amount invested in the derivative, which may
make the underlying fund’s returns more volatile and increase the risk of
loss. Derivative instruments may also be less liquid than more traditional
investments and the underlying fund may be unable to sell or close out its
derivative positions at a desirable time or price. This risk may be more acute
under adverse market conditions, during which the underlying fund may be
most in need of liquidating its derivative positions. Derivatives may also be
harder to value, less tax efficient and subject to changing government
regulation that could impact the underlying fund’s ability to use certain
derivatives or their cost. Also, derivatives used for hedging or to gain or limit
exposure to a particular market segment may not provide the expected
benefits, particularly during adverse market conditions. These risks are
greater for certain underlying funds than most other mutual funds because
certain underlying funds will implement their investment strategy primarily
through derivative instruments rather than direct investments in
stocks/bonds.

Emerging Markets Securities Risk. Emerging markets (also referred to
as developing markets) are generally subject to greater market volatility,
political, social and economic instability, uncertain trading markets and more
governmental limitations on foreign investment than more developed
markets. In addition, companies operating in emerging markets may be
subject to lower trading volume and greater price fluctuations than
companies in more developed markets. Securities law and the enforcement
of systems of taxation in many emerging market countries may change
quickly and unpredictably. In addition, investments in emerging markets
securities may also be subject to additional transaction costs, delays in
settlement procedures, and lack of timely information.

Exchange-Traded Fund Industry Concentration Risk. In following its
methodology, an underlying exchange-traded fund’s underlying index from
time to time may be concentrated to a significant degree in securities of
issuers located in a single industry or sector. To the extent that an
underlying fund’s underlying index concentrates in the securities of issuers
in a particular industry or sector, an underlying fund will also concentrate its
investments to approximately the same extent. By concentrating its
investments in an industry or sector, an underlying fund faces more risks
than if it were diversified broadly over numerous industries or sectors. Such
industry-based risks, any of which may adversely affect the companies in
which an underlying fund invests, may include, but are not limited to, the
following: general economic conditions or cyclical market patterns that could
negatively affect supply and demand in a particular industry; competition for
resources, adverse labor relations, political or world events; obsolescence of
technologies; and increased competition or new product introductions that
may affect the profitability or viability of companies in an industry. In
addition, at times, such industry or sector may be out of favor and
underperform other industries or the market as a whole.

Exchange-Traded Notes Risk. Exchange-traded notes are subject to
credit risk, counterparty risk, and the risk that the value of the
exchange-traded note may drop due to a downgrade in the issuer’s credit
rating. The value of an exchange-traded note may also be influenced by
time to maturity, level of supply and demand for the exchange-traded note,
volatility and lack of liquidity in the underlying market, changes in the
applicable interest rates, and economic, legal, political, or geographic events
that affect the referenced underlying market or assets. An underlying fund
will bear its proportionate share of any fees and expenses borne by an
exchange-traded note in which it invests. For certain exchange-traded
notes, there may be restrictions on an underlying fund’s right to redeem its
investment in an exchange-traded note, which is meant to be held until
maturity.

Financial Services Sector Risk. An underlying fund may be susceptible
to adverse economic or regulatory occurrences affecting the financial
services sector. Financial services companies are subject to extensive
government regulation and are disproportionately affected by unstable
interest rates, each of which could adversely affect the profitability of such
companies. Financial services companies may also have concentrated
portfolios, which makes them especially vulnerable to unstable economic
conditions.

Foreign Government Debt Risk. Investments in foreign government debt
securities (sometimes referred to as sovereign debt securities) involve
certain risks in addition to those relating to foreign securities or debt
securities generally. The issuer of the debt or the governmental authorities
that control the repayment of the debt may be unable or unwilling to repay
principal or interest when due in accordance with the terms of such debt,
and the Fund may have limited recourse in the event of a default against the
defaulting government. Without the approval of debt holders, some
governmental debtors have in the past been able to reschedule or
restructure their debt payments or declare moratoria on payments.

Foreign Securities Risk. An underlying fund’s foreign investments may
be adversely affected by political and social instability, changes in economic
or taxation policies, difficulty in enforcing obligations, decreased liquidity or
increased volatility. Foreign investments also involve the risk of the possible
seizure, nationalization or expropriation of the issuer or foreign deposits (in
which an underlying fund could lose its entire investments in a certain
market) and the possible adoption of foreign governmental restrictions such
as exchange controls. Unless an underlying fund has hedged its foreign
securities risk, foreign securities risk also involves the risk of negative
foreign currency rate fluctuations, which may cause the value of securities
denominated in such foreign currency (or other instruments through which
an underlying fund has exposure to foreign currencies) to decline in value. Currency exchange rates may fluctuate significantly over short periods of
time. Currency hedging strategies, if used, are not always successful. 


Geographic Focus Risk. An underlying fund may from time to time
invest a substantial amount of its assets in securities of issuers located in a
single country or a limited number of countries. Adverse economic, political
or social conditions in those countries may therefore have a significant
negative impact on an underlying fund’s investment performance.

High Yield Debt Securities (Junk Bond) Risk. Investments in high yield
debt securities (“junk bonds”) and other lower-rated securities will subject
an underlying fund to substantial risk of loss. These securities are
considered to be speculative with respect to the issuer’s ability to pay
interest and principal when due, are more susceptible to default or decline
in market value and are less liquid than investment grade debt securities. Prices of high yield debt securities tend to be very volatile.

Indexing Risk. An underlying fund is operated as a passively managed
index fund and, therefore, the adverse performance of a particular security
necessarily will not result in the elimination of the security from the
underlying fund’s portfolio. Ordinarily, the underlying fund’s adviser will not
sell the underlying fund’s portfolio securities except to reflect additions or
deletions of the securities that comprise the underlying fund’s underlying
index, or as may be necessary to raise cash to pay underlying fund
shareholders who sell underlying fund shares. As such, the underlying fund
will be negatively affected by declines in the securities represented by its
underlying index. Also, there is no guarantee that the underlying fund’s
adviser will be able to correlate the underlying fund’s performance with that
of its underlying index.

Infrastructure-Related Companies Risk. An underlying fund will
concentrate its investments in the infrastructure industry. Infrastructure-related companies are subject to a variety of risk factors,
including costs associated with environmental, governmental and other
regulations, high interest costs for capital construction programs, high
leverage, the effects of economic slowdowns, surplus capacity, increased
competition, fluctuations of fuel prices, the effects of energy conservation
policies, unfavorable tax laws or accounting policies, environmental damage,
difficulty in raising capital, increased susceptibility to terrorist acts or
political actions, and general changes in market sentiment towards
infrastructure assets.

Liquidity Risk. An underlying fund may be unable to sell illiquid
investments at the time or price it desires and, as a result, could lose its
entire investment in such investments. Liquid securities can become illiquid
during periods of market stress. If a significant amount of the an underlying
fund’s securities become illiquid, an underlying fund may not be able to
timely pay redemption proceeds and may need to sell securities at
significantly reduced prices.

Management Risk. There is no guarantee that the underlying funds’
portfolio manager’s investment selection process will produce a portfolio
effective at achieving the underlying fund’s respective investment objective. In addition, certain underlying funds’ investment strategies will likely cause
the underlying fund to underperform the broader equity markets in which
the underlying fund invests during market rallies. Further, the portfolio
managers’ use of instruments that provide economic leverage increases the
volatility of an underlying fund’s net asset value, which increases the
potential of greater losses that may cause an underlying fund to liquidate
positions when it may not be advantageous to do so.

Market Risk. The market values of an underlying fund’s investments,
and therefore the value of an underlying fund’s shares, will go up and down,
sometimes rapidly or unpredictably. Market risk may affect a single issuer,
industry or section of the economy, or it may affect the market as a whole. Individual stock prices tend to go up and down more dramatically than those
of certain other types of investments, such as bonds. During a general
downturn in the financial markets, multiple asset classes may decline in
value. When markets perform well, there can be no assurance that specific
investments held by an underlying fund will rise in value.

Market Trading Risk. An underlying exchange-traded fund faces
numerous market trading risks, including the potential lack of an active
market for its shares, losses from trading in secondary markets, and disruption in the creation/redemption process of an underlying fund. Any of
these factors may lead to an underlying fund’s shares trading at a premium
or discount to an underlying fund’s net asset value (NAV).

MLP Risk. An underlying fund invests in securities of MLPs, which are
subject to the following risks:
Limited Partner Risk. An MLP is a public limited partnership or limited
liability company taxed as a partnership under the Code. Although the
characteristics of MLPs closely resemble a traditional limited partnership, a
major difference is that MLPs may trade on a public exchange or in the
over-the-counter market. The risks of investing in an MLP are similar to
those of investing in a partnership, including more flexible governance
structures, which could result in less protection for investors than
investments in a corporation. Investors in an MLP normally would not be
liable for the debts of the MLP beyond the amount that the investor has
contributed but investors may not be shielded to the same extent that a
shareholder of a corporation would be. In certain circumstances, creditors of
an MLP would have the right to seek return of capital distributed to a limited
partner, which right would continue after an investor sold its investment in
the MLP.
Liquidity Risk. The ability to trade on a public exchange or in the
over-the-counter market provides a certain amount of liquidity not found in
many limited partnership investments. However, MLP interests may be less
liquid than conventional publicly traded securities and, therefore, more
difficult to trade at desirable times and/or prices.
Interest Rate Risk. In addition, MLP distributions may be reduced by
fees and other expenses incurred by the MLP. MLPs generally are
considered interest-rate sensitive investments. During periods of interest
rate volatility, these investments may not provide attractive returns.
General Partner Risk. The holder of the general partner or managing
member interest can be liable in certain circumstances for amounts greater
than the amount of the holder’s investment in the general partner or
managing member.

Additionally, if an underlying fund were to invest more than 25% of its
total assets in MLPs that are taxed as partnerships this could cause an
underlying fund to lose its status as regulated investment company under
Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code.

MLP Tax Risk. MLPs taxed as partnerships do not pay U.S. federal
income tax at the partnership level. A change in current tax law, or a change
in the underlying business mix of a given MLP, however, could result in an
MLP being classified as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes,
which would have the effect of reducing the amount of cash available for
distribution by the MLP and could cause a reduction of the value of an
underlying fund’s investment, and consequently the Fund’s investment in an
underlying fund and lower income.

Mortgage- and Asset-Backed Securities Risk. Mortgage- and
asset-backed securities are subject to prepayment or call risk, which is the
risk that a borrower’s payments may be received earlier or later than
expected due to changes in prepayment rates on underlying loans. This
could result in an underlying fund reinvesting these early payments at lower
interest rates, thereby reducing an underlying fund ’s income. Mortgageand
asset-backed securities also are subject to extension risk, which is the
risk that an unexpected rise in interest rates could reduce the rate of
prepayments, causing the price of the mortgage- and asset-backed
securities and an underlying fund’s share price to fall. An unexpectedly high
rate of defaults on the mortgages held by a mortgage pool will adversely
affect the value of mortgage-backed securities and will result in losses to an
underlying fund. An underlying fund may invest in mortgage pools that
include subprime mortgages, which are loans made to borrowers with
weakened credit histories or with lower capacity to make timely payments
on their mortgages. Privately issued mortgage-related securities are not
subject to the same underwriting requirements as those with government or
government-sponsored entity guarantees and, therefore, mortgage loans
underlying privately issued mortgage-related securities may have less
favorable collateral, credit risk or other underwriting characteristics, and wider variances in interest rate, term, size, purpose and borrower
characteristics.

Non-Diversification Risk. An underlying fund is non-diversified and can
invest a greater portion of its assets in the obligations or securities of a
small number of issuers or any single issuer than a diversified fund can. A
change in the value of one or a few issuers’ securities will therefore affect
the value of an underlying fund more than would occur in a diversified fund.

Preferred Securities Risk. Preferred securities are subject to
issuer-specific and market risks applicable generally to equity securities. Preferred securities also may be subordinated to bonds or other debt
instruments, subjecting them to a greater risk of non-payment, may be less
liquid than many other securities, such as common stocks, and generally
offer no voting rights with respect to the issuer.

REIT Risk/Real Estate Risk. An underlying fund concentrates its
investments in the securities of real estate and real estate related
companies. Investments in real estate related instruments may be affected
by economic, legal, cultural, environmental or technological factors that
affect property values, rents or occupancies of real estate related to an
underlying fund’s holdings. Shares of real estate related companies, which
tend to be small- and mid-cap companies, may be more volatile and less
liquid than larger companies. The value of investments in real estate related
companies may be affected by the quality of management, the ability to
repay loans, the utilization of leverage and financial covenants related
thereto, whether the company carries adequate insurance and
environmental factors. If a real estate related company defaults on certain
types of debt obligations, an underlying fund may own real estate directly,
which involves additional risks such as environmental liabilities; difficulty in
valuing and selling the real estate; and economic or regulatory changes.

Sampling Risk. An underlying fund’s use of a representative sampling
approach will result in its holding a smaller number of securities than are in
its underlying index and in the underlying fund holding securities not
included in its underlying index. As a result, an adverse development
respecting an issuer of securities held by the underlying fund could result in
a greater decline in the underlying fund’s NAV than would be the case if all
of the securities in its underlying index were held. An underlying fund’s use
of a representative sampling approach may also include the risk that it may
not track the return of its underlying index as well as it would have if the
underlying fund held all of the securities in its underlying index.

Sector Focus Risk. An underlying fund may from time to time invest a
significant amount of its assets (i.e. over 25%) in one market sector or
group of related industries. In this event, an underlying fund’s performance
will depend to a greater extent on the overall condition of the sector or
group of industries and there is increased risk that an underlying fund will
lose significant value if conditions adversely affect that sector or group of
industries.

Short Position Risk. Because an underlying fund’s potential loss on a
short position arises from increases in the value of the asset sold short, the
underlying fund will incur a loss on a short position, which is theoretically
unlimited, if the price of the asset sold short increases from the short sale
price. The counterparty to a short position or other market factors may
prevent an underlying fund from closing out a short position at a desirable
time or price and may reduce or eliminate any gain or result in a loss. In a
rising market, an underlying fund’s short positions will cause the underlying
fund to underperform the overall market and its peers that do not engage in
shorting. If an underlying fund holds both long and short positions, and both
positions decline simultaneously, the short positions will not provide any
buffer (hedge) from declines in value of the underlying fund’s long positions. Certain types of short positions involve leverage, which may exaggerate any
losses, potentially more than the actual cost of the investment, and will
increase the volatility of an underlying fund’s returns.

Small- and Mid-Capitalization Companies Risks. Small- and
mid-capitalization companies tend to be more vulnerable to changing
market conditions, may have little or no operating history or track record of
success, and may have more limited product lines and markets, less experienced management and fewer financial resources than larger
companies. These companies’ securities may be more volatile and less
liquid than those of more established companies, and their returns may
vary, sometimes significantly, from the overall securities market.

Subsidiary Risk. By investing in the Subsidiary, an underlying fund is
indirectly exposed to risks associated with the Subsidiary’s investments. The
Subsidiary is not registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as
amended (1940 Act), and, except as otherwise noted in this prospectus, is
not subject to the investor protections of the 1940 Act. Changes in the laws
of the United States and/or the Cayman Islands, under which an underlying
fund and the Subsidiary, respectively, are organized, could result in the
inability of an underlying fund and/or the Subsidiary to operate as described
in this prospectus and the SAI, and could negatively affect an underlying
fund and its shareholders.

U.S. Government Obligations Risk. Obligations of U.S. Government
agencies and authorities receive varying levels of support and may not be
backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government, which could
affect an underlying fund’s ability to recover should they default. No
assurance can be given that the U.S. Government will provide financial
support to its agencies and authorities if it is not obligated by law to do so.

Volatility Risk. Although an underlying fund’s investment strategy targets
a specific volatility level, certain of an underlying fund’s investments may
appreciate or decrease significantly in value over short periods of time. This
may cause an underlying fund’s net asset value per share to experience
significant increases or declines in value over short periods of time.

 One Man's 9-Minute Secret to Retiring Rich  by Investing Daily Staff - May 1, 2017     Years ago Jim Fink knew he’d need to make a change if he was ever going to retire.
It's a similar problem a lot of Americans are dealing with as they approach retirement.
He had a good job, was squirreling away money in his IRA, and investing in stocks—but wasn’t really getting anywhere.
The piddly returns he was making that way seemed like a waste of time. He needed something better.
Luckily Jim worked at an office building in Chicago, close to the financial district.
One day he ran into a "trader" who shared an approach that would go on to change Jim's life forever.
So Jim started experimenting with the approach he learned...
Before long he was generating extra monthly income like $1,200, $1,800, and $2,100... and all in a matter of weeks!
His nest egg began to grow exponentially, and before long he had turned a mere $50,000 into a massive $5.3 million.
Now, years later, Jim trades full-time—and lets independent-minded investors follow the exact approach he's now perfected.
It’s an easy, step-by-step process that takes just 9 minutes to per week.
Best of all, unlike many risky approaches to making money, there's a built-in safety net unique to his strategy that can make it safer than traditional investing.
In fact, safety-loving Warren Buffett pulled in $4.7 billion following this exact approach not too long ago.
The full story behind how Jim makes his trades is right here.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
