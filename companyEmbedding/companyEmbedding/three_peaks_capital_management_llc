Investment OpportunitiesOVERVIEW
The Three Peaks Capital Management platform is designed to leverage our expertise in high yield fixed income securities in order to provide clients with investment choices based on their desired risk profiles. The mandates we manage work off our fundamental belief in, understanding of, and passion for the high yield asset category.
The high yield discipline managed by Three Peaks Capital has been consistent over the past ten years. The consistency has been a result of the seasoned portfolio management and the continuity of both the analytical and trading elements of the team. Although we are always searching for ways to sharpen and refine our process, we believe that we have created a model that works quite well. Our goal continues to be to build a portfolio of high-yield credits that are well researched, de-leveraging, and cash-flowing, own hard assets and have a roadmap and desire to become an investment grade credit. The focus on this strategy is what will drive the consistency in the months and years ahead.

BBB Accreditation





                This Business Is Not BBB Accredited
            

                
                Businesses are under no obligation to seek BBB accreditation, and some businesses are not accredited because they have not sought BBB accreditation.
            

                To be accredited by BBB, a business must apply for accreditation and BBB must determine that the business meets
                BBB accreditation standards, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses must pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB:

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

In the following brief excerpt from the Investing Strategies Report, expert analysts discuss the outlook for the sector and for investors. SANDY RUFENACHT, a 22-year industry veteran, is the Chief Investment Officer, Portfolio Manager and Principal Owner of Three Peaks Capital Management, LLC. Mr. Rufenacht also serves as the Portfolio Manager for the Aquila Three Peaks High Income Fund and the Aquila Three Peaks Opportunity Growth Fund. Before founding Three Peaks in 2003, Mr. Rufenacht managed or co-managed multiple fixed-income products at Denver-based Janus Capital Group for more than a decade. During his tenure at Janus, Mr. Rufenacht received numerous international accolades while managing the Janus High Yield Bond Fund and the Janus World High Yield Bond Fund. Before joining Janus Capital, Mr. Rufenacht spent two years at Colonial Investments in Boston as Fund Accounting Supervisor. He graduated from the University of Northern Colorado with a degree in business administration. Mr. Rufenacht also serves on the University of Colorado's School of Medicine Council of Advisors and on the University of Northern Colorado's Monfort College of Business Dean's Leadership Council. TWST: Please give us a brief history of Three Peaks Capital Management. Mr. Rufenacht: After being at Janus for fourteen years running the high yield bond fund, I left in 2003 to establish Three Peaks Capital Management. Initially, Three Peaks managed assets for high net worth individuals, corporations, foundations, pension accounts, etc. In June of 2006, we launched the Aquila Three Peaks High Income Fund with the Aquila Group of Funds of New York as a joint venture to service the mutual fund spectrum. Today, Three Peaks has about $1.25 billion under management. The public mutual fund is about $325 million with the balance comprised of separately managed accounts. We've grown quite quickly, with the majority of the assets we manage invested in the high yield asset class. TWST: What sectors does Three Peaks avoid, and which ones are the firm investing in right now? Mr. Rufenacht: As I've mentioned, we focus on the more stable sectors of the economy and avoid ones that are still in their infancy stages. We generally avoid the highly cyclical sectors, which are steel, paper, chemical, autos, airlines, financials, restaurants and retailers. Over the years, it has become apparent that companies in these sectors have difficulty supporting debt when the economy slows and consumer reduces spending. We focus our investments, and therefore time and efforts, in more mature industries such as energy, health care, telecom, supermarket and packaging sectors. Companies, such as Ball Container Corp. (BLL) and Owens-Illinois (OI), are solid businesses, which produce products that consumers and business like, need and want. Cable television is another area that we are attracted to. Even in a recessionary period, people pay their cable bill. Death care names, such as Service Corp. International (SCI), are attractive as they have a sound business model in an industry that will never go away. We own Corrections Corporation (CXW), which are jails and prisons. In many states, such as California, an inmate-overpopulation problem has emerged and private inmate facilities, like Corrections Corporation, are the cheapest way to solve the problem. We also own movie theaters, such as Regal (RGC) and AMC.  Again, like cable, these are an inexpensive form of entertainment. I've been covering the theater sector since about 1992, and there was a period where the movie industry had gotten to over capacity. Too many theaters had been built, and too much debt had accumulated. This has since been rectified and it has become a good business model. We are focused on the sectors and industries that we think are based in need and necessity. We place a heavy emphasis on knowing what is going on in the energy and health care sectors because the need for both is extremely high, but so are the regulations and political banter involved with both. Investing in companies that are operating in stable sectors despite the direction of the economy helps to eliminate volatility. Lastly, not only do we not invest in emerging markets, we don't invest in international-based companies or domestic companies that have a high exposure to emerging markets. Our research is based on speaking and meeting with the management teams regularly and seeing the company's assets as often as possible, which becomes more difficult if we have to call internationally or fly around the world. There are hundreds, if not over a thousand companies in the high yield market that are based in the United States and have the majority of their operations in North America. We don't need to have the added risks associated with non-U.S. companies in order to generate a stable return.
