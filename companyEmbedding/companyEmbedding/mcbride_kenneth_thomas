Systems and methods for payment of postage indicia after the point of generation



Patent number:  9208620
                                            

Abstract:  Systems and methods provide for printing unactivated tokens which can be activated into valid postage indicia at a later time. Monetary liability for postage indicia value is postponed until the token is activated into a postage indicium; thus, the token does not have value and is not valid until activated into indicium. Consequently, a user is not made monetarily liable for printed tokens unless the tokens are activated into postage indicia.

Systems and methods for distributed printing of personalized postage indicia



Patent number:  7963437
                                            

Abstract:  Systems and methods which provide for distributed printing of personalized postage indicia are shown. Embodiments facilitate printing of personalized postage indicia at various distributed printing locations, such as user sites, retail locations, consumer kiosks, etc., while implementing techniques to avoid widespread availability of live (e.g., active or representing postage value) postage barcodes, prevent printing of fraudulent postage indicia, and/or preventing approved images from being replaced with unapproved images in printed postage indicia. Embodiments facilitate distributed printing of personalized postage indicia through implementation of a technique wherein a manufacturer, such as a postage service provider or a postal authority, provides a centralized print of unassigned tokens on postage stock. The unassigned tokens are configured or otherwise able to form a complete postage indicia when appropriate personalized content is associated therewith.
