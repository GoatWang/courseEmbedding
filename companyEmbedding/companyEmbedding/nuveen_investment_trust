Investing involves risk; principal loss is possible.


There is no assurance that a unit investment trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in a unit investment trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in a trust.


Past performance is no indication of future results. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate with changes in market conditions. Units when redeemed may be worth more or less than their original cost.


Teachers Advisors, Inc., Nuveen Asset Management, LLC, Symphony Asset Management LLC, and NWQ Investment Management Company, LLC, registered investment advisers and affiliates of Nuveen, LLC serve as the portfolio consultants responsible for recommending a portfolio of securities for certain unit investment trusts.  Argus Investors Counsel, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Morningstar Investment Services, Inc., Prospect Capital Management L.P., Zacks Investment Research, ARK Investment Management (“ARK”), and KKM Financial, LLC also provide portfolio consulting services for various unit investment trusts but are not affiliated with Nuveen, LLC or its affiliates.

      continue to work in a very focused manner to bring high-quality and 
      innovative investment options to market through the unit trust

There is no assurance that a unit investment trust will achieve its 
      investment objective. An investment in a unit investment trust is 
      subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values 
      of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of 
      trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. 
      Accordingly, you can lose money investing in a trust.


Please consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and 
      expenses of the unit investment trust(s) carefully before investing. The 
      prospectus contains this and other information about the unit investment 
      trust(s). To obtain a prospectus, please contact your financial advisor 
      or download one at the SEC’s EDGAR filing system (sec.gov/edgar.htm) or 
      on the www.incapital.com 
      offerings page. Please read the prospectus carefully before investing.

 Fair Value Measurements  Fair value is defined
as the price that would be received upon selling an investment or transferring a liability in an orderly transaction to an independent buyer in the principal or most advantageous market for the investment. A three-tier hierarchy is used to maximize
the use of observable market data and minimize the use of unobservable inputs and to establish classification of fair value measurements for disclosure purposes. Observable inputs reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the
asset or liability. Observable inputs are based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity. Unobservable inputs reflect the reporting entitys own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in
pricing the asset or liability. Unobservable inputs are based on the best information available in the circumstances. The following is a summary of the three-tiered hierarchy of valuation input levels. 
 






Level 1 
 
Inputs are unadjusted and prices are determined using quoted prices in active markets for identical securities.

Level 2 
 
Prices are determined using other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices for similar securities, interest rates, prepayment speeds, credit risk, etc.).

Level 3 
 
Prices are determined using significant unobservable inputs (including managements assumptions in determining the fair value of investments).
 The inputs or methodologies used for valuing securities are not an indication of the risk associated with investing in those securities.
The following is a summary of the Funds fair value measurements as of the end of the reporting period:

 Income Tax Information  The following
information is presented on an income tax basis. Differences between amounts for financial statement and federal income tax purposes are primarily due to timing differences in recognizing certain gains and losses on investment transactions. To the
extent that differences arise that are permanent in nature, such amounts are reclassified within the capital accounts on the Statement of Assets and Liabilities presented in the annual report, based on their federal tax basis treatment; temporary
differences do not require reclassification. Temporary and permanent differences do not impact the net asset value of the Fund.  As of May 31, 2016, the cost of
investments was $42,631,884.  Gross unrealized appreciation and gross unrealized depreciation of investments as of May 31, 2016, were as follows:

 For Fund portfolio compliance purposes, the Funds industry classifications refer to any one or more of the industry
sub-classifications used by one or more widely recognized market indexes or ratings group indexes, and/or as defined by Fund management. This definition may not apply for purposes of this report, which may combine industry sub-classifications into
sectors for reporting ease.

All percentages shown in the Portfolio of Investments are based on net assets.

 Fair Value Measurements  Fair value is defined
as the price that would be received upon selling an investment or transferring a liability in an orderly transaction to an independent buyer in the principal or most advantageous market for the investment. A three-tier hierarchy is used to maximize
the use of observable market data and minimize the use of unobservable inputs and to establish classification of fair value measurements for disclosure purposes. Observable inputs reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the
asset or liability. Observable inputs are based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity. Unobservable inputs reflect the reporting entitys own assumptions about the assumptions market

participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Unobservable inputs are based on the best information available in the circumstances. The following is a summary of the three-tiered
hierarchy of valuation input levels.   






Level 1 
 
Inputs are unadjusted and prices are determined using quoted prices in active markets for identical securities.

Level 2 
 
Prices are determined using other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices for similar securities, interest rates, prepayment speeds, credit risk, etc.).

Level 3 
 
Prices are determined using significant unobservable inputs (including managements assumptions in determining the fair value of investments).
 The inputs or methodologies used for valuing securities are not an indication of the risk associated with investing in those securities.

 Income Tax Information  The following
information is presented on an income tax basis. Differences between amounts for financial statement and federal income tax purposes are primarily due to timing differences in recognizing certain gains and losses on investment transactions. To the
extent that differences arise that are permanent in nature, such amounts are reclassified within the capital accounts on the Statement of Assets and Liabilities presented in the annual report, based on their federal tax basis treatment; temporary
differences do not require reclassification. Temporary and permanent differences do not impact the net asset value of the Fund.  As of May 31, 2016, the cost of
investments (excluding common stocks sold short) was $154,664,995.  Gross unrealized appreciation and gross unrealized depreciation of investments (excluding common
stocks sold short) as of May 31, 2016, were as follows:

A Dynamic Approach to Dividend Investing
Goldman Sachs utilizes a forward looking methodology to identify stocks of European companies with the potential for both growth and sustainability of dividend yields, considering a variety of factors including:

Forecasted Dividend Payout Ratios
Free Cash Flow Levels
Debt to Earnings Ratios
Forecasted Dividend Growth
Analyst Ratings



MSCI Europe Index: Performance by Dividend Policy



Copyright 2015 Ned Davis Research, Inc. Further distribution prohibited without prior permission. All Rights Reserved. See NDR Disclaimer at www.ndr.com/copyright.html. For data vendor disclaimers refer to www.ndr.com/vendorinfo/.
Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Indices are statistical composites and index performance does not include any sales charges or fees an investor would pay to purchase securities that may be compared to the index. It is not possible to invest directly in an index. There is no assurance that any asset class or index will provide positive performance over time. The holdings of the unit trust may differ from those in the indices.
The chart illustrates the cumulative historical performance of the MSCI Europe Index and its member constituents grouped into hypothetical sub-indices according to dividend policy as determined and calculated by Ned Davis Research, Inc. starting at a base value of 100. The performance of the MSCI Europe Index and each hypothetical sub-index is determined by the monthly arithmetically equal-weighted gross total returns, assuming gross dividend reinvestment, in USD with monthly rebalancing. The chart plots the equity lines for dividend payers, dividend non-payers, dividend growers, dividend cutters, and dividend payers with no change in dividends as defined by Ned Davis Research, Inc. Dividend payers are companies that reported a dividend. Dividend non-payers are companies that have not reported a dividend. Dividend growers are companies that increased their dividend. Dividend cutters are companies that decreased their dividend by at least 2%. Dividend payers with no change in dividends are companies that paid a dividend but were not considered a grower or cutter. The dividend policy is determined using dividends paid over the prior 12-month period. Ned Davis Research first looks to use gross dividends reported. If gross dividends are not provided, Ned Davis Research then uses net dividends reported. All dividend values are adjusted historically for currency changes, so that a switch in reported currency will not alter the dividend policy of the company.


Principal Investment Strategy
The trust seeks to achieve its objective by attempting to substantially replicate the Goldman Sachs Europe High Sustainable Dividend Basket, an approximately sector-neutral basket, which includes 60 stocks selected from the MSCI Europe Index. The portfolio stocks are selected from 10 sectors in the MSCI Europe Index using a systematic and objective methodology.
The MSCI indices are the exclusive property of MSCI Inc. (“MSCI”). MSCI and the MSCI index names are service marks of MSCI or its affiliates and are licensed for use for certain purposes by The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and its affiliates. No purchaser, seller or holder of the securities, or any other person or entity, should use or refer to any MSCI trade name, trademark or service mark to sponsor, endorse, market or promote the securities without first contacting MSCI to determine whether MSCI’s permission is required. Under no circumstances may any person or entity claim any affiliation with MSCI without the prior written permission of MSCI. The basket is not sponsored, endorsed, sold or promoted by MSCI and MSCI does not make any representation regarding the advisability of investing in the securities.


Security Selection/Investment Goals
Goldman Sachs aims to identify stocks of companies that have dividend yields which are both high and sustainable by screening the constituents of the MSCI Europe Index based upon the filters below. The companies that remain are then ranked based on their expected dividend yield within their respective sector.


Methodology





1. Size & Liquidity Filter removes stocks of companies with a price history of less than six calendar months, a published one-month median daily trading volume of less than €5 million and market capitalization of less than €1 billion.
2. Forecasted Dividend Payout Ratio Filter removes stocks of companies with a ratio of forecasted current year dividend payout relative to forecasted earnings per share (“dividend payout ratio”) that is negative or greater than 70%.
3. Free Cash Flow Cover Filter excludes stocks of companies with a realized free cash flow cover of less than 50% for the most recent available fiscal year, as well as stocks of companies with a projected free cash flow cover of less than 75% for the fiscal year immediately following the most recent realized fiscal year.
4. Debt to EBITDA Filter screens out stocks of companies with negative earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), and stocks of companies with a net debt to EBITDA ratio above the 75th percentile in the distribution of net debt to EBITDA ratio across all companies with non-negative EBITDA within each sector. Companies with no net debt to EBITDA ratio are excluded from the calculation of the relevant sector 75% percentile, but remain eligible for inclusion in the basket.
5. Forecasted Dividend Growth Filter removes stocks of companies with a forecasted first or second period dividend growth rate below 0%.
6. Credit Default Swap Filter excludes stocks of companies with a composite spread for a 5-year senior credit default swap (CDS) of more than two times the Markit iTraxx Europe composite spread.
7. Analyst Rating Filter screens out stocks of companies with an “Underperform” or “Sell” median analyst investment recommendation rating.



Risk Considerations
There is no assurance that a unit investment trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit investment trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged. You can lose money investing in this trust.

Common stocks do not assure dividend payments. Dividends are paid only when declared by an issuer’s board of directors and the amount of any dividend may vary over time.

A portfolio concentrated in a single market sector may present more risk than a portfolio broadly diversified over several sectors.

This trust is concentrated in the consumer product sectors. Some of the general risks of companies in the consumer products sectors include cyclicality of revenues and earnings, economic recession, currency fluctuations, changing consumer tastes, extensive competition, product liability litigation and increased government regulation.

Investing in foreign securities involves certain risks not typically associated with investing solely in the United States. This may magnify volatility due to changes in foreign exchange rates, the political and economic uncertainties in foreign countries, U.S. or foreign tax treatment, and the potential lack of liquidity, government supervision and regulation.

The trust invests in securities issued by companies operating in Europe and, therefore, is subject to certain risks associated specifically with Europe. European Union member states no longer control their own monetary policies and such control is exercised by the European Central Bank. Furthermore, the European sovereign debt crisis and the related austerity measures in certain countries have had, and continues to have, a significant negative impact on the economies of certain European countries and their future economic outlooks.
 
Stocks of mid-cap companies are often more volatile than those of larger companies as a result of several factors such as limited trading volumes, products or financial resources, management inexperience and less publicly available information.

Although this trust’s life is approximately 15 months, this strategy should be considered as part of a long-term investment strategy and investors should consider their ability to pursue investing in successive portfolios at the applicable sales charge, if available. There may be tax consequences associated with an investment from one series to the next unless units are purchased in an IRA or other qualified tax-deferred account. Investors should consult their tax advisor or attorney to determine tax consequences associated with an investment from one portfolio to the next.

The portfolio is selected on the basis of data as of a given date and used values that can be calculated differently.

Investment Objective

        The European Dividend Builders Portfolio is a unit investment trust that seeks to provide capital appreciation and dividend income; however, there is no assurance the objective will be met.

Investment Strategy
The trust seeks to achieve its objective by attempting to replicate the Goldman Sachs Europe
High Sustainable Dividend Basket, an approximately sector-neutral
basket, which includes 60 stocks selected from the MSCI Europe Index. The portfolio
stocks are selected from the 10 sectors in the MSCI Europe Index using a systematic
and objective methodology.Goldman Sachs aims to identify stocks of companies with dividend yields that are
both high and sustainable by screening the constituents of the MSCI Europe Index
based upon several factors, including:
• Market capitalization and daily trading volume
• Forecasted dividend payout ratio
• Free cash flow cover
• Debt to EBITDA
• Forecasted dividend growth
• Credit default swap spreads
• Median analyst ratings
A basket of 60 stocks is constructed with at least one company from each sector,
targeting one tenth of the total in each sector, and drawing from those with the
highest-ranking expected dividend yields.
See the prospectus for a more detailed description of the trust’s security
selection methodology.

                    2.950%
                


Upfront Sales Charge
                

                    1.000%

                    1.450%
                


Creation and Dev. Fee
                

                    0.500%
                



The table above shows the initial offering period sales charges. Percentages are based on a $10.00 per unit offering price. For unit prices other than $10.00, percentages of initial sales charge, creation and development fee, and deferred sales charge will vary. The maximum sales charge is comprised of the initial sales charge, creation and development fee and deferred sales charge. The Trust is also subject to annual operating expenses and organization costs, which are not included in the sales charges. The creation and development fee is a charge of $0.05 per unit collected at the end of the initial offering period. If the price you pay exceeds $10.00 per unit, the creation and development fee will be less than 0.50%; if the price you pay is less than $10.00 per unit, the creation and development fee will exceed 0.50%. Investors will not be assessed the initial and deferred sales charge for eligible fee-based accounts and must purchase units utilizing a Fee CUSIP. Please see the prospectus for sales charge details.


Risk Considerations
There is no assurance that a unit investment trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit investment trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged. You can lose money investing in this trust.

Common stocks do not assure dividend payments. Dividends are paid only when declared by an issuer’s board of directors and the amount of any dividend may vary over time.

A portfolio concentrated in a single market sector may present more risk than a portfolio broadly diversified over several sectors.

This trust is concentrated in the consumer product sectors. Some of the general risks of companies in the consumer products sectors include cyclicality of revenues and earnings, economic recession, currency fluctuations, changing consumer tastes, extensive competition, product liability litigation and increased government regulation.

Investing in foreign securities involves certain risks not typically associated with investing solely in the United States. This may magnify volatility due to changes in foreign exchange rates, the political and economic uncertainties in foreign countries, U.S. or foreign tax treatment, and the potential lack of liquidity, government supervision and regulation.

The trust invests in securities issued by companies operating in Europe and, therefore, is subject to certain risks associated specifically with Europe. European Union member states no longer control their own monetary policies and such control is exercised by the European Central Bank. Furthermore, the European sovereign debt crisis and the related austerity measures in certain countries have had, and continues to have, a significant negative impact on the economies of certain European countries and their future economic outlooks.
 
Stocks of mid-cap companies are often more volatile than those of larger companies as a result of several factors such as limited trading volumes, products or financial resources, management inexperience and less publicly available information.

Although this trust’s life is approximately 15 months, this strategy should be considered as part of a long-term investment strategy and investors should consider their ability to pursue investing in successive portfolios at the applicable sales charge, if available. There may be tax consequences associated with an investment from one series to the next unless units are purchased in an IRA or other qualified tax-deferred account. Investors should consult their tax advisor or attorney to determine tax consequences associated with an investment from one portfolio to the next.

The portfolio is selected on the basis of data as of a given date and used values that can be calculated differently.

The stocks in the portfolio are not weighted in the same manner as the basket.

LIQ is the Liquidation Price.  Represents the value per unit that a unitholder would receive if the unitholder redeemed or sold units.  This price is equal to the net asset value per unit plus any remaining organization costs and creation & development fee.  This price reflects any remaining non-contingent deferred sales charges payable in connection with a liquidation of units.
Past performance is no indication of future results. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate with changes in market conditions. Units when redeemed may be worth more or less than their original cost. 
This page contains historical pricing or historical distributions information for the unit investment trust listed above. It should not be used for federal or state tax purposes, please contact your financial advisor for tax information.




Risk Considerations
There is no assurance that a unit investment trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit investment trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged. You can lose money investing in this trust.

Common stocks do not assure dividend payments. Dividends are paid only when declared by an issuer’s board of directors and the amount of any dividend may vary over time.

A portfolio concentrated in a single market sector may present more risk than a portfolio broadly diversified over several sectors.

This trust is concentrated in the consumer product sectors. Some of the general risks of companies in the consumer products sectors include cyclicality of revenues and earnings, economic recession, currency fluctuations, changing consumer tastes, extensive competition, product liability litigation and increased government regulation.

Investing in foreign securities involves certain risks not typically associated with investing solely in the United States. This may magnify volatility due to changes in foreign exchange rates, the political and economic uncertainties in foreign countries, U.S. or foreign tax treatment, and the potential lack of liquidity, government supervision and regulation.

The trust invests in securities issued by companies operating in Europe and, therefore, is subject to certain risks associated specifically with Europe. European Union member states no longer control their own monetary policies and such control is exercised by the European Central Bank. Furthermore, the European sovereign debt crisis and the related austerity measures in certain countries have had, and continues to have, a significant negative impact on the economies of certain European countries and their future economic outlooks.
 
Stocks of mid-cap companies are often more volatile than those of larger companies as a result of several factors such as limited trading volumes, products or financial resources, management inexperience and less publicly available information.

Although this trust’s life is approximately 15 months, this strategy should be considered as part of a long-term investment strategy and investors should consider their ability to pursue investing in successive portfolios at the applicable sales charge, if available. There may be tax consequences associated with an investment from one series to the next unless units are purchased in an IRA or other qualified tax-deferred account. Investors should consult their tax advisor or attorney to determine tax consequences associated with an investment from one portfolio to the next.

The portfolio is selected on the basis of data as of a given date and used values that can be calculated differently.

The stocks in the portfolio are not weighted in the same manner as the basket.

Returns With Transactional Sales Charge reflect the maximum transactional sales charge that would be payable by an investor upon sale or redemption of units at the end of the applicable period(s). The transactional sales charge includes any initial or deferred sales charges other than the creation and development fee. These returns do not reflect any creation and development fee prior to collection (generally the close of the initial offering period). Any creation and development fee is reflected in the returns as of the time of payment by a trust.

Returns Without Transactional Sales Charge do not reflect any transactional sales charge and do not reflect any creation and development fee prior to collection (generally the close of the initial offering period). Any creation and development fee is reflected in the returns as of the time of payment by a trust.
Returns are cumulative total returns (not annualized) unless labeled as average annual returns.  Distribution Received in Cash returns reflect trust expenses as incurred and assume income and principal distributions are paid out in cash on the payable date.  Distributions Reinvested returns reflect trust expenses as incurred and assume income and principal distributions are reinvested on the reinvestment date.

Past performance is no indication of future results. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate with changes in market conditions. Units when redeemed may be worth more or less than their original cost.

All returns are historical and do not represent potential future performance.  A trust’s performance, especially for short time periods, should not be the sole factor in making your investment decision.


Risk Considerations
There is no assurance that a unit investment trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit investment trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged. You can lose money investing in this trust.

Common stocks do not assure dividend payments. Dividends are paid only when declared by an issuer’s board of directors and the amount of any dividend may vary over time.

A portfolio concentrated in a single market sector may present more risk than a portfolio broadly diversified over several sectors.

This trust is concentrated in the consumer product sectors. Some of the general risks of companies in the consumer products sectors include cyclicality of revenues and earnings, economic recession, currency fluctuations, changing consumer tastes, extensive competition, product liability litigation and increased government regulation.

Investing in foreign securities involves certain risks not typically associated with investing solely in the United States. This may magnify volatility due to changes in foreign exchange rates, the political and economic uncertainties in foreign countries, U.S. or foreign tax treatment, and the potential lack of liquidity, government supervision and regulation.

The trust invests in securities issued by companies operating in Europe and, therefore, is subject to certain risks associated specifically with Europe. European Union member states no longer control their own monetary policies and such control is exercised by the European Central Bank. Furthermore, the European sovereign debt crisis and the related austerity measures in certain countries have had, and continues to have, a significant negative impact on the economies of certain European countries and their future economic outlooks.

Data used for the Portfolio Holdings and Portfolio Allocation Characteristics is from Bloomberg Finance L.P. Portfolio holdings are provided for informational purposes only and should not be deemed as a recommendation to buy or sell individual securities. Portfolio Holdings and Portfolio Allocation Characteristics are as of deposit day and are subject to change and may vary thereafter.
The style and capitalization characteristics are designed to help investors understand how they fit into an overall investment plan. Value, blend and growth are types of investment styles. Growth Investing generally seeks stocks that offer the potential for greater-than-average earnings growth, and may entail greater risk than value or blend investing. Value investing generally seeks stocks that may be sound investments but are temporarily out of favor in the marketplace, and may entail less risk than growth investing. A blend investment combines the two styles. Market capitalization is determined by the following criteria: Large Cap: Greater than $10 billion, Mid Cap: $2 billion-$10 billion, Small Cap: $250 million-$2 billion Micro Cap: Below $250 million.


Risk Considerations
There is no assurance that a unit investment trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit investment trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged. You can lose money investing in this trust.

Common stocks do not assure dividend payments. Dividends are paid only when declared by an issuer’s board of directors and the amount of any dividend may vary over time.

A portfolio concentrated in a single market sector may present more risk than a portfolio broadly diversified over several sectors.

This trust is concentrated in the consumer product sectors. Some of the general risks of companies in the consumer products sectors include cyclicality of revenues and earnings, economic recession, currency fluctuations, changing consumer tastes, extensive competition, product liability litigation and increased government regulation.

Investing in foreign securities involves certain risks not typically associated with investing solely in the United States. This may magnify volatility due to changes in foreign exchange rates, the political and economic uncertainties in foreign countries, U.S. or foreign tax treatment, and the potential lack of liquidity, government supervision and regulation.

The trust invests in securities issued by companies operating in Europe and, therefore, is subject to certain risks associated specifically with Europe. European Union member states no longer control their own monetary policies and such control is exercised by the European Central Bank. Furthermore, the European sovereign debt crisis and the related austerity measures in certain countries have had, and continues to have, a significant negative impact on the economies of certain European countries and their future economic outlooks.
 
Stocks of mid-cap companies are often more volatile than those of larger companies as a result of several factors such as limited trading volumes, products or financial resources, management inexperience and less publicly available information.

Although this trust’s life is approximately 15 months, this strategy should be considered as part of a long-term investment strategy and investors should consider their ability to pursue investing in successive portfolios at the applicable sales charge, if available. There may be tax consequences associated with an investment from one series to the next unless units are purchased in an IRA or other qualified tax-deferred account. Investors should consult their tax advisor or attorney to determine tax consequences associated with an investment from one portfolio to the next.

The portfolio is selected on the basis of data as of a given date and used values that can be calculated differently.

The stocks in the portfolio are not weighted in the same manner as the basket.

NOT FDIC INSURED - NOT BANK GUARANTEED - MAY LOSE VALUE

Income distributions will vary with changes in dividends or interest received on the underlying securities and with changes in the trust's fees and expenses. Principal distributions will be made only when the trust receives principal cash and will therefore vary. Both income and principal distributions may be affected by the sale of securities in the portfolio. See the prospectus for a more detailed description of the factors which could affect income and principal distributions.

Risk Considerations
There is no assurance that a unit investment trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit investment trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged. You can lose money investing in this trust.

Common stocks do not assure dividend payments. Dividends are paid only when declared by an issuer’s board of directors and the amount of any dividend may vary over time.

A portfolio concentrated in a single market sector may present more risk than a portfolio broadly diversified over several sectors.

This trust is concentrated in the consumer product sectors. Some of the general risks of companies in the consumer products sectors include cyclicality of revenues and earnings, economic recession, currency fluctuations, changing consumer tastes, extensive competition, product liability litigation and increased government regulation.

Investing in foreign securities involves certain risks not typically associated with investing solely in the United States. This may magnify volatility due to changes in foreign exchange rates, the political and economic uncertainties in foreign countries, U.S. or foreign tax treatment, and the potential lack of liquidity, government supervision and regulation.

The trust invests in securities issued by companies operating in Europe and, therefore, is subject to certain risks associated specifically with Europe. European Union member states no longer control their own monetary policies and such control is exercised by the European Central Bank. Furthermore, the European sovereign debt crisis and the related austerity measures in certain countries have had, and continues to have, a significant negative impact on the economies of certain European countries and their future economic outlooks.
 
Stocks of mid-cap companies are often more volatile than those of larger companies as a result of several factors such as limited trading volumes, products or financial resources, management inexperience and less publicly available information.

Although this trust’s life is approximately 15 months, this strategy should be considered as part of a long-term investment strategy and investors should consider their ability to pursue investing in successive portfolios at the applicable sales charge, if available. There may be tax consequences associated with an investment from one series to the next unless units are purchased in an IRA or other qualified tax-deferred account. Investors should consult their tax advisor or attorney to determine tax consequences associated with an investment from one portfolio to the next.

The portfolio is selected on the basis of data as of a given date and used values that can be calculated differently.

The stocks in the portfolio are not weighted in the same manner as the basket.

1. LIQ is the Liquidation Price.  Represents the value per unit that a unitholder would receive if the unitholder redeemed or sold units.  This price is equal to the net asset value per unit plus any remaining organization costs and creation & development fee.  This price reflects any remaining non-contingent deferred sales charges payable in connection with a liquidation of units.
2. There is no guarantee that any distributions will be made.  The estimated net annual income is per unit as of deposit day and based on the most recently declared dividends, distributions or interim and final dividends accounting for any foreign withholding taxes of the portfolio’s holdings.  The actual net annual income distributions you receive will vary from the estimate with changes in the portfolio’s fees and expenses, income received, currency fluctuations, and with the call, redemption, maturity, or sale of securities. 
3. The historical annual dividend distribution was calculated as of the day of deposit based on the trailing 12-month dividends or distributions paid by each issuer of securities in the trust portfolio and is net of the deferred sales charge and operating expenses charged by the trust. The trailing 12-month dividend for each issuer includes net dividend amounts for all fixed schedule dividends that have been declared over the past 12 months, excluding special distributions like special cash and return of capital, taxes, any related dividend fees and tax related credits. The amount of distributions you receive will vary from the above-stated amount due to changes in the dividends or distributions paid by issuers, changes in the trust's fees and expenses, income received, currency fluctuations, and with the call, redemption, maturity or sale of portfolio securities. Fees and expenses of the trust may vary as a result of the trust's size, redemption activity, brokerage and other transaction costs and extraordinary expenses among other factors.

Incapital and Nuveen Investments Expand Unit Trust Partnership


New Unit Trusts Leverage Expertise of Nuveen’s Multi-Affiliate Model
Enhanced by Incapital Additions to Unit Trust Business
Nuveen Expands Specialist Sales Support Team for Unit Trusts

CHICAGO, June 9, 2015 – Incapital LLC and Nuveen Investments, today announced the expansion of their joint-distribution and portfolio consultant unit trust partnership with the addition of new unit trusts and expanded sales resources at both firms to support the growth of the unit trust business and better serve the financial advisor community and their clients. Since the beginning of 2014, Nuveen and Incapital have partnered together on key aspects of unit trust product development, marketing, distribution and client relationship management.  In this partnership, Incapital serves as trust underwriter and sponsor, providing units to the public through broker-dealers and other firms.  Nuveen Investments, through its several affiliates, serves as portfolio consultant responsible for developing investment strategies and constructing model portfolios for the unit trusts.
Commenting on the partnership, John DesPrez, Incapital’s Chief Executive Officer, said, “Incapital’s relationship with Nuveen Investments continues to deepen. With the expansion of our joint-distribution agreement, we will be offering a wider range of investment strategies to thousands of additional financial advisors and their clients.”


INCAPITAL UNIT TRUSTS FEATURING NUVEEN’S INVESTMENT EXPERTISE
Since inception of the partnership, Incapital has offered five equity unit trust strategies that draw upon the deep and specialized expertise of Nuveen Investments’ affiliates: 

Nuveen Equity Outlook Portfolios
Nuveen Large Cap Dividend Portfolios 
Nuveen Core Real Estate Securities Portfolios
Nuveen NWQ Global Dividend Value Portfolios
Nuveen Tradewinds Global Energy Revolution Portfolio

To further broaden its platform for clients, Incapital has been working closely with Nuveen this year to develop a robust pipeline of new unit trusts employing a variety of strategies and themes.  Capitalizing on the recently closed Nuveen 2015 Equity Outlook Portfolio, Series 68, which more than doubled in assets from the prior year’s series, Incapital filed an initial registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the Nuveen 2015 Mid-Year Equity Outlook Portfolio, Series 86   This new unit trust’s portfolio selection is led by Bob Doll, Nuveen Asset Management’s Senior Portfolio Manager and Chief Equity Strategist, and seeks to include a mid-year update in which Bob Doll reassesses his investment outlook as expressed in his 2015 Ten Predictions.
Additionally, Incapital filed an initial registration statement with the SEC for the Nuveen Symphony Low Volatility Equity Portfolio, Series 88, which employs the investment expertise of Symphony Asset Management, an affiliate of Nuveen Investments.  Recognized for their rigorous fundamental research and alternative investment/hedge fund expertise, Symphony applies a team-based approach to valuation and risk analysis, which seeks to identify and translate relative value into desired risk/reward portfolio outcomes.
Bill Adams, Nuveen Investments’ Senior Executive Vice President and Head of Global Structured Products added, “We are very pleased to expand our relationship with Incapital as we work to bring innovative investment options to investors.  We believe unit trusts can expand the ability of investors and their advisors to access the specialized investment expertise of our affiliates across a broad range of asset classes to help them better achieve their financial objectives.”


JOINT-DISTRIBUTION EFFORT
Incapital has recently appointed Hugh McHaffie as Managing Director who will soon oversee the origination and distribution of a range of wealth management solutions, including Unit Trust, Market Linked and Annuity offerings. McHaffie is supported by a veteran Unit Trust origination team in Chicago, headed by John Browning, Managing Director and Randy Watts, Executive Director. Pat Dwyer, National Sales Manager, will soon lead Incapital’s nation-wide distribution network supporting financial advisors seeking wealth management investment solutions for their clients.
Given the performance of the current unit trust offerings, strong interest from the market, and robust pipeline of new offerings currently under consideration, Nuveen Investments is also enhancing its unit trust distribution efforts with the appointment of Melissa Roe as Managing Director, National Head of Unit Trust Sales.  Overseeing a team of external and internal unit trust specialists, Roe will act as a liaison between Nuveen Investments and Incapital to represent the capabilities of Nuveen Investments’ affiliates and ensure that the needs of financial advisors and their investor clients are being served.

Nuveen, formerly Nuveen Investments, is a division of TIAA, operating in asset management. Nuveen was founded in Chicago, Illinois in 1898 and was previously named The John Nuveen Co., after founder John Nuveen. In October 2014, TIAA-CREF completed their purchase of Nuveen.
Nuveen started in the municipal bond underwriting business and remains active in municipal bond market. Nuveen sells services including separately managed accounts, retail mutual funds and closed-end funds. Nuveen has $882 billion in assets under management.[1]

History[edit]
Founded in 1898, Nuveen Investments began as John Nuveen & Company, when founder John Nuveen, Sr. created the firm as an investment banking company specializing in the underwriting and distribution of municipal bonds. John Nuveen formed the company in 1898. The first bond it underwrote was for a Minnesota water company. After World War II, John Nuveen, Jr. helped with the Marshall Plan administration.
In 1969, it was purchased by Investors Diversified Services (IDS). In 1974, the company was sold to The St. Paul Companies. It was privatised in 2007 after being acquired by Private Equity Group led by Madison Dearborn Partners for $5.4 Billion.[2]
The company is also known for a commercial it aired in 2000 during the Super Bowl which, through the aid of computer animation, featured Christopher Reeve "walking" along with several other sufferers of spinal paralysis.
Auction rate securities[edit]
Nuveen came under criticism during 2008 for its involvement in the auction rate securities auction failures,[3] during which assets held in Nuveen's closed-end funds, totaling $15 billion, became illiquid.[4][5] Those funds had two share classes: auction-rate preferred shares that hold first claim on the underlying assets (and pay income at rates set in weekly auctions), and common shares that typically pay higher income in exchange for greater risk of loss of principal. During the auction failures, while common shareholders suffered worse than preferred shareholders in terms of principal losses, they were able to sell their shares on the NYSE while preferred shareholders had no market in which to sell.[4] In response, Nuveen posted a "Nuveen Auction Rate Preferred Resource Center" to inform its investors of its plans to borrow money to pay them back.[6] The company later set refinancing for $2.7 Billion in taxable auction-rate preferred shares and has placed $500 Million of VRDP refinancing for its municipal auction rate preferred shares.[7][8]

Nuveen, formerly Nuveen Investments, is a division of TIAA, operating in asset management. Nuveen was founded in Chicago, Illinois in 1898 and was previously named The John Nuveen Co., after founder John Nuveen. In October 2014, TIAA-CREF completed their purchase of Nuveen.
Nuveen started in the municipal bond underwriting business and remains active in municipal bond market. Nuveen sells services including separately managed accounts, retail mutual funds and closed-end funds. Nuveen has $882 billion in assets under management.[1]

History[edit]
Founded in 1898, Nuveen Investments began as John Nuveen & Company, when founder John Nuveen, Sr. created the firm as an investment banking company specializing in the underwriting and distribution of municipal bonds. John Nuveen formed the company in 1898. The first bond it underwrote was for a Minnesota water company. After World War II, John Nuveen, Jr. helped with the Marshall Plan administration.
In 1969, it was purchased by Investors Diversified Services (IDS). In 1974, the company was sold to The St. Paul Companies. It was privatised in 2007 after being acquired by Private Equity Group led by Madison Dearborn Partners for $5.4 Billion.[2]
The company is also known for a commercial it aired in 2000 during the Super Bowl which, through the aid of computer animation, featured Christopher Reeve "walking" along with several other sufferers of spinal paralysis.
Auction rate securities[edit]
Nuveen came under criticism during 2008 for its involvement in the auction rate securities auction failures,[3] during which assets held in Nuveen's closed-end funds, totaling $15 billion, became illiquid.[4][5] Those funds had two share classes: auction-rate preferred shares that hold first claim on the underlying assets (and pay income at rates set in weekly auctions), and common shares that typically pay higher income in exchange for greater risk of loss of principal. During the auction failures, while common shareholders suffered worse than preferred shareholders in terms of principal losses, they were able to sell their shares on the NYSE while preferred shareholders had no market in which to sell.[4] In response, Nuveen posted a "Nuveen Auction Rate Preferred Resource Center" to inform its investors of its plans to borrow money to pay them back.[6] The company later set refinancing for $2.7 Billion in taxable auction-rate preferred shares and has placed $500 Million of VRDP refinancing for its municipal auction rate preferred shares.[7][8]

History[edit]
Founded in 1898, Nuveen Investments began as John Nuveen & Company, when founder John Nuveen, Sr. created the firm as an investment banking company specializing in the underwriting and distribution of municipal bonds. John Nuveen formed the company in 1898. The first bond it underwrote was for a Minnesota water company. After World War II, John Nuveen, Jr. helped with the Marshall Plan administration.
In 1969, it was purchased by Investors Diversified Services (IDS). In 1974, the company was sold to The St. Paul Companies. It was privatised in 2007 after being acquired by Private Equity Group led by Madison Dearborn Partners for $5.4 Billion.[2]
The company is also known for a commercial it aired in 2000 during the Super Bowl which, through the aid of computer animation, featured Christopher Reeve "walking" along with several other sufferers of spinal paralysis.
Auction rate securities[edit]
Nuveen came under criticism during 2008 for its involvement in the auction rate securities auction failures,[3] during which assets held in Nuveen's closed-end funds, totaling $15 billion, became illiquid.[4][5] Those funds had two share classes: auction-rate preferred shares that hold first claim on the underlying assets (and pay income at rates set in weekly auctions), and common shares that typically pay higher income in exchange for greater risk of loss of principal. During the auction failures, while common shareholders suffered worse than preferred shareholders in terms of principal losses, they were able to sell their shares on the NYSE while preferred shareholders had no market in which to sell.[4] In response, Nuveen posted a "Nuveen Auction Rate Preferred Resource Center" to inform its investors of its plans to borrow money to pay them back.[6] The company later set refinancing for $2.7 Billion in taxable auction-rate preferred shares and has placed $500 Million of VRDP refinancing for its municipal auction rate preferred shares.[7][8]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
