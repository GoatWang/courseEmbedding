About FOTV
 
FOTV is a rapidly expanding collection of integrated digital media companies, all calibrated to make the most of both its proprietary technology platforms, and its vast content capabilities.

These companies operate in several digital spheres—both in licensing the platforms to third parties, providing turnkey services to consumers and clients, thus maximizing exploitation of the intellectual property that FOTV owns, creates, acquires or licenses.
FOTV’s integrated businesses include: the world’s largest privately owned film and television library; patented entertainment technologies in hologram projection systems; FilmOn Networks, the world’s largest live streaming TV and VOD platform; Cable television channels in the USA and Europe; the world’s largest independent digital distribution platform for music and video; Advanced social media marketing platforms that include Class15 and Advirally; B2B digital content production services and consumer facing Web TV services.
The group was established in 2007 as the corporate investment vehicle of its founder, media and entertainment entrepreneur Alkiviades “Alki” David, a member of the prominent Greek “David-Leventis” family, whose holdings include manufacturing, biotech, Coca Cola bottling plants, asset management, retail, hospitality and real estate. Mr. David’s most significant personal successes to date have been within the shipping and media technology industries.
FOTV’s content strategy includes initiatives based on creating original content, distribution tied to live events, branded content integration and B2B digital distribution that incorporates Social Media Influencers and popular Artists in the film, TV and music industries. FOTV has also formed many strategic alliances with major media corporations to license both the technology and content in the group’s portfolio.
FilmOn Networks, the globally accessible IPTV platform which serves over 70 Million unique visitors each month, and Hologram USA, the company that develops digital resurrection performances, in collaboration with the management and estates of celebrities from the world of entertainment, politics and sports. HUSA also creates game changing telepresence opportunities for living entertainers and politicians.
FOTV also owns the world’s largest privately held collection of movies and TV shows which includes the respected Hemdale, Cannon, Allied and Cinebx libraries. Over 30,000 film negatives are constantly being restored and digitally re-mastered at a state-of-the-art facility in Irvine, CA.
In 2013, the company’s FilmOn subsidiary established a significant strategic alliance with Chinese company Lenovo Group Ltd., the world’s largest personal computer manufacturer and third largest ‘smart connected device’ maker. The FilmOn TV app is now preloaded on every PC distributed by Lenovo globally, which at the company’s reported run rate in July 2014, will amount to approximately 100 million.
With over one hundred full time engineers and programmers located in Odessa Ukraine, and in Los Angeles, FOTV creates multiple technologies, sites and apps as well as manages a large IPTV and Web-services Cloud Infrastructure. This fully autonomous Network is hosted from a datacenter in several locations across the Globe, and has taken a decade to implement.
In addition to the corporate headquarters in Beverly Hills, the company has offices and technical infrastructure, satellite up link, and production studios in London, Switzerland and Ukraine.
FOTV is focused on continually developing value for its stakeholders through organic growth, strategic investment, and acquisitions of complimentary companies, technologies, and digital properties worldwide.

DISTINCTADVANTAGE
Because of FOTV’s exclusive and proprietary content, the Company is uniquely positioned as a complementary service
                to large general content providers such as television broadcasters, cable television channels and streaming services
                such as Netflix, Hulu, Amazon and Apple TV.





EXCLUSIVE AND PROPRIETARY CONTENT
FOTV has amassed an extensive library
                    of content with exclusive worldwide
                    streaming distribution rights and has
                    established exclusive relationships with
                    key talent and content providers
                    The significant volume of titles the
                    Company offers in the VOD category
                    and the breadth of FilmOn’s 700 linear
                    programming channels differentiate
                    the Company from Netflix and similar
                    OVD platforms, which primarily
                    provide serialized content and selected
                    VOD titles produced in a proprietary

	CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS



	This Quarterly Report on

	Form 10-Q

	(this

	Form 10-Q)

	contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
	Securities Act), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act). All statements contained in this

	Form 10-Q

	other than statements of
	historical fact, including statements regarding our future results of operations and financial position, our business strategy and plans, and our objectives for future operations, are forward-looking statements. The words believe,
	may, will, estimate, continue, anticipate, intend, expect, and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. We have based these
	forward-looking statements largely on our current expectations and projections about future events and trends that we believe may affect our financial condition, results of operations, business strategy, short-term and long-term business operations
	and objectives, and financial needs. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, including those described in Part II, Item 1A, Risk Factors in this

	Form 10-Q.

	Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks emerge from time to time. It is not possible for our management to predict all risks, nor can we assess the
	impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements we may make. In light of these risks,
	uncertainties, and assumptions, the future events and trends discussed in this

	Form 10-Q

	may not occur and actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated or implied in the
	forward-looking statements.


	We undertake no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revision to these forward-looking
	statements, except as required by law. Given these risks and uncertainties, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements.


	Unless expressly indicated or the context requires otherwise, the terms FOTV, the Company, we,
	us, and our in this

	Form 10-Q

	refer to FOTV Media Networks Inc., a Delaware corporation, and, where appropriate, its wholly owned subsidiaries.

	Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements




	For the three and Six Months June 30, 2016 and 2015





	Note 1  Basis of Presentation





	Nature of
	operations



	FOTV Media Networks Inc. (the Company, we, our, us, or the Group) was founded
	in the United Kingdom (UK) in 2007 and began operations in the United States (US) in 2010. The Company operates an internet-based IPTV platform serving video streams monthly to a global audience who watch the Companys
	live programming, 700 linear channels, 90,000 on demand movies, documentaries, podcasts, music videos and social TV services. The Companys programming reaches satellite audiences via DISH Network in the US, and FreeSat in Europe. In April
	2016, the Company changed its name from FilmOn.TV Networks Inc. to FOTV Media Networks Inc.


	In April 2016, as part of a group reorganization under common
	control, the Company acquired HUSA Development Inc., a company owned by the majority shareholder of the Company, which had commenced business operations during November 2015. (see Note 2  Acquisitions). These transactions are being accounted
	for on the predecessor values basis as common control transactions. Upon consummation of the transaction, the results of operations of the Company, its existing subsidiaries and HUSA Development Inc. were included in the consolidated financial
	statements as if the companies had always been owned by the Company.



	Basis of Presentation



	The accompanying interim condensed consolidated financial statements as of June 30, 2016 and for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 are
	unaudited. The unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the annual consolidated financial statements and, in the opinion of management, reflect all adjustments, which are of a normal
	recurring nature, necessary to present fairly the Companys financial position as of June 30, 2016, results of operations for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, and cash flows for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and
	2015. The Companys results for an interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year.


	Although the
	Company believes that all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the interim periods presented are included and that the disclosures are adequate, these condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto are unaudited and should
	be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2015 included in our final prospectus dated August 12, 2016 contained in our registration statement on Form S-1.
	The accompanying balance sheet at December 31, 2015 has been derived from audited financial statements, except that it has been adjusted to take account of the common control transaction that occurred in April 2016, as discussed in the basis of
	presentation above, but does not include all disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (USGAAP).


	The interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis of continuity of operations, realization of assets, and the
	satisfaction of liabilities in the ordinary course of business. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets and liabilities that might be necessary should
	the Company be unable to continue as a going concern (see Note 1Going Concern).



	Reverse Stock Split



	On November 10, 2015, our Board of Directors and the holder of a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock approved an amendment to our
	certificate of incorporation to effect a 0.375-for-1 reverse stock split of our outstanding common stock and authorized our executive officers to implement such reverse stock split at such time as they deem advisable. In February 2016, the executive
	officers, implemented the reverse stock split decreasing the Companys common stock outstanding from 99,500,000 shares to 37,312,500 shares. As such, all share and per share numbers have been adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split.

	Going Concern



	The accompanying condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company
	has experienced recurring losses since its inception. The Company incurred a net loss of $12,232,000 and used $7,191,000 in cash from operations for the six months ended June 30, 2016, and had an accumulated deficit of $69,651,000 as of
	June 30, 2016. Since inception, the Company has financed its activities principally from regular financing injections from its majority shareholder. Management expects to incur additional losses and cash outflows in the foreseeable future in
	connection with development of its operating activities. The Companys consolidated financial statements have been presented on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the
	normal course of business.


	The Company is subject to a number of risks similar to those of other similar stage companies, including dependence on key
	individuals, successful product development, marketing and branding of products; uncertainty of product development and generation of revenues; dependence on outside sources of financing; risks associated with research and development; dependence on
	third-party content providers, suppliers and collaborators; protection of intellectual property; and competition with larger, better-capitalized companies. Ultimately, the attainment of profitable operations is dependent on future events, including
	obtaining adequate financing to fulfil its development activities and generating a level of revenues adequate to support the Companys cost structure. To support the Companys financial performance, management has undertaken several
	initiatives, including the raising of additional financing subsequent to the period end:


	In December 2015, February 2016 and May 2016, we made
	strategic acquisitions of businesses in order to increase our ability to generate future cash flows and enhance product offerings.


	In May 2016 and June
	2016, the Company raised $2,440,000 through a private placement. In the private placement, the Company placed 381,247 new shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (see Note 4).


	During the six months ended June 30, 2016, the majority shareholder purchased 904,980 shares of common stock for a purchase price of $7,241,000,
	throughout the period.


	There can be no assurance however that financing will be available in sufficient amounts, when and if needed, on acceptable terms
	or at all. If results of operations for the remainder of 2016 do not meet managements expectations, or additional capital is not available, management believes it has the ability to reduce certain expenditures. The precise amount and timing of
	the funding needs cannot be determined accurately at this time, and will depend on a number of factors, including the market demand for the Companys products, the quality of product development efforts, management of working capital, and
	continuation of normal payment terms and conditions for purchase of services. The Company is uncertain whether its existing cash balances and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund its operations for the next twelve months. If the
	Company is unable to substantially increase revenues, reduce expenditures, or otherwise generate cash flows for operations, then the Company will need to raise additional funding to continue as a going concern through its major shareholder, or
	through other avenues.



	Goodwill



	Goodwill is not
	subject to amortization and is tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. Management has established the last day of its year end as the date of our annual goodwill and
	indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment assessment. Impairment testing is performed for each of our reporting units. We compare the carrying value of a reporting unit, including goodwill, to the fair value of the unit. Carrying value is based
	on the assets and liabilities associated with the operations of that reporting unit, which often requires allocation of shared or corporate items among reporting units. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we revalue
	all assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, excluding goodwill, to determine if the fair value of the net assets is greater than the net assets including goodwill. If the fair value of the net assets is less than the carrying amount of net
	assets including goodwill, impairment has occurred. Our estimates of fair value are determined based on a discounted cash flow model. Growth rates for sales and profits are determined using inputs from our long-range planning process. We also make
	estimates of discount rates, perpetuity growth assumptions, market comparables, and other factors.

	Note 2  Acquisitions and Sale of Assets





	OV Guide Inc. Acquisition



	On March 8, 2016, we
	completed the acquisition of OVGuide Inc. (OVG). For accounting consideration, we had effective control of OVG on February 29, 2016. Founded in 2006, OVG is a privately held company where users can search and discover video content
	on the internet. Also headquartered in Los Angeles, California, we believe this deal enables the Company to broaden its content offering by leveraging the innovative video search technology employed by OVG.


	The acquisition took place using a statutory merger instrument which involved the Company issuing 1,007,814 shares of the Companys common stock in
	exchange for 100% of the outstanding share capital and eligible share options in OVG, which subsequently became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. The Company is in the process of determining the fair value of the assets and liabilities
	acquired in accordance with ASC 805. The following information is based on managements estimate.


	The Company has estimated the fair value at the
	consideration due; subject to the contingent payments, (see below), as follows (in thousands):

	Fair value of shares issued


	The
	Company has estimated the fair value of the shares to be $8.00 per share for a total estimated value of $8,063,000. Of the total shares issuable, 100,782 shares are being held in an escrow account (Hold-Back Participants). The Hold-Back
	Participants are being retained for indemnity obligations. Of the total Hold-Back Participants, 50,391 shares will be released on the six-month anniversary of the acquisition and the remaining 50,391 shares will be released on the one-year
	anniversary of the acquisition.


	Fair value of stock options purchased


	In accordance with the merger agreement, the Company was required to replace, with the Companys stock options, the outstanding stock options, which were
	in the money, of OVG as of the date of the merger. As of the acquisition date, OVG had a total of 5,620,500 stock options, in the money, outstanding. Of the total stock options outstanding, 5,135,823 options were vested. The value of the vested
	option was estimated to be $903,000. The Company has attributed the $903,000 as a component of the purchase price. The remaining value of the outstanding stock options will be treated as post-merger compensation and be charged to income over the
	vesting period of one year. The Company estimated the value of the stock options to be approximately $259,000 using the Black-Scholes option pricing formula. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, The Company has recorded stock
	option expenses of approximately $97,000 and $129,000, respectively.

	Bonus Shares



	The Company is obligated to issue shares of the Companys common stock for an aggregate fair value of $800,000 as a bonus to key employees (Bonus
	Shares). The Bonus Shares Plan will provide that (i) Bonus Shares will vest one year following closing, provided that the key employee remains employed by the Company or one the Companys affiliates, except that the Bonus Shares will
	fully vest in the event of a termination of a key employees employment without cause; (ii) the Bonus Share, to the extent vested, shall be settled in shares of the Companys common stock on the one year anniversary of the closing;
	and (iii) any Bonus Shares forfeited as a result of not vesting may be reallocated among the key employees within one year following the closing by mutual agreement between the chief executive officer of the Company and the chief executive
	officer of OVG. The Company has determined that the bonus shares are post-merger compensation, as such, the bonus shares will be accounted for in accordance with ASC 718 Compensation  Stock Compensation and charged to income over the period
	earned.


	Purchase price adjustment


	The acquisition
	agreement sets out a formula for issuing additional shares to the OVG shareholders if the Company does not succeed in having a successful initial public offering (IPO) of its shares, with the Securities and Exchange Commission, within
	twelve months of the closing date. Also, if the share price, in the IPO, is less than $8.00, there is a formula for additional shares to the OVG shareholders, as follows:


	 




	(a)


	Upon the effectiveness of an IPO of the Company that is consummated on or before the one-year anniversary of the closing, if the initial price to public of the Companys common stock in the IPO is less than the
	Companys common stock (Cash) value per share, then Company shall issue additional shares of Companys common stock to the Holdback Participants, Option holders and Bonus Recipients (with each Holdback Participant, Option holder and Bonus
	Recipient having the right to receive such persons Pro Rata Portion of such aggregate number of shares of the Companys common stock), for no additional consideration), equal to (i) the quotient of (1) $10,000,000 divided by
	(2) the IPO True-Up Price (as defined below), minus (ii) the quotient of (1) $10,000,000 divided by (2) the Companys common stock (cash) value per share. IPO True-Up Price means a price per share calculated by
	dividing the pre- money valuation of the Company for purposes of the IPO by the Companys fully diluted capitalization immediately prior to the IPO; provided, that the IPO True-Up Price shall not exceed the Companys common stock (cash)
	value per share and shall not be less than the price per share obtained by dividing $200,000,000 by the Companys fully diluted capitalization immediately prior to the IPO.




	 




	(b)


	If the Company does not consummate an IPO on or before the one-year anniversary of the closing, then the Company shall issue additional shares of the Companys common stock to the Holdback Participants, Option
	Holders and Bonus Recipients (with each Holdback Participant, Option holder and Bonus Recipient having the right to receive such persons Pro Rata Portion of such aggregate number of shares of the Companys common stock), for no additional
	consideration, equal to (i) the quotient of (1) $10,000,000 divided by (2) the Alternative True-Up Price (as defined below), minus (ii) the quotient of (1) $10,000,000 divided by (2) the Companys common stock
	(cash) value per share. Alternative True- Up Price means a price per share calculated by dividing $250,000,000 by the Companys fully diluted capitalization on the first day following the one-year anniversary of the closing.




	The Companys management has evaluated the above provision and determined the provision to be a free- standing derivate instrument in
	accordance with ASC 815Derivatives and Hedging. As such, the Company will fair value the instrument, each reporting period, with the fair value adjustment to the statement of operations. At issuance date the fair value of the derivative was
	$nil, and at June 30, 2016, the fair value of the derivative was also estimated by management to be $nil.


	Purchase Price Allocation


	The Company negotiated the purchase price based on the expected cash flows to be derived from their operations after integration into the Companys
	existing distribution, production and service networks. The acquisition purchase price is allocated on a preliminary basis based on the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, which are based on management estimates and
	third-party appraisals. The following table summarizes (in thousands) the preliminary fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed related to the acquisition:

	Intangible Assets


	The developed
	technology intangible assets relate to OVGs products across all of their product lines that have reached technological feasibility, primarily the technology to operate the Companys website. Customer relationships represent existing
	contracted relationships with affiliate marketing partners. The estimated lives of each component is as follows:

	The estimated fair values of the identifiable intangible assets, which include developed technology, trade name and customer
	relationships were primarily determined using either the relief-from-royalty or excess earnings methods. The rates utilized to discount net cash flows to their present values ranged from 24.5% to 25.9% and were determined after consideration of the
	overall enterprise rate of return and the relative risk and importance of the assets to the generation of future cash flows. The estimated fair values of the studio relationships and content library were determined under the cost method.


	The Company did not record any in-process research and development assets as OVGs major technology projects are either substantially complete or
	primarily represent improvements and additional functionality to existing products for which a substantial risk of completion does not exist.


	Developed
	technology, trade names and customer relationships will be amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.


	Deferred tax liability


	The Company has recorded a deferred tax liability for the difference between the book and tax basis of the intangible assets.

	Hologram Acquisition



	In
	May 2016, the Company formed a wholly owned subsidiary Hologram USA Productions Inc. (Hologram) as a vehicle to enter into a transaction with HUSA Development Inc. (HUSA), a company owned by the majority shareholder of the
	Company. Hologram acquired the net assets and liabilities of HUSAs Holographic Projection System installation business (the Business), which constitute a business, as defined by ASC 805. The Business relates to the use of certain
	technology for projecting hologram images. The Business installs the projection equipment, on a permanent basis, in facilities that desire the ability to project hologram content. The purchase price is equal to the equity investment of the Business,
	as defined by USGAAP. The purchase price is approximately $1,530,000, as follows (in thousands):

	The purchase price is due and payable within thirty-six months from May 11, 2016. Since the transaction is between
	entities under common control, the Company accounted for the transaction on a predecessor basis and, as such, the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2015 have been revised to represent the new business on a pooling of interest
	basis to include the Business from its date of inception in November 2015.

	In conjunction with the acquisition of the Business, Hologram and HUSA have entered into an exclusive distribution agreement
	for Hologram to control the sales, licensing, distribution and other commercial exploitation of holograms owned by HUSA. The term of the distribution agreement is five years, with successive one-year extensions unless written notice of termination
	by either party. The parties will share, in equal proportion, the net revenues from all exploitation of the holograms. Net revenues is defined as the gross revenue less all direct costs and expenses incurred by Hologram in the distribution and
	commercial exploitation of the holograms.



	Sale of asset the Sky Channel



	In May 2016, the Company sold its Sky Channel (Channel) to unrelated third party for approximately $430,000. The sales price of $430,000 was paid
	in-full upon transfer of the Channel.




	Note 3  Related Parties




	During the normal course of business, the Group enters into various transactions with both Anakando Limited and other related parties whereby the Company or
	the related parties pay expense on behalf of the other company. As of June 30, 2016, the net balance due from the related parties (ETV, Inc., Hologram USA Production Inc., Alki David Productions, Inc. and Hologram USA, Inc.) was approximately

	Note 4  Stockholders Equity




	For the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, the Director contributed $2,151,000 and $7,241,000, respectively, to fund the Companys operating
	deficits. The Company issued to the Director 268,882 and 904,980 shares, respectively, of the Companys common stock at a value of $8.00 per share as settlement for the contribution.



	Stock Options



	In conjunction with the acquisition of
	OVG, the Company was required to issue stock options to purchase 5,620,500 shares of the Companys common stock (Options). The Options were issued to the OVG employees who held OVG stock option that were vested and in-the-money at
	the date of the acquisition. The Options have an exercise price of $2.0503, expire three months from the date the employee terminates employment with the Company. The Options shall vest 50% on the six-month anniversary of the Closing, and the
	remaining 50% shall vest in equal monthly installments over the six months thereafter. As of June 30, 2016, none of the options were vested, the weighted average fair value was approximately $0.21 per option for a total aggregate fair value of
	approximately $1,162,000. Of the total aggregate fair value approximately $903,000 was attributed to pre-acquisition cost with the remaining $259,000 relating to post acquisition cost. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, the

	Issuance of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock



	On May 2, 2016, we received gross proceeds of approximately $2,214,000, or $1,928,000 after issuance cost of approximately $286,000, from a private
	placement of our series A convertible preferred stock (the 2016 Private Placement), convertible into 345,997 shares of our common stock, and warrants to purchase 51,894 shares of common stock, pursuant to the terms of a Securities
	Purchase Agreement with a small number of accredited investors. We subsequently received on June 24, 2016, an additional $226,000 in gross proceeds, or $185,000 after issuance cost of approximately $41,000, from the sale of our series A
	preferred stock, convertible into 35,250 shares of our common stock, and warrants to purchase 5,287 shares of common stock, in a second closing of the 2016 Private Placement. The series A preferred stock is convertible into shares of common stock
	automatically upon the closing of our pending initial public offering. The conversion price of the series A preferred stock is $6.40 per share, representing a 20% discount to the initial public offering price per share in our pending initial
	offering. The conversion price is subject to adjustment if at any time during the period commencing on the closing date of our pending initial offering and ending on the first anniversary of that date, we issue in a financing additional shares of
	common stock or other equity or equity linked securities that exceed an aggregate of 10,000 shares at a purchase, conversion or exercise price less than $6.40 per share. In any such case, we have agreed to issue additional shares of common stock to
	the investors so that the effective purchase price per share in the 2016 Private Placement is the same per share purchase, conversion or exercise price of such additional shares. The Companys management has evaluated this provision and
	determined the provision to be a free-standing derivate instrument in accordance with ASC 815 - Derivatives and Hedging. As such, the Company will fair value the instrument, each reporting period, with the fair value adjustment to the
	statement of operations. At issuance date the fair value of the derivative was $nil, and at June 30, 2016, the fair value of the derivative was also estimated by management to be $nil.

	Note 5  Business Segments and Geographic Information




	Following the acquisition of CinemaNow on December 28, 2015, OVG on February 29, 2016 and Hologram on May 11, 2016, the Company now operates and
	internally manages four distinct operating segments. The reportable segments are each managed separately because they operate and manage distinct products with different revenue models.



	FOTV



	FOTV operates an internet-based IPTV platform
	serving video streams monthly to a global audience who watch the Companys live programming, linear channels, and on demand movies, documentaries, podcasts, music videos and social TV services. The Companys programming reaches satellite
	audiences via DISH Network in the US, and FreeSat in Europe.



	CinemaNow



	CinemaNow is an over-the-top provider that enables transactional digital storefronts across multiple territories by managing the entire content supply chain
	from licensing to encoding, storage, delivery and commerce reporting.



	OVG



	OVG is the comprehensive guide that facilitates the discovery, and consumption, of online video. OVG cross platform service has millions of monthly users
	globally across desktop, mobile web, iOS, Android and Roku. The OVG portal provides millions of ad supported videos across over 20 categories, but is focused on Movies and TV shows. OVG provides this service with a robust, automated, cloud based
	infrastructure that includes a comprehensive OTT data set, a streaming video platform that supports OVG and third party applications, and proprietary tagging technology. Since the acquisition of CinemaNow was recorded as of December 31, 2015
	and OVG was recorded as of February 29, 2016, all operating activity for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 are a result of the FOTV segment.



	Hologram



	Hologram uses patented technology for the
	projecting of hologram images. Hologram will enter into contracts with theaters owners (Theaters) to install the projection equipment, on a permanent basis, in Theaters that desire the ability to project hologram content. Hologram is
	responsible for the maintaining the installed equipment and providing the Theaters with hologram content. The Hologram and the Theaters will share equally in the box office receipts for the showing of the hologram content. As of June 30, 2016,
	Hologram has not in entered into an agreement with a Theater. Currently, Hologram is creating its own theater in Hollywood, California. Hologram has entered into an agreement to lease a theater and is renovating and installing the projection
	technology.


	The reportable operations by segment are as follows for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, in thousands:

	Company History



	In 2007, Alkiviades (Alki) David, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of our company, formed FilmOn TV UK Ltd. (formerly known as
	FilmOn.com Plc) in the United Kingdom. Through FilmOn TV UK Ltd., he began amassing digital video content and streaming it over the internet. In September 2010, Mr. David brought the FilmOn concept to the United States, establishing multiple
	FilmOn entities for the creation, collection and distribution of digital video content. He also established operations in Beverly Hills, California. In September 2011, Mr. David formed FilmOn.TV Networks Inc. in Delaware. He used FilmOn.TV
	Networks Inc. as the United States holding company for the United States-based FilmOn entities and operations he had established. In August 2012, as part of a reorganization of the FilmOn group of companies, FilmOn.TV Networks Inc. acquired FilmOn
	TV UK Ltd. in a stock-for-stock exchange in which FilmOn.TV Networks Inc. became the holding company for all the United Kingdom -based FilmOn operations. In August 2015, pursuant to a further reorganization, all of the other United States FilmOn
	entities consolidated under FilmOn.TV Networks Inc.


	Expanding thereafter in the United States, in December 2015, we acquired 100% of the
	membership interests of CinemaNow, LLC through our acquisition of its parent holding company Reliance Majestic Holdings, LLC and, in February 2016, we acquired 100% ownership of OVGuide Inc. through the merger of our newly-formed, wholly-owned
	subsidiary with and into OVGuide. Following the acquisitions, we changed our corporate name to FOTV Media Networks Inc. from FilmOn.TV Networks Inc. to reflect our broader media focus and transferred all of our contracts, assets and properties
	relating to our historical FilmOn.TV Networks operations to a separate newly-formed subsidiary that we named FilmOn.TV Networks Inc. In April 2016, we formed a wholly owned subsidiary, Hologram USA FOTV Productions Inc. , as a vehicle to acquire the
	holographic projection system installation business of HUSA, a company affiliated with Mr. David. The following chart reflects the current corporate structure of our key operating units:

	In 2007, Alkiviades (Alki) David, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of our company, formed
	FilmOn TV UK Ltd. (formerly known as 111PIX Ltd.) in the United Kingdom. Through FilmOn TV UK Ltd., he began amassing digital video content and streaming it over the internet. In September 2010, Mr. David brought the FilmOn concept to the
	United States, establishing multiple FilmOn entities for the creation, collection and distribution of digital video content. He also established operations in Beverly Hills, California. In September 2011, Mr. David formed FilmOn.TV Networks
	Inc. in Delaware. He used FilmOn.TV Networks Inc. as the United States holding company for the United States-based FilmOn entities and operations he had established. In August 2012, as part of a reorganization of the FilmOn group of companies,
	FilmOn.TV Networks Inc. acquired FilmOn TV UK Ltd. in a stock-for-stock exchange in which FilmOn.TV Networks Inc. became the holding company for all the UK-based FilmOn operations. In August 2015, pursuant to a further reorganization, all of the
	other U.S. FilmOn entities consolidated under FilmOn.TV Networks Inc.


	Expanding thereafter in the United States, in December 2015, we
	acquired 100% of the membership interests of CinemaNow, LLC through our acquisition of its parent holding company Reliance Majestic Holdings, LLC and, in March 2016, we acquired 100% ownership of OVGuide.com, Inc. through the merger of our
	newly-formed, wholly-owned subsidiary with and into OVGuide. Following the acquisitions, we changed our corporate name to FOTV Media Networks Inc. from FilmOn.TV Networks Inc. to reflect our broader media focus and transferred all of our

	Revenue Model



	Currently, the majority of our content is free, and our business model can presently be characterized as freemium, meaning that our
	content is largely advertising supported and is available to be watched at no cost. We also offer premium subscription-based video content. For a fee ranging from $9.99 to $19.99 per month (depending on the amount of digital video recording storage
	space selected), premium subscribers have access to our premium channels, pay-per-view specials, special live events (e.g., boxing and music concerts), an HD quality signal for all channels (where available), no advertising and the ability to record
	a set number of hours of programs. Free viewers are entitled to only an SD quality signal. In addition, we offer transactional VOD (pay-per-view, as well as digital video purchases) viewing that allows users to purchase or rent only the digital
	video content that they wish to own or view for a limited time.


	Our FilmOn and CinemaNow platforms are customizable for affiliate partner
	video services and white label opportunities, and we have a team of platform developers who are constantly upgrading and customizing our video service platforms. These platforms may be licensed to third parties at market rates. Additionally, in
	August 2012, we entered into a strategic alliance with a subsidiary of Lenovo Group Ltd., the worlds largest personal computer vendor by unit sales, to preload the FilmOn app on Lenovo products.


	We have to date financed our operations through equity investments and loans made through Anakando Ltd., which is owned by Alkiviades (Alki)
	David, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and affiliated companies and with the net proceeds of our recent private placement. As of the initial closing of this offering, all related party notes payable and stockholder advances reflected in
	our consolidated financial statements will be converted to equity as additional paid-in capital and we will have no outstanding indebtedness. See Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions.

	The largest portion of our revenue is derived from pre-roll video and display advertising and streaming
	(Advertising Revenue) and rental of video assets (Transactional Revenue), from our acquisition of CinemaNow, which accounted for 27% and 32%, respectively, of total revenue during the three months ended June 30, 2016.


	Of our 2016 Advertising Revenue, $379,000, or 54% was derived from the acquisition of OVG. The remaining 2016 Adverting Revenue of
	$323,000 decreased by $4,088,000, from the same period in 2015. The primary decrease in Advertising Revenue was driven by the ramp-up of advertising network relationships for the sale of video pre-roll ad inserts and our shift away from selling
	print display ads that have a significantly lower revenue yield than video ads. While our ad inventory available to be sold to advertisers decreased significantly, the percentage sell-through rate, which is the rate at which we are able to sell our
	total available video ad opportunities, increased in large measure due to the migration of our advertising sales operations from our United Kingdom office to our United States office. The sell-through rate increased to 23.7% in 2016 from 7.05% in
	2015, even though our sell-through rate increased the absolute number of ad impressions sold decreased significantly resulting in the decrease in revenue realized for the three months ended June 30, 2016 when compared to the same period in
	2015.


	Transactional Revenue is derived from the delivery of the CinemaNow titles. For the three months ended June 30, 2016,
	Transactional Revenue of $835,000 was derived from a total 116,634 customers who transacted 306,963 titles consisting of 164,278 purchased titles and 142,685 rented titles. 55% of customers were newly registered users for the three months while the
	average transaction total per customer was 2.63 titles for the period.


	Affiliate revenues are generated by OVG referring its users, based
	on the content they are searching for or browsing, to various third party paid services at which the user executes some transaction. The affiliate fees are one time fees, or a percentage of lifetime revenue, for any subscriber who
	signs up for a subscription video on demand (SVOD) service, or a percentage of the rental or purchase fee on a transactional video on demand (TVOD) or ecommerce service. The majority of affiliate revenues are earned through users of
	the website and mobile website, with a small portion also coming from iOS and Android applications. The majority of reporting for this revenue comes from third party dashboards, since all of the tracking and transaction confirmation data comes from
	the third party service.


	Our paid subscriber base revenue for the three months ended June 30, 2016 increased to $169,000, or 44% when
	compared to the same period in 2015. Also, the average number of DVR hours contracted per month by subscribers for the three months ended June 30, 2016 grew to an average of 3,013, or 20%, from an average of 2,507 hours per month for the same
	period in 2015, indicating an increase in subscriber loyalty and viewership of our content.


	Our white labeling revenue is attributable to
	our acquisition of CinemaNow, which accounted for 14% of our total revenue for the three months ended June 30, 2016. During the three months ended June 30, 2016, the Company was providing white labeling services to three customers.

	Table of Contents



	During the first quarter of 2016, the Company engaged in sponsorship activities. For the three
	months ended June 30, 2016, sponsorship revenue of approximately $154,000 was from three customers each related to three separate productions.




	Cost of Revenues




	Cost of revenues consists primarily of the costs associated with the operations of our websites, services and CinemaNows movie rental
	royalties owed to the licensor major studio. The operational costs consist of the delivery of CinemaNow titles and the operation FilmOn and OVG websites and services, namely datacenter and bandwidth costs and traffic acquisition costs. Our cost of
	revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2016 decreased to $2,931,000, down 12% from $3,341,000 for the same period in 2015. The decrease was a result of additional cost of $1,458,000 from our acquisition of CinemaNow and OVG offset by
	a $1,867,000 decrease in FilmOns cost of revenues due to our decreased advertising spending.







	Operating Expenses






	Platform Technology and Development Expenses




	Our technology and website maintenance expenses consist primarily of labor and related costs to maintain our websites and streaming
	infrastructure. Technology and website maintenance expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2016 increased to $739,000, or 96%, from $377,000 for the same period in 2015. The increase was attributable to the additional maintenance
	associated with the websites purchased from the acquisitions of CinemaNow and OVG.




	Depreciation and Amortization Expenses




	Depreciation expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2016 increased to $1,402,000, an increase of 314%, from $339,000
	for the same period in 2015. The increase was attributable to amortization expense resulting from the intangible assets purchased from the acquisitions of CinemaNow and OVG.




	General and Administrative Expenses




	General and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation-related expenses (including stock-based compensation expense) related to
	corporate departments and fees for professional services and includes costs related to our non-data center facilities and sales operations. General and administrative expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2016 increased to $4,216,000, an
	increase of 68%, from $2,504,000 for the same period in 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to the acquisition of CinemaNow, OVG and Hologram, which accounted for $1,614,000 of the increase. Also, we expanded our headquarters office space
	in Beverly Hills, with the addition of a Hologram demo facility and we had additional legal and professional fees related to our audits and public offering.




	Other Income




	Other income for the three months ended June 30, 2016 was derived from the sale of the Companys cable channel Sky EPG in the United
	Kingdom.

	The largest portion of our revenue is derived from Advertising Revenue and Transactional, from our acquisition
	of CinemaNow, which accounted for 35% and 34%, respectively, of total revenue during the six months ended June 30, 2016.

	Table of Contents



	Of our 2016 Advertising Revenue, $512,000, or 24% was derived from the acquisition of OVG. The
	remaining 2016 Adverting Revenue of $1,595,000 decreased by $4,871,000 for the same period in 2015. The primary decrease in Advertising Revenue was driven by the ramp-up of advertising network relationships for the sale of video pre-roll ad inserts
	and our shift away from selling print display ads that have a significantly lower revenue yield than video ads. While our ad inventory available to be sold to advertisers decreased significantly, the percentage sell-through rate, which is the rate
	at which we are able to sell our total available video ad opportunities, increased in large measure due to the migration of our advertising sales operations from our United Kingdom office to our United States office. The sell-through rate increased
	to 12.4% in 2016 from 5.0% in 2015, even though our sell-through rate increased the absolute number of ad impressions sold decreased significantly resulting in the decrease in revenue realized for the six months ended June 30, 2016 when
	compared to the same period in 2015.


	Transactional Revenue is derived from the delivery of the CinemaNow titles. For the six months ended
	June 30, 2016, Transactional Revenue of $2,060,000 was derived from a total 197,579 customers who transacted 617,313 titles consisting of 273,194 purchased titles and 344,119 rented titles. 60% of customers were newly registered users for
	the six months while the average transaction total per customer was 3.12 titles for the period.


	Affiliate revenues are generated by OVG
	referring its users, based on the content they are searching for or browsing, to various third party paid services at which the user executes some transaction. The affiliate fees are one time fees, or a percentage of lifetime revenue, for
	any subscriber who signs up for a subscription video on demand (SVOD) service, or a percentage of the rental or purchase fee on a transactional video on demand (TVOD) or ecommerce service. The majority of affiliate revenues are
	earned through users of the website and mobile website, with a small portion also coming from iOS and Android applications. The majority of reporting for this revenue comes from third party dashboards, since all of the tracking and transaction
	confirmation data comes from the third party service.


	Our paid subscriber base for the six months ended June 30, 2016 increased to
	$358,000, or 20% when compared to the same period in 2015. Also, the average number of DVR hours contracted per month by subscribers for the six months ended June 30, 2016 grew to an average of 3,043 hours, or 25%, from an average of 2,430
	hours per month for the same period on 2015, indicating an increase in subscriber loyalty and viewership of our content.


	Our storefront
	revenue is attributable to our acquisition of CinemaNow, which accounted for 14% of our total revenue for the three months ended June 30, 2016. During the six months ended June 30, 2016, the Company was providing white label service to
	three customers.


	During the first quarter of 2016, the Company engaged in sponsorship activities. For the six months ended June 30,
	2016, sponsorship revenue of approximately $230,000 was from three customers each related to three separate productions.




	Cost of
	Revenues




	Cost of revenues consists primarily of the costs associated with the operations of our websites, services and
	CinemaNows movie rental royalties owed to the licensor major studio. The operational costs consist of the delivery of CinemaNow titles and the use of the FilmOn and OVG services, namely datacenter and bandwidth costs and traffic acquisition
	costs. Our cost of revenues for the six months ended June, 30, 2016 increased to $6,795,000, up 14% from $5,969,000 for the same period in 2015. The increase was a result of an additional cost of $3,112,000 from our acquisition of CinemaNow and OVG
	offset by a $2,286,000 decrease in FilmOns cost of revenues due to our decreased advertising spending.




	Operating Expenses






	Platform Technology and Development Expenses




	Our technology and website maintenance expenses consist primarily of labor and related costs to maintain our websites and streaming
	infrastructure. Technology and website maintenance expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2016 increased to $1,274,000, up 65% from $773,000 for the same period in 2015. The increase is attributable to the additional maintenance associated
	with the websites purchased from the acquisitions of CinemaNow and OVG.

	Depreciation Expenses




	Depreciation expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2016 increased to $2,569,000, an increase of 271%, from $692,000 for the same
	period in 2015. The increase was attributable to amortization expense resulting from the intangible assets purchased from the acquisitions of CinemaNow and OVG.




	General and Administrative Expenses




	General and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation-related expenses (including stock-based compensation expense) related to
	corporate departments and fees for professional services and includes costs related to our non-data center facilities, and sales operations. General and administrative expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2016 increased to $8,225,000, an
	increase of 66% from $4,966,000 for the same period of 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to the acquisition of CinemaNow, OVG and Hologram, which accounted for $2,827,000 of the increase. Also, we expanded our headquarters office space
	in Beverly Hills, with the addition of a Hologram demo facility and we had additional legal and professional fees related to our audits and public offering.




	Other Income




	Other income for the six months ended June 30, 2016 was derived from the sale of the Companys cable channel Sky EPG in the United
	Kingdom.






	Liquidity and Capital Resources



	Anakando Ltd., directly and through equity investments and loans made by its sole shareholder Alkiviades (Alki) David, our Chairman and Chief
	Executive Officer, and affiliated companies have financed substantially all of the development and operations of our company to date.




	2016 Preferred Stock, Private Placements and Common Stock Subscriptions




	On May 2, 2016, we received gross proceeds of $2,214,394 from a private placement of our series A preferred stock (the 2016
	Private Placement), convertible into 345,997 shares of our common stock, and warrants to purchase 51,894 shares of common stock, pursuant to the terms of a Securities Purchase Agreement with a small number of accredited investors. We
	subsequently received on June 24, 2016, an additional $225,600 in gross proceeds from the sale of our series A preferred stock, convertible into 35,250 shares of our common stock, and warrants to purchase 5,287 shares of common stock, in a
	second closing of the 2016 Private Placement. The proceeds from the sale of the series A preferred stock and warrants are being used by us for working capital and general corporate purposes, including payment of transaction costs and related fees.


	Our series A preferred stock is convertible into shares of common stock automatically upon the initial closing of our pending initial
	public offering. The conversion price of the series A preferred stock is $6.40 per share, representing a 20% discount to the initial public offering price per share in our pending initial public offering. The conversion price is subject to
	adjustment if at any time during the period commencing on the closing date of our pending initial public offering and ending on the first anniversary of that date, we issue in a financing additional shares of common stock or other equity or
	equity-linked securities that exceed an aggregate of 10,000 shares at a purchase, conversion or exercise price less than $6.40 per share. In any such case, we have agreed to issue additional shares of common stock to the investors so that the
	effective purchase price per share in the 2016 Private Placement is the same per share purchase, conversion or exercise price of such additional shares. No adjustment will be made, however, in respect of shares of common stock or stock options
	issued to employees, directors or consultants at the then fair market value, or in connection with acquisitions of other entities, not to exceed 10% of the shares then outstanding on a fully-diluted basis, or that would require us to take any action
	that violates the rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC. Each investor was issued, for no additional consideration, a three-year warrant to purchase a number of shares of our common stock as was equal to 15% of the number of shares into which the
	series A preferred stock purchased is convertible. The warrants are exercisable commencing upon the closing date of our pending initial public offering. The warrants have an exercise price equal to $8.00 per share, the pending initial public
	offering price per share in our initial public offering.

	Table of Contents



	We agreed to provide the investors with piggyback registration rights with respect to
	the resale of the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the series A preferred stock and exercise of the warrants in a future registration statement under the Securities Act, subject to limitations on the investors shares that may
	be imposed by the underwriter of a public offering. In connection with our 2016 Private Placement, the investors entered into lock-up agreements with us that prohibit those investors from, directly or indirectly, offering, selling, pledging or
	otherwise transferring or disposing of any of the shares of our common stock underlying the series A preferred stock for a period of six months following the closing date of our pending initial public offering. Bonwick Capital Partners LLC
	served as placement agent in connection with our 2016 Private Placement. The placement agent and its subagents received an aggregate of $117,364 in sales commissions, plus warrants to purchase 26,681 shares of our common stock at an exercise price
	of $8.00 per share.


	During the three months ended March 31, 2016, our majority shareholder, Anakando Ltd., provided us with
	$5,089,000 in cash, to fund our operating activities, in exchange for an aggregate of 636,098 shares of our common stock, at a price of $8.00 per share. For the three months ended June 30, 2016, Anakando Ltd. provided us with $2,152,000 in
	cash to fund our operations, in exchange for an aggregate of 268,882 shares of our common stock, at a price of $ 8.00 per share.




	Cash and Cash Equivalents




	As of June 30, 2016, we had $473,000 in cash and cash equivalents, compared to $659,000 as of December 31, 2015, and a working

	Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates



	This discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our interim unaudited condensed consolidated
	financial statements, which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Certain accounting policies are particularly important to the understanding of our financial positions and
	results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management or can be materially affected by changes from period to period in economic factors or conditions that are outside of our control. As a result, they are
	subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. In applying these policies, management uses their judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates. Those estimates are based on our historical
	operations, our future business plans and projected financial results, the terms of existing contracts, observance of trends in the industry, information provided by our customers, and information available from other outside sources, as
	appropriate. For information regarding the Companys critical accounting policies as well as recent accounting pronouncements, see Note 1 to the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended December 31,
	2015 included in our final prospectus dated August 12, 2016 contained in our registration statement on Form S-1.




	Results of
	Operations




	The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and the
	related notes included in this report.




	Use of Estimates




	Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which
	require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates.


	On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including the following:


	 




	 


	


	 


	the useful lives of property and equipment and intangible assets;




	 




	 


	


	 


	fair value of our common stock used to determine compensation expense for the issuance of for services service-based restricted stock awards; assumptions used in determining the need for, and amount of, a valuation
	allowance on net deferred tax assets; and




	 




	 


	


	 


	film cost amortization.




	We base our estimates on historical experience, available market
	information, appropriate valuation methodologies, and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.

	Going Concern




	We have experienced net losses and significant cash used in operating activities since our inception and as of June 30, 2016, had an
	accumulated deficit of approximately $70 million, a net loss of approximately $12.5 million and net cash used in operating activities of approximately $7.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016. Our management expects us
	to continue to incur net losses and have significant cash outflows for at least the next twelve months. These conditions, among others, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The condensed consolidated financial
	statements included this filing have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern. This basis of accounting contemplates the recovery of our assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. A successful
	transition to attaining profitable operations is dependent upon achieving a level of positive cash flows adequate to support our cost structure.


	As at June 30, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $0.5 million, compared to $0.7 million at the beginning of the
	year. During the six months ended June 30, 2016, we received approximately $2.1 million for the issuance of our series A convertible preferred stock and we received approximately $7.2 million from our majority shareholder for the issuance of
	our common stock.




	Goodwill




	Goodwill is not subject to amortization and is tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that
	impairment may have occurred. Management has established the last day of its year end as the date of our annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment assessment. Impairment testing is performed for each of our reporting units. We
	compare the carrying value of a reporting unit, including goodwill, to the fair value of the unit. Carrying value is based on the assets and liabilities associated with the operations of that reporting unit, which often requires allocation of shared
	or corporate items among reporting units. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we revalue all assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, excluding goodwill, to determine if the fair value of the net assets is greater
	than the net assets including goodwill. If the fair value of the net assets is less than the carrying amount of net assets including goodwill, impairment has occurred. Our estimates of fair value are determined based on a discounted cash flow
	model. Growth rates for sales and profits are determined using inputs from our long-range planning process. We also make estimates of discount rates, perpetuity growth assumptions, market comparables, and other factors.




	Intangible Assets and Film Library Costs




	Film library costs include capitalizable production costs, production overhead and cost of acquired film libraries and are stated at the
	lower of cost less accumulated amortization. Marketing, distribution and general and administrative costs are expensed as incurred. For acquired film libraries, remaining revenues include amounts to be earned for up to ten years from the date of
	acquisition. Costs of film library are subject to regular recoverability assessments, which compare the estimated fair values with the unamortized costs. The Company bases these fair value measurements on the Companys assumptions about how
	market participants would price the asset at the balance sheet date, which may be different than the amounts ultimately realized in future periods.


	The amount by which the unamortized costs of film library exceed their estimated fair values is written off. Film library costs for projects
	that have been abandoned or have not been set for production within three years are generally written off. Management has determined that film library cost will be expensed using the straight-line basis over an estimated period of 15 years.




	Impairment of Long-Lived Assets




	We evaluate impairment losses on long-lived assets used in operations when events and changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might
	be impaired. If our review indicates that the carrying value of an asset will not be recoverable, based on a comparison of the carrying value of the asset to the undiscounted future cash flows, the impairment will be measured by comparing the
	carrying value of the asset to its fair value. Fair value will be determined based on quoted market values, discounted cash flows or appraisals. Impairments of property and equipment are recorded in the statement of operations as part of
	depreciation expense. As of December 31, 2015 and June 30, 2016, there were no impairment losses of long-lived assets.

	Revenue Recognition




	We have six revenue streams: advertising-supported video streaming, subscriber, video on demand purchase and rental transactions, affiliate
	revenues, storefront and sponsorship revenue. Revenues are derived from video advertising impressions served, monthly premium subscription packages and fees paid upon the purchase or rental of titles on demand.


	We recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned. We consider revenue realized or realizable and earned when all of the
	following criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) the product has been shipped or the services have been rendered to the customer, (iii) the sales price is fixed or determinable, and
	(iv) collectability is reasonably assured.


	Advertising supported video streaming revenues, net of agency commissions, are recognized
	in the period during which underlying advertisements are broadcast or published.


	Subscription revenues are recognized ratably over the
	membership period. Revenues are presented net of the taxes that are collected from members and remitted to governmental authorities. Deferred revenue consists of membership fees billed to members that have not been recognized.


	Transactional VOD revenues are recognized at the time pay-per-view or video on demand transactions are made by viewers for each individual
	title purchased or rented.




	Business combinations




	We account for acquisitions of entities that include inputs and processes and have the ability to create outputs as business combinations. The
	purchase price of the acquisition is allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition dates. The excess of the purchase price over those fair values
	is recorded as goodwill. To the extent the fair value of net assets acquired, including other identifiable assets, exceeds the purchase price, a bargain purchase gain is recognized immediately. During the measurement period, which may be up to one
	year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired
	or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to the consolidated statements of operations.


	Accounting for business combinations requires significant estimates and assumptions at the acquisition date, including estimated fair value of
	acquired intangible assets, estimated income tax assets and liabilities assumed, and determination of the fair value of contractual obligations, where applicable. Significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not
	limited to, future expected cash flows from acquired users and customers, acquired technology, and trade names from a market participant perspective, useful lives, and discount rates. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in
	the past have been reasonable and appropriate, these estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and inherently uncertain.


	For the acquisition of business under common control we account for them as a business combination under a method similar to the
	pooling-of-interest method (Pooling-of-Interest) In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 805-50-25, the financial statements of the group shall report results of operations for the period in which the
	transfer occurs as though the transfer of net assets or exchange of equity interests had occurred at the beginning of the period. Results of operations for that period will thus comprise those of the previously separate entities combined from the
	beginning of the period to the date the transfer is completed and those of the combined operations from that date to the end of the period.

	Income Taxes




	We are subject to income taxes in both the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions, specifically the U.K. Significant judgment is required in evaluating
	our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. During the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. For example, our effective tax rate could
	be adversely affected by differences between our anticipated and the actual mix of earnings generated across different tax jurisdictions which have higher or lower statutory tax rates, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and
	liabilities, by changes in foreign currency exchange rates or by changes in the relevant tax, accounting and other laws, regulations, principles and interpretations. We record income taxes under the liability method. Deferred tax assets and
	liabilities reflect our estimation of the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for book and tax purposes. We determine deferred income taxes based on the differences in
	accounting methods and timing between consolidated financial statement and income tax reporting. Accordingly, we determine the deferred tax asset or liability for each temporary difference based on the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when
	we realize the underlying items of income and expense. We consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets, including our recent earnings experience by jurisdiction, expectations of future taxable
	income, and the carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes, as well as other relevant factors. We may establish a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized.
	Due to inherent complexities arising from the nature of our businesses, future changes in income tax law, tax sharing agreements or variances between our actual and anticipated operating results, we make certain judgments and estimates. Therefore,
	actual income taxes could materially vary from these estimates.


	We recognize in the consolidated financial statements the impact of a tax
	position, if that position is more likely than not to be sustained upon an examination, based on the technical merits of the position. The Company records a liability for the difference between the benefit recognized and measured and the tax
	position taken or expected to be taken on the Companys tax return. To the extent that the assessment of such tax positions changes, the change in estimate is recorded in the period in which the determination is made. To the extent
	interest and penalties are not assessed with respect to uncertain tax positions, amounts accrued will be reduced and reflected as a reduction of the overall income tax provision. The Company did not incur or need to record any liability, interest
	and penalties during the years ended December 31, 2015 and the six months ended June 30, 2016. We are subject to audit in various jurisdictions, and such jurisdictions may assess additional income taxes against us. Although we believe our
	tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of any tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect
	on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made.



	Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements



	We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition,
	revenues, results of operations, liquidity or capital expenditures.



	Seasonality



	Our revenues and results of operations have fluctuated in the past, and will likely continue to fluctuate, on a quarterly basis.
	Such fluctuations are the result of a seasonal pattern that reflects variations in consumer purchasing habits. When consumers buy internet-connected devices, they tend to increase their viewership of digital media, including general video
	streaming services. Our subscriber growth is generally greatest during the fourth and first quarters (October through March), and slowest during the second and third quarters (May through August).



	Impact of Inflation



	We believe that
	inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations for three months ended June 30, 2016. We cannot assure you that future inflation will not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition.

	Recent Accounting Pronouncements



	In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU)

	2014-09,


	 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).

	 This ASU is a comprehensive new revenue recognition model that requires a company to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or
	services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In August 2015, FASB issued ASU 2015-14,

	Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the
	Effective Date

	, which deferred the effective date of ASU 2014-09 to reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company will adopt this
	ASU on January 1, 2018. Companies may use either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach to adopt this ASU. Management is currently evaluating this standard, including which transition approach to use, and does not expect this
	ASU to materially impact our consolidated net income, financial position or cash flows.


	In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15,
	Presentation of Financial Statements  Going Concern. The guidance in this update applies to all entities and require their management to assess the entitys ability to continue as a going concern by incorporating and expanding upon
	certain principles that are currently in United States auditing standards. Specifically, the update (1) provides a definition of the term substantial doubt, (2) requires an evaluation every reporting period including interim periods,
	(3) provides principles for considering the mitigating effect of managements plans, (4) requires certain disclosures when substantial doubt is alleviated as a result of consideration of managements plans, (5) requires an
	express statement and other disclosures when substantial doubt is not alleviated, and (6) requires an assessment for a period of one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued). The update will be
	effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016 and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. Early application is permitted. The amendments of ASU 2014-15, when adopted, are not expected to have a material impact on our
	consolidated financial statements.


	In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11, An entity should measure inventory within the scope of this
	Update at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. Subsequent measurement
	is unchanged for inventory measured using LIFO or the retail inventory method. The amendments in this Update more closely align the measurement of inventory in general accepted accounting principals (GAAP) with the measurement of
	inventory in International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). The Board has amended some of the other guidance in Topic 330 to more clearly articulate the requirements for the measurement and disclosure of inventory. However, the Board does not
	intend for those clarifications to result in any changes in practice. Other than the change in the subsequent measurement guidance from the lower of cost or market to the lower of cost and net realizable value for inventory within the scope
	of this Update, there are no other substantive changes to the guidance on measurement of inventory. For public business entities, the amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including
	interim periods within those fiscal years.


	The amendments in this Update should be applied prospectively with earlier application
	permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. We do not expect these amendments to have a material effect on our financial statements.


	In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-16 (ASC Topic 805), Business Combinations Simplifying the Accounting for
	Measurement-Period Adjustments. The amendments in this update require that an acquirer recognize measurement period adjustments in the period in which the adjustments are determined. The income effects of such measurement period adjustments are to
	be recorded in the same periods financial statements but calculated as if the accounting had been completed as of the acquisition date. The impact of measurement period adjustments to earnings that relate to prior period financial statements
	are to be presented separately on the income statement or disclosed by line item. The amendments in this update are for fiscal years, including interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is
	permitted for public business entities for reporting periods for which financial statements have not yet been issued. Management has determined that the implementation of this pronouncement does not have a material impact to our consolidated
	operations, financial position or cashflows.


	In November 2015, FASB issued ASU 2015-17,

	 Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet
	Classification of Deferred Taxes

	. This ASU requires the presentation of all deferred tax assets and liabilities as non-current in the consolidated balance sheet. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those
	years beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. Management has determined that the implementation of this pronouncement does not have a material impact to our consolidated operations, financial position or cashflows.

	In February 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-02,

	 Leases (Topic 842)

	. FASB issued ASU
	2016-02 to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. Certain qualitative and quantitative disclosures
	are required, as well as a retrospective recognition and measurement of impacted leases. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted.
	Management is currently evaluating this standard.


	In March 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-08,

	 Revenue from Contracts with Customers
	(Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net)

	. The amendments are intended to improve the operability and understandability of the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations. The
	effective date for this ASU is the same as the effective date for ASU 2014-09. Management is currently evaluating this standard.


	In March
	2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-04, 

	Liabilities-Extinguishments of Liabilities (Subtopic 405-20): Recognition of Breakage for Certain Prepaid Stored-Value Products (a consensus of the Emerging Issues Task Force)

	 to
	specify how prepaid stored-value product liabilities should be derecognized. We are required to adopt this standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, but have early adopted this standard during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 as permitted.
	This standard does not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements since we sell prepaid cards for vendors and the liability for the prepaid cards is not reflected on our consolidated balance sheets.


	In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, 

	Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based
	Payment Accounting

	 to provide guidance that changes the accounting for certain aspects of share-based payments to employees. The guidance requires the recognition of the income tax effects of awards in the income statement when the awards
	vest or are settled, thus eliminating additional paid-in capital pools. The guidance also allows for the employer to repurchase more of an employees shares for tax withholding purposes without triggering liability accounting. In addition, the
	guidance allows for a policy election to account for forfeitures as they occur rather than on an estimated basis. We are required to adopt this standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, but have early adopted this standard during the fourth
	quarter of fiscal 2016 as permitted. There was no impact upon adoption of this guidance since the recognition of income tax effects of awards was not materially different than amounts that had previously been recorded in our financial statements and
	we currently use an estimated average forfeiture rate to compute stock-based compensation expense.

	QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK





	We are a smaller reporting

	CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES






	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures



	Our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer (CEO) and principal financial and accounting officer
	(PFAO), has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q. Based on this evaluation, our
	CEO and PFAO concluded that, because of certain material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act were not effective as of
	June 30, 2016.


	We did not maintain effective controls over certain aspects of the financial reporting process because we lacked a
	sufficient complement of personnel with a level of accounting expertise and an adequate supervisory review structure that is commensurate with our financial reporting requirements. In addition, there was inadequate segregation of duties due to the
	limitation on the number of our accounting personnel.


	 


	20






	Table of Contents



	We intend to take appropriate and reasonable steps to make the necessary improvements to
	remediate these deficiencies. However, due to our size and nature, segregation of all conflicting duties has not always been possible and may not be economically feasible.



	Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting



	For the quarter ended June 30, 2016, there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that has materially
	affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.









	PART
	II  OTHER INFORMATION








	Item 1. Legal Proceedings



	From time to time, during the normal course of our business, we are subject to various litigation claims and legal disputes most significantly
	in the areas of intellectual property (e.g., trademarks, copyrights and patents). Our intellectual property rights extend to our technology, business processes and the content on our website. We use the intellectual property of third parties in
	marketing and providing our service through contractual and other rights. Despite our efforts, from time to time, third parties have alleged, and may in the future allege, that we have violated their intellectual property rights.


	We are currently parties to multiple lawsuits related to our products and services, including copyright infringement lawsuits brought by
	content broadcasters and intellectual property rights-holders, and we may in the future be subject to additional such lawsuits and disputes.


	CBS Broadcasting Inc., NBC Studios LLC, Universal Network Television, LLC, NBC Subsidiary (KNBC-TV) LLC, Twentieth Century Fox Film
	Corporation, Fox Television Stations, Inc., ABC Holding Company Inc., and Disney Enterprises, Inc. filed suit against us on or about October 1, 2010 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. CBS Studios Inc.,
	Big Ticket Television, Inc., Open 4 Business Productions LLC, and American Broadcasting Companies, Inc. later joined as plaintiffs against us in the case. The plaintiffs claim that we streamed their broadcast content over the internet in violation
	of their intellectual property rights. We settled this case and entered into a Stipulated Consent Judgment and Permanent Injunction filed August 9, 2012 pursuant to which we agreed, among other things, to be permanently enjoined from infringing
	plaintiffs exclusive intellectual property rights to their broadcast content, including by streaming plaintiffs broadcast television programming over the internet. We subsequently developed and deployed a new technology to stream
	broadcast television programming that we believed complied with then-existing Second Circuit law. The New York district court disagreed, and on July 24, 2014, the district court held us in civil contempt for purportedly violating the
	August 9, 2012 injunction. On August 14, 2014, the district court entered judgment against us imposing a sanction of $90,000 and directing us to pay plaintiffs attorneys fees as a result of our purported violation of the
	injunction. On March 8, 2016, the three-judge appellate panel of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals issued a mandate affirming the district courts decision. On April 1, 2016, the panel awarded plaintiffs $221.00 in costs. On
	May 16, 2016, FilmOn.com paid a sanctions payment to the Court in the amount of $90,000. It also has made a payment to Plaintiffs to cover attorneys fees and costs in full, after plaintiffs agreed to compromise their claims in that
	regard. Accordingly, the judgment has been satisfied. The parties have filed the Satisfaction of Judgment.

	Fox Television Stations, Inc., Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation, and Fox Broadcasting
	Company, Inc. filed suit against us on or about August 10, 2012 in the United States District Court for the Central District of California for copyright infringement, trademark infringement, and Lanham Act claims. Separately, NBCUniversal
	Media, LLC, Universal Network Television, LLC, NBC Subsidiary (KNBC-TV) LLC, American Broadcasting Companies, Inc., Disney Enterprises, Inc., CBS Broadcasting Inc., and CBS Studios Inc. filed suit against us on or about August 13, 2012 in
	the United States District Court for the Central District of California for copyright infringement. Open 4 Business Productions LLC, Telemundo Network Group LLC, WNJU-TV Broadcasting LLC, ABC Holding Company Inc., and Big Ticket Television, Inc.
	later joined as plaintiffs against us in the case. These two cases were consolidated on September 8, 2014. The plaintiffs claim that we streamed their broadcast content over the internet in violation of their intellectual property rights
	and they seek damages, attorneys fees, and injunctive relief. On December 27, 2012, the district court entered a preliminary injunction temporarily enjoining us from retransmitting or streaming the plaintiffs copyrighted programming
	within the geographic jurisdiction of the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. On September 25, 2014, we amended our counterclaims to assert that we are entitled to a compulsory performance license to retransmit
	plaintiffs broadcast content pursuant to Section 111 of the 1976 Copyright Act. On July 24, 2015, the district court granted partial summary judgment to us on our counterclaim, certified that order for immediate appeal, and stayed
	the remainder of the case pending the outcome of that appeal. In granting partial summary judgment, the district court held that we were potentially entitled to a compulsory license under Section 111 of the Copyright Act, but also that we
	remain potentially liable for non-compliant secondary transmissions. The December 27, 2012 preliminary injunction remains in effect. This case is currently on an interlocutory appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit,
	which agreed to consider whether the cable system compulsory license set forth in 17 U.S.C. Section 111(c) is available to Internet-based retransmission services. On August 4, 2016, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals held oral argument in
	this appeal. The remainder of the case is stayed pending appeal. We intend to continue to defend this case vigorously.


	Fox Television
	Stations, Inc., Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation, Fox Broadcasting Company, NBC Subsidiary

	(WRC-TV)

	LLC, NBC Studios LLC, Universal Network Television LLC, Open 4 Business Productions LLC, Telemundo
	Network Group LLC, American Broadcasting Companies, Inc., Disney Enterprises, Inc., and Allbritton Communications Company filed suit against us on or about May 23, 2013 in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. CBS
	Broadcasting Inc., CBS Studios Inc., and TEGNA Inc. subsequently joined as plaintiffs against us in the case. The plaintiffs claim that we streamed broadcast content over the internet in violation of their intellectual property rights and they seek
	damages, attorneys fees, and injunctive relief. On September 5, 2013, the district court entered a preliminary injunction temporarily enjoining us from retransmitting or streaming the plaintiffs copyrighted programming within the
	United States of America, except for the geographic boundaries of the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. We subsequently asserted a counterclaim that we are entitled to a compulsory performance license to retransmit
	plaintiffs broadcast content pursuant to Section 111 of the 1976 Copyright Act. On June 18, 2015, the plaintiffs filed a motion for summary judgment on their infringement claim and our counterclaim under Section 111 of the 1976
	Copyright Act. On July 9, 2015, we filed a motion for summary judgment on our counterclaim under Section 111 of the 1976 Copyright Act. In December 2015, the plaintiffs motion for partial summary judgment was denied in part and
	granted in part, and our motion for summary judgment was denied and our counterclaim for a compulsory license to retransmit plaintiffs copyrighted programming under Section 111 of the Copyright Act was dismissed. Specifically, the court
	entered judgment as follows: (1) FilmOn X, LLC is liable for infringing Plaintiffs exclusive right of public performance under section 106(4) of the Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. § 106(4); and (2) Defendants counterclaim for
	declaratory relief that they are entitled to a statutory or compulsory license to retransmit Plaintiffs copyrighted programming under Section 111 of the Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C.§ 111, is dismissed. The Plaintiffs motion
	for partial summary judgment on their copyright infringement claims with respect to FilmOn.TV Networks, Inc., FilmOn.TV, Inc., FilmOn.com, Inc. and Alkiviades (Alki) David (our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer) was denied without prejudice. We
	have appealed the Courts entry of partial final judgment on our counterclaim to the District of Columbia Circuit. The district court has ordered that discovery on all remaining issues in the case shall proceed while the appeal is pending.
	Plaintiffs have elected to pursue statutory damages as opposed to actual damages for their claims of copyright infringement. Among other things, the parties are conducting discovery on issues relating to statutory damages, liability for willful
	infringement, and theories of secondary liability including alter ego liability. We intend to continue to defend this case vigorously.


	We
	filed suit against Window to the World Communications, Inc. on or about November 22, 2013 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. In that action, we seek a declaratory judgment that we are entitled to a
	compulsory performance license to retransmit defendants broadcast content pursuant to Section 111 of the 1976 Copyright Act. The defendant counterclaimed alleging that we streamed broadcast content over the internet in violation of its
	intellectual property rights. On May 25, 2016 the Court entered partial final judgment for Window to the World Communications, Inc. on its motion for partial summary judgment and denied our claim for declaratory judgment. Specifically, the
	court ruled that FilmOn X is not entitled to a statutory or compulsory license to retransmit Window to the World Communications, Inc.s copyrighted programming under Section 111 of the Copyright Act. We have appealed the Courts entry
	of partial final judgment on our declaratory relief claim to the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals. The remainder of the case has been stayed while the appeal is pending. We intend to continue to prosecute this case vigorously.

	On August 6, 2015, RMH filed a suit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of
	California against Datapipe, Inc. (Datapipe) for a contractual dispute in connection with digital data storage services provided by Datapipe to RMH. On September 1, 2015, Datapipe filed a counterclaim against RMH. The parties are
	currently involved in settlement negotiations and expect to reach a settlement imminently.


	We are also currently parties to other claims,
	lawsuits and proceedings arising from the ordinary course of business.


	Although the results of claims, lawsuits, and proceedings in which
	we are involved cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not currently believe that the final outcome of the matters discussed above will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. However,
	defending and prosecuting these claims is costly and can and may impose a significant burden on our management and employees. In addition, we may receive unfavorable preliminary or interim rulings in the course of litigation, and there can be no
	assurances that favorable final outcomes will be obtained. If we are unable to obtain an outcome which sufficiently protects our rights, successfully defend our use, or allows us time to develop non-infringing technology and content or to otherwise
	alter our business practices on a timely basis in response to the claims against us, our business, prospects and competitive position may be adversely affected.







	Item 1A. Risk Factors



	In addition
	to the information set forth in the Risk Factor section of our Final Prospectus dated August 12, 2016 contained in our Registration Statement on Form S-1, information at the beginning of Managements Discussion and Analysis entitled
	Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Information and updates noted below, investors should consider that there are numerous and varied risks, known and unknown, that may prevent us from achieving our goals. If any of these risks
	actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operation may be materially adversely affected. In such case, the trading price of our common stock could decline and investors could lose all or part of their investment.



	Risks Related to Our Business



	We have
	experienced significant net losses. The Company has experienced recurring losses since its inception. For the six months ended June 30, 2016, we had a net loss of $12,249,000 and an accumulated deficit of $69,668,000 as of June 30, 2016.
	Our business strategy may be unsuccessful and no assurance can be given that we will ever have net income. Accordingly, our prospects must be considered in light of the competition, risks, expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by an
	emerging online media company. Our inability to effectively meet our competition could have an adverse effect on our prospects, operating results and financial condition.


	We have a history of losses, expect future losses and cannot assure you that we will achieve profitability or obtain the financing necessary
	for future growth.


	Revenues generated from our operations are not presently sufficient to sustain our operations. Therefore, we will
	need to raise additional capital to fund our operations in order to continue our operations. Financing transactions may include the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities, obtaining credit facilities, or other financing
	alternatives. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in any future financing or that it will be available on terms that are acceptable to us.


	Future financings through equity investments are likely to be dilutive to existing stockholders. Also, the terms of securities we may
	issue in future capital transactions may be more favorable for our new investors. Newly issued securities, warrants and restricted stock awards may include preferences, superior voting rights and privileges senior to those of existing
	holders. Further, we may incur substantial costs in pursuing future capital and/or financing, including investment banking fees, legal and accounting fees, printing and distribution expenses and other costs. We may also be required to
	recognize non-cash expenses in connection with certain securities we may issue, such as convertible notes and warrants, which will adversely impact our financial condition. Our ability to obtain needed financing may be impaired by such factors
	as the overall level of activity in the capital markets and our history of losses, which could impact the availability or cost of future financings. If the amount of capital we are able to raise from financing activities, together with our
	revenues from operations, is not sufficient to satisfy our capital needs, we may have to curtail our marketing and development plans and possibly cease operations.

	Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds




	2016 Preferred Stock, Private Placements and Common Stock Subscriptions



	On May 2, 2016, we received gross proceeds of $2,214,394 from a private placement of our series A preferred stock (the 2016 Private
	Placement), convertible into 345,997 shares of our common stock, and warrants to purchase 51,894 shares of common stock, pursuant to the terms of a Securities Purchase Agreement with a small number of accredited investors. We subsequently
	received on June 24, 2016, an additional $225,600 in gross proceeds from the sale of our series A preferred stock, convertible into 35,250 shares of our common stock, and warrants to purchase 5,287 shares of common stock, in a second closing of
	the 2016 Private Placement. The proceeds from the sale of the series A preferred stock and warrants are being used by us for working capital and general corporate purposes, including payment of transaction costs and related fees.


	The series A preferred stock is convertible into shares of common stock automatically upon the initial closing of our initial offering. The
	conversion price of the series A preferred stock is $6.40 per share, representing a 20% discount to the initial public offering price per common share in our initial public offering. The conversion price is subject to adjustment if at any time
	during the period commencing on the closing date of our initial offering and ending on the first anniversary of that date, we issue in a financing additional shares of common stock or other equity or equity-linked securities that exceed an aggregate
	of 10,000 shares at a purchase, conversion or exercise price less than $6.40 per share. In any such case, we have agreed to issue additional shares of common stock to the investors so that the effective purchase price per share in the 2016 Private
	Placement is the same per share purchase, conversion or exercise price of such additional shares. No adjustment will be made, however, in respect of shares of common stock or stock options issued to employees, directors or consultants at the then
	fair market value, or in connection with acquisitions of other entities, not to exceed 10% of the shares then outstanding on a fully-diluted basis, or that would require us to take any action that violates the rules of the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC.
	Each investor was issued, for no additional consideration, a three-year warrant to purchase a number of shares of our common stock as was equal to 15% of the number of shares into which the series A preferred stock purchased is convertible. The
	warrants are exercisable commencing upon the closing date of our initial offering. The warrants have an exercise price equal to $8.00 per share, the initial public offering price per share in our initial public offering.


	We agreed to provide the investors with piggyback registration rights with respect to the resale of the shares of common stock
	issuable upon conversion of the series A preferred stock and exercise of the warrants in a future registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, subject to limitations on the investors shares that may be imposed by the underwriter of
	a public offering. In connection with our 2016 Private Placement, the investors entered into lock-up agreements with us that prohibit those investors from, directly or indirectly, offering, selling, pledging or otherwise transferring or disposing of
	any of the shares of our common stock underlying the series A preferred stock for a period of six months following the closing date of our initial public offering. Bonwick Capital Partners LLC served as placement agent in connection with our 2016
	Private Placement of our series A preferred stock and warrants. The placement agent received an aggregate of $117,364 in sales commissions, plus warrants to purchase 26,681 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $8.00 per share.


	For the three months ended June 30, 2016, our majority shareholder contributed $2,151,000 to fund the Companys operating deficits.
	To settle the contributions, the Company issued to the majority shareholder 268,882 shares of the Companys common stock at a value of $8.00 per share.


	Each of the above issuances were made in reliance on an exemption from registration under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933.
	For each such sale, no advertising or general solicitation was employed in offering the securities. The offerings and sales were made to a limited number of persons, all of whom were accredited investors or sophisticated investors, business
	associates of ours or our executive officers, and transfers were restricted by us in accordance with the requirements of the Securities Act. Each of such persons represented to us that they were accredited or sophisticated investors, that they had
	been given access to the information they requested to make their investment decision, that they were capable of analyzing the merits and risks of their investment, and that they understood the speculative nature of their investment. Further, all of
	the above-referenced persons had access to our documents and could ask any questions of us. Accordingly, we believe that the issuances of the securities listed above were exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act by virtue of
	Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act.
