Exhibit 99.1
Jeffrey C.
O’Hara Named Chief Executive Officer of Tel-Instrument
Electronics Corp.
Harold K. Fletcher
to Continue as Chairman of the Board
CARLSTADT, N.J.--(BUSINESS
WIRE)--December 20, 2010--Tel-Instrument Electronics Corp. (NYSE
AMEX: “TIK”) announced today that its Board of
Directors has elected Jeffrey C. O’Hara as the
Company’s CEO/President. Mr. Harold K. Fletcher will continue
to serve as the Chairman of the Board.
Mr. Fletcher stated, “I have
had the distinct privilege of serving as CEO for Tel since 1982.
During that timeframe, we have grown from a small specialty
commercial electronics manufacturer into an industry leader in
military defense avionics. This was accomplished through the
tireless work of our employees and Board of Directors, many of whom
are still involved with the Company.
“As part of our ongoing
management succession plan, I am pleased to announce the
appointment of Jeffrey O’Hara as our CEO/President. Jeff
possesses a wealth of experience in diverse industries that has
prepared him to drive our business agenda for 2011 and beyond.
After serving on the Board for seven years and leading the Audit
Committee, Jeff joined the Company in 2005 as V.P. of Operations
and was promoted to President/COO in 2007. During his five years in
senior management, Jeff has been instrumental in securing many
major new contracts for the Company. He has also built a solid
management team capable of taking Tel to the next level in terms of
both revenues and profitability.”
Prior to his leadership role at
Tel, Mr. O’Hara held senior executive and Board positions at
privately held companies ranging up to $500 million in annual
revenues as well as senior financial positions at General Motors.
He has an MBA in Finance from the University of Michigan and is
also a CPA. Mr. O’Hara joined Tel’s Board in 1998 in
conjunction with the recapitalization of the Company in which he
was a significant investor.
“
