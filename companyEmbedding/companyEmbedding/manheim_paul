Paul Manheim, 93, Partner At Lehman for Many Years

Paul E. Manheim, a collector of Asian art, died on New Year's Day at his home in East Hampton, N.Y., 55 years to the day after he became a partner at the old Wall Street investment house of Lehman Brothers. He was 93.It was Mr. Manheim who led Lehman Brothers into providing individual investment services to wealthy Americans in the prosperous years after World War II, said Robert S. Rubin, a former president of the brokerage firm.Mr. Manheim started out as a statistical analyst in 1928, when the idea of technical research was relatively new on Wall Street. He was made a partner on Jan. 1, 1944, and over the years he managed money, worked on rehabilitating failed companies and in 1958 helped organize the One William Street Fund, the first open-end investment fund offered by Lehman, which was slow to expand from a wealthy clientele into selling its expertise to the masses.''Today on Wall Street you are a specialist,'' Mr. Rubin said, ''an analyst or money manager or broker, but he had his hand in everything.''

Mr. Manheim came to New York as an infant. He was born in what is now the Slovak Republic, where his father and grandfather were timber merchants. Continue reading the main story

He graduated from the University of Virginia in 1925 and went to work in the Caribbean for Dunbar Molasses and was United States consul in Guyana, which at the time was a colony known as British Guiana. He returned to New York in 1927, worked briefly for a brokerage firm and then joined Lehman Brothers in 1928 as a statistical research analyst.

Over the years he was a director of Air Express International, Ekco Products, Great Western Financial, Loew's, Media General, Paramount Pictures, the Postal Telegraph and Cable Corporation and Western Union.He moved to limited partner status, semiretirement, in 1970.He is survived by his wife, Simone Gardner; a brother, Frank, of London; a sister, Louise Espy of Manhattan; two daughters, Emily Goldman of Santa Fe, N.M., and Martha Green of Brooklyn; a son Anthony, of Brooklyn; seven grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.His marriages to Kate Carns in 1931 and to Ruth Gram in 1958 ended in divorce.In the 1960's, Mr. Manheim used his growing wealth to acquire Asian art, especially from India and Nepal.But on Labor Day weekend in 1975, a chain-smoking burglar broke into his East Side mansion and took 200 pieces of Asian art. It was one of the first of a rash of burglaries at the homes of Asian art collectors at a time when prices were soaring. The police put Mr. Manheim's losses at $750,000, about $2.3 million in today's dollars.The F.B.I. later recovered much of the art, and Mr. Manheim donated many of the items to the Brooklyn Museum, where he was a governor from 1969 to 1982, said Amy Poster, the museum's Asian art curator.

Played by:
Rod Loomis


Doctor Paul Manheim was a Human male in the 24th century. He was one of the greatest scientific minds of the time, advancing theories related to time. He was married to Jenice.
In 2342, he was a professor teaching at a university in Paris. Before 2349, he married Jenice.
Despite his brilliance, his theories on time and gravity did not gain widespread acceptance, with the result that in 2349 he left Earth with his wife and a team of fellow scientists in an attempt to test his theories. 
After searching for two years for a suitable site, the team settled on Vandor IV, where they built two labs. The dense gravity of the pulsar in that system was required for the time-gravity experiments he needed to be carried out. Manheim believed there were infinite dimensions, and that if the linearity of time could be changed, then a "window" to these dimensions could be opened up. As he came closer to proving his theories, he installed a security system in the lab, as well as a force field. He also made his wife stay in a protected room whenever he performed a new experiment.
He finally achieved his goal in 2364, when he opened a "window" into another dimension. However, this was at a serious cost to his health, as his mind was trapped between the two dimensions, and caused the destruction of one of the labs. He issued a distress call, which was answered by the USS Enterprise-D. Manheim himself was dying, and the temporal distortions caused by the open "window", or the "Manheim Effect", was spreading through the galaxy. The window had to be closed to prevent the other dimension ripping the fabric of the galaxy. This was achieved with the help of Lieutenant Commander Data, causing Manheim to recover completely. Although unable to adequately describe the other dimension, he remained on Vandor IV with his wife to continue his work, saying he owed it to those that died in the other lab. (TNG: "We'll Always Have Paris")
In 2365, when the Enterprise encountered a duplicate version of Captain Picard, apparently transported six hours back in time, the contemporary Captain Picard rejected Manheim's experiments with gravity and time as a cause of this anomaly - noting that the experiments were rudimentary and uncontrollable. (TNG: "Time Squared")

 Paul Manheim was played by Rod Loomis.In the video game Star Trek Armada, the special weapon of the Federation faction is a temporal facility that gives reference to Manheim's name. The facility allows a user to locally freeze time for enemies, while his or her own units remain unaffected.In Star Trek Online, players who obtain a Mobius class temporal destroyer (the mirror universe counterpart of the Wells-class) also receive a "Manheim Device" which allows them to create past and future duplicates of themselves.
