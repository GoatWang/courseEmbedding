(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- MANAGEMENT'S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  Entergy operates primarily through two business segments: Utility and Entergy Wholesale Commodities.   The Utility business segment includes the generation, transmission, distribution, and sale of electric power in portions of Arkansas, Mississippi, Texas, and Louisiana, including the City of New Orleans; and operation of a small natural gas distribution business.   The Entergy Wholesale Commodities business segment includes the ownership, operation, and decommissioning of nuclear power plants located in the northern United States and the sale of the electric power produced by its operating plants to wholesale customers. Entergy Wholesale Commodities also provides services to other nuclear power plant owners and owns interests in non-nuclear power plants that sell the electric power produced by those plants to wholesale customers.  Results of Operations Following are income statement variances for Utility, Entergy Wholesale Commodities, Parent & Other, and Entergy comparing the first quarter 2016 to the first quarter 2015 showing how much the line item increased or (decreased) in comparison to the prior period: Entergy Wholesale Parent & Utility Commodities Other (a) Entergy (In Thousands) 2015 Consolidated Net Income (Loss) $227,750 $123,432 ($48,253 ) $302,929 Net revenue (operating revenue less fuel expense, purchased power, and other regulatory charges/credits) (35,427 ) (60,318 ) (9 ) (95,754 ) Other operation and maintenance (41,278 ) 1,335 1,748 (38,195 ) Asset write-offs, impairments, and - 7,361 - related charges 7,361 Taxes other than income taxes (6,461 ) (973 ) (311 ) (7,745 ) Depreciation and amortization 8,619 (6,156 ) (176 ) 2,287 Other income (8,300 ) (20,530 ) (923 ) (29,753 ) Interest expense 966 188 2,755 3,909 Other expenses 5,941 (20,852 ) - (14,911 ) Income taxes 16,585 (17,876 ) (9,235 ) (10,526 ) 2016 Consolidated Net Income (Loss) $199,651 $79,557 ($43,966 ) $235,242  (a) Parent & Other includes eliminations, which are primarily intersegment activity.  Refer to "ENTERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES - SELECTED OPERATING RESULTS" for  Table of Contents  Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis Net Revenue Utility Following is an analysis of the change in net revenue comparing the first quarter 2016 to the first quarter 2015: Amount (In Millions) 2015 net revenue $1,410 Volume/weather (46 ) Retail electric price 23 Other (12 ) 2016 net revenue $1,375  The volume/weather variance is primarily due to a decrease of 849 GWh, or 3%, in billed electricity usage primarily due to the effect of less favorable weather on residential and commercial sales. The decrease is partially offset by an increase in industrial usage, primarily due to increased growth for new and expansion customers as well as existing customers, primarily in the petroleum refining industry.  The retail electric price variance is primarily due to an increase in base rates at Entergy Arkansas, as approved by the APSC. The new rates were effective February 24, 2016 and began billing with the first billing cycle of April 2016. The increase includes an interim base rate adjustment surcharge, effective with the first billing cycle of April 2016, to recover the incremental revenue requirement for the period February 24, 2016 through March 31, 2016. See Note 2 to the financial statements herein for further discussion of the rate case.  Entergy Wholesale Commodities Following is an analysis of the change in net revenue comparing the first quarter 2016 to the first quarter 2015: Amount (In Millions) 2015 net revenue $527 Nuclear realized price changes (78 ) Rhode Island State Energy Center (15 ) Nuclear volume 12 Nuclear fuel expenses 21 Other (1 ) 2016 net revenue $466  As shown in the table above, net revenue for Entergy Wholesale Commodities decreased by $61 million in the first quarter 2016 as compared to the first quarter 2015 primarily due to lower realized wholesale energy prices and lower capacity prices and as a result of the sale of the Rhode Island State Energy Center in December 2015. The decrease was partially offset by higher volume in the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear fleet resulting from fewer unplanned outage days in the first quarter 2016 as compared to the first quarter 2015, and a decrease in nuclear fuel expenses related to the impairments of the FitzPatrick, Pilgrim, and Palisades plants and related assets in the third and fourth quarters of 2015. See Note 1 to the financial statements in the Form 10-K for discussion of the impairments.  Table of Contents   Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis Following are key performance measures for Entergy Wholesale Commodities for the first quarter 2016 and 2015: 2016 2015 Owned capacity (MW) (a) 4,880 5,463 GWh billed 9,246 9,592 Average revenue per MWh $56.47 $67.00 Entergy Wholesale Commodities Nuclear Fleet Capacity factor 90% 90% GWh billed 8,688 8,618 Average revenue per MWh $57.43 $65.78 Refueling Outage Days: Indian Point 2 25 - Indian Point 3 - 23  (a) The reduction in owned capacity is due to the sale of the 583 MW Rhode Island State Energy Center in December 2015.  Realized Revenue per MWh for Entergy Wholesale Commodities Nuclear Plants  See "MANAGEMENT'S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - Results of Operations - Realized Revenue per MWh for Entergy Wholesale Commodities Nuclear Plants" in the Form 10-K for a discussion of the effects of sustained low natural gas prices and power market structure challenges on market prices for electricity over the past few years in the power regions where the Entergy Wholesale Commodities power plants are located. As shown in the contracted sale of energy table in "Market and Credit Risk Sensitive Instruments," Entergy Wholesale Commodities has sold forward 88% of its planned nuclear energy output for 2016 for an expected average contracted energy price of $40 per MWh based on market prices at March 31, 2016. In addition, Entergy Wholesale Commodities has sold forward 63% of its planned nuclear energy output for 2017 for an expected average contracted energy price of $46 per MWh based on market prices at March 31, 2016.  The market price trend presents a challenging economic situation for the Entergy Wholesale Commodities plants. The severity of the challenge varies for each of the plants based on a variety of factors such as their market for both energy and capacity, their size, their contracted positions, and the amount of investment required to continue to operate and maintain the safety and integrity of the plants, including the estimated asset retirement costs. In addition, currently the market design under which the plants operate does not adequately compensate merchant nuclear plants for their environmental and fuel diversity benefits in the region.  In October 2015, Entergy determined that it will close the Pilgrim and FitzPatrick plants. The decisions to shut down the plants were primarily due to the poor market conditions that have led to reduced revenues, the poor market design that fails to properly compensate nuclear generators for the benefits they provide, and increased operational costs. The Pilgrim plant is expected to cease operations on May 31, 2019. The FitzPatrick plant is expected to shut down at the end of its current fuel cycle, which is planned for January 27, 2017.  Entergy previously shut down Vermont Yankee in 2014, and, after the closures of Pilgrim and FitzPatrick, will have two remaining nuclear power generating facilities in operation in the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business, Indian Point and Palisades. Unlike the three facilities that Entergy has decided to shut down, Indian Point is a multi-unit site with both Indian Point 2 and 3 in operation that sells power at NYISO Zone G, which is a key supply region for New York City. In addition, Indian Point 2 (1,028 MW) and 3 (1,041 MW) are significantly larger plants than Vermont Yankee (605 MW), Pilgrim (688 MW), or FitzPatrick (838 MW). The Indian Point plants, however, are currently involved and face opposition in extensive licensing proceedings, which are described in "Entergy Wholesale  Table of Contents  Commodities Authorizations to Operate Its Nuclear Power Plants" in the Form 10-K and herein. Palisades (811 MW) is similar in size to FitzPatrick, is also a single-unit site, and the MISO market in which it operates has also experienced market price declines over the past few years. At this time, most of the Palisades output is sold under a 15-year power purchase agreement, entered at the plant's acquisition in 2007, that expires in 2022. The power purchase agreement prices currently exceed market prices and escalate each year, up to $61.50/MWh in 2022.  In 2015, Entergy recorded impairment and other related charges to write down the carrying values of the FitzPatrick, Pilgrim, and Palisades plants and related assets to their fair values. Impairment of long-lived assets and nuclear decommissioning costs, and the factors that influence these items, are both discussed in the Form 10-K in "MANAGMENT'S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - Critical Accounting Estimates." If economic conditions or regulatory activity no longer support the continued operation of Indian Point or Palisades for their expected lives or no longer support the recovery of the costs of the plants, it could adversely affect Entergy's results of operations through loss of revenue, impairment charges, increased depreciation rates, transitional costs, or accelerated decommissioning costs.  Other Income Statement Items  Utility  Other operation and maintenance expenses decreased from $555 million for the first quarter 2015 to $514 million for the first quarter 2016 primarily due to:   a decrease of $22 million in fossil-fueled generation expenses primarily due to an overall lower scope of work done during plant outages in 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015;   the deferral of $8 million of previously-incurred costs related to ANO post-Fukushima compliance and $10 million of previously-incurred costs related to ANO flood barrier compliance, as approved by the APSC as part of the Entergy Arkansas 2015 rate case settlement. See Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the rate case settlement;   a decrease of $15 million in compensation and benefits costs primarily due to a decrease in net periodic pension and other postretirement benefits costs as a result of an increase in the discount rate used to value the benefit liabilities and a refinement in the approach used to estimate the service cost and interest cost components of pension and other postretirement costs. See "MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - Critical Accounting Estimates - Qualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits" in the Form 10-K and Note 6 to the financial statements herein for further discussion of benefits costs; and   a decrease of $6 million in energy efficiency costs, including the effects of true-ups.  The decrease was partially offset by an increase of $27 million in nuclear generation expenses primarily due to an increase in regulatory compliance costs and higher nuclear labor costs, including contract labor. The increase in regulatory compliance costs is primarily related to additional NRC inspection activities in the first quarter 2016 as a result of the NRC's March 2015 decision to move ANO into the "multiple/repetitive degraded cornerstone column" of the NRC's Reactor Oversight Process Action Matrix. See "ANO Damage, Outage, and NRC Reviews" below.  Depreciation and amortization expenses increased primarily due to additions to plant in service.  Other income decreased primarily due to lower realized gains on decommissioning trust fund investments in 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015.  Entergy Wholesale Commodities  Other income decreased primarily due to lower realized gains on decommissioning trust fund investments in 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015, which included realized decommissioning trust gains that resulted from portfolio reallocations for the Vermont Yankee nuclear decommissioning trust funds.  Table of Contents Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis  Other expenses decreased due to the reduction in deferred refueling outage amortization costs related to the impairments of the FitzPatrick, Pilgrim, and Palisades plants and related assets in the third and fourth quarters of 2015. See Note 1 to the financial statements in the Form 10-K for discussion of the impairments.  Income Taxes  The effective income tax rate was 37.3% for the first quarter 2016. The difference in the effective income tax rate for the first quarter 2016 versus the federal statutory rate of 35% was primarily due to state income taxes, certain book and tax differences related to utility plant items, and the provision for uncertain tax positions, partially offset by book and tax differences related to the allowance for equity funds used during construction.  The effective income tax rate was 33.2% for the first quarter 2015. The difference in the effective income tax rate for the first quarter 2015 versus the federal statutory rate of 35% was primarily due to the reversal of a portion of the provision for uncertain tax positions resulting from the receipt of finalized tax and interest computations for the 2006-2007 audit from the IRS, partially offset by certain book and tax differences related to utility plant items. See Note 3 to the financial statements in the Form 10-K for a discussion of the 2006-2007 audit.  Entergy Wholesale Commodities Authorizations to Operate Its Nuclear Power Plants  See "MANAGEMENT'S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - Entergy Wholesale Commodities Authorizations to Operate Its Nuclear Power Plants" in the Form 10-K for a discussion of the NRC operating licenses for Indian Point 2 and Indian Point 3 and the NRC license renewal joint application in process for these plants. Following are updates to that discussion.  Indian Point NRC/ASLB Proceedings  In May 2016 the NRC issued a decision sustaining New York State's appeal of the ASLB's November 2013 Track 1 decision upholding the adequacy of Severe Accident Mitigation Alternatives (SAMA) decommissioning cost estimates. The NRC directed its staff to supplement its SAMA analysis to include sensitivity runs for two inputs to SAMA decommissioning costs. Since SAMA analysis is part of the NRC's environmental impact analysis, and not part of its safety analysis, further supplementation of the NRC's Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement will be required, with attendant impact on the schedule for completion of proceedings before the NRC. One SAMA appeal from Track 1 remains to be decided.  Indian Point Coastal Zone Management Act Proceedings  As discussed in the Form 10-K, in January 2016, Entergy filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York challenging the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation's objection to Entergy's withdrawn Coastal Zone Management Act consistency certification on federal preemption grounds. Entergy's complaint requests a determination that the objection, which cites nuclear safety concerns, is preempted and thus invalid. The New York State Department of State filed a motion to dismiss Entergy's lawsuit in March 2016, and Entergy filed its response in May 2016.  ANO Damage, Outage, and NRC Reviews  See Note 8 to the financial statements in the Form 10-K for a discussion of the ANO stator incident and subsequent NRC reviews.  As discussed in the Form 10-K, in March 2015 the NRC issued a letter notifying Entergy of its decision to move ANO into the "multiple/repetitive degraded cornerstone column" (Column 4) of the NRC's Reactor Oversight Process Action Matrix. Placement into Column 4 requires significant additional NRC inspection activities at the ANO site, including a review of the site's root cause evaluation associated with the flood barrier and stator issues, an  Table of Contents  assessment of the effectiveness of the site's corrective action program, an additional design basis inspection, a safety culture assessment, and possibly other inspection activities consistent with the NRC's Inspection Procedure. Entergy Arkansas incurred incremental expenses of approximately $53 million in 2015 to prepare for the NRC inspection that began in early 2016. Excluding remediation and response costs that may result from the additional NRC inspection activities, Entergy Arkansas expects to incur incremental expenses of approximately $50 million in 2016, of which $19.6 million was incurred in the first quarter 2016, in support of NRC inspection activities and to implement Entergy Arkansas's performance improvement initiatives developed in 2015. A lesser amount of incremental expenses is expected to be ongoing annually after 2016.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  See "MANAGEMENT'S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - Liquidity and Capital Resources" in the Form 10-K for a discussion of Entergy's capital structure, capital expenditure plans and other uses of capital, and sources of capital. Following are updates to that discussion.  Capital Structure Entergy's capitalization is balanced between equity and debt, as shown in the following table. The increase in the debt to capital ratio is primarily due to the net issuance of long-term debt in 2016. December 31, March 31, 2016 2015 Debt to capital 60.9 % 59.1 % Effect of excluding securitization bonds (1.2 %) (1.4 %) Debt to capital, excluding securitization 59.7 % 57.7 % bonds (a) Effect of subtracting cash (1.9 %) (2.7 %) Net debt to net capital, excluding 57.8 % 55.0 % securitization bonds (a)  (a) Calculation excludes the Arkansas, Louisiana, New Orleans, and Texas securitization bonds, which are non-recourse to Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy New Orleans, and Entergy Texas, respectively.  Net debt consists of debt less cash and cash equivalents. Debt consists of notes payable and commercial paper, capital lease obligations, and long-term debt, including the currently maturing portion. Capital consists of debt, common shareholders' equity, and subsidiaries' preferred stock without sinking fund. Net capital consists of capital less cash and cash equivalents. Entergy uses the debt to capital ratios excluding securitization bonds in analyzing its financial condition and believes they provide useful information to its investors and creditors in evaluating Entergy's financial condition because the securitization bonds are non-recourse to Entergy, as more fully described in Note 5 to the financial statements in the Form 10-K. Entergy also uses the net debt to net capital ratio excluding securitization bonds in analyzing its financial condition and believes it provides useful information to its investors and creditors in evaluating Entergy's financial condition because net debt indicates Entergy's outstanding debt position that could not be readily satisfied by cash and cash equivalents on hand.  Table of Contents Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis  Entergy Corporation has in place a credit facility that has a borrowing capacity of $3.5 billion and expires in August 2020. Entergy Corporation also has the ability to issue letters of credit against 50% of the total borrowing capacity of the credit facility. The commitment fee is currently 0.275% of the undrawn commitment amount. Commitment fees and interest rates on loans under the credit facility can fluctuate depending on the senior unsecured debt ratings of Entergy Corporation. The weighted average interest rate for the three months ended March 31, 2016 was 2.35% on the drawn portion of the facility. Following is a summary of the borrowings outstanding and capacity available under the facility as of March 31, 2016:   Letters Capacity Capacity Borrowings of Credit Available (In Millions) $3,500 $616 $7 $2,877  A covenant in Entergy Corporation's credit facility requires Entergy to maintain a consolidated debt ratio, as defined, of 65% or less of its total capitalization. The calculation of this debt ratio under Entergy Corporation's credit facility is different than the calculation of the debt to capital ratio above. Entergy is currently in compliance with the covenant and expects to remain in compliance with this covenant. If Entergy fails to meet this ratio, or if Entergy or one of the Utility operating companies (except Entergy New Orleans) defaults on other indebtedness or is in bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings, an acceleration of the facility's maturity date may occur. See Note 4 to the financial statements herein for additional discussion of the Entergy Corporation credit facility and discussion of the Registrant Subsidiaries' credit facilities.  Entergy Nuclear Vermont Yankee entered into a credit facility guaranteed by Entergy Corporation which expires in January 2018. In the first quarter 2016, Entergy Nuclear Vermont Yankee increased the borrowing capacity of its credit facility to $100 million. As of March 31, 2016, $61 million in cash borrowings were outstanding under the credit facility. Entergy Nuclear Vermont Yankee also entered into an uncommitted credit facility guaranteed by Entergy Corporation with a borrowing capacity of $85 million which expires in January 2018. As of March 31, 2016, there were no cash borrowings outstanding under the uncommitted credit facility. See Note 4 to the financial statements herein for additional discussion of the Vermont Yankee facilities.  Entergy Corporation has a commercial paper program with a Board-approved program limit of up to $1.5 billion. As of March 31, 2016, Entergy Corporation had $578 million of commercial paper outstanding. The weighted-average interest rate for the three months ended March 31, 2016 was 1.14%.  Capital Expenditure Plans and Other Uses of Capital  See the table and discussion in the Form 10-K under "MANAGEMENT'S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Capital Expenditure Plans and Other Uses of Capital," that sets forth the amounts of planned construction and other capital investments by operating segment for 2016 through 2018. Following are updates to the discussion.  St. Charles Power Station  In August 2015, Entergy Louisiana filed with the LPSC an application seeking certification that the public necessity and convenience would be served by the construction of the St. Charles Power Station, a nominal 980 megawatt combined-cycle generating unit, on land adjacent to the existing Little Gypsy plant in St. Charles Parish, Louisiana. Testimony has been filed by LPSC staff and intervenors, with LPSC staff concluding that the construction of the project serves the public convenience and necessity. Three intervenors contend that Entergy Louisiana has not established that construction of the project is in the public interest, claiming that the RFP excluded consideration of certain resources that could be more cost effective, that the RFP provided undue preference to the self-build option, and that a 30-year capacity commitment is not warranted by current supply conditions. The RFP independent monitor also filed testimony and a report affirming that the St. Charles Power Station was selected through an objective and  Table of Contents  fair RFP that showed no undue preference to any proposal. An evidentiary hearing was held in April 2016 and, subject to regulatory approval by the LPSC and receipt of other permits and approvals, full notice to proceed is expected to be issued in Summer 2016. Commercial operation is estimated to occur by Summer 2019.  Dividends  Declarations of dividends on Entergy's common stock are made at the discretion of the Board. Among other things, the Board evaluates the level of Entergy's common stock dividends based upon Entergy's earnings per share from the Utility operating segment and the Parent and Other portion of the business, financial strength, and future investment opportunities. At its April 2016 meeting, the Board declared a dividend of $0.85 per share.  May 06, 2016  (c) 1995-2016 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc. All Rights Reserved

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.
