Discover the five trust actions that will help individuals minimize risk while maximizing possibilities.

















THE CHALLENGE
We live in a low-trust world surrounded by crises and challenges. Who can you trust? How can you trust? 

Choosing Smart Trust will enable you to operate with high-trust in a low-trust and unpredictable marketplace. The more unpredictable it becomes, the more your sound judgment and ability to trust in this low-trust world will give you a tremendous competitive advantage—and the capacity to navigate the uncertainty low trust creates.
 
Based on the book, Smart Trust, by Stephen M. R. Covey and Greg Link, this LiveClicks on-demand workshop will help you understand how trust issues impact every situation in life. In fact, trusted people are more likely to get hired or promoted, get the best projects and bigger budgets, and are last to be laid off. In Smart Trust, you will learn the five trust actions that will help you minimize risk while maximizing possibilities. This course will teach you the tools you need to extend Smart Trust, which will help you enjoy greater prosperity, energy, and joy—both personally and professionally.



























Attend a Workshop
    






















								“The first job of a leader—at work or at home—is to inspire trust. It’s to bring out the best in people by entrusting them with meaningful stewardships, and to create an environment in which high-trust interaction inspires creativity and possibility.” 
-Stephen M. R. Covey

FAQ

What are UITs?Unit Investment Trusts (UITs) are a fixed portfolio of stocks, bonds or other securities. These types of portfolios allow investors to know what securities are held within a UIT as of the date of deposit, as well as the mandatory termination date of the trust. While it is not common, a trust may terminate early as described in the prospectus. UITs offer an attractive opportunity for investors to own a portfolio of securities via a low minimum, typically liquid investment. As a point of contrast, while many actively managed funds continually buy and sell securities, thereby changing their investment mix, the securities held in a UIT generally remain fixed.
How are UIT securities chosen?Some UIT securities are chosen according to a quantitative selection process determined by a sponsor while some are based on an index. Other UITs are chosen by experienced analysts or portfolio managers, who research the securities and screen them for various characteristics, according to specific objectives. Once securities are selected, the UIT portfolios are then supervised accordingly throughout the life of the trust.
Can a security held in a UIT be removed at any time?While it is rare, a security held in a UIT may be removed from a portfolio under certain circumstances, such as a significant decline in credit rating. By and large, securities held in a UIT remain fixed for the life of the trust, regardless of market value.
What are the minimum investments in SmartTrust® UITs?Typical minimums are 100 units, however, the minimums may vary based on the UIT. Higher minimums may also be required by each respective brokerage firm.
Are UITs suitable for my retirement accounts?Unit trusts may be an appropriate investment vehicle for IRAs or self-employed retirement plans. They offer a variety of investment opportunities — ranging from relatively conservative to more aggressive investments — in both domestic and international markets.
What are my options when a UIT matures?Option #1: Rollover at a reduced sales charge
At a reduced sales charge, investors may roll over into a new series of the same trust, if available, or any other SmartTrust® UIT available in the primary market*
*Maturity rollover is considered a taxable event. Please refer to each trust’s prospectus for complete rollover option information. Investors should be aware that there is a time limit to notify the trustee of the rollover.
Option #2: Maturity
Investors may do nothing and allow the portfolio units to mature. The trust will liquidate and they will receive a cash distribution of the trust’s proceeds, if any.
Option #3: In-kind distribution
Investors may generally request an in-kind distribution of the securities underlying the units if they own 2,500 or more units at either the time of purchase or maturity. Please see additional provisions set forth in the prospectus. SmartTrust® Unit Investment Trusts are generally long-term investment strategies and investors should consider their ability to invest in successive portfolios, if available. Investors should consult their tax advisor to determine tax consequences associated with an investment from one portfolio to the next, if available. Neither Hennion & Walsh, Inc. or Hennion & Walsh Asset Management, Inc. provide tax advice. Please refer to the trust prospectus for more complete in-kind distribution information. In-kind distribution is generally available for stocks traded and held in the United States. In-kind distribution may be modified or discontinued at any time without notice.
Can I sell my units?You may sell all, or a portion of, your units any day the stock market is open. You will receive the then-current net asset value of the units, based on the current market value of the underlying securities in the portfolio, less any remaining deferred sales charge, as of the evaluation time. As the market fluctuates, of course, so will the value of your units. Therefore, your units may be worth more or less than what you originally paid.
How are UITs priced?UITs are priced at the end of each business day similar to mutual funds. The price is based on the market value of the underlying securities and includes cash and other assets and liabilities held by the trust.
Are UITs eligible in commission and fee/wrap accounts?UITs are available in a sales charge structure for commission accounts as well as for fee/wrap accounts. It is best to check with your individual brokerage firm to see if UITs are eligible for your fee/wrap platform.
Are UITs regulated?Unit investment trusts are one of three basic types of investment company. Investment companies are subject to stringent federal laws and oversight by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). It is important to note that the SEC does not approve or disapprove of UITs or the securities within a given UIT or pass upon the adequacy of any prospectus for a given UIT. Investment companies are regulated primarily under the Investment Company Act of 1940. This federal statute is highly detailed and governs the structure and day-to-day operations of investment companies. Investment companies are also subject to regulations of the Securities Act of 1933, FINRA, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

*Estimated Net Annual First Year Distribution per unit is computed by dividing the estimated annual income of the underlying securities less the expense per unit by the number of units outstanding. The estimated net annual distributions for subsequent years are expected to be less than estimated distributions for the first year because a portion of the securities included in the trust portfolio will be sold during the  first year to pay for organization costs, the creation and development fee and the deferred sales charge. The actual net annual distributions will vary with changes in the trust’s fees and expenses and income of the underlying securities.

*Estimated Net Annual First Year Distribution per unit is computed by dividing the estimated annual income of the underlying securities less the expense per unit by the number of units outstanding. The estimated net annual distributions for subsequent years are expected to be less than estimated distributions for the first year because a portion of the securities included in the trust portfolio will be sold during the  first year to pay for organization costs, the creation and development fee and the deferred sales charge. The actual net annual distributions will vary with changes in the trust’s fees and expenses and income of the underlying securities.

FAQ



  How does VHT stand out from our competition?   Teamwork is our key to success along with uncompromised customer service, before, during and after the sale. It’s important to understand that after install, new technologies and updates become available, life styles change or your electronic gear just stops working and you’ll need a company that will be available to service your account. VHT has a service department dedicated to servicing our existing clients when the need arises.
  
  What would you consider your speciality at VHT?   Along with customer service, we specialize in Automation – integrating all your every day consumer electronics into one easy to use platform. Whether you have a small system with one remote or a very large system with cameras & security, multiple video/audio zones, intercom, networking, paging, climate control, etc.,etc. our end result is always the same – It’s got to be easy to use! We can’t stress that enough, otherwise you won’t use your system. We develop easy to use systems to suit your needs and lifestyle within your budget.
  
  Do you install other people’s equipment?   If you have existing equipment that we can use, we will. However, if you are buying new equipment, we recommend you check with us first as we carry all name brands and may save you money by beating competitor pricing. Note: we look at every project as a whole. If we can supply the equipment, usually we can discount the labor in most projects.
  
  Do you guarantee your workmanship?   Yes, we guarantee our workmanship for one full year. All components are covered under manufacture warranty.
