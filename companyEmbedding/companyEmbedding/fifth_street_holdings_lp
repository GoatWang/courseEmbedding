Fifth Street Asset Management Inc. Enters Into Agreement For Oaktree To Assume Management Of Business Development Companies Fifth Street Finance Corp. And Fifth Street Senior Floating Rate Corp.






GlobeNewswire



Jul 14, 2017 7:00 AM EDT













 




























































 GREENWICH, Conn., July 14, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Fifth Street Asset Management (NASDAQ:FSAM) ("FSAM") today announced that it has signed a definitive asset purchase agreement with Oaktree Capital Management, L.P. ("Oaktree"), an affiliate of Oaktree Capital Group, LLC (NYSE:OAK), under which Oaktree will become the new investment adviser to two Business Development Companies ("BDCs"): Fifth Street Finance Corp. (NASDAQ:FSC) ("FSC") and Fifth Street Senior Floating Rate Corp. (NASDAQ:FSFR) ("FSFR"). Oaktree will pay gross cash consideration of $320 million in cash to Fifth Street Management LLC ("FSM"), an affiliate of FSAM, upon the close of the transaction. The shares of common stock of FSC and FSFR owned by Fifth Street Holdings L.P. ("FSH") are not included in the transaction.  The transaction is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2017. The transaction follows a strategic review conducted by the FSAM management team and Board of Directors, including a Special Committee, in conjunction with legal and financial advisors, of a range of alternatives to maximize the value of the Fifth Street platform. A Special Committee of FSAM's Board of Directors, formed to review the asset sale transaction and related matters, and Board of Directors each unanimously determined that this transaction is in the best interest of FSAM and its stockholders. "We believe this transaction combining FSAM's established presence in the BDC space and Oaktree's deep credit expertise offers a compelling value for FSAM's assets and allows the FSC and FSFR stockholders to participate in the future growth potential of the portfolio under a larger, more diversified manager led by a highly experienced investment team. Oaktree's long-term investment approach, emphasizing return consistency and downside protection, along with its proposed fee structure, made Oaktree the appropriate manager to stabilize and grow the BDC portfolios, which should provide enhanced returns for FSC and FSFR stockholders going forward.  We have recommended and fully support the FSC and FSFR boards' decision to approve the agreements with Oaktree," said Leonard M. Tannenbaum, FSAM's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.

 Fifth Street Asset Management Inc. Announces Sale of Middle Market CLO Business to NewStar Financial, Inc.




                    Friday, July 7, 2017 11:00 AM  UTC

GREENWICH, CT, July  07, 2017   -- Fifth Street Asset Management Inc. (NASDAQ:FSAM) (“FSAM” or “Fifth Street”) today announced that it has agreed to sell Fifth Street CLO Management LLC (“FSCM”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Fifth Street Holdings L.P., to NewStar Financial, Inc. (NASDAQ:NEWS) (“NewStar”).  FSAM intends to use the proceeds from this transaction to pay down its credit facility and for general corporate purposes.  The estimated purchase price is approximately $16 million, net of $13 million of assumed indebtedness, and will be subject to adjustment up or down based on certain working capital items as of closing.  The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter, subject to certain investor consents and closing conditions set forth in the purchase agreement between Fifth Street Holdings L.P. and NewStar.
FSCM was formed in 2015 to manage Fifth Street’s middle market CLO business.  The company currently manages two CLOs, with approximately $726 million of assets under management as of March 31, 2017, backed by middle market loans, and holds certain interests in its sponsored CLOs primarily to comply with regulatory risk retention requirements. “Over the course of FSAM’s strategic review, it became clear to us that given the market environment and headwinds we faced over the past year and a half, it would be difficult to scale our CLO business,” said Leonard M. Tannenbaum, Chief Executive Officer of FSAM.  “We believe that exiting this business line is in the best interest of our shareholders and is an important step as we continue to enhance our liquidity position and streamline operations.” Natixis Securities Americas LLC served as financial advisor to FSAM and Dechert LLP served as its legal counsel. About Fifth Street Asset Management Inc. Fifth Street Asset Management Inc. (NASDAQ:FSAM) is a nationally recognized credit-focused asset manager.  The firm has over $4 billion of assets under management across two publicly-traded business development companies, Fifth Street Finance Corp. (NASDAQ:FSC) and Fifth Street Senior Floating Rate Corp. (NASDAQ:FSFR), as well as multiple private investment vehicles.  The Fifth Street platform provides innovative and customized financing solutions to small and mid-sized businesses across the capital structure through complementary investment vehicles and co-investment capabilities.  With a nearly 20-year track record focused on disciplined credit investing across multiple economic cycles, Fifth Street is led by a seasoned management team that has issued billions of dollars in public equity, private capital and public debt securities.  Fifth Street's national origination strategy, proven track record and established platform have allowed the firm to surpass $10 billion of loan commitments since inception.  For more information, please visit fsam.fifthstreetfinance.com.

Fifth Street Asset Management Inc. Announces Sale Of Middle Market CLO Business To NewStar Financial, Inc.






GlobeNewswire



Jul 7, 2017 7:00 AM EDT













 




























































 GREENWICH, CT, July 07, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Fifth Street Asset Management Inc. (NASDAQ:FSAM) ("FSAM" or "Fifth Street") today announced that it has agreed to sell Fifth Street CLO Management LLC ("FSCM"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Fifth Street Holdings L.P., to NewStar Financial, Inc. (NASDAQ:NEWS) ("NewStar").  FSAM intends to use the proceeds from this transaction to pay down its credit facility and for general corporate purposes.  The estimated purchase price is approximately $16 million, net of $13 million of assumed indebtedness, and will be subject to adjustment up or down based on certain working capital items as of closing.  The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter, subject to certain investor consents and closing conditions set forth in the purchase agreement between Fifth Street Holdings L.P. and NewStar. FSCM was formed in 2015 to manage Fifth Street's middle market CLO business.  The company currently manages two CLOs, with approximately $726 million of assets under management as of March 31, 2017, backed by middle market loans, and holds certain interests in its sponsored CLOs primarily to comply with regulatory risk retention requirements. "Over the course of FSAM's strategic review, it became clear to us that given the market environment and headwinds we faced over the past year and a half, it would be difficult to scale our CLO business," said Leonard M. Tannenbaum, Chief Executive Officer of FSAM.  "We believe that exiting this business line is in the best interest of our shareholders and is an important step as we continue to enhance our liquidity position and streamline operations." Natixis Securities Americas LLC served as financial advisor to FSAM and Dechert LLP served as its legal counsel.  About Fifth Street Asset Management Inc. Fifth Street Asset Management Inc. (NASDAQ:FSAM) is a nationally recognized credit-focused asset manager.  The firm has over $4 billion of assets under management across two publicly-traded business development companies, Fifth Street Finance Corp. (NASDAQ:FSC) and Fifth Street Senior Floating Rate Corp. (NASDAQ:FSFR), as well as multiple private investment vehicles.  The Fifth Street platform provides innovative and customized financing solutions to small and mid-sized businesses across the capital structure through complementary investment vehicles and co-investment capabilities.  With a nearly 20-year track record focused on disciplined credit investing across multiple economic cycles, Fifth Street is led by a seasoned management team that has issued billions of dollars in public equity, private capital and public debt securities.  Fifth Street's national origination strategy, proven track record and established platform have allowed the firm to surpass $10 billion of loan commitments since inception.  For more information, please visit fsam.fifthstreetfinance.com.

PRESS RELEASE
BOSTON, July 07, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — NewStar Financial, Inc. (Nasdaq:NEWS) (“NewStar” or the “Company”) announced today that it has agreed to acquire Fifth Street CLO Management LLC (“FSCM”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Fifth Street Holdings L.P., an affiliate of Fifth Street Asset Management, Inc. (“Fifth Street” or “FSAM”) (NASDAQ:FSAM), a publicly-traded credit-focused asset management firm based in Greenwich, Connecticut. The estimated purchase price is approximately $16 million, net of $13 million of assumed indebtedness and will be subject to adjustment up or down based on certain working capital items as of the closing of the transaction. The acquisition will add approximately $726 million to NewStar’s assets under management, increasing total pro forma AUM to approximately $7.3 billion. The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of 2017, subject to certain investor consents and other closing conditions set forth in the purchase agreement between Fifth Street Holdings L.P. and NewStar. The transaction is expected to be accretive to NewStar’s earnings per share in 2017.
FSCM was formed in 2015 by Fifth Street to manage its middle market CLO business. FSCM currently manages two CLOs backed by middle market loans and holds certain interests in its sponsored CLOs primarily to comply with regulatory risk retention requirements. 





Over the past eighteen months, NewStar has focused on expanding its asset management platform by launching new managed funds, acquiring investment management platforms and increasing its investment activity. This transaction is the Company’s second acquisition adding to its managed assets and represents another important step in that strategy. The acquisition is highly complementary to the Company’s existing middle market direct lending business and provides balance to its overall asset management platform, increasing pro forma fee-paying AUM to $4 billion, split evenly between its middle market and liquid credit strategies platforms. The transaction also adds significantly to the Company’s lending capacity, allowing it to better meet the needs of its private equity clients and compete more effectively to lead new direct lending opportunities.
FSCM will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of NewStar and the funds will be managed by NewStar’s middle market investment team. The transaction is expected to add more than $2.5 million to the Company’s run-rate fee revenue and will serve as a further catalyst to the growth of NewStar’s asset management activities.
“This acquisition is consistent with our strategy to expand our asset management activities in ways that add to our value proposition for institutional investors and leverage our core strengths in direct lending, securitization and credit management. This transaction also provides an attractive way to diversify our business mix, adding to fee revenue and accelerating improvement in equity returns,” said NewStar’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Tim Conway. 





“The transaction is expected to be accretive to earnings in 2017, adding predictable fee revenue derived from long-term CLO management contracts” added John Bray, NewStar’s Chief Financial Officer. “We were able to complete thorough due diligence and the terms of the transaction worked well for all parties.”
Seward & Kissel LLP served as legal counsel and GreensLedge Capital Markets LLC advised NewStar on the transaction.
