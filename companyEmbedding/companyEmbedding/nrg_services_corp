The integrated power company said it plans to deploy up to $6.3 billion in excess cash through 2020, including $4 billion by end of 2018, in either projects or investments or shareholder return programs. As part of the plan, the company is targeting divesting 50% to 100% of its interest in NRG Yield and its leading renewables platform. NRG has engaged Citi, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley for certain asset sale processes, and expects to announce signed agreements during the fourth quarter of 2017. The stock, which was still inactive in premarket trade, has tumbled 13.0% over the past three months, while the SPDR Utilities Select Sector  has slipped 0.8% and the S&P 500  has gained 3.4%.

Energy stocks rally to lead S&P 500 gainers as oil erases some of Thursday's loss
Energy stocks rallied to lead S&P 500 gainers Friday, rebounding from a rout Thursday driven by a steep decline in oil prices. Crude futures were back in the black Friday after a nearly 5% decline in the prior session, although prices were on track for a hefty loss for the week. Oil has suffered "heavy losses this week as investors are no longer pleased with current output cuts by OPEC," said Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets, as reported by MarketWatch. Futures were up 77 cents, or 1.7%, at $46.29 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Against that backdrop, Transocean Ltd  led the advancers with a 7.4% gain. Chesapeake Energy Corp.  was up 5.4%, NRG Energy Inc.  was up 3% and Murphy Oil Corp.  rose 2.5%. National Oilwell Varco Inc.  added 2.3%, TechnipFMC Plc  rose 2.2% and Hess Corp.  tacked on 2.1%. The Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund was up 0.8%. The S&P 500  was slightly higher.

Thursday’s Biggest Winners and Losers in the S&P 500
Thursday was a fairly mixed day in the U.S. broad markets. Crude oil continued to push higher again posting a gain of over 1%, although it didn’t have a huge impact on Oil & Gas stocks with only a few posting marginal gains and some actually losing. Financial stocks were the only real winners across the board, and this comes after Fed Chair Janet Yellen’s dovish position that she articulated in front of the House and Senate Banking Committees. Retailers saw some solid gains on Thursday as well. Otherwise the rest of the S&P 500 was fairly mixed.

The Good

Lease with Free Installation
Performance Guarantee
System Monitoring

Lease with Free Installation
NRG Home Solar offers a 20 year leasing option. Leasing a solar system means that either NRG Home Solar or a third party will own the system and you will make monthly payments to them as if you are renting the system. This is a great option for consumers who do not have a lot of cash on hand but would like to take advantage of the savings associated with solar energy conversion. NRG Home Solar will install the system for free. After that, monthly lease payments will generally be lower than standard monthly utility payments (depending on factors such as location, electricity usage, utility rates, and system production). At the end of the leasing period, NRG gives its customers the choice to either remove the system at no cost, extend the agreement for another five years, or purchase the system at a reasonable rate.
Performance Guarantee
After designing each system, NRG Home Solar will give the customer a quote stating the amount of power the system should generate and add this to the service agreement. If at any time the system produces less than the quoted amount, NRG Home Solar will refund the customer the difference.
System Monitoring
NRG Home Solar monitors each customer's system 24/7 and will notify the customer if there are any issues. NRG also offers a mobile app and online monitoring service that allows customers to monitor their system's energy production and consumption on their own from anywhere in the world. This empowers customers to stay on top of their monthly savings.



The Bad

Strict Credit Score Requirement
Poor Customer Service
Limited Online Information

Strict Credit Score Requirement
NRG Home Solar requires an Experian credit score of 700 or higher, while most companies in the industry only require a score of 650. While this isn't necessarily a bad thing, it does exclude a large number of potential customers from going solar with NRG.
Poor Customer Service
Based on reviews we've received for NRG Home Solar, those who have signed a lease with NRG have been quite upset with the company's customer service. Many customers have stated they had delays with the installation. Additionally, several negative reviews on our site mention NRG's lack of responsiveness to customers' questions and concerns.
Limited Online Information
Lastly, we noticed a lack of transparency in regards to specific details of the lease contract and the equipment used on the NRG website. This information is important for potential customers who are planning to lease a solar system for the next 20 years, so the lack thereof is frustrating.



The Bottom Line
NRG Home Solar offers its services in 3 states: New York, New Jersey, and Massachusetts. The company offers a 20-year leasing agreement that enables them to install the system for $0 and provide customers with an energy production guarantee, as well as 24/7 monitoring. NRG Home Solar also has a solar monitoring app and online portal, giving customers access to system information at all times. If customers live in NRG's service area (3 states) and are interested in signing a 20-year lease, NRG Home Solar is a viable option. With 24/7 monitoring, a production guarantee and a mobile monitoring app, NRG Home Solar earns a fairly high score. However, with reports of poor customer service and a general lack of pertinent information on the company's website, customers may want to take a look at the user reviews below before making a final decision.

After a salesperson visit I was told that I had 90 days to cancel my contract without penalty.  After doing research I noticed that this company is terrible for customer service.  No return emails.  No return phone calls.  after one month I decided to cancel.  Nobody replied to my messages.  I had to go to the Better Business Bureau to file a complaint.  Finally I received a call and the individual started to qoute the Federal Lease Law ????.  I told him we can do this the easy way of I will contact the Attorney General's office.  At this time I was transferred to a cancellation specialist for information.  Several hours later I received an email stated my contract with NRG is cancelled.  Be very careful with salesperson.  Doesn't state all the facts and customer service is the worst company service I have ever dealt with.

My system was sold by American Solar Direct...who went bankrupt. The output guarantee requires constant monitoring. American's user website closed and the link to NRG's user website server does not respond so I haven't seen it yet....if it exists.
I have no way to know if my system meets the electricity generation specified in my contract and I doubt anybody is monitoring it to let me know I have a refund coming if output is low. 
 I live in California which NRG doesn't list as a service area either. We in California need a class action lawyer to help us.
I want out of this lease if the terms are not met!

I have had ground mounted panels in California for two years. They no longer service CA and there is no local contact. person available.
They said they would monitor my panels and guaranteed that I would save money. Last year I had $750 true up with PGE and this year I owe them $1200. 
When I called today I was told my lease states that I am responsible for maintaining the panels but they will check into how they are operating and get back to me.
If they are monitoring my panels and system like I was promised they would know how they are operating and not tell me that it is my responsibility. What a bunch of bs.
I am supposed to be responsible for keeping them clean and free from damage not maintenance and monitoring. There isn't even anywhere to check performance but from PGE according to them I produce way less than I use. Seriously?! Some of the lowest production/highest usage times, I am at work and it's sunny out. I know the dog is not cranking the ac and wasting energy.
They took my rebate money and ran. Now I am stuck in a twenty year lease at S170 a month and paying PGE a nice sum annually at true up plus monthly costs that solar doesn't cover.
At least future potential customers in CA are safe from being screwed since they aren't installing individual home solar here anymore.

This company really sells you that charlatan deal. Stay Far AWAY. They promise that you will have lower bills!! Lies!!! You are locked in with a 20 year contract and you will pay MORE in your bills. I am SO disgusted. I was paying less before I got the panels!!! Totally betrayed my trust...don't make my same mistake. Conveniently went out of BUSINESS!!!

Signed up with NRG -now have solar panels sitting on my roof that are completely useless as I have not heard back for months from anyone to complete the process. I cannot get in contact with anyone who was involved in the initial set up. Numbers have been disconnected and the only valid # reached is in Texas. We were also told that we would receive a $1500 gift card once we signed with them and we never did.  Also told that we would receive a referral fee and no one ever contacted the people we referred. Now they are restructuring and I think they have taken homeowner's rebates without a care.

Salesman (Ralph S) was great until I was set up. Said I would get $100 for any referral that would sit down and talk with him.(no such program). Said I would get $500 for any referral that would contract a set up with them. (there really was such a program but he would never log info for me to get credit). Said company would reimburse me for cost of combining meters (Company said they had no record of that ever being approved but did honor it after I provided the emails in which he stated they had approved it). Office personnel and installation personnel were all very polite, helpful, and a pleasure to deal with but I couldn't recommend the company because of extremely dishonest sales rep.

Used deceptive practice to sell solar farm contract making it a nightmare to desolve the contract.
Check the BBB in your area to see where they really stand.  Can't imagine where the rating on
this page came from.

Just had a couple fast talking sales guys at my door and decided to check them out as they are really staring to push solar in Canada. As suspected, these ratings are about what expected. This exactly why you should never deal with door to door scammers. Buyer beware!

They installed at my home and were great.  On time, took care of all the permits.  I didn't do a thing, and they installed a month earlier then they said.

We have had a 22 panel NRG leased system since Oct. 2011 without a hitch. We prepaid the lease in full. Our electric cost is about $14 average per month. Very happy with it.

DO NOT USE this is the most incompetent company, There is no customer service, and apparently all the EXEC's must be on the take. No one ever returns complaint calls, if i could rip the panels off the roof without damaging my roof i would. Use any other solar company. If anyone else conducted business how NRG does, Im sure the US Attorneys office would investigate

DO NOT do business with this company. It is a scam. Beware of high pressure sales tactics, especially targeting seniors. The company was previously known as "Roof Diagnostics". Non-stop nonsense for over 4 years. In 2012 the panels were installed incorrectly, wired backwards. There was no customer service, no resolution. My electric bills were HIGHER than with public utility. Filed numerous complains with the BBB, no response. Their 3rd party supplier, Kilowatt Financial, is even worse. No customer support, no email address, dead end 800 numbers. Also filed numerous BBB claims with no luck. Still sending bills for $3000. After 4 years they claim to have a lien on our property. No record of a contract or agreement. Meeting with an attorney to file a lawsuit!

Not to mention the former CEO Kelcy Pegler, his father was the owner of Roof Diagnostics who was indicted for insurance fraud in NJ and served jail time!

Common questions

What's the difference between a C corporation and an S corporation?
The IRS allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a "C corporation" or an "S corporation." Income from C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporation.S corporations have only one level of taxation. The shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation, but an S corporation does not pay taxes on its net income. While the S corporation is popular among small business owners, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility.


How does a corporation protect my personal assets?
If a business operates as a corporation, the business owners, called shareholders, are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation. That's because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners. If a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity, then anyone seeking to collect a debt from, or enforce a claim against, a corporation, would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves. They would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation.


Why do many people choose to form their corporation in Delaware?
Delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations. However, the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public. Delaware's laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders, and Delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes. These benefits don't mean much to smaller corporations. Keep in mind that if a corporation forms in Delaware and does business in another state, the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork, and pay any taxes and/or fees required to do business in that state. Given those factors, many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business.


What is an EIN?
An employer identification number (EIN), also known as a federal tax identification number, is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes. It's like a Social Security number, but for a business. In general, most businesses need an EIN. The only reason a business would not get an EIN is if it has only one owner, elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes, and does not want to open a separate business bank account. In this case, the owner would use their Social Security number as the business identifier. However, there are disadvantages to this approach, namely the risk of liability.


How are LLCs taxed?
Unlike a corporation, LLCs have some flexibility in how they're taxed. Depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects, the LLC can be taxed as either a corporation, partnership or as part of the owner's personal tax return (called a "disregarded entity"). By default, an LLC with two or more members are taxed as a partnership, unless they file an IRS Form 8832 to elect to be treated as a corporation. If the LLC has only one owner, it will be taxed as a sole proprietor, unless the owner files Form 8832. It's not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed. You have up to 12 months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision.


What is a registered agent?
A registered agent (sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent) is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business. States require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity. While you can be your own registered agent, there are disadvantages. You have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record. If you miss a filing deadline, you risk being fined or shut down. Our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents, sort through junk mail and keep your information private.


Is a corporation right for me?
It depends on many factors. Get help deciding by answering a few questions here.

The LegalZoom 3-step process was developed by attorneys from some of the most prestigious law firms in America. There are no complex instructions to follow and nothing to download or print. Simply answer a few questions and get started on
              setting up your corporation.

Here's how it works:

Complete the Incorporation Questionnaire
						Complete our simple questionnaire. With LegalZoom, you can choose to form a new corporation or incorporate an existing business. You can also select provisions to help you guard against personal liability.
We Create and File Your Incorporation Papers
						We create and file the Articles of Incorporation (or, in some states, the "Certificate of Formation" or "Certificate of Incorporation") with the Secretary of State (or in some states, the "Department of State" or "Corporation Commission"). We even create company-specific bylaws and organizational minutes.
Final Wrap-Up
						When we receive your filed Articles of Incorporation back from the state, we send them to you along with the rest of your formation documents, as well as easy instructions regarding next steps.

Common questions

What's the difference between a C corporation and an S corporation?
The IRS allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a "C corporation" or an "S corporation." Income from C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporation.S corporations have only one level of taxation. The shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation, but an S corporation does not pay taxes on its net income. While the S corporation is popular among small business owners, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility.


How does a corporation protect my personal assets?
If a business operates as a corporation, the business owners, called shareholders, are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation. That's because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners. If a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity, then anyone seeking to collect a debt from, or enforce a claim against, a corporation, would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves. They would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation.


Why do many people choose to form their corporation in Delaware?
Delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations. However, the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public. Delaware's laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders, and Delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes. These benefits don't mean much to smaller corporations. Keep in mind that if a corporation forms in Delaware and does business in another state, the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork, and pay any taxes and/or fees required to do business in that state. Given those factors, many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business.


What is an EIN?
An employer identification number (EIN), also known as a federal tax identification number, is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes. It's like a Social Security number, but for a business. In general, most businesses need an EIN. The only reason a business would not get an EIN is if it has only one owner, elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes, and does not want to open a separate business bank account. In this case, the owner would use their Social Security number as the business identifier. However, there are disadvantages to this approach, namely the risk of liability.


How are LLCs taxed?
Unlike a corporation, LLCs have some flexibility in how they're taxed. Depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects, the LLC can be taxed as either a corporation, partnership or as part of the owner's personal tax return (called a "disregarded entity"). By default, an LLC with two or more members are taxed as a partnership, unless they file an IRS Form 8832 to elect to be treated as a corporation. If the LLC has only one owner, it will be taxed as a sole proprietor, unless the owner files Form 8832. It's not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed. You have up to 12 months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision.


What is a registered agent?
A registered agent (sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent) is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business. States require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity. While you can be your own registered agent, there are disadvantages. You have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record. If you miss a filing deadline, you risk being fined or shut down. Our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents, sort through junk mail and keep your information private.


Is a corporation right for me?
It depends on many factors. Get help deciding by answering a few questions here.
