REI Names Ivar Chhina New Chief Financial Officer



Recreational Equipment, Inc. (REI) today announced Ivar Chhina has been named the company’s chief financial officer.
Chhina, 46, has served REI as a member of the co-op’s board of directors since March 2006, most recently, as vice chair and as chair of the Audit and Finance Committee.  He will resign his position on the board to serve the co-op as an employee.

“I am delighted to have the opportunity to work more closely with a person so deeply committed to REI’s purpose,” said Sally Jewell. REI’s president and CEO.  “I am fully confident Ivar will complement our team by bringing strong skills in finance and technology, together with vision and commitment, to guide our co-op toward a bright future.”

Chhina brings years of executive, finance and technology experience to REI.  He is currently a project-based partner with a San Francisco Bay Area private equity firm, and is also currently serving as a board member and interim CEO of a Texas-based health care organization.  Previously, Chhina was chairman and CEO of a retail dental practice management franchise with 130 retail locations in eight western states. 

“I am truly excited to join REI in this capacity,” said Chhina.  “To work more directly for an organization I love deeply, in a business that has the potential to impact so many people’s lives in a positive way is the perfect role for me.”

Chhina holds a bachelor’s degree in Economics and Political Science from the University of Nevada – Reno, and a master’s degree in International Policy Studies from Middlebury College Monterey Institute. 

In addition to his professional accomplishments, Chhina has been active in the community, most recently serving in leadership capacities on the board of trustees of Fort Mason Center, which is dedicated to preserving and enhancing the nationally-significant historic Fort Mason site on San Francisco Bay as a National Park Service facility for a broad variety of artistic, cultural, educational and recreational uses by Bay Area residents. 

In addition to mountaineering and rock climbing, Chhina is an avid mountain biker, road cyclist, backpacker and fly fisher, and also enjoys backcountry and cross country skiing.

About REI
REI is a national outdoor retail co-op dedicated to inspiring, educating and outfitting its members and the community for a lifetime of outdoor adventure and stewardship. Founded in 1938 by a group of Pacific Northwest mountaineers seeking quality equipment, REI operates retail stores nationwide, two online stores – http://www.rei.com and http://www.REI-OUTLET.com – and an adventure travel company, REI Adventures. REI offers products from all of the top brands for camping, climbing, cycling, fitness, hiking, paddling, snow sports and travel, including its own line of award-winning outdoor gear and apparel. While anyone may join or shop at REI, members pay a one-time $20 fee and receive a share in the company’s profits through an annual member refund based on their purchases. As an active supporter of the communities in which it does business, REI is committed to promoting environmental stewardship and increasing access to outdoor recreation through education, volunteerism, gear donations and financial contributions.

From 1991 to 2001, Mr. Chhina held senior executive, finance and operational roles with several portfolio companies of Mehta & Company, a private equity firm for which he was an operating partner and is currently a venture partner. Mr. Chhina also serves on the board of Northwestern Management Services LLC, as an advisor to the managing member of JDC Management, LLC, on the board of directors of Spring & Sprout Dental Support Services, LLC, on the board of directors of Stat Health Holding, LLC, on the board and audit and finance committee of the Pacific Science Center, and as a director and past chair of the finance committee of the Washington chapter of The Nature Conservancy, all of which are private or not-for-profit companies. Previously, he held executive positions and directorships with several companies and has served on and chaired boards and committees of charitable and educational entities. Mr. Chhina received an M.A. in international policy studies from the Middlebury College Monterey Institute and a dual B.A. in economics and political science from the University of Nevada-Reno. We believe Mr. Chhina is qualified to serve on our Board of Directors based on his financial expertise, knowledge of the recreational products industry and extensive experience advising, operating and directing businesses across multiple industries.

Posted by SGB Media | Mar 28, 2006 | Outdoor, Outdoor Trade, Uncategorized, Update | 0  | 









Members of REI returned incumbents Chuck Katz and Joanne Harrell, and elected Ivar Chhina to three-year board terms. The election results were announced at the co-op's annual membership meeting March 27. 

Katz, of Palo Alto, Calif., is a manager of a family investment business and charitable foundation. He was formerly executive vice president of Opsware, Inc. and an attorney with Perkins Coie in Seattle. Harrell, 51, of Seattle, is a general manager at Microsoft. She is a board member of AAA of Washington and Visiting Committee for the University of Washington Evans School of Public Affairs. 

Chhina, of Burlingame, Calif., was a self-nominated candidate, serving his first term on the board. He is president and CEO of InterDent, Inc., a dental services company managing 130 affiliated dental offices throughout the western United States. He is also chair of the Audit Committee for the Board of Trustees of the Fort Mason Foundation in San Francisco. 

The REI Board also selected its officers for 2006. Doug Walker, founder and former CEO of WRQ, was elected as chairman. Anne Farrell, president emerita and former president and CEO of the Seattle Foundation, was elected vice chairman. 

In other board activity, incumbent director Bill Britt, whose term expired in 2006, was appointed to complete the one year remaining on the term of Catherine Walker, who resigned when she was hired last month as REI vice president, general counsel. Britt, of Anchorage, Alaska, is health environment and safety manager for Chevron Alaska.
