Again, with AEGON as his partner, he started a business for them called Clearwater Financial Marketing.  This operation is currently offering a Life Settlements program as well as a new product created by Jack and WRL called the WRL Benefactor.

Clearwater Financial Marketing LLC



 
The development of a thriving secondary market for life insurance policies has introduced a new planning dimension for financial advisors.  Through the ability to offer their senior clients a new type of “exit plan” from unwanted, unneeded or unaffordable life insurance policies, financial professionals are better equipped to meet their fiduciary obligation.
Studies have shown that many senior policy owners who have engaged in a life settlement transaction often rely on the advice from their financial professional before deploying their sale proceeds to other asset management vehicles, long term care coverage or even to a more up-to-date, lower cost life insurance policy.
A life settlement is a sophisticated process that requires credible evaluation of product suitability, full disclosure, and affirmation by the client. If professionals lack the requisite settlement expertise, it is advised that they seek guidance from, and delegate transaction duties to, a reliable and trustworthy firm that specializes in the process. Financial professionals across the country have relied on Clearwater Financial Marketing, LLC (CFM) to act as their “back-office” partner in tending to the often-tedious details of the life settlement transaction process. CFM provides licensing help, initial case screening, marketability review, bidding management, and assistance during the complex closing phase for the professional advisor.
      Our background in the life insurance and securities industries serve as a backdrop to our life settlement business model. We pledge that each and every transaction will be conducted in an ethical, legal and economically responsible manner.

Life Settlement amounts are based on numerous factors. Actual results may vary. Some or all of the proceeds of a life settlement may be taxable under federal or state income tax laws. Advice from a professional tax advisor is recommended. The number of bidders for a policy may be limited; proceeds from sales of similar policies may vary and may be subject to claims of creditors. Receipt of proceeds may impact eligibility for government benefits and entitlements. Prior to sale, the insured should consider the continued need for coverage, impact to estate plans, availability of insurance, cost of comparable coverage or tax implications.
