The system supports dynamic generation and real time dissemination of essential information to incident responders, such as the first responders to a disaster.The incident playbook enables the incident planner to design a real-world plan containing only the information relevant at the time of need to a particular class of responders. The incident playbook becomes in one sense a derivative work of multiple, lengthy recovery plans, highlighting only the most important steps to be carried out immediately after a crisis event.  These may include, for a specific response team:Who do we contact as essential team members? How do contact these members?What other resources do we need immediately?What do we need to do as the essential next steps? How do we communicate with outside emergency responders?In addition, each type of disaster scenario requires different responses.  A response to a hurricane will likely be different than a response to a power outage. Therefore it would be preferred if such plans could be crafted in advance of a specific event type, depending on the disaster event type.Inventors: Gary Cohen, Derek Bluestone, Bhuvana Sundaresan, Frank Buck, Patrick OlivaresCertificationsABCPDRI InternationalAugust 2012  –  PresentModel ThinkingCourseraGamificationCourseraLeading Strategic Innovation in OrganizationsCourseraSocial Network AnalysisCourseraAn Introduction to MarketingCourseraOrganizational AnalysisCourseraCertificate of Completion in Leading with Emotional IntelligenceAmerican Management AssociationR ProgrammingCourseraMarch 2015  –  PresentMachine Learning Foundations: A Case Study ApproachCoursera Course Certificates, License 978R9FQPLYEFMay 2016  –  PresentMachine Learning: RegressionCoursera Course Certificates, License 7N8WEUEAFC4GJune 2016  –  PresentMachine Learning: ClassificationCoursera Course Certificates, License HWGNNY9ME7USAugust 2016  –  PresentSkillsSoftware Project ManagementSoftware DevelopmentEnterprise SoftwareSaaSAgile MethodologiesDesign PatternsEvolutionary AlgorithmsScrumOracleArchitectureCRMDatabasesManagementLeadershipWeb ServicesSee 7+Disaster RecoveryStrategyProject ManagementStart-upsArchitecturesCustomer Relationship Management (CRM)Software as a Service (SaaS)See lessHow's this translation?Great•Has errorsThanks for your help!OrganizationsUniversity of Michigan Club of PhiladelphiaScholarship Committee Co-ChairStarting 1999I am responsible for publicizing and awarding an alumni-funded scholarship to a Philadelphia-area high school senior who is admitted to and decides to attend the University of Michigan.

(more...)To deliberately prevent someone from inheriting something. This is usually done by a provision in a will stating that someone who would ordinarily inherit property -- a close family member, for example -- should not receive it. In most states, you cannot completely disinherit your spouse; a surviving spouse has the right to claim a portion (usually one-third to one-half) of the deceased spouse's estate. With a few exceptions, however, you can expressly disinherit children.

STATUTORY SHAREThe portion of a deceased person's estate that a spouse is entitled to claim under state law. The statutory share is usually one-third or one-half of the deceas... (more...)The portion of a deceased person's estate that a spouse is entitled to claim under state law. The statutory share is usually one-third or one-half of the deceased spouse's property, but in some states the exact amount of the spouse's share depends on whether or not the couple has young children and, in a few states, on how long the couple was married. In most states, if the deceased spouse left a will, the surviving spouse must choose either what the will provides or the statutory share. Sometimes the statutory share is known by its more arcane legal name, dower and curtesy, or as a forced or elective share.

SUCCESSOR TRUSTEEThe person or institution who takes over the management of trust property when the original trustee has died or become incapacitated.

GRANTOR RETAINED INCOME TRUSTIrrevocable trusts designed to save on estate tax. There are several kinds; with all of them, you keep income from trust property, or use of that property, for ... (more...)Irrevocable trusts designed to save on estate tax. There are several kinds; with all of them, you keep income from trust property, or use of that property, for a period of years. When the trust ends, the property goes to the final beneficiaries you've named. These trusts are for people who have enough wealth to feel comfortable giving away a substantial hunk of property. They come in three flavors: Grantor-Retained Annuity Trusts (GRATs), Grantor-Retained Unitrusts (GRUTs) and Grantor-Retained Income Trusts (GRITs).

TRUSTEEThe person who manages assets owned by a trust under the terms of the trust document. A trustee's purpose is to safeguard the trust and distribute trust income ... (more...)The person who manages assets owned by a trust under the terms of the trust document. A trustee's purpose is to safeguard the trust and distribute trust income or principal as directed in the trust document. With a simple probate-avoidance living trust, the person who creates the trust is also the trustee.

POWER OF APPOINTMENTThe legal authority to decide who will receive someone else's property, usually property held in a trust. Most trustees can distribute the income from a trust o... (more...)The legal authority to decide who will receive someone else's property, usually property held in a trust. Most trustees can distribute the income from a trust only according to the terms of the trust, but a trustee with a power of appointment can choose the beneficiaries, sometimes from a list of candidates specified by the grantor. For example, Karin creates a trust with power of appointment to benefit either the local art museum, symphony, library or park, depending on the trustee's assessment of need.

RESIDUARY BENEFICIARYA person who receives any property by a will or trust that is not specifically left to another designated beneficiary. For example, if Antonio makes a will leav... (more...)A person who receives any property by a will or trust that is not specifically left to another designated beneficiary. For example, if Antonio makes a will leaving his home to Edwina and the remainder of his property to Elmo, then Elmo is the residuary beneficiary.

LIFE INSURANCEA contract in which an insurance company agrees to pay money to a designated beneficiary upon the death of the policy holder. In exchange, the policyholder pays... (more...)A contract in which an insurance company agrees to pay money to a designated beneficiary upon the death of the policy holder. In exchange, the policyholder pays a regularly scheduled fee, known as the insurance premiums. The purpose of life insurance is to provide financial support to those who survive the policyholder, such as family members or business partners. When the policyholder dies, the insurance proceeds pass to the beneficiaries free of probate, though they are counted for federal estate tax purposes. group life insurance Life insurance available through an employer or association that covers participating employees and members under one master insurance policy. Most group life insurance policies are term insurance policies, that terminate when the member or employee reaches a certain age or leaves the organization and do not accumulate any cash surrender value. term life insurance No-frills life insurance, with neither cash surrender value nor loan value (an amount that can be used as collateral for a loan). Term life insurance provides a pre-set amount of coverage if the policyholder dies during the period of time specified in the policy. Policyholders usually have the option to renew at the end of the term for the period of years specified in the policy. Unlike whole life insurance, premiums generally increase as the insured person gets older and the risk of death increases.universal life insurance A type of whole life insurance that offers some additional features and advantages. Like whole life insurance, universal life insurance accumulates cash value through investment of the premium payments. The unique feature of universal life insurance is that it has variable premiums, benefits and payment schedules, all of which are tied to market interest rates and the performance of the investment portfolio. Also, universal life plicies normally provide you with more consumer information. For example, you are told how much of your policy payments goes for insurance company overhead expenses, reserves and policy proceed payments, and how much is retained and invested for your savings. This information isn't usually provided with whole life policies.variable life insurance A type of whole life insurance in which the amount of death benefits varies, depending on the performance of investments. The insurance company places some or all of the fixed premium payments into an investment account; some companies let the insured person decide how the money is invested. The policyholder bears the risk of investment losses, though there is a guaranteed minimum benefit payment. One benefit of variable insurance is that interest and dividend income from the investment account is not taxed until it is paid out to the policyholder.variable universal life insurance A type of whole life insurance that provides greater potential for financial gain--and brings greater risks. Like universal life insurance, variable universal life insurance offers flexible premiums, payment schedules and benefits. But variable universal life policies are riskier because the premiums are invested in stocks, rather than more predictable money market accounts and bonds. Also called universal variable life insurance.whole life insurance Life insurance that provides coverage for the entire life of the policyholder, who pays the same fixed premium throughout his or her life. The policy builds up cash reserves that may be paid out to the policyholder when he or she surrenders or partially surrenders the policy or uses the cash reserves to fund low-interest loans. The annual increase in the cash value of the policy is not taxed. If the policyholder surrenders the policy, a portion of the payment is not taxable. Also called straight life insurance or ordinary life insurance.

PERSONAL PROPERTYAll property other than land and buildings attached to land. Cars, bank accounts, wages, securities, a small business, furniture, insurance policies, jewelry, p... (more...)All property other than land and buildings attached to land. Cars, bank accounts, wages, securities, a small business, furniture, insurance policies, jewelry, patents, pets and season baseball tickets are all examples of personal property. Personal property may also be called personal effects, movable property, goods and chattel, and personalty. Compare real estate.

Specialties & ExpertiseDr. Gary Cohen has the following 7 areas of expertise and  1 specialty.                     Family Medicine
    A family practitioner is a doctor who specializes in caring for people of all ages, at all stages of life. Rather than focusing on the treatment of one disease or patient population, family practitioners are often the doctors that people see for their everyday ailments, like cold and flu or respiratory infections, and health screenings. When necessary, family practitioners will provide referrals for conditions that require the expertise of another specialist.


    The doctors may also provide physicals, inoculations, prenatal care, treat chronic diseases, like diabetes and asthma, and provide advice on disease prevention.
