Astrophysics[edit]
Hart published in 1975 a detailed examination of the Fermi paradox:[2] the contrast between the extreme likelihood of extraterrestrial life somewhere in the universe and the total absence of any evidence for this. Hart’s work has since become a theoretical reference point for much of the research into what is now sometimes known as the Fermi-Hart paradox.[3] Concerning Hart's contributions to the study of the paradox, Geoffrey A. Landis writes: "A more proper name for [the paradox] would be the Fermi-Hart paradox, since while Fermi is credited with first asking the question, Hart was the first to do a rigorous analysis showing that the problem is not trivial, and also the first to publish his results".[4] Robert H. Gray argues that the term Fermi paradox is a misnomer; he argues that it is not the work of Fermi, nor is it an actual paradox (rather an argument).[5] He views Hart as the proper originator of this argument, in his 1975 paper. Gray therefore proposes, that instead of the (standard, but in his view incorrect) name Fermi paradox, it should be known as the Hart-Tipler argument–acknowledging Hart's priority as the argument's originator, but also acknowledging Frank J. Tipler's substantial extension of Hart's arguments in his 1980 paper Extraterrestrial intelligent beings do not exist.[6]
Hart is an advocate of the Rare Earth hypothesis; he proposed a very narrow habitable zone based on climate studies. He advocated for this hypothesis in the influential book which he co-edited, "Extraterrestrials: Where are They",[7] in particular in the chapter he contributed to it "Atmospheric Evolution, the Drake Equation and DNA: Sparse Life in an Infinite Universe".[7]:215–225
History[edit]
Hart's first book was The 100: A Ranking of the Most Influential Persons in History (1978), which has sold more than 500,000 copies and been translated into 15 languages.[8] The first person on Hart's list was Muhammad, chosen over Jesus or Moses.[9][10] Hart attributes this to the fact that Muhammad was "supremely successful" in both the religious and secular realms. He also accredits Muhammad for his role in the development of Islam, far more influential than Jesus' contribution to the development of Christianity. Hart claims that St. Paul was more pivotal than Jesus to the growth of Christianity.
His fourth book, Understanding Human History, was called "racist" by the Southern Poverty Law Center.[11]
Racial conferences[edit]
In 1996, Hart addressed a conference organized by Jared Taylor's white separatist organization, New Century Foundation, publisher of American Renaissance. He proposed partitioning the United States into four states: a white state, a black state, a Hispanic state, and an integrated mixed-race state.[1]
At the 2006 American Renaissance conference, Hart, who is Jewish, had a public confrontation with David Duke, the former Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan and former Louisiana state representative, over Duke's antisemitic remarks. Accounts of the conference say that Hart stood up, called Duke a Nazi (with expletive) and stormed out.[12][13]
Hart organized a conference held in Baltimore in 2009 with the title, Preserving Western Civilization. It was billed as addressing the need to defend "America's Judeo-Christian heritage and European identity". Invited speakers included: Lawrence Auster, Peter Brimelow, Steven Farron, Julia Gorin, Lino A. Graglia, Henry C. Harpending, Roger D. McGrath, Pat Richardson, J. Philippe Rushton, Srdja Trifković, and Brenda Walker.

Hart published in 1975 a detailed examination of the Fermi paradox:[2] the contrast between the extreme likelihood of extraterrestrial life somewhere in the universe and the total absence of any evidence for this. Hart’s work has since become a theoretical reference point for much of the research into what is now sometimes known as the Fermi-Hart paradox.[3] Concerning Hart's contributions to the study of the paradox, Geoffrey A. Landis writes: "A more proper name for [the paradox] would be the Fermi-Hart paradox, since while Fermi is credited with first asking the question, Hart was the first to do a rigorous analysis showing that the problem is not trivial, and also the first to publish his results".[4] Robert H. Gray argues that the term Fermi paradox is a misnomer; he argues that it is not the work of Fermi, nor is it an actual paradox (rather an argument).[5] He views Hart as the proper originator of this argument, in his 1975 paper. Gray therefore proposes, that instead of the (standard, but in his view incorrect) name Fermi paradox, it should be known as the Hart-Tipler argument–acknowledging Hart's priority as the argument's originator, but also acknowledging Frank J. Tipler's substantial extension of Hart's arguments in his 1980 paper Extraterrestrial intelligent beings do not exist.[6]
Hart is an advocate of the Rare Earth hypothesis; he proposed a very narrow habitable zone based on climate studies. He advocated for this hypothesis in the influential book which he co-edited, "Extraterrestrials: Where are They",[7] in particular in the chapter he contributed to it "Atmospheric Evolution, the Drake Equation and DNA: Sparse Life in an Infinite Universe".[7]:215–225
History[edit]
Hart's first book was The 100: A Ranking of the Most Influential Persons in History (1978), which has sold more than 500,000 copies and been translated into 15 languages.[8] The first person on Hart's list was Muhammad, chosen over Jesus or Moses.[9][10] Hart attributes this to the fact that Muhammad was "supremely successful" in both the religious and secular realms. He also accredits Muhammad for his role in the development of Islam, far more influential than Jesus' contribution to the development of Christianity. Hart claims that St. Paul was more pivotal than Jesus to the growth of Christianity.
His fourth book, Understanding Human History, was called "racist" by the Southern Poverty Law Center.[11]
Racial conferences[edit]
In 1996, Hart addressed a conference organized by Jared Taylor's white separatist organization, New Century Foundation, publisher of American Renaissance. He proposed partitioning the United States into four states: a white state, a black state, a Hispanic state, and an integrated mixed-race state.[1]
At the 2006 American Renaissance conference, Hart, who is Jewish, had a public confrontation with David Duke, the former Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan and former Louisiana state representative, over Duke's antisemitic remarks. Accounts of the conference say that Hart stood up, called Duke a Nazi (with expletive) and stormed out.[12][13]
Hart organized a conference held in Baltimore in 2009 with the title, Preserving Western Civilization. It was billed as addressing the need to defend "America's Judeo-Christian heritage and European identity". Invited speakers included: Lawrence Auster, Peter Brimelow, Steven Farron, Julia Gorin, Lino A. Graglia, Henry C. Harpending, Roger D. McGrath, Pat Richardson, J. Philippe Rushton, Srdja Trifković, and Brenda Walker.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

Michael H. Hart (born April 27, 1932) is an American astrophysicist and author, most notably of The 100: A Ranking of the Most Influential Persons in History. He has described himself as a white separatist[1] and is active in white separatist causes.

Astrophysics[edit]
Hart published in 1975 a detailed examination of the Fermi paradox:[2] the contrast between the extreme likelihood of extraterrestrial life somewhere in the universe and the total absence of any evidence for this. Hart’s work has since become a theoretical reference point for much of the research into what is now sometimes known as the Fermi-Hart paradox.[3] Concerning Hart's contributions to the study of the paradox, Geoffrey A. Landis writes: "A more proper name for [the paradox] would be the Fermi-Hart paradox, since while Fermi is credited with first asking the question, Hart was the first to do a rigorous analysis showing that the problem is not trivial, and also the first to publish his results".[4] Robert H. Gray argues that the term Fermi paradox is a misnomer; he argues that it is not the work of Fermi, nor is it an actual paradox (rather an argument).[5] He views Hart as the proper originator of this argument, in his 1975 paper. Gray therefore proposes, that instead of the (standard, but in his view incorrect) name Fermi paradox, it should be known as the Hart-Tipler argument–acknowledging Hart's priority as the argument's originator, but also acknowledging Frank J. Tipler's substantial extension of Hart's arguments in his 1980 paper Extraterrestrial intelligent beings do not exist.[6]
Hart is an advocate of the Rare Earth hypothesis; he proposed a very narrow habitable zone based on climate studies. He advocated for this hypothesis in the influential book which he co-edited, "Extraterrestrials: Where are They",[7] in particular in the chapter he contributed to it "Atmospheric Evolution, the Drake Equation and DNA: Sparse Life in an Infinite Universe".[7]:215–225
History[edit]
Hart's first book was The 100: A Ranking of the Most Influential Persons in History (1978), which has sold more than 500,000 copies and been translated into 15 languages.[8] The first person on Hart's list was Muhammad, chosen over Jesus or Moses.[9][10] Hart attributes this to the fact that Muhammad was "supremely successful" in both the religious and secular realms. He also accredits Muhammad for his role in the development of Islam, far more influential than Jesus' contribution to the development of Christianity. Hart claims that St. Paul was more pivotal than Jesus to the growth of Christianity.
His fourth book, Understanding Human History, was called "racist" by the Southern Poverty Law Center.[11]
Racial conferences[edit]
In 1996, Hart addressed a conference organized by Jared Taylor's white separatist organization, New Century Foundation, publisher of American Renaissance. He proposed partitioning the United States into four states: a white state, a black state, a Hispanic state, and an integrated mixed-race state.[1]
At the 2006 American Renaissance conference, Hart, who is Jewish, had a public confrontation with David Duke, the former Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan and former Louisiana state representative, over Duke's antisemitic remarks. Accounts of the conference say that Hart stood up, called Duke a Nazi (with expletive) and stormed out.[12][13]
Hart organized a conference held in Baltimore in 2009 with the title, Preserving Western Civilization. It was billed as addressing the need to defend "America's Judeo-Christian heritage and European identity". Invited speakers included: Lawrence Auster, Peter Brimelow, Steven Farron, Julia Gorin, Lino A. Graglia, Henry C. Harpending, Roger D. McGrath, Pat Richardson, J. Philippe Rushton, Srdja Trifković, and Brenda Walker.

Testimonials
Nice product.  Easy to use!
Searched on the web and decided to take a chance with getting something to do HART on my PC instead of having to lug around a HART communicator.  We are a Systems Integrator that performs field commissioning all over the world.  My main expertise is PLC programming and field commissioning.  I have to lug around cables, tools, laptops, etc. and the DevCom2000 software and HART modem work out well for me when I do checks from devices back to the PLC.  Since traveling with tools and equipment by airline is a hassle these days, this system has filled a big void without requiring additional baggage.
Your service is very good and your ability to make the customer feel like they are important goes beyond most of the vendors that I deal with.
A lot of the devices I check out are not in easily accessible areas on the skid.  That makes the HART Bluetooth modem especially appealing.  I can climb up to the device, connect it up and it enables me to keep my computer on the ground and not in awkward positions.  Since my laptop is my livelihood, keeping it safe, sound, and secure is very important.
Used every day since purchase.  Very useful!
The system has been one of the best field service aids that I have purchased.  Previously we had to share HART communicators and we only had two.  There are six people in our organization that do the majority of field work, so we were priority shipping the communicators all over the country.  The DevCom2000 software and HART modem bring the system price to the level where everyone in a field service organization can have one.  Great product, great support!
My company has several of the systems now and they become a HOT item when going out to the field.  It has saved us many hours of checkout/startup time.
I want to thank ProComSol because the factory support I have received has been outstanding.  This is one of the things that I like to tell everyone when showing the system because good factory support is becoming harder to obtain.  Keep up the good work!

Prof. Michael H. Hart’s speech given at the Second American Renaissance Conference in 1996. Prof. Hart outlines a practical means of dividing the United States into voluntary racial and non-racial states.


Second American Renaissance Conference (1996)
Louisville, Kentucky


The 1996 AR Conference was ground-breaking in several respects. The Civil Rights Industry, Inc. and the newsmedia sought—for the first, but not the last time—to have it cancelled or moved. It also was the proof that the talented and high-quality presentations of 1994 could be repeated.

JOIN THE LISTClickFIND A STOREThe 100: A Ranking Of The Most Influential Persons In Historyby Hart, Michael H.In 1978, when Michael Hart's controversial book The 100 was first published, critics objected that Hart had the nerve not only to select who he thought were the most influential people in history, but also to rank them according to their importance.Needless to say, the critics were wrong, and to date over 60,000 copies of the book have sold. Hart believed that in the intervening years the influence of some of his original selections had grown or lessened and that new names loomed large on the world stage. Thus, the publication of this revised and updated edition of The 100.As before, Hart's yardstick is influence: not the greatest people, but the most influential, the people who swayed the destinies of millions of human beings, determined the rise and fall of civilizations, changed the course of history.With incisive biographies, Hart describes their careers and contributions. Explaining his ratings, he presents a new perspective on history, gathering together the vital facts about the world's greatest religious and political leaders, inventors, writers, philosophers, explorers, artists, and innovators - from Asoka to Zoroaster. Most of the biographies are accompanied by photographs or sketches.Hart's selections may be surprising to some. Neither Jesus nor Marx, but Muhammad, is designated as the most influential person in human history. The writer's arguments may challenge and perhaps convince readers, but whether or not they agree with him, his manner of ranking is both informative and entertaining.The 100, revised and updated, is truly a monumental work. It promises to be just as controversial, just as thought-provoking, and just as successful as its predecessor - a perfect addition to any history or philosophy reference section.Historical, GeneralCondition: --HPB condition ratingsNew: Item is brand new, unused and unmarked, in flawless condition.Fine/Like New (F): No defects, little usage.
