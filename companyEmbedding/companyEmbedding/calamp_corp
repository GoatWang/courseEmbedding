Dashboard

 
Click image to enlarge.
You’ve financed many vehicles, and you need the right tools to locate each one at any given time. LenderOutlook’s Dashboard is your ultimate GPS communication and command center. From this single screen, you can find any vehicle based on its location.
Features:

Search for any asset and view its location
View a device’s last command
Perform administrative tasks, such as setting up pings per vehicle and editing vehicle information
View vehicle location history reports
Send commands to vehicles such as locate now, disable starter and more




Schedule Actions

 
Click image to enlarge.
Each GPS device automatically checks in every 24 hours by sending LenderOutlook its current location. But with the Schedule Actions module, you can locate vehicles more often or analyze other data, such as a vehicle’s fastest speed of the day.
Simply select multiple devices and schedule them to perform the same action at the same time each day to increase your productivity and your awareness.
Features:

Schedule actions for one vehicle or multiple vehicles at one time
View all vehicles with the same scheduled action
Enable or disable a vehicle’s starter at a specific date and time improving repossession




Notifications

 
Click image to enlarge.
Providing financing options to certain buyers is risky business. You need to know when your buyers miss payments or worse—when one of your vehicles hits the impound lot.
The Notifications module sends vital alerts via text message or email. When a vehicle triggers a specific action, including reaching certain speeds, you receive a notification. You can schedule notifications for multiple vehicles and customize who receives them.
Features:

Schedule notifications for one vehicle or multiple vehicles at one time
Choose the notification delivery method you prefer: text or email
View all vehicles with the same automatic notification




Geozones

 
Click image to enlarge.
Where exactly are your leased or financed vehicles going? You’ll always know with LenderOutlook’s Geozone module. Geozones are electronic boundaries defined by shape, not mileage. You can create geozones using rectangles, circles or a combination of both. Simply select the shape you want within the Geozone tab and draw it on the map.
For example, if you want to know when a vehicle arrives at an impound lot, just draw a geozone around the lot, then set up a notification to alert you when the vehicle arrives.
Features:

Configure up to 10 geozones per device
Create a geozone around a specific address, such as an impound lot
Set up alerts to notify you when vehicles enter/leave geozones




Reports Module

 
Click image to enlarge.
What if you could see the latest activity for every GPS device—all in one place? LenderOutlook’s Reports module puts all of this data—and more—at your fingertips.
LenderOutlook provides 22 reports to help you protect your leased and financed vehicles. You can schedule these reports to generate only once, once a week or on a specific day every month. No matter how often you schedule the report, you can always set it for automatic delivery at the same time every day.
Features:

Generate reports to quickly view vehicle data
Run reports for your main account or any sub-account
Schedule automatic delivery of any report
Export reports to CSV or PDF




Payment Reminder

 
Click image to enlarge.
You don’t want your customers to miss payments. You don’t want to have to disable a vehicle’s starter. And you certainly don’t want to have to pick up a vehicle from the impound lot. The Payment Reminder* tab in LenderOutlook helps you avoid all of these scenarios.
With Payment Reminder, you simply select a vehicle, enter the account details and add the borrower’s contact information. Then, payment reminders will be sent to the borrower via text or email. You can also schedule a buzz reminder when the ignition is turned on or disable the vehicle’s starter if payment is not received.
Features:

Create up to three payment notifications per vehicle
Send payment notifications via text message, email or both
Configure vehicle alert options such as buzzer or disable starter
Set insurance payment notifications

*Payment Reminder is available with the LUM-710 and LMU-810 devices.

FLEXIBILITY
The TTU-2840XTreme employs CalAmp’s industry leading on-board alert engine, PEG™ (Programmable Event Generator). This advanced engine monitors external conditions and supports customer-defined expectation-based rules to help meet the needs of your application. PEG continuously monitors the vehicle environment and responds instantaneously to pre-defined threshold conditions related to time, date, motion, location, geo-zone, input,and other event combinations. With PEG, your unique application will meet demanding customer requirements. This behavior can be programmed by CalAmp before shipment at a customer’s facility, or over-the-air once the unit has been fielded.


OVER-THE-AIR SERVICEABILITY
The TTU-2840XTreme also leverages CalAmp’s industry leading over-the-air device management and maintenance system, PULS™ (Programming, Updates, and Logistics System). Configuration parameters, PEG rules, and firmware can all be updated over the air. PULS offers out-of-the-box hands free configuration and automatic post-installation upgrades. You can also monitor unit health status across your customers’ fleets to quickly identify issues before they become expensive problems.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
