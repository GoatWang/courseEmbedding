Jacqueline K. Barton (born New York City, NY), is an American chemist. She worked as a Professor of Chemistry at Hunter College (1980–82), and at Columbia University (1983–89) before joining the California Institute of Technology (1989-to the present). In 1997 she became the Arthur and Marian Hanisch Memorial Professor of Chemistry and in 2009, the Chair of the Division of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering at Caltech. She currently is the John G. Kirkwood and Arthur A. Noyes Professor and Norman Davidson Leadership Chair of the Division of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering.
Barton studies the chemical and physical properties of DNA and their roles in biological activities. The primary focus of her research is transverse electron transport along double-stranded DNA, its implications in the biology of DNA damage and repair, and its potential for materials sciences applications such as targeted chemotherapeutic treatments for cancer. Among many other awards, Barton has received the 2011 National Medal of Science, the 2015 American Institute of Chemists Gold Medal and the 2015 Priestley Medal.

Education[edit]
Jacqueline Kapelman attended Riverdale Country School for Girls in Riverdale, New York, where her math teacher, Mrs. Rosenberg, insisted that she be allowed to take calculus at the boys' school. Her interest in chemistry began at Barnard College, where she studied physical chemistry with Bernice Segal. She loved laboratory work and chemical transformations and found Segal an inspiration as a teacher.[2][3] During her last year at Barnard she married Don Barton,[4] receiving her B.A. from Barnard College as Jacqueline Kapelman Barton, summa cum laude, in 1974.
She then studied inorganic chemistry at Columbia University under the supervision of Stephen J. Lippard.[5][6][7] While at Columbia she began studying transition-metal complexes and their possible applications to chemotherapy.[2] She earned a PhD in Inorganic Chemistry in 1979, addressing The structure and chemical reactivity of a blue platinum complex : the interaction of antitumor latinum drugs and matallointercalation reagent with nucleic acids.[8]

After earning her Ph.D. from Columbia in 1979, Barton held post-doctoral appointments at Bell Labs and Yale University, where she worked with Robert G. Shulman. She used nuclear magnetic resonance imaging technology to examine the metabolism of yeast cells.[4] Barton became a Professor of Chemistry at Hunter College from 1980–82, and began to develop her own laboratory, the Barton Research Group.[4] While at Hunter she studied the interactions of zinc ions with DNA, and later of ruthenium(II) and cobalt(III) complexes with DNA. This enabled her to roughly model complexes on a DNA helix and to begin studying the photophysical and photochemical properties related to enantiomers.[2]
In the 1980s she moved to Columbia University, where she taught from 1983 to 1989.[4] She became a full professor in 1986[9] and was the first woman to receive tenure in the Chemistry department at Columbia.[2] Her research focused on the use of organo-ruthenium complexes to examine the physical structure of DNA. With Nicholas Turro and Vijay Kumar she studied the interactions of ruthenium phenanthroline complexes and DNA and was able to design binding molecules targeted to specific DNA sequences.[2] Photosensitive ruthenium complexes would glow brightly when they attached to the DNA double helix. When rhodium complexes were attached to the DNA, they would attract the electron causing the glow, and "turn off" the effect. During her time at Columbia, Barton obtained two patents for this method of analyzing DNA structure.[10]
In 1989, Barton moved to Caltech,[9] where her research has focused on charge transport in DNA. By using specially-designed chiral metal complexes as probes of DNA she has been able to study how DNA is damaged and repaired.[9] In DNA-based diagnostic tests, complexes are used to determine whether electrons can flow across the DNA. If an electron could not move along the DNA, the DNA would continue to glow, indicating that there was damage in the DNA genetic molecule.[10]
The research that Barton, Catherine J. Murphy, Megan Núñez and others have done at Caltech has supported the idea of fast long-range electron transfer over DNA, challenging accepted scientific views and causing considerable controversy.[2] Based on years of studies, Barton and her group theorize that DNA operates like a wire, supporting a type of long-range signaling that enables repair proteins to detect and correct mistakes in DNA. This view of DNA is deeper and more dynamic than previous views of DNA as a static library.[11]
Understanding the mediation of electron-transfer chemistry by the DNA double helix has laid a foundation for the development of new diagnostic tools and for the possible design of novel chemotherapeutics.[2][12] Barton, Erik Holmlin, Shana Kelley, and Mike Hill created the company GeneOhm Sciences to explore the development of sensitive diagnostics for detecting DNA mismatches. The company has since been acquired by BD Diagnostics.[2]
Barton has taught more than 100 graduate and postdoctoral students, many of whom are women.[12] Recognized as a "superb role model, not just for young women but for all young scientists",[9] Barton advises others that "the best thing that I can do for women in science is first to do good science".[2] She became the Arthur and Marian Hanisch Memorial Professor of Chemistry in 1997.[13] She was named chair of the Division of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering of California Institute of Technology, effective July 1, 2009.[4]
Barton has been a Member of the Board of Dow Chemical since 1993.[14] She has also served on the Gilead Sciences Scientific Advisory Board (1989-2008).[4]
In 1990, she married Peter Dervan, a fellow chemist and professor at Caltech,[15] who is also a National Medal of Science winner.[16] She has two children, a daughter, Elizabeth, and a stepson Andrew.[17]
Research summary[edit]




Barton (third right) receiving the National Medal of Science at the White House in 2011


Barton introduced the application of transition metal complexes to probe recognition and reactions of double helical DNA. She has designed chiral metal complexes which mimic the properties of DNA-binding proteins, allowing other researchers the capability to simulate and analyze experiments in this nature. Barton additionally established that DNA charge transport chemistry is extremely sensitive to intervening perturbations in the DNA base stack, as with single base mismatches or lesions. This discovery has been a cornerstone for the development of DNA-based electrochemical sensors.
Awards and honors[edit]
Barton was awarded the National Medal of Science by Barack Obama in 2011, "For discovery of a new property of the DNA helix, long-range electron transfer, and for showing that electron transfer depends upon stacking of the base pairs and DNA dynamics. Her experiments reveal a strategy for how DNA repair proteins locate DNA lesions and demonstrate a biological role for DNA-mediated charge transfer."[18] Other awards include:

Jacqueline K. Barton (born New York City, NY), is an American chemist. She worked as a Professor of Chemistry at Hunter College (1980–82), and at Columbia University (1983–89) before joining the California Institute of Technology (1989-to the present). In 1997 she became the Arthur and Marian Hanisch Memorial Professor of Chemistry and in 2009, the Chair of the Division of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering at Caltech. She currently is the John G. Kirkwood and Arthur A. Noyes Professor and Norman Davidson Leadership Chair of the Division of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering.
Barton studies the chemical and physical properties of DNA and their roles in biological activities. The primary focus of her research is transverse electron transport along double-stranded DNA, its implications in the biology of DNA damage and repair, and its potential for materials sciences applications such as targeted chemotherapeutic treatments for cancer. Among many other awards, Barton has received the 2011 National Medal of Science, the 2015 American Institute of Chemists Gold Medal and the 2015 Priestley Medal.

Education[edit]
Jacqueline Kapelman attended Riverdale Country School for Girls in Riverdale, New York, where her math teacher, Mrs. Rosenberg, insisted that she be allowed to take calculus at the boys' school. Her interest in chemistry began at Barnard College, where she studied physical chemistry with Bernice Segal. She loved laboratory work and chemical transformations and found Segal an inspiration as a teacher.[2][3] During her last year at Barnard she married Don Barton,[4] receiving her B.A. from Barnard College as Jacqueline Kapelman Barton, summa cum laude, in 1974.
She then studied inorganic chemistry at Columbia University under the supervision of Stephen J. Lippard.[5][6][7] While at Columbia she began studying transition-metal complexes and their possible applications to chemotherapy.[2] She earned a PhD in Inorganic Chemistry in 1979, addressing The structure and chemical reactivity of a blue platinum complex : the interaction of antitumor latinum drugs and matallointercalation reagent with nucleic acids.[8]

After earning her Ph.D. from Columbia in 1979, Barton held post-doctoral appointments at Bell Labs and Yale University, where she worked with Robert G. Shulman. She used nuclear magnetic resonance imaging technology to examine the metabolism of yeast cells.[4] Barton became a Professor of Chemistry at Hunter College from 1980–82, and began to develop her own laboratory, the Barton Research Group.[4] While at Hunter she studied the interactions of zinc ions with DNA, and later of ruthenium(II) and cobalt(III) complexes with DNA. This enabled her to roughly model complexes on a DNA helix and to begin studying the photophysical and photochemical properties related to enantiomers.[2]
In the 1980s she moved to Columbia University, where she taught from 1983 to 1989.[4] She became a full professor in 1986[9] and was the first woman to receive tenure in the Chemistry department at Columbia.[2] Her research focused on the use of organo-ruthenium complexes to examine the physical structure of DNA. With Nicholas Turro and Vijay Kumar she studied the interactions of ruthenium phenanthroline complexes and DNA and was able to design binding molecules targeted to specific DNA sequences.[2] Photosensitive ruthenium complexes would glow brightly when they attached to the DNA double helix. When rhodium complexes were attached to the DNA, they would attract the electron causing the glow, and "turn off" the effect. During her time at Columbia, Barton obtained two patents for this method of analyzing DNA structure.[10]
In 1989, Barton moved to Caltech,[9] where her research has focused on charge transport in DNA. By using specially-designed chiral metal complexes as probes of DNA she has been able to study how DNA is damaged and repaired.[9] In DNA-based diagnostic tests, complexes are used to determine whether electrons can flow across the DNA. If an electron could not move along the DNA, the DNA would continue to glow, indicating that there was damage in the DNA genetic molecule.[10]
The research that Barton, Catherine J. Murphy, Megan Núñez and others have done at Caltech has supported the idea of fast long-range electron transfer over DNA, challenging accepted scientific views and causing considerable controversy.[2] Based on years of studies, Barton and her group theorize that DNA operates like a wire, supporting a type of long-range signaling that enables repair proteins to detect and correct mistakes in DNA. This view of DNA is deeper and more dynamic than previous views of DNA as a static library.[11]
Understanding the mediation of electron-transfer chemistry by the DNA double helix has laid a foundation for the development of new diagnostic tools and for the possible design of novel chemotherapeutics.[2][12] Barton, Erik Holmlin, Shana Kelley, and Mike Hill created the company GeneOhm Sciences to explore the development of sensitive diagnostics for detecting DNA mismatches. The company has since been acquired by BD Diagnostics.[2]
Barton has taught more than 100 graduate and postdoctoral students, many of whom are women.[12] Recognized as a "superb role model, not just for young women but for all young scientists",[9] Barton advises others that "the best thing that I can do for women in science is first to do good science".[2] She became the Arthur and Marian Hanisch Memorial Professor of Chemistry in 1997.[13] She was named chair of the Division of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering of California Institute of Technology, effective July 1, 2009.[4]
Barton has been a Member of the Board of Dow Chemical since 1993.[14] She has also served on the Gilead Sciences Scientific Advisory Board (1989-2008).[4]
In 1990, she married Peter Dervan, a fellow chemist and professor at Caltech,[15] who is also a National Medal of Science winner.[16] She has two children, a daughter, Elizabeth, and a stepson Andrew.[17]
Research summary[edit]




Barton (third right) receiving the National Medal of Science at the White House in 2011


Barton introduced the application of transition metal complexes to probe recognition and reactions of double helical DNA. She has designed chiral metal complexes which mimic the properties of DNA-binding proteins, allowing other researchers the capability to simulate and analyze experiments in this nature. Barton additionally established that DNA charge transport chemistry is extremely sensitive to intervening perturbations in the DNA base stack, as with single base mismatches or lesions. This discovery has been a cornerstone for the development of DNA-based electrochemical sensors.
Awards and honors[edit]
Barton was awarded the National Medal of Science by Barack Obama in 2011, "For discovery of a new property of the DNA helix, long-range electron transfer, and for showing that electron transfer depends upon stacking of the base pairs and DNA dynamics. Her experiments reveal a strategy for how DNA repair proteins locate DNA lesions and demonstrate a biological role for DNA-mediated charge transfer."[18] Other awards include:

Professor Barton has pioneered the application of transition metal complexes to probe recognition and reactions of double helical DNA. She has designed chiral metal complexes that recognize nucleic acid sites with specificities rivaling DNA-binding proteins. These synthetic transition metal complexes have been useful in elucidating fundamental chemical principles that govern the recognition of nucleic acids, in developing luminescent and photochemical reagents as new diagnostic tools, and in laying a foundation for the design of novel chemotherapeutics. Barton has also carried out seminal studies to elucidate electron transfer chemistry mediated by the DNA double helix. She first showed that oxidative damage to DNA can arise from a distance through charge migration through the DNA duplex. She furthermore established that DNA charge transport chemistry is exquisitely sensitive to intervening perturbations in the DNA base stack, as with single base mismatches or lesions. This chemistry has since been applied in the development of DNA-based electrochemical sensors and explored in the context of long range signaling within the cell. She has focused on the role of DNA charge transport chemistry in DNA repair.  Through this research, Barton has trained more than 100 graduate students and postdoctoral students, with about half in academic positions.
Barton has received numerous awards. These include the Alan T. Waterman Award of the National Science Foundation (1985), the American Chemical Society (ACS) Award in Pure Chemistry (1988), the ACS Eli Lilly Award in Biological Chemistry (1987), ACS Garvan Medal (1992), the ACS Breslow Award in Biomimetic Chemistry (2003), and the American Institute of Chemists Gold Medal (2015). She has also received the ACS Baekeland Medal (1991), the Fresenius Award (1986), the ACS Tolman Medal (1994), the Mayor of New York's Award in Science and Technology (1988), the Havinga Medal (1995), the Paul Karrer Medal (1996), the ACS Nichols Medal (1997), the Weizmann Women & Science Award (1998), the ACS Gibbs Medal (2006), the ACS Cotton Medal (2007), and the ACS Pauling Medal (2007). She was a fellow of the Sloan Foundation, a Dreyfus Teacher-Scholar, and an NSF Presidential Young Investigator. She is a recipient of a prestigious MacArthur Foundation Fellowship (1991) and she has been elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1991), the American Philosophical Society (2000), and the National Academy of Sciences (2002), along with an honorary fellowship in the Royal Society of Chemistry (2014). She has received ten honorary degrees including Yale University (2005) and Columbia University (2010). She also received university medals from Barnard College (1990) and Columbia University (1992). She has also served the chemical community through her participation in ACS, government and industrial boards. Based upon her industrial board service, she was named an Outstanding Director by ODX (2006). In October 2011, Dr. Barton received the 2010 National Medal of Science from President Obama. In 2015, she received the ACS Priestley Medal. Video of her 2015 Priestley Medal acceptance speech.

Meet Jacqueline K. Barton, 2015 Priestley Medalist
A Career In Chemistry




The view from Jacqueline K. Barton’s office at California Institute of Technology is modest, despite the fact that it once belonged to two-time Nobel Laureate Linus Pauling and still showcases his analytical balance. “I never thought I’d end up here,” Barton says. As a girl born in 1952, her early plans never involved becoming a chemistry professor at a place like Caltech.

Even though it wasn’t the plan, being a chemist is something at which Barton has excelled—so much so that this year she is receiving the highest honor of the American Chemical Society, the Priestley Medal, “for brilliant work on electron transport in DNA, for dedication to training young investigators, and for unwavering support of the chemistry enterprise.”

“She’s one heck of a creative scientist,” says Jonas C. Peters, a chemistry professor at Caltech. “She started a field that has captivated a huge amount of interest and that bridges inorganic chemistry, biochemistry, and physical chemistry.”

“She is so incredibly enthusiastic and energetic,” says Erik Holmlin, who worked with Barton for his Ph.D. and is now president and chief executive officer of BioNano Genomics. “But she is also scientifically rigorous. She has this combination of rigor and passion that really drives things forward and pushes back frontiers.”

Barton is the third woman to receive the Priestley Medal. The previous two were Darleane C. Hoffman in 2000 and Mary L. Good in 1997.

Barton first started pushing back frontiers as a child growing up in New York City, where she attended Riverdale Country School. At the time, the school was gender segregated. In addition to learning academic basics, the girls studied art and music while the boys focused on advanced math and science. The only coed class was American history.

But one of Barton’s teachers saw that she was good at math and decided that she should take calculus. “It was a major thing,” Barton says. “She went to my parents, and then she and my parents went to the headmistress.” Barton’s teacher prevailed, and Barton recalls being driven in a red station wagon to get to and from class on the boys’ campus.

Barton’s father was a judge and her mother a homemaker, “so the whole math and science thing was not part of their toolbox,” Barton says. “But my parents were always proud of me.”

In 1970, she entered Barnard College, the women’s college affiliated with Columbia University. Barton thought she might major in math, but chemistry won out. “Chemistry allows you to combine the rigors of mathematics with a little bit of something that could make a difference in the world,” Barton says. Also, “I love the beautiful molecular structures.”

Barton enrolled at Columbia for graduate school, where she initially thought that she’d focus on physical chemistry. Then chemistry professor Stephen J. Lippard pitched a project to her that involved binding inorganic complexes to DNA such that they would intercalate between the base pairs. “I got excited about DNA in the context of using it as a one-dimensional lattice to load up small molecules,” says Barton, noting that the project also involved some interesting statistical mechanics.

“She was a very bright, very articulate, very kind person,” Lippard says. “She was clearly destined for a really great career.”

After earning a Ph.D., Barton spent a year as a postdoctoral researcher at Bell Laboratories, then in 1980 she returned to New York to join the chemistry faculty at Hunter College. “I wasn’t ambitious,” Barton says. “When I was at Riverdale, I thought I’d be a high school teacher, then I thought I’d be a college teacher. I just sort of went from step to step.”

At Hunter, Barton started her research program by investigating DNA-binding metal complexes as analogs for restriction enzymes and other proteins that require metal ions to function. She also learned how to teach, write grants, and interact with her colleagues.

After a couple of years at Hunter, however, Barton felt constrained. She couldn’t do research at the level she wanted, she says, because of the teaching requirements and the graduate student pool. In 1983, Lippard moved to Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Barton replaced him on the Columbia faculty.

“She was really quite sensational,” says Ronald Breslow, one of Barton’s Columbia colleagues. “She’s a brilliant person generally, and she has huge amounts of energy and lots of enthusiasm. She’s everything you’re looking for in a colleague.

“She has a winning personality,” Breslow continues. “You can’t say that of all scientists—some succeed despite their personalities—but Jackie has a wonderful, warm personality and tremendous curiosity.”

At Columbia, Barton continued to work on DNA-binding complexes, exploring their enantioselectivity and sequence specificity. She developed a particularly close relationship with colleague Nicholas J. Turro, who died in 2012. “Nick looked out for me,” she says. He helped her figure out how to run a growing group and optimize her grant funds.

Turro and Barton also collaborated scientifically, using Turro’s expertise in photochemistry to probe Barton’s DNA complexes. That work led to a major finding by a joint postdoc, C. Vijay Kumar: DNA could transfer electrons between polypyridyl ruthenium and cobalt complexes (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1986, DOI: 10.1021/ja00280a047; Science 1988, DOI: 10.1126/science.3420416). When the structure of DNA was first solved, chemists had proposed that the stacked aromatic bases might be a good electron transport medium, but Kumar, Barton, and Turro provided the first evidence for it.

When Barton moved to Caltech in 1989, some members of her group continued to explore DNA’s conductive properties. In 1993, postdoc Catherine J. Murphy demonstrated that DNA facilitated electron transfer along a 15-base pair DNA duplex—a distance of 40 Å (Science 1993, DOI: 10.1126/science.7802858). In 1999, Megan E. Núñez extended that distance to 200 Å (Chem. Biol. 1999, DOI: 10.1016/s1074-5521(99)80005-2).

But the idea that DNA might behave as a molecular wire was controversial. There was a lot of back and forth in the literature and harsh questions at conferences. “She was given a tough time,” Lippard says.

Barton prefers not to talk about it. “It was painful,” she concedes. “And it was very tough on my students.”

Barton approached the criticism head-on with more experiments, carefully controlled. In particular, she insisted that her group members work with DNA under conditions normally found in a cell—in water at room temperature. They also always used well-characterized DNA so they knew how the base pairs stacked and how strongly electron donor and acceptor complexes coupled to the helices.

After many years, “the bottom line is that we and others have learned that charge transfer through DNA can occur over long molecular distances. But it depends exquisitely on the stacking. Anything that screws up the stacking will screw up the electron transport,” Barton says. If a thymine-adenine step on the DNA ladder is switched to a cytosine-adenine or guanine-adenine mismatch, for example, electron transfer will stop. Theorists are still trying to work out the mechanisms at play.

Barton suggests that the debates were ultimately good for the field. In doing all the experiments to satisfy the critics, she says, “we learned a lot more than we would’ve learned otherwise.”

Alumni of her lab add that they also learned a few things about doing science.

“I can’t say I enjoyed it at the time—I think that we sent my first paper to 10 different journals before it was accepted,” says Shana Kelley, who got her Ph.D. from Caltech and is now a professor of pharmaceutical sciences at the University of Toronto. “But it taught me that you have to have a thick skin, you have to do the experiments to understand what’s going on, and you have to have the tenacity to stick with your ideas and not get discouraged.”

The fact that Barton’s group members were able to come through the controversy with something positive to say is a testament to Barton’s adept mentoring and ability to share her enthusiasm for science.

“As a mentor, she was fabulous,” says Murphy, who is now a chemistry professor at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. “She was always sure it was going to work and we were going to figure out a way no matter what.”

“She has this amazing energy that she passes on to anyone who talks with her,” says Valérie C. Pierre, who was a postdoc in Barton’s lab and is now a chemistry professor at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities. “You would go into her office when nothing was working and come out encouraged to try the next experiment.”

Barton sets high expectations, Kelley notes. But at the same time, “she really watches her people closely to see what they excel at and help them to hone their skills,” Kelley says. “She taught me to be the very best scientist I could be.”

“The best part of what we do is help educate these young people and watch them turn into independent scientists,” Barton says. “When they defend their thesis, sitting there listening to them give their talk is just the most exciting thing in the world!”

But even when students decide that a scientific research career isn’t for them, Barton remains supportive. After getting her Ph.D. from Caltech, Tashica Williams Amirgholizadeh went to law school and is now corporate counsel at Gilead Sciences. Barton “recognizes and appreciates that not everyone wants to follow the same path,” Amirgholizadeh says.

In addition to taking on scientific challenges and mentoring group members, Barton has contributed to the chemistry enterprise globally as a member of the Dow Chemical Board of Directors, which she joined in 1993. Many board members are not scientists, and “the board looks to her for third-party validation on things they’re hearing from management,” says Andrew N. Liveris, Dow’s CEO. Barton helps explain Dow’s science to other board members—things such as why phosgene is a valuable synthetic building block—even as she pushes Dow management to ensure that the company is doing the best it can technologically.

“What I hope and have to bring to the board is some calibration of how good Dow’s R&D operation is and where we stand on environment, health, and safety issues,” Barton says.

Or as Liveris puts it, she helps the company with both offense and defense. “I have deep admiration for her as a scientist, leader, and terrific person,” he adds.

Barton is also currently serving in her second consecutive term as chair of the Caltech Division of Chemistry & Chemical Engineering. Caltech’s academic administration is lean, she notes—there are only six division chairs, the provost, and the president—so division chairs have a great deal of influence.

“Her strengths are her focus on critical problems and her energy in working on them—she doesn’t drop the ball,” colleague Harry B. Gray says. “Sometimes she has to make tough decisions that may be unpopular in some cases, but she goes ahead.”

Barton’s priorities have been fund-raising and hiring. Fund-raising has gone well—so far, Barton has raised $20 million to fund graduate fellowships.

As for hiring, Caltech has several chemistry faculty nearing retirement, and the push is on to ensure that the division’s future is as bright as its past. As part of that, Barton has created a diversity committee to try to figure out how the division can improve its recruiting. “The two-body problem continues to be difficult,” Barton says. But “I think the administration is increasingly committed to coming up with creative solutions,” she adds.

Barton’s colleagues note that she is just as good about mentoring young faculty as she is her group members. She helps foster a supportive atmosphere that gives junior faculty confidence, says Caltech chemistry professor Sarah E. Reisman.

Barton has contributed to the chemistry enterprise through other service, although she’s cautious and strategic about what she takes on. “You can only have so many things on your plate,” she says.

She manages her commitments by delegating. “I love to hire people who are smart and competent and that I can trust,” Barton says. Her group members have their responsibilities. Maureen S. Renta, her assistant of 25 years, “does everything for the group that doesn’t have to do with science,” Barton says. Amy Woodall-Ojeda and other division staff handle whatever else doesn’t require Barton’s direct attention. And Barton’s longtime nanny-housekeeper, Natividad Loeza, keeps things running at home.

These days, Barton’s group continues to work in three areas. One is determining whether cells use DNA-facilitated electron transfer as a means to monitor DNA integrity. Another is exploiting DNA electrochemistry for diagnostic applications, such as distinguishing tumors from normal tissue by looking for highly methylated DNA. The third is designing metal complexes that bind at DNA base pair mismatches for possible cancer treatments. Although Barton’s group is smaller than it used to be—part of that is her chair responsibilities, part is the overall funding climate—she seems no less enthusiastic about her science. “It’s fun!” she emphasizes.

“People who work for Jackie see a brilliant scientist who is strategic and tough,” says Madeleine Jacobs, former ACS executive director and CEO. The combination of that, Jacobs says, with Barton’s compassion and generosity make her a truly exceptional role model.

As Jacqueline K. Barton was getting her career established in the early 1980s, there was another “young hotshot,” as Barton describes him, also working on DNA sequence recognition: Caltech chemistry professor Peter B. Dervan. “We were intellectual colleagues,” Barton says, shying away from saying competitors.

The two scientists became familiar with each other at conferences, with Dervan approaching DNA recognition from an organic chemistry perspective while Barton exploited inorganic complexes. Barton also recalls that Dervan reviewed one of her lab’s first papers. She knew it was him because of the specific way that Caltech printed materials. “Every line was redlined,” she laughs, although it was clear that he was trying to be helpful.

Then the two got to know each other better while serving together for several years on the National Science Foundation Advisory Committee for Chemistry.

In 1990 Barton and Dervan married. They remain devoted to each other.

“I really love this guy,” Barton says.

“I’m just the luckiest guy in the whole world,” Dervan says.

Professionally, Barton and Dervan have kept their research programs largely separate from each other’s, generally avoiding collaboration. They don’t serve on thesis committees for each other’s students, although they will write recommendations if they’ve had someone as a teaching assistant. They do, however, host joint group parties.

Personally, the couple also clearly distinguishes between professional and personal time. On weekdays, they typically arrive on campus around 7:30 AM and go home at 5:30 PM, and work stays at work, they say. They swim in their backyard pool—“I certainly have acclimated to California,” says Barton, a New York City native—then Barton makes dinner while Dervan pours wine. Dervan has a son, Andrew, from a previous marriage; Barton and Dervan together have a daughter, Elizabeth. When the children were young, evenings and weekends were spent with them, and the family vacationed together twice a year.

“I’ve always been impressed at how much Jackie and Peter emphasize family. They’ve been a great example for me as a professor,” says Caltech chemistry professor Jonas Peters. “Jackie’s just a fantastic mom, and I really respect her for what a good parent she is.”

Now, Andrew is a physician with his own family, and Elizabeth is in law school. Still, Barton and Dervan keep work out of their personal time. The separate spheres mean that when Barton and Dervan attend conferences together and see each other’s talks, they are often learning something for the first time. “He’ll ask me a question or I’ll ask him, and everyone thinks it’s a setup,” Barton says. “It’s not! It’s a genuine question.”

Jacqueline Barton: DNA like wire for signaling within a cell


By EarthSky in Human World | April 23, 2012



Dr. Barton received a National Medal of Science after learning that cells use the double strands of the DNA helix like a wire for long-range signaling.





















A professor of chemistry at the California Institute of Technology, Jacqueline Barton received a National Medal of Science in 2011 for her discovery that cells use the double strands of the DNA helix like a wire for long-range signaling among proteins within a cell.  Her research holds promise for understanding how cells detect and repair DNA defects – related both to ordinary conditions like aging – and to diseases like Alzheimer’s and cancer.  This podcast is part of the Thanks To Chemistry series, produced in cooperation with the Chemical Heritage Foundation.  Generous sponsorship support was provided by the BASF Corporation.  Additional production support was provided by The Camille and Henry Dreyfus Foundation, DuPont, and ExxonMobil.  Jacqueline Barton spoke to EarthSky’s Jorge Salazar.
On October 21, 2011, you received a National Medal of Science for discovering that DNA acts like a wire in a cell.  Tell us about that.
First of all, it was an extraordinary honor.  I represent all the people who work with me – the graduate students and post-docs who really carry out the work.  
We think about DNA usually as the library of the cell.  It encodes all the information that makes us what we are.
National Medal of Science winner Jacqueline Barton via LA Times
But it also turns out that when you look at the chemical or molecular structure of DNA – that spiral staircase we call the double helix – you find the steps of the spiral staircase stacked one on top of one another.  It turns out that the DNA double helix looks a lot like solid state materials that are quite conductive.
Very soon after Watson and Crick first described the structure of DNA, chemists started asking – does this structure have the characteristic of being conductive?  That was over 50 years ago. 
About 20 to 30 years ago, chemists began being able to synthesize a little piece of DNA – to know exactly what’s connected to what.
We attached little molecular probes to either side of the DNA double helix to ask whether or not you can shoot an electron from one side of the DNA to the other side of the DNA.  And that’s how it all started.
Then what happened?  
At first, we thought about DNA in terms of its chemical characteristics.  We found that electrons and “holes” could move through DNA.  We usually think about DNA as “the library” because DNA encodes the RNA.  The RNA is sort of like taking a Xerox copy of what’s in the library.  Then from the RNA you go through the ribosome machine.  And you make proteins.  The proteins that are made are encoded by the sequence of base pairs in DNA.  
The nuclei of all our cells are filled with three billion base pairs of information in the DNA.  But some of our cells have to become, say, a nose cell.  Those cells have to make certain proteins get expressed.  Others of our cells have to make other proteins get expressed.  And all that information is in the DNA library.
DNA double helix.
What happens, let’s say, when a cell is under stress?  It has to activate a response to that stress.  We’ve been finding that actually the information has to get coordinated across the DNA library because a lot of things have to happen.  A lot of proteins have to get made.  
We thought maybe there’s signaling across the nucleus of the cell – across the DNA-containing genome.  Some of that might actually be happening by using DNA as a wire.  
What do you mean by that?  How can DNA be like a wire?
Your DNA is getting damaged all the time, especially if you don’t, say, eat your broccoli.  When the DNA gets damaged, that damage has to get fixed or else that information in the DNA library can’t be used anymore.  In each of our cells, we have this exquisite repair machinery.  Little proteins are constantly sifting through your DNA to find mistakes and fix them.
We found out that DNA can be a good wire.  But it’s only a good wire if all the bases are stacked on top of each other – these steps on the spiral staircase – and if the DNA isn’t damaged.  If there is a little mistake in the DNA, then it’s not a good wire anymore.  
It’s like a stack of copper pennies.  And that stack of copper pennies can be conductive.  But if one of the pennies is a little bit awry – if it’s not stacked so well – then you’re not going to be able to get good conductivity in it.  The same is true in the DNA double helix.  
Let’s go back to thinking about our DNA becoming damaged all the time – how those repair proteins have to find those mistakes in the three billion bases of DNA.  We think that what happens is that nature uses DNA like a wire.  It’s sort of like two telephone repairmen trying to find a mistake in the line.  If they can talk to each other, if these repair proteins can talk to each other across the DNA, then the DNA is just fine.  So they don’t have to repair that region.  And they can go someplace else.  
But if there’s a mistake in the DNA, then they can’t talk to each other so well. 
From starting out over 20 years ago in synthesizing little pieces of DNA – and seeing if we can shoot an electron up or down it – we’ve come now to the point of saying nature uses DNA like a wire for long-range signaling and for finding mistakes in the DNA.
What inspired you to become a chemist?
I like being in the lab.  When I was in high school, I took a lot of math courses.  When I went to college I thought I’d try a chemistry course.  The lab part of the class was really exciting.  It got me hooked.  And it gave me a way to combine my mathematical perspective with thinking about real-world problems.
At the beginning, it’s detective work – having a puzzle, a problem to solve.  Doing a reaction in the lab and seeing things change colors and then isolating a product and finding out what it was.  That was exciting.  
As I got more and more into it, I started getting involved in research.  Then there are all sorts of interesting things to think about.  You’re learning things that no one ever knew before.

Jacqueline K. Barton
DNA’s electrical conductivity is at the heart of studies Barton is undertaking to find new methods for medical diagnosis and treatment.












 









Home / Learn / Historical Biographies
Jacqueline Barton probes DNA by shooting electrons through it. Using custom-built molecules to direct these electrical currents, she can locate genes, see how they are arranged, and scan them for damage.
Barton hopes that these techniques will lead to new ways to diagnose diseases and treat them through DNA repair. To further this end she cofounded GeneOhm Sciences in 2001, which became part of Becton, Dickinson and Company in 2006.
A Passion for Chemistry

Barton was born in 1952 and raised in New York City. Her father was a State Supreme Court justice, and her mother was a Belgian Jew who escaped to England ahead of Hitler’s invading army and then immigrated to the United States. Barton did not study chemistry in high school since it was not offered at her girls’ preparatory school. After entering Barnard College of Columbia University, she took her first chemistry class and lab. She loved the subject and decided to make it her career. Barton stayed at Columbia and earned her PhD in inorganic chemistry, then worked at Bell Labs and taught at Hunter College, City University of New York, before returning to Columbia as a professor. Later she took a position at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in Pasadena. During her career as an educator and researcher Barton has trained more than 100 graduate and postdoctoral students, about half of whom moved into academic positions. She is currently the Arthur and Marian Hanisch Memorial Professor of Chemistry and Chair of the Division of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering at Caltech.
Studying DNA’s Electrical Conductivity
Barton first became interested in DNA during graduate school. She has since spent her career studying the electrical conductivity of DNA. She was among the first to demonstrate this strange property, and no one knows whether it helps DNA with its job of carrying genetic information. Barton is hoping to find answers to this question.
Barton has also shown that certain damaged DNA molecules do not conduct electricity. Since damaged DNA can cause many kinds of cancer, she hopes that her discovery will eventually help doctors detect damaged DNA before cancer results. In addition Barton has investigated how some metal compounds (called “complexes”) interact with DNA molecules. Evidence suggests that metal complexes can be used to repair damaged DNA.
Recognition
Among her many honors Barton received the National Medal of Science in 2010 from President Barack Obama and was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 2002.

Education[edit]
Jacqueline Kapelman attended Riverdale Country School for Girls in Riverdale, New York, where her math teacher, Mrs. Rosenberg, insisted that she be allowed to take calculus at the boys' school. Her interest in chemistry began at Barnard College, where she studied physical chemistry with Bernice Segal. She loved laboratory work and chemical transformations and found Segal an inspiration as a teacher.[2][3] During her last year at Barnard she married Don Barton,[4] receiving her B.A. from Barnard College as Jacqueline Kapelman Barton, summa cum laude, in 1974.
She then studied inorganic chemistry at Columbia University under the supervision of Stephen J. Lippard.[5][6][7] While at Columbia she began studying transition-metal complexes and their possible applications to chemotherapy.[2] She earned a PhD in Inorganic Chemistry in 1979, addressing The structure and chemical reactivity of a blue platinum complex : the interaction of antitumor latinum drugs and matallointercalation reagent with nucleic acids.[8]

After earning her Ph.D. from Columbia in 1979, Barton held post-doctoral appointments at Bell Labs and Yale University, where she worked with Robert G. Shulman. She used nuclear magnetic resonance imaging technology to examine the metabolism of yeast cells.[4] Barton became a Professor of Chemistry at Hunter College from 1980–82, and began to develop her own laboratory, the Barton Research Group.[4] While at Hunter she studied the interactions of zinc ions with DNA, and later of ruthenium(II) and cobalt(III) complexes with DNA. This enabled her to roughly model complexes on a DNA helix and to begin studying the photophysical and photochemical properties related to enantiomers.[2]
In the 1980s she moved to Columbia University, where she taught from 1983 to 1989.[4] She became a full professor in 1986[9] and was the first woman to receive tenure in the Chemistry department at Columbia.[2] Her research focused on the use of organo-ruthenium complexes to examine the physical structure of DNA. With Nicholas Turro and Vijay Kumar she studied the interactions of ruthenium phenanthroline complexes and DNA and was able to design binding molecules targeted to specific DNA sequences.[2] Photosensitive ruthenium complexes would glow brightly when they attached to the DNA double helix. When rhodium complexes were attached to the DNA, they would attract the electron causing the glow, and "turn off" the effect. During her time at Columbia, Barton obtained two patents for this method of analyzing DNA structure.[10]
In 1989, Barton moved to Caltech,[9] where her research has focused on charge transport in DNA. By using specially-designed chiral metal complexes as probes of DNA she has been able to study how DNA is damaged and repaired.[9] In DNA-based diagnostic tests, complexes are used to determine whether electrons can flow across the DNA. If an electron could not move along the DNA, the DNA would continue to glow, indicating that there was damage in the DNA genetic molecule.[10]
The research that Barton, Catherine J. Murphy, Megan Núñez and others have done at Caltech has supported the idea of fast long-range electron transfer over DNA, challenging accepted scientific views and causing considerable controversy.[2] Based on years of studies, Barton and her group theorize that DNA operates like a wire, supporting a type of long-range signaling that enables repair proteins to detect and correct mistakes in DNA. This view of DNA is deeper and more dynamic than previous views of DNA as a static library.[11]
Understanding the mediation of electron-transfer chemistry by the DNA double helix has laid a foundation for the development of new diagnostic tools and for the possible design of novel chemotherapeutics.[2][12] Barton, Erik Holmlin, Shana Kelley, and Mike Hill created the company GeneOhm Sciences to explore the development of sensitive diagnostics for detecting DNA mismatches. The company has since been acquired by BD Diagnostics.[2]
Barton has taught more than 100 graduate and postdoctoral students, many of whom are women.[12] Recognized as a "superb role model, not just for young women but for all young scientists",[9] Barton advises others that "the best thing that I can do for women in science is first to do good science".[2] She became the Arthur and Marian Hanisch Memorial Professor of Chemistry in 1997.[13] She was named chair of the Division of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering of California Institute of Technology, effective July 1, 2009.[4]
Barton has been a Member of the Board of Dow Chemical since 1993.[14] She has also served on the Gilead Sciences Scientific Advisory Board (1989-2008).[4]
In 1990, she married Peter Dervan, a fellow chemist and professor at Caltech,[15] who is also a National Medal of Science winner.[16] She has two children, a daughter, Elizabeth, and a stepson Andrew.[17]
Research summary[edit]




Barton (third right) receiving the National Medal of Science at the White House in 2011


Barton introduced the application of transition metal complexes to probe recognition and reactions of double helical DNA. She has designed chiral metal complexes which mimic the properties of DNA-binding proteins, allowing other researchers the capability to simulate and analyze experiments in this nature. Barton additionally established that DNA charge transport chemistry is extremely sensitive to intervening perturbations in the DNA base stack, as with single base mismatches or lesions. This discovery has been a cornerstone for the development of DNA-based electrochemical sensors.
Awards and honors[edit]
Barton was awarded the National Medal of Science by Barack Obama in 2011, "For discovery of a new property of the DNA helix, long-range electron transfer, and for showing that electron transfer depends upon stacking of the base pairs and DNA dynamics. Her experiments reveal a strategy for how DNA repair proteins locate DNA lesions and demonstrate a biological role for DNA-mediated charge transfer."[18] Other awards include:

When rhodium complexes were attached to the DNA, they would attract the electron causing the glow, and "turn off" the effect. During her time at Columbia, Barton obtained two patents for this method of analyzing DNA structure.[10]
In 1989, Barton moved to Caltech,[9] where her research has focused on charge transport in DNA. By using specially-designed chiral metal complexes as probes of DNA she has been able to study how DNA is damaged and repaired.[9] In DNA-based diagnostic tests, complexes are used to determine whether electrons can flow across the DNA. If an electron could not move along the DNA, the DNA would continue to glow, indicating that there was damage in the DNA genetic molecule.[10]
The research that Barton, Catherine J. Murphy, Megan Núñez and others have done at Caltech has supported the idea of fast long-range electron transfer over DNA, challenging accepted scientific views and causing considerable controversy.[2] Based on years of studies, Barton and her group theorize that DNA operates like a wire, supporting a type of long-range signaling that enables repair proteins to detect and correct mistakes in DNA. This view of DNA is deeper and more dynamic than previous views of DNA as a static library.[11]
Understanding the mediation of electron-transfer chemistry by the DNA double helix has laid a foundation for the development of new diagnostic tools and for the possible design of novel chemotherapeutics.[2][12] Barton, Erik Holmlin, Shana Kelley, and Mike Hill created the company GeneOhm Sciences to explore the development of sensitive diagnostics for detecting DNA mismatches. The company has since been acquired by BD Diagnostics.[2]
Barton has taught more than 100 graduate and postdoctoral students, many of whom are women.[12] Recognized as a "superb role model, not just for young women but for all young scientists",[9] Barton advises others that "the best thing that I can do for women in science is first to do good science".[2] She became the Arthur and Marian Hanisch Memorial Professor of Chemistry in 1997.[13] She was named chair of the Division of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering of California Institute of Technology, effective July 1, 2009.[4]
Barton has been a Member of the Board of Dow Chemical since 1993.[14] She has also served on the Gilead Sciences Scientific Advisory Board (1989-2008).[4]
In 1990, she married Peter Dervan, a fellow chemist and professor at Caltech,[15] who is also a National Medal of Science winner.[16] She has two children, a daughter, Elizabeth, and a stepson Andrew.[17]
Research summary[edit]




Barton (third right) receiving the National Medal of Science at the White House in 2011


Barton introduced the application of transition metal complexes to probe recognition and reactions of double helical DNA. She has designed chiral metal complexes which mimic the properties of DNA-binding proteins, allowing other researchers the capability to simulate and analyze experiments in this nature. Barton additionally established that DNA charge transport chemistry is extremely sensitive to intervening perturbations in the DNA base stack, as with single base mismatches or lesions. This discovery has been a cornerstone for the development of DNA-based electrochemical sensors.
Awards and honors[edit]
Barton was awarded the National Medal of Science by Barack Obama in 2011, "For discovery of a new property of the DNA helix, long-range electron transfer, and for showing that electron transfer depends upon stacking of the base pairs and DNA dynamics. Her experiments reveal a strategy for how DNA repair proteins locate DNA lesions and demonstrate a biological role for DNA-mediated charge transfer."[18] Other awards include:

Jacqueline K. Barton (born New York City, NY), is an American chemist. She worked as a Professor of Chemistry at Hunter College (1980–82), and at Columbia University (1983–89) before joining the California Institute of Technology (1989-to the present). In 1997 she became the Arthur and Marian Hanisch Memorial Professor of Chemistry and in 2009, the Chair of the Division of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering at Caltech. She currently is the John G. Kirkwood and Arthur A. Noyes Professor and Norman Davidson Leadership Chair of the Division of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering.
Barton studies the chemical and physical properties of DNA and their roles in biological activities. The primary focus of her research is transverse electron transport along double-stranded DNA, its implications in the biology of DNA damage and repair, and its potential for materials sciences applications such as targeted chemotherapeutic treatments for cancer. Among many other awards, Barton has received the 2011 National Medal of Science, the 2015 American Institute of Chemists Gold Medal and the 2015 Priestley Medal.

Education[edit]
Jacqueline Kapelman attended Riverdale Country School for Girls in Riverdale, New York, where her math teacher, Mrs. Rosenberg, insisted that she be allowed to take calculus at the boys' school. Her interest in chemistry began at Barnard College, where she studied physical chemistry with Bernice Segal. She loved laboratory work and chemical transformations and found Segal an inspiration as a teacher.[2][3] During her last year at Barnard she married Don Barton,[4] receiving her B.A. from Barnard College as Jacqueline Kapelman Barton, summa cum laude, in 1974.
She then studied inorganic chemistry at Columbia University under the supervision of Stephen J. Lippard.[5][6][7] While at Columbia she began studying transition-metal complexes and their possible applications to chemotherapy.[2] She earned a PhD in Inorganic Chemistry in 1979, addressing The structure and chemical reactivity of a blue platinum complex : the interaction of antitumor latinum drugs and matallointercalation reagent with nucleic acids.[8]

After earning her Ph.D. from Columbia in 1979, Barton held post-doctoral appointments at Bell Labs and Yale University, where she worked with Robert G. Shulman. She used nuclear magnetic resonance imaging technology to examine the metabolism of yeast cells.[4] Barton became a Professor of Chemistry at Hunter College from 1980–82, and began to develop her own laboratory, the Barton Research Group.[4] While at Hunter she studied the interactions of zinc ions with DNA, and later of ruthenium(II) and cobalt(III) complexes with DNA. This enabled her to roughly model complexes on a DNA helix and to begin studying the photophysical and photochemical properties related to enantiomers.[2]
In the 1980s she moved to Columbia University, where she taught from 1983 to 1989.[4] She became a full professor in 1986[9] and was the first woman to receive tenure in the Chemistry department at Columbia.[2] Her research focused on the use of organo-ruthenium complexes to examine the physical structure of DNA.

Jacqueline K. Barton (born New York City, NY), is an American chemist. She worked as a Professor of Chemistry at Hunter College (1980–82), and at Columbia University (1983–89) before joining the California Institute of Technology (1989-to the present). In 1997 she became the Arthur and Marian Hanisch Memorial Professor of Chemistry and in 2009, the Chair of the Division of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering at Caltech. She currently is the John G. Kirkwood and Arthur A. Noyes Professor and Norman Davidson Leadership Chair of the Division of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering.
Barton studies the chemical and physical properties of DNA and their roles in biological activities. The primary focus of her research is transverse electron transport along double-stranded DNA, its implications in the biology of DNA damage and repair, and its potential for materials sciences applications such as targeted chemotherapeutic treatments for cancer. Among many other awards, Barton has received the 2011 National Medal of Science, the 2015 American Institute of Chemists Gold Medal and the 2015 Priestley Medal.

Education[edit]
Jacqueline Kapelman attended Riverdale Country School for Girls in Riverdale, New York, where her math teacher, Mrs. Rosenberg, insisted that she be allowed to take calculus at the boys' school. Her interest in chemistry began at Barnard College, where she studied physical chemistry with Bernice Segal. She loved laboratory work and chemical transformations and found Segal an inspiration as a teacher.[2][3] During her last year at Barnard she married Don Barton,[4] receiving her B.A. from Barnard College as Jacqueline Kapelman Barton, summa cum laude, in 1974.
She then studied inorganic chemistry at Columbia University under the supervision of Stephen J. Lippard.[5][6][7] While at Columbia she began studying transition-metal complexes and their possible applications to chemotherapy.[2] She earned a PhD in Inorganic Chemistry in 1979, addressing The structure and chemical reactivity of a blue platinum complex : the interaction of antitumor latinum drugs and matallointercalation reagent with nucleic acids.[8]

After earning her Ph.D. from Columbia in 1979, Barton held post-doctoral appointments at Bell Labs and Yale University, where she worked with Robert G. Shulman. She used nuclear magnetic resonance imaging technology to examine the metabolism of yeast cells.[4] Barton became a Professor of Chemistry at Hunter College from 1980–82, and began to develop her own laboratory, the Barton Research Group.[4] While at Hunter she studied the interactions of zinc ions with DNA, and later of ruthenium(II) and cobalt(III) complexes with DNA. This enabled her to roughly model complexes on a DNA helix and to begin studying the photophysical and photochemical properties related to enantiomers.[2]
In the 1980s she moved to Columbia University, where she taught from 1983 to 1989.[4] She became a full professor in 1986[9] and was the first woman to receive tenure in the Chemistry department at Columbia.[2] Her research focused on the use of organo-ruthenium complexes to examine the physical structure of DNA. With Nicholas Turro and Vijay Kumar she studied the interactions of ruthenium phenanthroline complexes and DNA and was able to design binding molecules targeted to specific DNA sequences.[2] Photosensitive ruthenium complexes would glow brightly when they attached to the DNA double helix. When rhodium complexes were attached to the DNA, they would attract the electron causing the glow, and "turn off" the effect. During her time at Columbia, Barton obtained two patents for this method of analyzing DNA structure.[10]
In 1989, Barton moved to Caltech,[9] where her research has focused on charge transport in DNA. By using specially-designed chiral metal complexes as probes of DNA she has been able to study how DNA is damaged and repaired.[9] In DNA-based diagnostic tests, complexes are used to determine whether electrons can flow across the DNA. If an electron could not move along the DNA, the DNA would continue to glow, indicating that there was damage in the DNA genetic molecule.[10]
The research that Barton, Catherine J. Murphy, Megan Núñez and others have done at Caltech has supported the idea of fast long-range electron transfer over DNA, challenging accepted scientific views and causing considerable controversy.[2] Based on years of studies, Barton and her group theorize that DNA operates like a wire, supporting a type of long-range signaling that enables repair proteins to detect and correct mistakes in DNA. This view of DNA is deeper and more dynamic than previous views of DNA as a static library.[11]
Understanding the mediation of electron-transfer chemistry by the DNA double helix has laid a foundation for the development of new diagnostic tools and for the possible design of novel chemotherapeutics.[2][12] Barton, Erik Holmlin, Shana Kelley, and Mike Hill created the company GeneOhm Sciences to explore the development of sensitive diagnostics for detecting DNA mismatches. The company has since been acquired by BD Diagnostics.[2]
Barton has taught more than 100 graduate and postdoctoral students, many of whom are women.[12] Recognized as a "superb role model, not just for young women but for all young scientists",[9] Barton advises others that "the best thing that I can do for women in science is first to do good science".[2] She became the Arthur and Marian Hanisch Memorial Professor of Chemistry in 1997.[13] She was named chair of the Division of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering of California Institute of Technology, effective July 1, 2009.[4]
Barton has been a Member of the Board of Dow Chemical since 1993.[14] She has also served on the Gilead Sciences Scientific Advisory Board (1989-2008).[4]
In 1990, she married Peter Dervan, a fellow chemist and professor at Caltech,[15] who is also a National Medal of Science winner.[16] She has two children, a daughter, Elizabeth, and a stepson Andrew.[17]
Research summary[edit]




Barton (third right) receiving the National Medal of Science at the White House in 2011


Barton introduced the application of transition metal complexes to probe recognition and reactions of double helical DNA. She has designed chiral metal complexes which mimic the properties of DNA-binding proteins, allowing other researchers the capability to simulate and analyze experiments in this nature. Barton additionally established that DNA charge transport chemistry is extremely sensitive to intervening perturbations in the DNA base stack, as with single base mismatches or lesions. This discovery has been a cornerstone for the development of DNA-based electrochemical sensors.
Awards and honors[edit]
Barton was awarded the National Medal of Science by Barack Obama in 2011, "For discovery of a new property of the DNA helix, long-range electron transfer, and for showing that electron transfer depends upon stacking of the base pairs and DNA dynamics. Her experiments reveal a strategy for how DNA repair proteins locate DNA lesions and demonstrate a biological role for DNA-mediated charge transfer."[18] Other awards include:

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
