ShareConditions Commonly Seen in PatientsThe following information is provided by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services for the year 2014 and depicts the rates of sixteen chronic conditions found in Dr. Van Horn, Jr's Medicare patients. It should be noted that the prevalence of conditions listed below may not be characteristic of the provider's entire patient population, and in some cases information has been redacted from the original data source to protect patient information.Most Frequently SeenMoreMost Frequently SeenThroughout 2014, Dr. Van Horn, Jr saw the greatest relative rate of patients with Atrial Fibrillation (38% of Medicare patients) compared to averages for all physicians in his state, likely indicating he is experienced in managing treatment and complications associated with this condition.Overview of Atrial Fibrillation:seriousnessSevereprevalenceFairly Commonmonetary costModerate

Atrial fibrillation (also called a-fib) is a heart condition that causes the upper chambers of the heart to contract randomly, creating an irregular or abnormally fast heartbeat. Atrial fibrillation often occurs alongside other heart conditions. Medication may be prescribed if the condition is causing discomfort or if there are underlying conditions. Atrial fibrillation increases the risk of potentially fatal cardiovascular complications, including stroke.

Full Description


Atrial fibrillation (also called a-fib) is a heart condition that causes an irregular or abnormally fast heartbeat. When at rest, the heart normally beats between 60 and 100 times per minute. A person with atrial fibrillation may have an unpredictable heart rate or a resting heart rate of over 140 beats per minute. When the heart beats, the muscle walls around it contract, forcing blood out and around the body. When the muscles relax, the heart fills back up with blood. In atrial fibrillation, the upper chambers of the heart contract randomly. They often contract so fast that the heart muscles cannot relax properly between contractions. This reduces the heart’s efficiency and performance. Abnormal electrical impulses can start firing randomly, overriding the heart’s natural pacemaker, creating an irregular pulse rate.While the exact cause of a-fib is unknown, it is more common in certain age groups and can be triggered by drinking or smoking. It commonly occurs in conjunction with other conditions such as high blood pressure, atherosclerosis, and heart conditions. Individuals with atrial fibrillation may not have any symptoms. Some people are aware of a change in heart rate or experience chest pain, dizziness, shortness of breath, fatigue, and palpations. While the condition is not directly life-threatening, atrial fibrillation increases the risk of serious complications, including stroke and heart failure. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation may come and go and stops within 48 hours without treatment. Persistent atrial fibrillation may last as long as 7 days, depending on treatment. Longstanding persistent atrial fibrillation is continuous atrial fibrillation that occurs for more than a year. Permanent atrial fibrillation is the most severe form and is present at all times.Treatment for atrial fibrillation varies depending on the person, the symptoms, and the severity of the condition. Treatment focuses on supporting comfort and preventing complications. Medication can be used to help prevent a stroke as well as control heart rate and heart rhythm. In some cases the heart can be given a controlled electrical shock to restore normal rhythm. In extreme cases a pacemaker can be surgically implanted to help the heart beat normally.
