Jul 4 17
Unity Investments Holdings Limited provided earnings guidance for the six months ended June 30, 2017. The board of directors of the company announced that, based on the preliminary assessment of the Group's unaudited management accounts for the six months ended June 30, 2017 and information currently available to the Board, the Group is expected that the unaudited consolidated net loss for the Interim Period increased significantly as compared to that for the six months ended June 30, 2016 as set out in the 2016 interim report of the company.
