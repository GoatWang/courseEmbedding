About Niner
Niner may be a young company, but in their short existence They've made an impressive knobby-tire rooster tail through the muddy, 29er puddle. Quickly establishing themselves as the twenty-niner authority through passion, innovation, and community, Niner is about the freedom and rush of riding, topped with a healthy dose of post-ride camaraderie. But, most notable is there push for modern, yet refined designs. Changing the industry by doing everything from twisting arms of reluctant companies to produce components for 29er applications, to conducting extensive in-house R&D ensuring their own technologies and products perform to the highest degree, Niner is a leader in what they rightfully call "The Big Revolution." Take a look at the praised, 29er-specific CVA suspension system. No other manufacturer can say they developed a rear suspension for large wheels only; others have merely adapted existing designs for use with a completely different wheel size. Niner doesn' t compromise for the sake of a quick buck. Back in 05', when they first introduced the CVA design to the public, it was on a prototype WFO 9, a long-travel, full-suspension 29er like nothing seen before. While the CVA platform quickly made it into production on shorter-travel versions, like the RIP 9, Niner continued to develop the WFO 9 -- with consumers clawing at the doors to get one. Fast forward four years, hundreds of hours of computer analysis, and countless miles of real-world testing under mountain-bike fanatics, and the WFO 9 was released to glowing reviews. Had Niner pushed it to market prematurely, it would have tainted the long-travel 29er niche with shoddy handling, weak construction, and an unsupportive aftermarket. That' s the difference between a fad and what has become a staple to the mountain bike industry -- dedication and professional execution. That attitude has produced a full line of distinguished bikes: Race-day carbon lust machines, back-country full suspension rigs, working-man steel hardtails, and more. Ride a Niner, and you' ll not only feel the highly-publicized advantages of twenty-niners, you' ll feel the dedication to professionalism and the passion that goes into developing each and every Niner frame.

About Niner
In the last millennium almost everyone rode bikes with 26" wheels. A few biking revolutionaries broke with this tradition to install bigger wheels on their bikes, such as Geoff Apps, Wes Williams, and Mark Slate. Some of this experimentation even dates back to the 1980s but it wasn't until the turn of the century that the 29er was properly introduced to the world as a viable option. The term 29er is credited to the Fisher bike company after they introduced the Two Niner bike, but a number of companies had started to offer bikes with 29" wheels at around the same time.
For consumers and cycling enthusiasts this meant 29" wheels were now a mainstream product, albeit one that was categorized as niche. The more standard 26" wheels remained the most popular.
It was in this environment that entrepreneur Chris Sugai decided to launch Niner. He had ridden 29" bikes before and thought they were better than the smaller-wheeled options. His idea was radical - to make and supply bikes exclusively with 29" wheels. In other words, it was 29ers or nothing.
That was back in 2005 and Sugai has said in interviews since that people at the time thought he was crazy. The gamble has paid off, however, and Niner is now a respected, niche mountain bike brand.
It is based in Fort Collins, Colorado in the US, and it has stuck to its founding principle: the only wheel size available in the range is 29". That range is extensive, however, and includes options for casual cyclists up to those involved in competition.
Why 29" wheels though? Those converted to the 29er style believe the bigger wheels are fast on normal riding terrains, and better equipped to handle rougher conditions. This means 29ers roll over obstacles instead of digging in. The extreme example that Niner gives to explain this is to compare a skateboard wheel with a monster truck wheel. The skateboard can be stopped by a small pebble, while rows of cars barely slow down a monster truck.
The 29er is a style of bike that has become increasingly popular, cementing Niner's position as a specialist manufacturer.
