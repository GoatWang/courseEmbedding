 Teraphysics Corporation(26%)Teraphysics Corporation develops devices that operate in the terahertz band, the last unexploited frequency of the electromagnetic spectrum. There are numerous frequencies that lie just above and below the THz band, such as infra-red and microwave, and commercially they have led to multi-billion dollar industries such as optical fiber, satellite communications, radar and cell phones. Because of the difficulty of operating in this band, it is frequently referred to as the “Terahertz Gap.” Why hasn’t the THz band been exploited? It is not because a lack of potential applications. In fact, many applications in product inspection, food safety, communications, medical imaging, and security have been demonstrated in laboratories. Commercialization has lagged because of the absence of compact sources and amplifiers of sufficient power to enable development of these opportunity areas. Teraphysics has successfully developed a practical family of miniaturized THz devices capable of generating and amplifying high levels of THz light. 
Teraphysics is closely collaborating with TeraView, Ltd., a UK company and global leader in the development and sale of THz products and applications. The combination of Teraphysics’ amplification capabilities, coupled with TeraView’s unparalleled applications knowledge and existing product, provides a unique opportunity to grow the Terahertz market. With its technology and key commercial relationships, the Teraphysics’ goal is to create a vertically integrated entity that will dominate THz commercialization in the coming years, with no visible competition on the horizon.

CapRocq Core Risk Factors

Prospective  investors should be aware that an investment in shares of the Company's common  stock involves a high, and sometimes speculative, degree  of risk, and is suitable only for persons or entities that are able to evaluate  the risks of the investment. An investment in  our shares should be made only by persons or entities able to bear the risk of  and to withstand the total loss of their investment. Prospective investors  should carefully read this offering circular prior to making a decision to  purchase shares. 
It is impossible  to accurately predict the results to an investor from an investment in shares  of the Company's common stock because of  general risks associated with the ownership and operation of real estate, the  risks associated with the types of properties the Company intends to acquire,  and certain tax risks, among other risks. These risks may be exacerbated by the  additional risks associated with the specific properties that the Company  acquires and the ownership structure of the Investment. Such specific risks  include, but are not limited to, high vacancy rates, tenants in possession but  not paying rent, tenants paying rent but who have "gone dark," properties that  need substantial capital improvements and/or repositioning in their local  markets, properties that are not generating income, and risks relating to joint  venture and co-investor structures. In addition, prospective investors must  rely solely upon the Advisor to identify Investment opportunities and to  negotiate any debt financing. Prospective investors who are unwilling to rely  solely on the Advisor should not invest in our shares. 
Each prospective  investor should consider carefully the risk involved in this offering, and  should consult with his own legal, tax, and financial advisors with respect  thereto prior to investing in shares of the Company's common stock. Examples of  a few risks in this offering are the following:
• Upon raising the minimum  offering amount, we will only own one Investment
• Our Advisor may not be  successful in identifying and consummating suitable investment opportunities.
• Investments in real  estate-related assets can be speculative.
• Adverse economic  conditions may negatively affect our results of operations and, as a result,  our ability to make distributions to our stockholders or to realize  appreciation in the value of our Investments.
• REIT distribution  requirements could adversely affect our liquidity.
• We may have conflicts of  interest with our Advisor and other affiliates, which could result in investment  decisions that are not in the best interests of our stockholders.
• We have used and may  continue to use mortgage and other debt financing to acquire properties or  interests in properties and otherwise incur other indebtedness, which increases  our expenses and could subject us to the risk of losing properties in  foreclosure if our cash flow is insufficient to make loan payments.
• A limit on the percentage  of our securities a person may own may discourage a takeover or business  combination, which could prevent our stockholders from realizing a premium  price for their stock.
• The price of our common  stock may fluctuate significantly.
Prior to this offering, there has been no public market for CapRocq Core REIT, Inc.'s Common Stock, therefore our  Company cannot predict the extent to which an active market for its Common  Stock will develop or be sustained after this offering, or how the development  of such a market might affect the market price of its common stock. For a  complete discussion of risks, please refer to the Form 1-A. A Form 1-A offering  circular relating to these securities has been qualified by the Securities and  Exchange Commission. You may obtain a copy of the final offering circular here: https://www.theasmx.com/investment/caprocqcorereit The Form-1-A contains  forward-looking statements reflecting current expectations that involve risks  and uncertainties. These forward looking statements include statements  regarding commercialization plans, projected timelines, etc. Actual results and  the timing of events may differ materially from those contained in these  forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those  discussed in the section entitled "Risk Factors" and elsewhere in the  offering circular. This document shall not constitute an offer to sell or the  solicitation of an offer to buy, nor shall there be any sale of these  securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or  sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the  securities laws of any such state or jurisdiction.

Microwave and infrared, the frequencies that border these frequencies have led to multi-billion dollar industries.Often referred to as the “Terahertz Gap,” the technology has not been brought to commercialization due to the absence of compact sources and amplifiers capable of generating sufficient power. THz is a platform technology that will open many market opportunities.Teraphysics recently achieved a revolutionary advancement: The first suite of commercially viable high frequency devices capable of generating and amplifying power levels previously unattainable from solid state and laser enabled sources. Our revolutionary devices are the most powerful hand-held THz and MMW devices in existence. Teraphysics is the sole owner of the critical proprietary technology that bridges the “THz Gap”.The initial target markets for Teraphysics is food processing and safety and wireless communications. THz’s unique ability to detect micro contaminants or foreign materials in a variety of different foodstuffs has led to a number of customer-driven, high value applications in food safety and processing. Teraphysics’ MMW technology provides the wireless industry with a killer E-band solution for backhaul and the daunting data transmission demands the wireless industry is faced with.With these technologies, Teraphysics is closely collaborating with global leaders in multiple market verticals in the development and sale of THz and MMW products and applications. With its technology and key commercial relationships, Teraphysics’ goal is to create a vertically integrated entity that will dominate THz and MMW commercialization. There is no visible competition on the horizon.Products / ServicesFood SafetyThe addressable market for Food Safety is $1.5B (5,000 production lines X $250K per unit). Teraphysics projects a market penetration rate of 17% (847 units) over a 5 year period. Terahertz’s unique ability to detect concealed contaminants or foreign materials in a variety of different foodstuffs has led to a number of customer-driven, high value applications in the food inspection market, including food safety and food processing. Customer-driven projects in these markets have demonstrated the unique benefits of the Company’s products, not achievable with current inspection technologies such as X-Ray, microwave or optical imaging. We recently entered into a long-term and very profitable relationship with one of the world’s largest food producers. They intend to share our technology with others in the industry which would allow us to penetrate the huge global food safety market.WirelessThe addressable world market is $308B (approx. 1M macro cell towers worldwide of which 70% are targets in major metro areas; 700,000 X 8 radios per tower = 5.6M radio units X an average selling price of $55,000 = $308B). We project a penetration rate of less than 1% (8,000 units) over a 5 year period. Wireless data traffic has more than doubled in each of the last 6 years, and it is predicted to expand at an exponential rate for years to come. The International Wireless Consortium predicts wireless data traffic to increase 5000 fold by the year 2030, with expectations of 100B devices being placed into service over the next 10-15 years. Two-thirds of the growth will come from a massive densification of micro cells, and our MMW amplifiers will magnify spectrum reuse dramatically. This opportunity has all of the elements of a creative monopoly as outlined in Peter Thiel’s book Zero to One. Also worth noting, the manufacturing of our devices will be outsourced leading to a minimal capex.ManagementChief Executive OfficerLouis S.
