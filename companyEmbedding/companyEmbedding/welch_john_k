			Mr. Welch, age 67, was President and Chief Executive Officer of Centrus Energy Corp. (formerly USEC Inc.) from October 2005 until his retirement in October 2014.
 
Positions Held: He was previously a senior executive with General Dynamics Corporation, retiring from the company in 2003 as Executive Vice President for the Marine Systems Group, which included Bath Iron Works, Electric Boat and National Steel and Shipbuilding Company (NASSCO). During his career with General Dynamics, which began in 1989, Mr. Welch also served as President of Electric Boat, Vice President of Programs for Electric Boat, with responsibility for new construction, overhaul and repair programs, material acquisition and information technology, and Vice President for Program Development at Electric Boat, with responsibility for strategic planning, program and product marketing and high-technology program acquisition and management. Mr. Welch served over seven years on active duty with the U.S. Navy as a nuclear submarine officer and retired from the Naval Reserve.
 
Prior Public Company Directorships (within the last five years): Mr. Welch served on the board of directors of Centrus Energy Corp. and its predecessor, USEC Inc., from 2005 until 2013.
 
Other Directorships and Memberships and Education: Mr. Welch is Chairman of the Board of Battelle Memorial Institute and serves on the board of Mount St. Joseph High School. He received a B.S. in Aerospace Engineering from the U.S. Naval Academy, a Master's Degree in Aeronautical Engineering from the Naval Postgraduate School and an M.B.A. from Loyola College.
 
Qualifications, Experience, Attributes and Skills: We believe Mr. Welch is qualified to serve as a director based upon his senior executive experience at other public companies in the shipbuilding and energy markets, including his experience as executive vice president of the primary competitor to our core shipbuilding business. Mr. Welch also brings experience as a director of other public and private companies and not-for-profit entities.

How the BuildZoom Score works








Follow this contractor

















Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Florida:













Does Welch John K carry a valid contracting license?



If you pay someone to construct a building or a structure, make structural alterations to load bearing walls, or perform services such as plumbing or air conditioning work, that person must have a state contractor's license.











How important is contractor licensing in Florida?



The Florida Construction Industry License Board maintains high standards for contractor licensing. Prior to receiving their license, Florida contractors are required to prove four years of relevant work experience or education; pass a board examination and prove financial solvency.











Your liability risk when hiring Welch John K



In Florida, licensed contractors with employees are required to carry workers' compensation insurance and attest they have obtained public liability and property damage insurance in the amounts determined by the Board.











Financial recourse when hiring Welch John K



Florida maintains a recovery fund, called the Florida Homeowners' Construction Recovery Fund, which is available to a natural person who has suffered monetary damages by the financial mismanagement or misconduct of a contractor, and who has exhausted all other sources of payment. The Board makes the determination of eligibility for an award. Florida contractors are not required to carry an active bond.











What else should I know before hiring Welch John K



As of 2007, the Florida DBPR began requiring license applicants to submit their fingerprints, which are used to run a criminal background check with the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. In addition, they are required to provide a credit report during the license application process to demonstrate financial stability. 











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



The Florida Construction Industry License Board recommends getting at least three written bids before hiring a contractor. Do not automatically accept the lowest bid - an abnormally low bid may indicate the contractor made a mistake and is not including the same work quoted by their competitors. We've made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.
