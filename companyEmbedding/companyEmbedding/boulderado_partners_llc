Briar Rose Bed and Breakfast
Boulder, Colorado





The Rose is located downtown between
the Pearl Street Mall to the north, the Twenty-Ninth Street Mall to
the East, the University of Colorado and the main Naropa University
campus to the
south, and, of course, the Rockies to the west.  There are wonderful
mountain trails within a couple miles, with stunning panoramic
views of the Continental Divide (or an intimate canyon with beautiful
rock formations and many stream-crossings en-route to a secluded
meadow), and the beautiful Boulder Creek Path a couple hundred yards
away.


The Briar Rose attracts a wonderful variety of guests from all
around the world.  Breakfast
is a time of stimulating conversations 
with remarkably interesting people, or an intimate breakfast for two
on our sun-porch.  Fresh flower arrangements are everywhere, and the
gardens are lovely in Spring through the Fall (and still pleasant in
the Winter, which has its own quiet charm when fresh white snow
blankets the ground.)  We offer a large assortment of wonderful fresh
organic loose-leaf tea,
served any time of day with our homemade shortbread butter cookies.  
We are very highly rated, 
with many rave reviews. Our main house was
built in the 1880's, adding to its charm.








We have ten guest rooms, each with its
individual character and amenities. Finish elements vary by room
(hardwood floors, bathtubs, skylights, writing desks, sofa sleepers,
fireplaces, the Huron room with private hot
tub, etc.). For those wishing to conduct business during their
stay, high-speed wireless is available throughout, and our common area
features two guest computers with print, fax, copy and scan
capability.


Boulder has lots of great restaurants (a few requiring long advance reservations), and as concierge we delight in helping visitors
       find what they are looking for, be it Thai, Indian, Northern Italian,
       Organic, Vegetarian, Fresh, or the famous Boulder-Dushanbe
       Teahouse.


As host we extend kindness to whoever walks in the door, whether
guests or not. Our hospitality is expressed each moment in taking care
of those things that call for it. Our wonderful staff of Naropa
University and University of Colorado at Boulder students help us do
this in a way that will engage you.


We intend to be the Boulder's eco
    leader.  We continuously evolve how we make travel more
    sustainable.  For example:  

We serve organic breakfasts (catering to guests' dietary needs whether vegetarian, vegan, or gluten-free.).
You sleep on fine organic cotton sheets by Coyuchi.
Year-by-year we are increasing the energy efficiency of our Boulder accommodations. 
We provide bath products from Shikai and soap from Kiss My Face in 12 oz.   bottles which we refill. Other Boulder hotels use disposable 1.5 oz. bottles   which end up in landfills). 
We offer a wonderful selection of fine loose-leaf organic teas—the only Boulder Bed and Breakfast to do so.
We use environmentally friendly cleaning products.
We recycle paper, glass, metal, and plastic.
We compost our food and yard waste.
We use eco-friendly no-VOC paints.
We are members of the Green Hotel Association.

Boulder Hotels Leader in Sustainability




We intend to encourage and promote ecological consciousness in every
aspect of providing hospitality to our guests.  This is an evolving
process of redesigning our operations to be increasingly friendly to
the environment.  We lead boulder hotels in the effort to make travel sustainable and your stay carbon-neutral.      
How we express this intention:

we serve organic breakfasts--the only hotel or lodging place to do do in Boulder county (since 2004)   
we commit one percent of annual revenues to capital expenditures which reduce the environmental impact of  guest stays – see our Environmental Development Plan  (since 2009)
we are a zero waste community partner with Ecocycle
   (www.ecocycle.org). We recycle all our cans, bottles, plastics,
   batteries, and paper waste products. We compost all of our
   biodegradable waste materials.  (Organic waste decomposes
   aerobically in a compost bin producing carbon dioxide, and
   anaerobically in landfills. Anaerobic decomposition creates
   methane gas which causes more global warming than carbon dioxide.)
   (since 2004)	
we provide 
	bath products from Shikai and soap from Kiss My Face in 12 oz. 
	bottles which we refill. Other Boulder hotels use disposable 1.5 oz. bottles 
	which end up in landfills). (since 2006)	
our accommodations feature organic cotton sheets from Coyuchi. (since 2007)   
we ride 
	bikes. Almost 100% of our employee commuting is by bike or 
	foot. Our local grocery shopping is done with the 
	Briar Rose Bike/trailer. (since 2004)   
we plant 
	native and xeric species and use mulches to conserve water
	(since 2004)   
we cut our 
	lawn with a human-powered reel mower. (The EPA estimates 
	that gas-powered lawnmowers in the U.S. cause as much air 
	pollution as 3.5 million late-model cars.) (since 2004)   
we use 
	compact fluorescent light ("CFL") bulbs to reduce our electricity 
	consumption (since 2006). Overall, our electricity consumption has decreased on a kilowatt basis during our tenure, has been flat on a dollar basis, and has decreased markedly on a per-guest-night basis. This manifests our intention to make the guest vacation travel as carbon-neutral as possible.  In May of 2010 we spent approximately $3,500 on electrical and lighting improvements. In particular we (a) added some exterior lighting circuits that have dusk-to-dawn sensors so that we don't rely on guests or staff to turn them off; (b) replaced all incandescent bulbs with CFLs in the guest rooms, kitchen, living and dining rooms, basements, and staff quarters; (c) reduced the lumens of individual exterior light fixtures while increasing the number of fixtures so as not to lessen the security provided by the exterior lighting; and (d) began experimentation with LED bulbs for exterior lighting.
we run a 95 percent efficient gas furnace in the main house and 
	energy-efficient heat pumps in some guest rooms. The heat pumps 
	are used for both heating and cooling. (since 2004)	
we use a high-efficiency front loading washing machine to wash 
	all bedding and linens, and we do not use fabric-softening dryer 
	sheets. (since 2004)   
100% use of paper containing recycled fiber for toilet and
	facial tissue, and printer paper (since 2005)   
we increased the R-value of our attic insulation to 49 in three of our five attics (2007 and 2008)   
we use eco-friendly cleaning products from 
	Eco-products, Seventh Generation, etc. (since 2004)   

	we provide filtered water in glass bottles in the guest room rather
	than offering mineral water in plastic bottles. (since 2008)   
we send as little as possible to the landfill by donating

 we engaged Xcel Energy in March 2010 to provide an energy assessment of our facilities. In this assessment, Xcel Energy gave us good marks saying our energy usage was 4 percent below the lodging norm of 100 KBtu per square foot. This was heartening to us as we know (a) most lodging occurs in bigger buildings with a lower ratio of windows to walls and a lower ratio of exterior walls to heated square footage and (b) we have an older structure with known issues in the building envelope that we have not fully addressed. These items are significant drivers of energy consumption, and despite these items we are already above average. Xcel Energy recommended that we (i) do additional lighting retrofits of CFL bulbs which we have subsequently done - see above); (ii) upgrade air conditioners... we intend to do this, but it's quite expensive; (iii) unplug a secondary refrigerator ... we do not intend to do this as we perceive an operational need for the secondary refrigerator; and (iv) wrap the water heaters with insulation. We don't intend to wrap the water heaters because they are insulated and not warm to the touch... so we don't think we are losing much heat. Also, we think the assessment was too formulaic in one respect: Xcel Energy universally labels fixes to the building envelope as low return on investment. We disagree when the fixes occur in the context of a remodel and in the lodging business one remodels regularly. Hence, we would like reserve some energy conservation funds for building envelope fixes.
we replaced the kitchen floor with linoleum in March 2010. Our previous floor was worn vinyl, short for polyvinyl chloride. The production of polyvinyl chloride causes more environmental damage than any other plastic. (We intend to retain a soft floor in the kitchen to lessen the stress of  employees standing on hard surfaces for extended periods.) In contrast, lineoleum is made of natural materials  (the primary constituent is linseed oil from the flax plant).  Linoleum is  also durable - lasting four or five decades. The installed cost was $2,500.
