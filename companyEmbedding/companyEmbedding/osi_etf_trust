START









Build a strong core portfolio
Answer 5 quick questions to start.













Question 1
What do you consider your investment style to be?

Conservative
Moderate
Aggressive





Consider risk versus return


Your comfort with risk can depend on your previous investment experience, performance goals, time horizon, and net worth. In general, the higher return you want, the greater risk you'll have to take.






NEXT



Question 1 of 5





Question 2
If the market sees a big downward swing how would you react?

Do nothing
Invest more



Sell some investments
Sell everything


Pause and reflect


Your risk tolerance is key to deciding on your overall portfolio mix. So even when you know that markets constantly move up and down, you should carefully consider these peaks and valleys - and how much of your total investment you're really willing to risk on a possible long-term downturn.

Question 2 of 5





Question 3
If the market sees a big upward swing how would you react?

Do nothing

Sell some investments

Think of the future


Keeping in mind the constant movement of markets, now consider what you would do in an up market. You should take into consideration not just current gains, but also your long-term financial goals.

Question 4
How long do you plan to keep your assets invested for?

YEARS


Estimating your time horizon


Your investing goal may be far in the future, or it could be right around the corner. How many years you have to reach your goals will shape your portfolio.

Question 4 of 5





Question 5
How much would your initial investment be?







Why does the amount matter?


As your portfolio increases in size you can incorporate a larger number of funds to further diversify your portfolio and access more targeted exposures.




Laying the foundation


No matter how much you have to invest, a well-diversified core can help reduce your overall risk long-term. You can use iShares Core Funds as the essential building blocks of your portfolio and add on other kinds of investments to customize for your specific goals.

What is an ETF?










An ETF (Exchange Traded Fund) is a diversified collection of assets (like a mutual fund) that trades on an exchange (like a stock). ETFs are an easy-to-use, low cost and tax efficient way to invest your money.








What are the benefits of ETFs?
 





iShares Core ETFs have outperformed more than 75% of their mutual fund peers on average over the past 5 years1


 




1/3 the price of atypical mutual fund2

1/2 the tax cost of theaverage active mutual fund3

Word on the street

We took to the streets of San Francisco and asked people, "What is an exchange traded fund?" In their words, here's what they had to say.





What is an exchange traded fund






 







Comparing ETFs and mutual funds
Many investors are familiar with mutual funds. How are ETFs similar? And what makes them different?
Hover over the icons to learn more.


Learn more about the differences in investment strategy, fees,and tax implications of ETFs vs mutual funds.







Similarities




Diversification
You get a diversified collection of stocks and/or bonds, which can potentially help reduce risk compared to individual securities.





Professionally managed
The funds are overseen by professional managers.





Risk and reward
The risk profile of an ETF is derived from its underlying holdings, as with mutual funds.



Differences




Cost
ETFs typically cost less than comparable mutual funds (⅓ the cost, on average), and there are no hidden loads or fees. (Your broker may charge a transaction fee, though many iShares ETFs are available commission-free at providers like Fidelity⁴). What’s more, your taxes may be significantly lower: tax costs for iShares ETFs on average are less than ½ those of the average mutual fund³.





Fund performance
Most ETFs seek to closely match the performance of an established stock or bond index, such as the S&P 500 or the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index. Actively managed mutual funds try to beat the index, which can be hard to do, especially after fees and taxes. iShares Core ETFs have outperformed more than 75% of their mutual fund peers on average over the past five years¹.





Buying and selling
As with stocks, you can buy and sell ETFs at the market price whenever the market is open. Mutual fund shares are purchased directly from the fund at Net Asset Value (NAV) and priced once a day after the market closes.





Knowing what you own
Because ETFs usually aim to track an index, their holdings change relatively little over time – without the “style drift” that may surprise mutual fund investors.

1Morningstar, as of 12/31/2016. Post-tax comparison between the 1, 3 and 5 year returns at NAV of the iShares Core ETFs and the oldest share class of active open-end mutual funds within the same Morningstar categories as the iShares Core ETFs. Mutual funds are generally more tax inefficient than ETFs and, as a result, are typically more negatively impacted than ETFs when comparing performance based on post-tax returns rather than total returns. The number of ETFs and mutual funds used for each period varies based on the inception date of the iShares Core ETFs. iShares Core ETFs included in this comparison vary based on the time period analyzed: 1 year (19 Core ETFs existed for the full 1-year period ended 1/31/15); 3 year (15 Core ETFs existed for the full 3-year period ended 1/31/13); and 5 year (9 Core ETFs existed for the full 5-year period ended 1/31/11). iShares Core ETFs outperformed 77.5% (1955/2426), 84.6% (1804/2157), and 79.9% (1330/1515) of their active mutual fund peers over the 1, 3, and 5 year periods ended 12/31/16, respectively. Performance was averaged for Morningstar categories containing more than one iShares fund, and may be different for other time periods. Returns are calculated after taxes on distributions, including capital gains and dividends, assuming the highest federal tax rate for each type of distribution in effect at the time of the distribution. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. For more information on the differences between iShares ETFs and mutual funds, click here.
2Morningstar, as of 12/31/16. Comparison is between the average Prospectus Net Expense Ratio for the iShares ETFs (0.38%) and the oldest share class of active open-end mutual funds (1.22%) with 10-year track records that were available in the U.S. between 1/1/2007 and 12/31/2016.
3Morningstar, as of 12/31/16. "Tax Cost Ratio" is a Morningstar measure of the impact of taxes on capital gains and income distributions on performance. The average 10-year Tax Cost Ratio of iShares ETFs and the oldest share class of all actively managed open-end mutual funds available in the U.S. between 1/1/2007 and 12/31/2016 (excluding municipal bond and money market funds) included in the comparison is 0.51% and 1.20%, respectively.
4ETFs are subject to a short-term trading fee by Fidelity, if held less than 30 days. Other conditions and fees may apply. See Fidelity.com/commissions for details.  BlackRock is not affiliated with Fidelity or any of their affiliates.





 
Carefully consider the Funds' investment objectives, risk factors, and charges and expenses before investing. This and other information can be found in the Funds' prospectuses or, if available, the summary prospectuses, which may be obtained by visiting the iShares Fund and BlackRock Fund prospectus pages. Read the prospectus carefully before investing.
Investing involves risk, including possible loss of principal.







Fixed income risks include interest-rate and credit risk. Typically, when interest rates rise, there is a corresponding decline in bond values. Credit risk refers to the possibility that the bond issuer will not be able to make principal and interest payments.






International investing involves risks, including risks related to foreign currency, limited liquidity, less government regulation and the possibility of substantial volatility due to adverse political, economic or other developments. These risks often are heightened for investments in emerging/ developing markets or in concentrations of single countries.

Transactions in shares of ETFs will result in brokerage commissions and will generate tax consequences. All regulated investment companies are obliged to distribute portfolio gains to shareholders.






Certain traditional mutual funds can also be tax efficient.

What is an ETF?










An ETF (Exchange Traded Fund) is a diversified collection of assets (like a mutual fund) that trades on an exchange (like a stock). ETFs are an easy-to-use, low cost and tax efficient way to invest your money.








What are the benefits of ETFs?
 





iShares Core ETFs have outperformed more than 75% of their mutual fund peers on average over the past 5 years1


 




1/3 the price of atypical mutual fund2

1/2 the tax cost of theaverage active mutual fund3



 


Learn more about why to use ETFs.






 






Word on the street

We took to the streets of San Francisco and asked people, "What is an exchange traded fund?" In their words, here's what they had to say.





What is an exchange traded fund






 







Comparing ETFs and mutual funds
Many investors are familiar with mutual funds. How are ETFs similar? And what makes them different?
Hover over the icons to learn more.


Learn more about the differences in investment strategy, fees,and tax implications of ETFs vs mutual funds.







Similarities




Diversification
You get a diversified collection of stocks and/or bonds, which can potentially help reduce risk compared to individual securities.





Professionally managed
The funds are overseen by professional managers.





Risk and reward
The risk profile of an ETF is derived from its underlying holdings, as with mutual funds.



Differences




Cost
ETFs typically cost less than comparable mutual funds (⅓ the cost, on average), and there are no hidden loads or fees. (Your broker may charge a transaction fee, though many iShares ETFs are available commission-free at providers like Fidelity⁴). What’s more, your taxes may be significantly lower: tax costs for iShares ETFs on average are less than ½ those of the average mutual fund³.





Fund performance
Most ETFs seek to closely match the performance of an established stock or bond index, such as the S&P 500 or the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index. Actively managed mutual funds try to beat the index, which can be hard to do, especially after fees and taxes. iShares Core ETFs have outperformed more than 75% of their mutual fund peers on average over the past five years¹.





Buying and selling
As with stocks, you can buy and sell ETFs at the market price whenever the market is open. Mutual fund shares are purchased directly from the fund at Net Asset Value (NAV) and priced once a day after the market closes.





Knowing what you own
Because ETFs usually aim to track an index, their holdings change relatively little over time – without the “style drift” that may surprise mutual fund investors.

1Morningstar, as of 12/31/2016. Post-tax comparison between the 1, 3 and 5 year returns at NAV of the iShares Core ETFs and the oldest share class of active open-end mutual funds within the same Morningstar categories as the iShares Core ETFs. Mutual funds are generally more tax inefficient than ETFs and, as a result, are typically more negatively impacted than ETFs when comparing performance based on post-tax returns rather than total returns. The number of ETFs and mutual funds used for each period varies based on the inception date of the iShares Core ETFs. iShares Core ETFs included in this comparison vary based on the time period analyzed: 1 year (19 Core ETFs existed for the full 1-year period ended 1/31/15); 3 year (15 Core ETFs existed for the full 3-year period ended 1/31/13); and 5 year (9 Core ETFs existed for the full 5-year period ended 1/31/11). iShares Core ETFs outperformed 77.5% (1955/2426), 84.6% (1804/2157), and 79.9% (1330/1515) of their active mutual fund peers over the 1, 3, and 5 year periods ended 12/31/16, respectively. Performance was averaged for Morningstar categories containing more than one iShares fund, and may be different for other time periods. Returns are calculated after taxes on distributions, including capital gains and dividends, assuming the highest federal tax rate for each type of distribution in effect at the time of the distribution. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. For more information on the differences between iShares ETFs and mutual funds, click here.
2Morningstar, as of 12/31/16. Comparison is between the average Prospectus Net Expense Ratio for the iShares ETFs (0.38%) and the oldest share class of active open-end mutual funds (1.22%) with 10-year track records that were available in the U.S. between 1/1/2007 and 12/31/2016.
3Morningstar, as of 12/31/16. "Tax Cost Ratio" is a Morningstar measure of the impact of taxes on capital gains and income distributions on performance. The average 10-year Tax Cost Ratio of iShares ETFs and the oldest share class of all actively managed open-end mutual funds available in the U.S. between 1/1/2007 and 12/31/2016 (excluding municipal bond and money market funds) included in the comparison is 0.51% and 1.20%, respectively.
4ETFs are subject to a short-term trading fee by Fidelity, if held less than 30 days. Other conditions and fees may apply. See Fidelity.com/commissions for details.  BlackRock is not affiliated with Fidelity or any of their affiliates.





 
Carefully consider the Funds' investment objectives, risk factors, and charges and expenses before investing. This and other information can be found in the Funds' prospectuses or, if available, the summary prospectuses, which may be obtained by visiting the iShares Fund and BlackRock Fund prospectus pages. Read the prospectus carefully before investing.
Investing involves risk, including possible loss of principal.







Fixed income risks include interest-rate and credit risk. Typically, when interest rates rise, there is a corresponding decline in bond values. Credit risk refers to the possibility that the bond issuer will not be able to make principal and interest payments.






International investing involves risks, including risks related to foreign currency, limited liquidity, less government regulation and the possibility of substantial volatility due to adverse political, economic or other developments. These risks often are heightened for investments in emerging/ developing markets or in concentrations of single countries.

ETF Performance










When low cost funds post solid performance, investors keep more of what they earn.






 






Want to keep more of what you earn?

Investment fees and taxes matter. See how much you could save if you invest with iShares ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds) versus a typical mutual fund.





Want to keep more of what you earn?








Potential savings
When you combine the impact of lower fees, potential tax savings, and performance that seeks to match an index, ETFs may potentially earn you nearly $56,000 over 10 years.







Chart reflects the hypothetical growth of a fictional investment of $250,000 with an 8% return and assumes the reinvestment of dividends and capital gains. Fund expenses, including management fees and other expenses have been deducted. The graph is for illustrative purposes only and is not indicative of the performance of any actual fund or investment portfolio.






 




How iShares ETFs can help you keep more





1/3 the cost of a typical mutual fund1:
Most ETFs aim to match the performance of a benchmark index. This strategy generally requires less frequent turnover of holdings within the fund, so fund fees tend to be lower.



1/2 the tax cost of the average active mutual fund2:
When you sell your mutual fund or ETF at a gain, you will have to pay taxes on that gain. But capital gains taxes can be incurred even if you don’t sell your shares, due to trading activity within your fund. Active mutual funds that frequently buy and sell securities are often subject to higher capital gains distributions. Because most ETFs track an index, they tend to generate fewer undesirable capital gains distributions.



Only 18% of active managers beat their benchmarks after fees over the last five years3:
Because of the more frequent trading and complex strategies in actively-managed funds, fund expenses are higher – so performance has to be good enough to compensate for those higher fees.















Percent of comparable mutual funds that iShares Core ETFs outperformed







Morningstar, as of 12/31/2016. Post-tax comparison between the 1, 3 and 5 year returns at NAV of the iShares Core ETFs and the oldest share class of active open-end mutual funds within the same Morningstar categories as the iShares Core ETFs. Mutual funds are generally more tax inefficient than ETFs and, as a result, are typically more negatively impacted than ETFs when comparing performance based on post-tax returns rather than total returns.

Free commission offer applies to online purchases of Fidelity ETFs and select iShares ETFs in a Fidelity brokerage account. Fidelity accounts may require minimum balances. The sale of ETFs is subject to an activity assessment fee (from $0.01 to $0.03 per $1,000 of principal). iShares ETFs and Fidelity ETFs are subject to a short-term trading fee by Fidelity if held less than 30 days.



$4.95 commission applies to online U.S. equity trades in a Fidelity retail account only for Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC retail clients. Certain accounts may require a minimum opening balance of $2,500. Sell orders are subject to an activity assessment fee (from $0.01 to $0.03 per $1,000 of principal). Other conditions may apply. See Fidelity.com/commissions for details.

          1. Strategic Insight Simfund/FI Desktop, data as of 7/31/2013. Based on a comparison of total expense ratios for U.S. sector level ETFs with similar holdings and investment objectives (using the MSCI and S&P Global Industry Classification System — GICS) within the universe of 298 ETFs Morningstar has classified as the Sector Stock asset class.
	
    

          2. BlackRock Global ETP Landscape Report 12/31/2015. Based on AUM, net new flows, and number of ETFs.
	
    

          3. The BlackRock Diversified Income Portfolio is composed of exchange-traded products (ETPs)—primarily exchange-traded funds (ETFs)—but may contain other investment vehicles, such as mutual funds.
	
    

          ETFs are subject to market fluctuation and the risks of their underlying investments. ETFs are subject to management fees and other expenses. Unlike mutual funds, ETF shares are bought and sold at market price, which may be higher or lower than their NAV, and are not individually redeemed from the fund.
	
    

Exchange-traded products (ETPs) are subject to market volatility and the risks of their underlying securities, which may include the risks associated with investing in smaller companies, foreign securities, commodities, and fixed income investments. Foreign securities are subject to interest rate, currency exchange rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets. ETPs that target a small universe of securities, such as a specific region or market sector, are generally subject to greater market volatility, as well as to the specific risks associated with that sector, region, or other focus. ETPs that use derivatives, leverage, or complex investment strategies are subject to additional risks. The return of an index ETP is usually different from that of the index it tracks because of fees, expenses, and tracking error. An ETP may trade at a premium or discount to its net asset value (NAV) (or indicative value in the case of exchange-traded notes). The degree of liquidity can vary significantly from one ETP to another and losses may be magnified if no liquid market exists for the ETP's shares when attempting to sell them. Each ETP has a unique risk profile, detailed in its prospectus, offering circular, or similar material, which should be considered carefully when making investment decisions.


          Research is provided for informational purposes only, does not constitute advice or guidance, nor is it an endorsement or recommendation for any particular security or trading strategy. Research is provided by independent companies not affiliated with Fidelity. Please determine which security, product, or service is right for you based on your investment objectives, risk tolerance, and financial situation. Be sure to review your decisions periodically to make sure they are still consistent with your goals.
	
    

For iShares ETFs, Fidelity receives compensation from the ETF sponsor and/or its affiliates in connection with an exclusive long-term marketing program that includes promotion of iShares ETFs and inclusion of iShares funds in certain FBS platforms and investment programs. Additional information about the sources, amounts, and terms of compensation can be found in the ETF’s prospectus and related documents. Fidelity may add or waive commissions on ETFs without prior notice. BlackRock and iShares are registered trademarks of BlackRock Inc., and its affiliates.


Strategic Advisers, Inc., and BlackRock Investment Management, LLC, are independent entities and are not legally affiliated. Strategic Advisers, Inc., is the investment manager for client accounts and implements trades for the accounts based on the model portfolio of investments it receives from BlackRock Investment Management, LLC. Strategic Advisers may select investments for an account that differ from BlackRock Investment Management's model.


BlackRock® Diversified Income Portfolio is a service offered through Strategic Advisers, Inc., a registered investment adviser and a Fidelity Investments company. This service provides discretionary money management for a fee.


Brokerage services are provided by Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC. Custody and other services are provided by National Financial Services LLC. Both are Fidelity Investments companies and Members of NYSE and SIPC.


Before investing, consider the funds' investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses. Contact Fidelity for a prospectus or, if available, a summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.

Core position



Uninvested cash

Uninvested cash in your account is held in what is known as a core position. Think of your core position as a place where money is held before you invest it or distribute it from your account. For the Fidelity Account®, you may choose one of many core positions:

Fidelity Government Money Market Fund (SPAXX), a taxable mutual fund normally investing at least 80% of assets in U.S. Government securities and related debt, and related repurchase/reverse repurchase agreements. Intended for investors seeking as high a level of current income as is consistent with the preservation of capital and liquidity.*
Fidelity Treasury Money Market Fund (FLTXX), a taxable mutual fund normally investing at least 80% of assets in U.S. Treasury securities and related repurchase/reverse repurchase agreements. Intended for investors seeking as high a level of current income as is consistent with the preservation of capital and liquidity.*



							
								*
							
							
								
					
You could lose money by investing in a money market fund. Although the fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. An investment in the fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Fidelity Investments and its affiliates, the fund’s sponsor, have no legal obligation to provide financial support to money market funds and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the fund at any time.


Fidelity’s government and U.S. Treasury money market funds will not impose a fee upon the sale of your shares, nor temporarily suspend your ability to sell shares if the fund's weekly liquid assets fall below 30% of its total assets because of market conditions or other factors.

Value
 Is OSI ETF Trust - O'Shares FTSE Russell Small Cap Quality Dividend ETF undervalued based on future cash flows and its price relative to the stock market?

Value is all about what a company is worth versus what price it is available for. If you went into a grocery store and all the bananas were on sale at half price, they could be considered undervalued.



INTRINSIC VALUE BASED ON FUTURE CASH FLOWS 

 It is not possible to calculate the future cash flow value for OSI ETF Trust - O'Shares FTSE Russell Small Cap Quality Dividend ETF. This is due to cash flow or dividend data being unavailable. The share price is $25.77.



PRICE RELATIVE TO MARKET 


We can also value a company based on what the stock market is willing to pay for it. This is similar to the price of fruit (e.g. Mangoes or Avacados) increasing when they are out of season, or how much your home is worth.

Discounted cash flow (Dividend Discount Model)
The calculations below outline how an intrinsic value for OSI ETF Trust - O'Shares FTSE Russell Small Cap Quality Dividend ETF is arrived at by discounting future dividends to their present value. This approach is used for finance firms where free cash flow is difficult to estimate (e.g. Banks/ Insurance firms).
If the firm does not pay the majority of its earnings out as a dividend this method will often arrive at a value significantly lower than the share price.
See our documentation to learn about this calculation.

Value of the stock
Value = Expected dividends per share / (Discount Rate - Perpetual growth rate)
$0 = ($0 / (10.55% - 2.33%)
Value per share: $0
Current discount (share price of $25.77): %

Estimate of Discount Rate
The discount rate, or required rate of return, is estimated by calculating the Cost of Equity.
Discount rate = Cost of Equity = Risk Free Rate + (Levered Beta * Equity Risk Premium)
Discount rate = 10.55% = 2.33% + (1.072 * 7.67%)

Estimate of Bottom Up Beta
The Levered is used in the case of financial firms, but it is not adjusted for financial leverage like with non-finance firms. Therefore the average levered beta from comparable firms is used as the bottom-up beta. It is limited to 0.8 to 2.0 (practical range for a stable firm).
Average Levered Beta from peers = 1.072
Levered Beta used in calculation = 1.072

Assumptions

The risk free rate of 2.33% is from the 10 year government bond rate in US.
The bottom-up beta is estimated by analysing other companies in the same industry.
The Equity Risk Premium is calculated by subtracting the risk free rate from the market return premium (10%) (source: Buffet).
The dividend discount model is automatically used for companies in the following industries: Banks, Insurance, Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs), Diversified Financial Services and Capital Markets.














Future Performance
 How is OSI ETF Trust - O'Shares FTSE Russell Small Cap Quality Dividend ETF expected to perform in the next 1 to 3 years based on estimates from 0 analysts?

 ETFs appear based on your recent clicks on Fidelity.com. Our     goal is to make it easier for you to research and find the     appropriate ETF for your situation.








Free commission offer applies to online purchases of Fidelity ETFs and select iShares ETFs in a Fidelity brokerage account. Fidelity accounts may require minimum balances. The sale of ETFs is subject to an activity assessment fee (of between $0.01 to $0.03 per $1,000 of principal). iShares ETFs and Fidelity ETFs are subject to a short-term trading fee by Fidelity if held less than 30 days.*The ETF/ETP Screener includes many types of Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and Exchange-traded products (ETPs). It can include ETPs not registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940.** Performance data shown is past performance and is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted. Yield and return will vary, therefore you have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.  For standard quarterly performance, go to the funds SnapShot page by clicking on the ETF/ETPs symbol.ETFs are subject to market fluctuation and the risks of their underlying investments.  ETFs are subject to management fees and other expenses.  Unlike mutual funds, ETF shares are bought and sold at market price, which may be higher or lower than their NAV, and are not individually redeemed from the fund. Leveraged and inverse exchange traded products are not designed for buy and hold Investors or investors who do not intend to manage their investment on a daily basis. These products require a Most Aggressive investment objective and an executed Designated Investments Agreement to purchase. These products are for sophisticated investors who understand their risks (including the effect of daily compounding of leveraged investment results), and who intend to actively monitor and manage their investments on a daily basis.For iShares ETFs, Fidelity receives compensation from the ETF sponsor and/or its affiliates in connection with an exclusive, long-term marketing program that includes promotion of iShares ETFs and inclusion of iShares funds in certain FBS platforms and investment programs. Additional information about the sources, amounts, and terms of compensation is described in the ETFs prospectus and related documents. Fidelity may add or waive commissions on ETFs without prior notice.

		ETF/ETP Screens provide quick access to a list of ETFs/ETPs with prospectus-stated objectives focused on geographical location (i.e. region, country); sector (i.e. energy, health care); or asset class (i.e. equity, fixed income). Just click the type of quick screen you want, then choose the area of focus. You can then screen on additional criteria to narrow the results further or begin researching the ETFs/ETPs results already shown by clicking on their symbols. Alternatively, you could click on the link below the map titled "Start Your Own Screen" to screen ETFs/ETPs based on your own criteria, or go to "Saved Screens" to launch a saved screen from a prior session.
		










How are Similar Funds determined?

This function provides a list of ETPs that is generated by XTF Marco Polo ("XTF"), a third-party independent research provider. XTF uses a proprietary algorithm to develop a list monthly of potentially similar ETPs based on a number of financial characteristics. The ETP characteristics evaluated by XTF's algorithm include, but are not limited to, geography, investment philosophy, style, market capitalization, credit grade and return correlations. Please note: The list provided may include as "similar" ETFs, ETNs and other ETP products. ETNs are not mutual funds; they are unsecured debt of the issuer. Unlike ETFs, ETNs are subject to the credit risk of the issuer. ETNs may trade at a price significantly different from their indicative value. ETNs can become illiquid; you should be willing and able to hold your notes until maturity. Some ETNs are callable or redeemable by the issuer before their stated maturity date. The tax treatment of ETNs is uncertain and may vary from what is described in the prospectus. The results may also include inverse and/or leveraged ETFs and ETNs, which require a Most Aggressive investment objective and an executed Designated Investments Agreement to purchase. These products are for sophisticated investors. They are not designed for buy-and-hold investors who seek to track an index over a long period of time.
This function provides general educational information on potentially similar ETPs. While this function may be of use to investors in evaluating certain information about ETPs, it should not be considered to include every factor that may be necessary for an investor to make a decision to invest in an ETP. A decision to invest in a particular ETF may be based on a number of factors, including investors' needs, goals, and comfort with risk. Please read the ETP's prospectus, offering circulate or other publicly available investment information before making an investment decision. As with other investments through Fidelity, you must decide for yourself if an investment in a security is consistent with your evaluation of the security, your investment objectives, your risk tolerance, your investment time frame and your financial situation. The information provided is educational in nature and should not be used as the sole basis for an investment decision. By making this information available, Fidelity is not endorsing or guaranteeing the suitability or potential value of any particular investment or information source.











		ETF/ETP Market Tracker provides a quick snapshot of changes for each asset class and individual ETF/ETPs throughout the trading day*. "Performance" shows change in price; "Volume" displays whether the relative volume is higher or lower than average; and "Net Flows" shows weekly net flows. The size of each box represents the relative change in net assets of the asset class within each category. A larger box indicates a greater change in net assets for the asset class. Click "Get more details on the market" to drill down into distinct and specific areas of the market as well as individual ETF/ETPs.	
These 3 views are updated in the following manner:
Today's Price % Change by Asset Class - Today's intraday price performance percent change for each ETP in each asset class is added together and then divided by the total number of ETPs in each asset class.
Relative Volume by Asset Class - Using the 90-day average of the daily volume for both the market and the security; we divide the security's average volume by the market's total volume to determine the normal percentage of the total volume that comes from each security. Throughout the trading day, we will do a similar calculation, comparing the current volume for that security to the total market volume at that point in the day. The two calculations are compared and if the current day's percentage is greater than the average, the security has higher relative volume than the market.
Prior Day Net Flows as % of Net Assets by Asset Class -  Prior Trading Day's ETP Net Flows are added together for the asset class then divided by the total sum of Net Assets for each asset class.
*Price change and volume are delayed typically 1 to 5 minutes during market open. Market close price change and volume will appear until next market open. 











		Expert Strategies are featured to help educate investors about different investment styles used by research firms and consist of a mix of screens from different providers representing different equity styles and are intended to reflect current market trends. They are typically changed monthly. Fidelity does not endorse or recommend them.
		











		Sabrient selects its ETF Bulls or Bears of the Week using a proprietary methodology that combines Sabrient's Outlook Scores with its Bull or Bear Score.  This results in a ranked universe of approximately 300 ETFs, out of which Sabrient selects three from the highest rankings and three from the lowest for its ETF Bulls/ Bears of the week.   This content is provided for educational purposes only and is updated before the market opens each Monday.

How are Similar Funds determined?

This function provides a list of ETPs that is generated by XTF Marco Polo ("XTF"), a third-party independent research provider. XTF uses a proprietary algorithm to develop a list monthly of potentially similar ETPs based on a number of financial characteristics. The ETP characteristics evaluated by XTF's algorithm include, but are not limited to, geography, investment philosophy, style, market capitalization, credit grade and return correlations. Please note: The list provided may include as "similar" ETFs, ETNs and other ETP products. ETNs are not mutual funds; they are unsecured debt of the issuer. Unlike ETFs, ETNs are subject to the credit risk of the issuer. ETNs may trade at a price significantly different from their indicative value. ETNs can become illiquid; you should be willing and able to hold your notes until maturity. Some ETNs are callable or redeemable by the issuer before their stated maturity date. The tax treatment of ETNs is uncertain and may vary from what is described in the prospectus. The results may also include inverse and/or leveraged ETFs and ETNs, which require a Most Aggressive investment objective and an executed Designated Investments Agreement to purchase. These products are for sophisticated investors. They are not designed for buy-and-hold investors who seek to track an index over a long period of time.
This function provides general educational information on potentially similar ETPs. While this function may be of use to investors in evaluating certain information about ETPs, it should not be considered to include every factor that may be necessary for an investor to make a decision to invest in an ETP. A decision to invest in a particular ETF may be based on a number of factors, including investors' needs, goals, and comfort with risk. Please read the ETP's prospectus, offering circulate or other publicly available investment information before making an investment decision. As with other investments through Fidelity, you must decide for yourself if an investment in a security is consistent with your evaluation of the security, your investment objectives, your risk tolerance, your investment time frame and your financial situation. The information provided is educational in nature and should not be used as the sole basis for an investment decision. By making this information available, Fidelity is not endorsing or guaranteeing the suitability or potential value of any particular investment or information source.











		ETF/ETP Market Tracker provides a quick snapshot of changes for each asset class and individual ETF/ETPs throughout the trading day*. "Performance" shows change in price; "Volume" displays whether the relative volume is higher or lower than average; and "Net Flows" shows weekly net flows. The size of each box represents the relative change in net assets of the asset class within each category. A larger box indicates a greater change in net assets for the asset class. Click "Get more details on the market" to drill down into distinct and specific areas of the market as well as individual ETF/ETPs.	
These 3 views are updated in the following manner:
Today's Price % Change by Asset Class - Today's intraday price performance percent change for each ETP in each asset class is added together and then divided by the total number of ETPs in each asset class.
Relative Volume by Asset Class - Using the 90-day average of the daily volume for both the market and the security; we divide the security's average volume by the market's total volume to determine the normal percentage of the total volume that comes from each security. Throughout the trading day, we will do a similar calculation, comparing the current volume for that security to the total market volume at that point in the day. The two calculations are compared and if the current day's percentage is greater than the average, the security has higher relative volume than the market.
Prior Day Net Flows as % of Net Assets by Asset Class -  Prior Trading Day's ETP Net Flows are added together for the asset class then divided by the total sum of Net Assets for each asset class.
*Price change and volume are delayed typically 1 to 5 minutes during market open. Market close price change and volume will appear until next market open. 











		Expert Strategies are featured to help educate investors about different investment styles used by research firms and consist of a mix of screens from different providers representing different equity styles and are intended to reflect current market trends. They are typically changed monthly. Fidelity does not endorse or recommend them.

Start Preamble
AGENCY:
Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”).
ACTION:
Notice of an application for an order under section 6(c) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “Act”) for an exemption from sections 2(a)(32), 5(a)(1), 22(d), and 22(e) of the Act and rule 22c-1 under the Act, under sections 6(c) and 17(b) of the Act for an exemption from sections 17(a)(1) and 17(a)(2) of the Act, and under section 12(d)(1)(J) for an exemption from sections 12(d)(1)(A) and 12(d)(1)(B) of the Act. The requested order would permit (a) index-based series of certain open-end management investment companies (“Funds”) to issue shares redeemable in large aggregations only (“Creation Units”); (b) secondary market transactions in Fund shares to occur at negotiated market prices rather than at net asset value (“NAV”); (c) certain Funds to pay redemption proceeds, under certain circumstances, more than seven days after the tender of shares for redemption; (d) certain affiliated persons of a Fund to deposit securities into, and receive securities from, the Fund in connection with the purchase and redemption of Creation Units; (e) certain registered management investment companies and unit investment trusts outside of the same group of investment companies as the Funds (“Funds of Funds”) to acquire shares of the Funds; and (f) certain Funds (“Feeder Funds”) to create and redeem Creation Units in-kind in a master-feeder structure.

Applicants: O'Shares Investment Advisers, LLC (the “Initial Adviser”), a Delaware limited liability company registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and OSI ETF Trust (the “Trust”), a Delaware statutory trust registered under the Act as an open-end management investment company with multiple series.
DATES:

Filing Dates: The application was filed on April 21, 2016, and amended on July 29, 2016.

Hearing or Notification of Hearing: An order granting the requested relief will be issued unless the Commission orders a hearing. Interested persons may request a hearing by writing to the Commission's Secretary and serving applicants with a copy of the request, personally or by mail. Hearing requests should be received by the Commission by 5:30 p.m. on August 26, 2016, and should be accompanied by proof of service on applicants, in the form of an affidavit, or for lawyers, a certificate of service. Pursuant to rule 0-5 under the Act, hearing requests should state the nature of the writer's interest, any facts bearing upon the desirability of a hearing on the matter, the reason for the request, and the issues contested. Persons who wish to be notified of a hearing may request notification by writing to the Commission's Secretary.

Start Supplemental Information
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained via the Commission's Web site by searching for the file number, or for an applicant using the Company name box, at http://www.sec.gov/​search/​search.htm or by calling (202) 551-8090.
Summary of the Application
1. Applicants request an order that would allow Funds to operate as index exchange traded funds (“ETFs”).[1] 
           Fund shares will be purchased and redeemed at their NAV in Creation Units only. All orders to purchase Creation Units and all redemption requests will be placed by or through an “Authorized Participant,” which will have signed a participant agreement with the Distributor. Shares will be listed and traded individually on a national securities exchange, where share prices will be based on the current bid/offer market. Certain Funds may operate as Feeder Funds in a master-feeder structure. Any order granting the requested relief would be subject to the terms and conditions stated in the application.
2. Each Fund will hold investment positions selected to correspond generally to the performance of an Underlying Index. In the case of Self-Indexing Funds, an affiliated person, as defined in section 2(a)(3) of the Act (“Affiliated Person”), or an affiliated person of an Affiliated Person (“Second-Tier Affiliate”), of the Trust or a Fund, of the Adviser, of any sub-adviser to or promoter of a Fund, or of the Distributor will compile, create, sponsor or maintain the Underlying Index.[2] 

3. Shares will be purchased and redeemed in Creation Units and generally on an in-kind basis. Except where the purchase or redemption will include cash under the limited circumstances specified in the application, purchasers will be required to purchase Creation Units by depositing specified instruments (“Deposit Instruments”), and shareholders redeeming their shares will receive specified instruments (“Redemption Instruments”). The Deposit Instruments and the Redemption Instruments will each correspond pro rata to the positions in the Fund's portfolio (including cash positions) except as specified in the application.
4. Because shares will not be individually redeemable, applicants request an exemption from section 5(a)(1) and section 2(a)(32) of the Act that would permit the Funds to register as open-end management investment companies and issue shares that are redeemable in Creation Units only.
5. Applicants also request an exemption from section 22(d) of the Act and rule 22c-1 under the Act as secondary market trading in shares will take place at negotiated prices, not at a current offering price described in a Fund's prospectus, and not at a price based on NAV. Applicants state that (a) Start Printed Page 52486secondary market trading in shares does not involve a Fund as a party and will not result in dilution of an investment in shares, and (b) to the extent different prices exist during a given trading day, or from day to day, such variances occur as a result of third-party market forces, such as supply and demand. Therefore, applicants assert that secondary market transactions in shares will not lead to discrimination or preferential treatment among purchasers. Finally, applicants represent that share market prices will be disciplined by arbitrage opportunities, which should prevent shares from trading at a material discount or premium from NAV.
6. With respect to Funds that effect creations and redemptions of Creation Units in kind and that are based on certain Underlying Indexes that include foreign securities, applicants request relief from the requirement imposed by section 22(e) in order to allow such Funds to pay redemption proceeds within fifteen calendar days following the tender of Creation Units for redemption. Applicants assert that the requested relief would not be inconsistent with the spirit and intent of section 22(e) to prevent unreasonable, undisclosed or unforeseen delays in the actual payment of redemption proceeds.
7. Applicants request an exemption to permit Funds of Funds to acquire Fund shares beyond the limits of section 12(d)(1)(A) of the Act; and the Funds, and any principal underwriter for the Funds, and/or any broker or dealer registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, to sell shares to Funds of Funds beyond the limits of section 12(d)(1)(B) of the Act. The application's terms and conditions are designed to, among other things, help prevent any potential (i) undue influence over a Fund through control or voting power, or in connection with certain services, transactions, and underwritings, (ii) excessive layering of fees, and (iii) overly complex fund structures, which are the concerns underlying the limits in sections 12(d)(1)(A) and (B) of the Act.
8. Applicants request an exemption from sections 17(a)(1) and 17(a)(2) of the Act to permit persons that are Affiliated Persons, or Second Tier Affiliates, of the Funds, solely by virtue of certain ownership interests, to effectuate purchases and redemptions in-kind. The deposit procedures for in-kind purchases of Creation Units and the redemption procedures for in-kind redemptions of Creation Units will be the same for all purchases and redemptions and Deposit Instruments and Redemption Instruments will be valued in the same manner as those investment positions currently held by the Funds. Applicants also seek relief from the prohibitions on affiliated transactions in section 17(a) to permit a Fund to sell its shares to and redeem its shares from a Fund of Funds, and to engage in the accompanying in-kind transactions with the Fund of Funds.[3] 
           The purchase of Creation Units by a Fund of Funds directly from a Fund will be accomplished in accordance with the policies of the Fund of Funds and will be based on the NAVs of the Funds.
9. Applicants also request relief to permit a Feeder Fund to acquire shares of another registered investment company managed by the Adviser having substantially the same investment objectives as the Feeder Fund (“Master Fund”) beyond the limitations in section 12(d)(1)(A) and permit the Master Fund, and any principal underwriter for the Master Fund, to sell shares of the Master Fund to the Feeder Fund beyond the limitations in section 12(d)(1)(B).
10. Section 6(c) of the Act permits the Commission to exempt any persons or transactions from any provision of the Act if such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act. Section 12(d)(1)(J) of the Act provides that the Commission may exempt any person, security, or transaction, or any class or classes of persons, securities, or transactions, from any provision of section 12(d)(1) if the exemption is consistent with the public interest and the protection of investors. Section 17(b) of the Act authorizes the Commission to grant an order permitting a transaction otherwise prohibited by section 17(a) if it finds that (a) the terms of the proposed transaction are fair and reasonable and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned; (b) the proposed transaction is consistent with the policies of each registered investment company involved; and (c) the proposed transaction is consistent with the general purposes of the Act.

Footnotes

1.
     Applicants request that the order apply to the initial series and any additional series of the Trust, and any other open-end management investment company or series thereof (each, included in the term “Fund”), each of which will operate as an ETF and will track a specified index comprised of domestic or foreign equity and/or fixed income securities (each, an “Underlying Index”). Any Fund will (a) be advised by the Initial Adviser or an entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the Initial Adviser (each, an “Adviser”) and (b) comply with the terms and conditions of the application.

        Back to Citation
      


2.
     Each Self-Indexing Fund will post on its Web site the identities and quantities of the investment positions that will form the basis for the Fund's calculation of its NAV at the end of the day. Applicants believe that requiring Self-Indexing Funds to maintain full portfolio transparency will help address, together with other protections, conflicts of interest with respect to such Funds.

        Back to Citation
      


3.
     The requested relief would apply to direct sales of shares in Creation Units by a Fund to a Fund of Funds and redemptions of those shares. Applicants, moreover, are not seeking relief from section 17(a) for, and the requested relief will not apply to, transactions where a Fund could be deemed an Affiliated Person, or a Second-Tier Affiliate, of a Fund of Funds because an Adviser or an entity controlling, controlled by or under common control with an Adviser provides investment advisory services to that Fund of Funds.

START









Build a strong core portfolio
Answer 5 quick questions to start.













Question 1
What do you consider your investment style to be?

Conservative
Moderate
Aggressive





Consider risk versus return


Your comfort with risk can depend on your previous investment experience, performance goals, time horizon, and net worth. In general, the higher return you want, the greater risk you'll have to take.






NEXT



Question 1 of 5





Question 2
If the market sees a big downward swing how would you react?

Do nothing
Invest more



Sell some investments
Sell everything


Pause and reflect


Your risk tolerance is key to deciding on your overall portfolio mix. So even when you know that markets constantly move up and down, you should carefully consider these peaks and valleys - and how much of your total investment you're really willing to risk on a possible long-term downturn.

Question 2 of 5





Question 3
If the market sees a big upward swing how would you react?

Do nothing
Invest more



Sell some investments
Sell everything


Think of the future


Keeping in mind the constant movement of markets, now consider what you would do in an up market. You should take into consideration not just current gains, but also your long-term financial goals.

Question 4 of 5





Question 5
How much would your initial investment be?







Why does the amount matter?


As your portfolio increases in size you can incorporate a larger number of funds to further diversify your portfolio and access more targeted exposures.




Laying the foundation


No matter how much you have to invest, a well-diversified core can help reduce your overall risk long-term. You can use iShares Core Funds as the essential building blocks of your portfolio and add on other kinds of investments to customize for your specific goals.

What is an ETF?










An ETF (Exchange Traded Fund) is a diversified collection of assets (like a mutual fund) that trades on an exchange (like a stock). ETFs are an easy-to-use, low cost and tax efficient way to invest your money.








What are the benefits of ETFs?
 





iShares Core ETFs have outperformed more than 75% of their mutual fund peers on average over the past 5 years1


 




1/3 the price of atypical mutual fund2

1/2 the tax cost of theaverage active mutual fund3



 


Learn more about why to use ETFs.






 






Word on the street

We took to the streets of San Francisco and asked people, "What is an exchange traded fund?" In their words, here's what they had to say.





What is an exchange traded fund






 







Comparing ETFs and mutual funds
Many investors are familiar with mutual funds. How are ETFs similar? And what makes them different?
Hover over the icons to learn more.


Learn more about the differences in investment strategy, fees,and tax implications of ETFs vs mutual funds.







Similarities




Diversification
You get a diversified collection of stocks and/or bonds, which can potentially help reduce risk compared to individual securities.





Professionally managed
The funds are overseen by professional managers.





Risk and reward
The risk profile of an ETF is derived from its underlying holdings, as with mutual funds.



Differences




Cost
ETFs typically cost less than comparable mutual funds (⅓ the cost, on average), and there are no hidden loads or fees. (Your broker may charge a transaction fee, though many iShares ETFs are available commission-free at providers like Fidelity⁴). What’s more, your taxes may be significantly lower: tax costs for iShares ETFs on average are less than ½ those of the average mutual fund³.





Fund performance
Most ETFs seek to closely match the performance of an established stock or bond index, such as the S&P 500 or the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index. Actively managed mutual funds try to beat the index, which can be hard to do, especially after fees and taxes. iShares Core ETFs have outperformed more than 75% of their mutual fund peers on average over the past five years¹.





Buying and selling
As with stocks, you can buy and sell ETFs at the market price whenever the market is open. Mutual fund shares are purchased directly from the fund at Net Asset Value (NAV) and priced once a day after the market closes.





Knowing what you own
Because ETFs usually aim to track an index, their holdings change relatively little over time – without the “style drift” that may surprise mutual fund investors.

1Morningstar, as of 12/31/2016. Post-tax comparison between the 1, 3 and 5 year returns at NAV of the iShares Core ETFs and the oldest share class of active open-end mutual funds within the same Morningstar categories as the iShares Core ETFs. Mutual funds are generally more tax inefficient than ETFs and, as a result, are typically more negatively impacted than ETFs when comparing performance based on post-tax returns rather than total returns. The number of ETFs and mutual funds used for each period varies based on the inception date of the iShares Core ETFs. iShares Core ETFs included in this comparison vary based on the time period analyzed: 1 year (19 Core ETFs existed for the full 1-year period ended 1/31/15); 3 year (15 Core ETFs existed for the full 3-year period ended 1/31/13); and 5 year (9 Core ETFs existed for the full 5-year period ended 1/31/11). iShares Core ETFs outperformed 77.5% (1955/2426), 84.6% (1804/2157), and 79.9% (1330/1515) of their active mutual fund peers over the 1, 3, and 5 year periods ended 12/31/16, respectively. Performance was averaged for Morningstar categories containing more than one iShares fund, and may be different for other time periods. Returns are calculated after taxes on distributions, including capital gains and dividends, assuming the highest federal tax rate for each type of distribution in effect at the time of the distribution. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. For more information on the differences between iShares ETFs and mutual funds, click here.
2Morningstar, as of 12/31/16. Comparison is between the average Prospectus Net Expense Ratio for the iShares ETFs (0.38%) and the oldest share class of active open-end mutual funds (1.22%) with 10-year track records that were available in the U.S. between 1/1/2007 and 12/31/2016.
3Morningstar, as of 12/31/16. "Tax Cost Ratio" is a Morningstar measure of the impact of taxes on capital gains and income distributions on performance. The average 10-year Tax Cost Ratio of iShares ETFs and the oldest share class of all actively managed open-end mutual funds available in the U.S. between 1/1/2007 and 12/31/2016 (excluding municipal bond and money market funds) included in the comparison is 0.51% and 1.20%, respectively.
4ETFs are subject to a short-term trading fee by Fidelity, if held less than 30 days. Other conditions and fees may apply. See Fidelity.com/commissions for details.  BlackRock is not affiliated with Fidelity or any of their affiliates.





 
Carefully consider the Funds' investment objectives, risk factors, and charges and expenses before investing. This and other information can be found in the Funds' prospectuses or, if available, the summary prospectuses, which may be obtained by visiting the iShares Fund and BlackRock Fund prospectus pages. Read the prospectus carefully before investing.
Investing involves risk, including possible loss of principal.







Fixed income risks include interest-rate and credit risk. Typically, when interest rates rise, there is a corresponding decline in bond values. Credit risk refers to the possibility that the bond issuer will not be able to make principal and interest payments.






International investing involves risks, including risks related to foreign currency, limited liquidity, less government regulation and the possibility of substantial volatility due to adverse political, economic or other developments. These risks often are heightened for investments in emerging/ developing markets or in concentrations of single countries.






There is no guarantee that dividends will be paid.






Transactions in shares of ETFs will result in brokerage commissions and will generate tax consequences. All regulated investment companies are obliged to distribute portfolio gains to shareholders.






Certain traditional mutual funds can also be tax efficient.






Investment comparisons are for illustrative purposes only. To better understand the similarities and differences between investments, including investment objectives, risks, fees and expenses, it is important to read the products' prospectuses.






The strategies discussed are strictly for illustrative and educational purposes and are not a recommendation, offer or solicitation to buy or sell any securities or to adopt any investment strategy. There is no guarantee that any strategies discussed will be effective.

ETF Performance










When low cost funds post solid performance, investors keep more of what they earn.






 






Want to keep more of what you earn?

Investment fees and taxes matter. See how much you could save if you invest with iShares ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds) versus a typical mutual fund.





Want to keep more of what you earn?








Potential savings
When you combine the impact of lower fees, potential tax savings, and performance that seeks to match an index, ETFs may potentially earn you nearly $56,000 over 10 years.







Chart reflects the hypothetical growth of a fictional investment of $250,000 with an 8% return and assumes the reinvestment of dividends and capital gains. Fund expenses, including management fees and other expenses have been deducted. The graph is for illustrative purposes only and is not indicative of the performance of any actual fund or investment portfolio.






 




How iShares ETFs can help you keep more





1/3 the cost of a typical mutual fund1:
Most ETFs aim to match the performance of a benchmark index. This strategy generally requires less frequent turnover of holdings within the fund, so fund fees tend to be lower.



1/2 the tax cost of the average active mutual fund2:
When you sell your mutual fund or ETF at a gain, you will have to pay taxes on that gain. But capital gains taxes can be incurred even if you don’t sell your shares, due to trading activity within your fund. Active mutual funds that frequently buy and sell securities are often subject to higher capital gains distributions. Because most ETFs track an index, they tend to generate fewer undesirable capital gains distributions.



Only 18% of active managers beat their benchmarks after fees over the last five years3:
Because of the more frequent trading and complex strategies in actively-managed funds, fund expenses are higher – so performance has to be good enough to compensate for those higher fees.















Percent of comparable mutual funds that iShares Core ETFs outperformed







Morningstar, as of 12/31/2016. Post-tax comparison between the 1, 3 and 5 year returns at NAV of the iShares Core ETFs and the oldest share class of active open-end mutual funds within the same Morningstar categories as the iShares Core ETFs. Mutual funds are generally more tax inefficient than ETFs and, as a result, are typically more negatively impacted than ETFs when comparing performance based on post-tax returns rather than total returns.

Free commission offer applies to online purchases of Fidelity ETFs and select iShares ETFs in a Fidelity brokerage account. Fidelity accounts may require minimum balances. The sale of ETFs is subject to an activity assessment fee (from $0.01 to $0.03 per $1,000 of principal). iShares ETFs and Fidelity ETFs are subject to a short-term trading fee by Fidelity if held less than 30 days.



$4.95 commission applies to online U.S. equity trades in a Fidelity retail account only for Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC retail clients. Certain accounts may require a minimum opening balance of $2,500. Sell orders are subject to an activity assessment fee (from $0.01 to $0.03 per $1,000 of principal). Other conditions may apply. See Fidelity.com/commissions for details. Employee equity compensation transactions and accounts managed by advisors or intermediaries through Fidelity Clearing and Custody Solutions are subject to different commission schedules.


          1. Strategic Insight Simfund/FI Desktop, data as of 7/31/2013. Based on a comparison of total expense ratios for U.S. sector level ETFs with similar holdings and investment objectives (using the MSCI and S&P Global Industry Classification System — GICS) within the universe of 298 ETFs Morningstar has classified as the Sector Stock asset class.
	
    

          2. BlackRock Global ETP Landscape Report 12/31/2015. Based on AUM, net new flows, and number of ETFs.
	
    

          3. The BlackRock Diversified Income Portfolio is composed of exchange-traded products (ETPs)—primarily exchange-traded funds (ETFs)—but may contain other investment vehicles, such as mutual funds.
	
    

          ETFs are subject to market fluctuation and the risks of their underlying investments. ETFs are subject to management fees and other expenses. Unlike mutual funds, ETF shares are bought and sold at market price, which may be higher or lower than their NAV, and are not individually redeemed from the fund.
	
    

Exchange-traded products (ETPs) are subject to market volatility and the risks of their underlying securities, which may include the risks associated with investing in smaller companies, foreign securities, commodities, and fixed income investments. Foreign securities are subject to interest rate, currency exchange rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets. ETPs that target a small universe of securities, such as a specific region or market sector, are generally subject to greater market volatility, as well as to the specific risks associated with that sector, region, or other focus. ETPs that use derivatives, leverage, or complex investment strategies are subject to additional risks. The return of an index ETP is usually different from that of the index it tracks because of fees, expenses, and tracking error. An ETP may trade at a premium or discount to its net asset value (NAV) (or indicative value in the case of exchange-traded notes). The degree of liquidity can vary significantly from one ETP to another and losses may be magnified if no liquid market exists for the ETP's shares when attempting to sell them. Each ETP has a unique risk profile, detailed in its prospectus, offering circular, or similar material, which should be considered carefully when making investment decisions.


          Research is provided for informational purposes only, does not constitute advice or guidance, nor is it an endorsement or recommendation for any particular security or trading strategy. Research is provided by independent companies not affiliated with Fidelity. Please determine which security, product, or service is right for you based on your investment objectives, risk tolerance, and financial situation. Be sure to review your decisions periodically to make sure they are still consistent with your goals.
	
    

For iShares ETFs, Fidelity receives compensation from the ETF sponsor and/or its affiliates in connection with an exclusive long-term marketing program that includes promotion of iShares ETFs and inclusion of iShares funds in certain FBS platforms and investment programs. Additional information about the sources, amounts, and terms of compensation can be found in the ETF’s prospectus and related documents. Fidelity may add or waive commissions on ETFs without prior notice. BlackRock and iShares are registered trademarks of BlackRock Inc., and its affiliates.


Strategic Advisers, Inc., and BlackRock Investment Management, LLC, are independent entities and are not legally affiliated. Strategic Advisers, Inc., is the investment manager for client accounts and implements trades for the accounts based on the model portfolio of investments it receives from BlackRock Investment Management, LLC. Strategic Advisers may select investments for an account that differ from BlackRock Investment Management's model.


BlackRock® Diversified Income Portfolio is a service offered through Strategic Advisers, Inc., a registered investment adviser and a Fidelity Investments company. This service provides discretionary money management for a fee.


Brokerage services are provided by Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC. Custody and other services are provided by National Financial Services LLC. Both are Fidelity Investments companies and Members of NYSE and SIPC.


Before investing, consider the funds' investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses. Contact Fidelity for a prospectus or, if available, a summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.

Core position



Uninvested cash

Uninvested cash in your account is held in what is known as a core position. Think of your core position as a place where money is held before you invest it or distribute it from your account. For the Fidelity Account®, you may choose one of many core positions:

Fidelity Government Money Market Fund (SPAXX), a taxable mutual fund normally investing at least 80% of assets in U.S. Government securities and related debt, and related repurchase/reverse repurchase agreements. Intended for investors seeking as high a level of current income as is consistent with the preservation of capital and liquidity.*
Fidelity Treasury Money Market Fund (FLTXX), a taxable mutual fund normally investing at least 80% of assets in U.S. Treasury securities and related repurchase/reverse repurchase agreements. Intended for investors seeking as high a level of current income as is consistent with the preservation of capital and liquidity.*



							
								*
							
							
								
					
You could lose money by investing in a money market fund. Although the fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. An investment in the fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Fidelity Investments and its affiliates, the fund’s sponsor, have no legal obligation to provide financial support to money market funds and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the fund at any time.


Fidelity’s government and U.S. Treasury money market funds will not impose a fee upon the sale of your shares, nor temporarily suspend your ability to sell shares if the fund's weekly liquid assets fall below 30% of its total assets because of market conditions or other factors.

          The initial customer ratings and reviews for this product (those dated before 11/17/2014) were provided to Fidelity through an email solicitation for feedback on the product. All ratings and reviews are provided to Fidelity on a voluntary basis and are screened in accordance with the guidelines set forth in our Customer Ratings and Reviews Terms of Use. For additional information on which ratings and reviews may be posted, please refer to our Customer Ratings and Reviews Terms of Use. Featured reviews have been selected based on subjective criteria and have been reviewed by Fidelity Investments. The average rating is determined by calculating the mathematical average of all ratings that are approved for posting per the Customer Ratings and Reviews Terms of Use, and does not include any ratings that did not meet the guidelines and were therefore not posted). Ratings and reviews are added continuously to the Web site (after a delay for screening against guidelines), and average ratings are updated dynamically as reviews are added or removed.


          The ratings and experiences of customers may not be representative of the experiences of all customers or investors and are not indicative of future success. The accuracy of information included in the customer ratings and reviews cannot be guaranteed by Fidelity Investments. Customers who post ratings may be responsible for disclosing whether they have a financial interest or conflict in submitting a rating or review.
	
    

          Please contact a Fidelity representative if you have any questions or concerns about the ratings and reviews posted here.
	
    

          Reviews displayed were solicited for Active Trader Pro® version 10.2 and ActiveTraderPro.com® version 10 and above.
