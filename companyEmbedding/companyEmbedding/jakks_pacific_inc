Corporate Overview

Corporate Overview

JAKKS Pacific, Inc. is a multi-brand company that, since 1995, has been designing, developing, producing and marketing toys, leisure products and writing instruments for children and adults around the world.
The company has become a top five U.S. player in the toys and leisure products sector through product development, licensing agreements and strategic acquisitions. We believe our growth strategy is unique and built upon a concentrated effort to spread earnings across all four quarters. We have accomplished that by expanding and “counter-seasonalizing” our product lines, adding new retail outlets and leveraging our product development and merchandising expertise on products with staying power.
JAKKS Pacific® is a leading toy and consumer products company with a diverse product portfolio and customer base. We focus on traditional products and play patterns, and incorporate classic and popular brands, as well as simple innovation and technology, to make them appealing to today’s sophisticated kids and consumers of all ages. Speed to market is part of our corporate philosophy and, we believe, a major competitive advantage. We have also worked hard to cultivate excellent relationships with our valued licensors and retail partners. As we seek to grow JAKKS Pacific to a billion dollar company, we believe we can inspire children with our powerhouse portfolio, while maintaining profitability and a strong financial performance for our esteemed shareholders and hardworking employees along the way. In addition, we are strongly committed to being socially responsible corporate citizens, and believe we can create change that will improve the lives and well-being of children for generations to come. JAKKS Cares™ is our philanthropic division and we utilize the powerful resources and employees of JAKKS™ to assist needy children, families and pets around the world. JAKKS Cares also seeks ways to "Reduce, Reuse and Recycle" to help save our planet.

CPSC, Jakks Pacific Inc. Announce Recall to Replace Certain Cans of "Smatter" Spray Foam
































FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEJuly 18, 2002Release # 02-203
Jakks Pacific Recall Hotline: (800) 554-5516



 
WASHINGTON, D.C. - In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), Jakks Pacific Inc., of Malibu, California is voluntarily recalling approximately 296,000 cans of its aerosol "Smatter" spray foam. If the pressurized can is left in a hot automobile, it can forcefully break apart and cause injury to a nearby consumer. Jakks Pacific has received eight reports of the aerosol container breaking apart. One child reportedly suffered a minor bump on the head when a can of spray foam broke apart after being in a hot car. In two cases, car windshields were cracked.Only early production of spray foam with the date codes "0492PT" to "0952PT" stamped on the bottom of the can are involved in this recall. "Smatter" is an aerosol product that sprays a soft foam material from the can when the nozzle is pushed. The product is generally used at parties, celebrations, or games. The spray foam is sold in three different varieties: "Original Smatter," "Spit Smatter," and "Fatter Smatter." "SMATTER" appears in large print on the can and on the cardboard packaging. "NickelodeonTM" is written on the orange handle. "Made in China" is written the back of the product.Discount department and toy stores sold the recalled "Smatter" products nationwide from February 2002 through June 5, 2002 for about $10.Consumers should immediately take the recalled "Smatter" away from children and contact Jakks Pacific, Inc. at (800) 554-5516 between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. PT Monday through Friday, for information on receiving a free replacement "Smatter" product. Consumers also can visit the firm's web site at www.jakkspacific.com. Never leave any aerosol can in a hot car because it could break apart, possibly causing injury. 



The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission is charged with protecting the public from unreasonable risks of injury or death associated with the use of
          thousands of types of consumer products under the agency’s jurisdiction. Deaths, injuries, and property damage from consumer product incidents cost the
          nation more than $1 trillion annually. CPSC is committed to protecting consumers and families from products that pose a fire, electrical, chemical or
          mechanical hazard. CPSC's work to help ensure the safety of consumer products - such as toys, cribs, power tools, cigarette lighters and household
          chemicals -– contributed to a decline in the rate of deaths and injuries associated with consumer products over the past 40 years.
Federal law bars any person from selling products subject to a publicly-announced voluntary recall by a manufacturer or a mandatory recall ordered by the
          Commission.
To report a dangerous product or a product-related injury go online to www.SaferProducts.gov or call CPSC's Hotline at 800-638-2772 or teletypewriter at
          301-595-7054 for the hearing impaired. Consumers can obtain news release and recall information at www.cpsc.gov, on Twitter @USCPSC or by subscribing
          to CPSC's free e-mail newsletters.

Read MoreHide Full Article









On Jun 19, we issued an updated research report on the multi-brand toy and consumer products company, JAKKS Pacific, Inc. (JAKK  -  Free Report)	.Though the company has solid long-term growth potential but the risks from near-term headwinds might restrict its growth momentum.ProspectsFor 2017, JAKKS Pacific expects higher net income, earnings per share and adjusted EBITDA on lower net sales compared with 2016. Moreover, the company anticipates enhanced profitability in 2017, given continual focus on building its base of evergreen brands and categories as well as entering new categories, creating a strong portfolio of new and existing licenses, and developing owned IP and content.We are particularly positive on the company’s innovative partnerships and joint ventures that should help JAKKS Pacific gain market share in a competitive industry. Additionally, the company’ strategic acquisitions is likely to aid in entering new categories.JAKKS Pacific’s collaborations with Disney, Skechers, Nickelodeon, Cabbage Patch Kids to manufacture toys and merchandise related to these brands should drive growth. Furthermore, the company’s licensing agreements with popular movie and television franchises are expected to boost sales as merchandise based on movies enjoys immense popularity. Notably, since the beginning of the year, it has entered into multiple licensing agreements spanning across varied product lines, which are all set to hit stores in the near term and add to the top line.JAKKS Pacific also remains committed to diversifying its footprint outside the U.S. in various key markets and currently operates in 65 countries, worldwide. Notably, the expansion initiatives are likely to strengthen its international presence as well as customer base and thereby aid in growing sales, profit margins and the company’s access to attract licenses.Meanwhile, in order to cash in on the demand for smartphone gaming, the company has introduced a number of mobile gaming apps and digital games, along with the physical toys, which would help the company. Moreover, JAKKS Pacific’s investment in digital innovation will help in brand building apart from helping the company to capitalize on the increasingly lucrative technology-based gaming market. Additionally, the company has realized the importance of online retailing and has shifted a great amount of focus to aggressively growing online sales.ChallengesHowever, shares of JAKKS Pacific have declined 49.5% in the last one year against the Zacks categorized Toys/Games/Hobby Products industry’s gain of 35.6%.It is to be noted that a challenging retail environment for toys due to lower consumer confidence is a major concern for JAKKS Pacific as well as other leading toy makers like Hasbro, Inc. (HAS  -  Free Report)	 and Mattel, Inc. (MAT  -  Free Report)	. Currently, customers are reducing non-essential purchases, which in turn is hurting toy makers’ revenue. Continuous competition from technology-based gaming companies like Electronic Arts, Inc. (EA  -  Free Report)	 and Activision Blizzard, Inc. (ATVI  -  Free Report)	 has also been posing a significant threat to the market position of toy makers like JAKKS Pacific.Meanwhile, as the U.S. dollar continues to show strength against various other currencies, the negative currency impact is likely to hurt revenues, given the company’s considerable international presence. Moreover, the British Pound’s plunge in value since the Brexit vote is impacting JAKKS Pacific’s revenues. In fact, the company expects 2017 revenues to be lower than last year for foreign exchange movements can be cited to be the primary reason.Additionally, the company is experiencing increased costs related to international expansion, development of new IP and acquisitions. In fact, JAKKS Pacific noted that in the first quarter of 2017, these initiatives added greatly to expenses without the offsetting benefit of having any material impact on revenue growth. We believe that unless the trend reverses, the company’s margins will remain under pressure, despite several cost-containment efforts.JAKKS Pacific currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana. Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021. Early investors stand to make a killing, but you have to be ready to act and know just where to look. See the pot trades we're targeting>>

JAKKS Pacific Banks on Alliances, New Products, Risks StayHomeMailFlickrTumblrNewsSportsFinanceCelebrityAnswersGroupsMobileMoreTry Yahoo Finance on Firefox »YahooSearchSearchSign inU.S. Markets closedS&P 5002,472.54-0.91 (-0.04%)Dow 3021,580.07-31.71 (-0.15%)Nasdaq6,387.75-2.25 (-0.04%)LISTENAetna's CEO Mark Bertolini on the future of the health care systemBertolini shares how a life-threatening injury shaped his views on health care.JAKKS Pacific Banks on Alliances, New Products, Risks StayZacks Equity ResearchZacksJune 19, 2017ReblogShareTweetShareOn Jun 19, we issued an updated research report on the multi-brand toy and consumer products company, JAKKS Pacific, Inc. JAKK.Though the company has solid long-term growth potential but the risks from near-term headwinds might restrict its growth momentum.ProspectsFor 2017, JAKKS Pacific expects higher net income, earnings per share and adjusted EBITDA on lower net sales compared with 2016. Moreover, the company anticipates enhanced profitability in 2017, given continual focus on building its base of evergreen brands and categories as well as entering new categories, creating a strong portfolio of new and existing licenses, and developing owned IP and content.We are particularly positive on the company’s innovative partnerships and joint ventures that should help JAKKS Pacific gain market share in a competitive industry. Additionally, the company’ strategic acquisitions is likely to aid in entering new categories.JAKKS Pacific’s collaborations with Disney, Skechers, Nickelodeon, Cabbage Patch Kids to manufacture toys and merchandise related to these brands should drive growth. Furthermore, the company’s licensing agreements with popular movie and television franchises are expected to boost sales as merchandise based on movies enjoys immense popularity. Notably, since the beginning of the year, it has entered into multiple licensing agreements spanning across varied product lines, which are all set to hit stores in the near term and add to the top line.JAKKS Pacific also remains committed to diversifying its footprint outside the U.S. in various key markets and currently operates in 65 countries, worldwide. Notably, the expansion initiatives are likely to strengthen its international presence as well as customer base and thereby aid in growing sales, profit margins and the company’s access to attract licenses.Meanwhile, in order to cash in on the demand for smartphone gaming, the company has introduced a number of mobile gaming apps and digital games, along with the physical toys, which would help the company. Moreover, JAKKS Pacific’s investment in digital innovation will help in brand building apart from helping the company to capitalize on the increasingly lucrative technology-based gaming market. Additionally, the company has realized the importance of online retailing and has shifted a great amount of focus to aggressively growing online sales.ChallengesHowever, shares of JAKKS Pacific have declined 49.5% in the last one year against the Zacks categorized Toys/Games/Hobby Products industry’s gain of 35.6%.It is to be noted that a challenging retail environment for toys due to lower consumer confidence is a major concern for JAKKS Pacific as well as other leading toy makers like Hasbro, Inc. HAS and Mattel, Inc. MAT. Currently, customers are reducing non-essential purchases, which in turn is hurting toy makers’ revenue. Continuous competition from technology-based gaming companies like Electronic Arts, Inc. EA and Activision Blizzard, Inc. ATVI has also been posing a significant threat to the market position of toy makers like JAKKS Pacific.Meanwhile, as the U.S. dollar continues to show strength against various other currencies, the negative currency impact is likely to hurt revenues, given the company’s considerable international presence. Moreover, the British Pound’s plunge in value since the Brexit vote is impacting JAKKS Pacific’s revenues. In fact, the company expects 2017 revenues to be lower than last year for foreign exchange movements can be cited to be the primary reason.Additionally, the company is experiencing increased costs related to international expansion, development of new IP and acquisitions. In fact, JAKKS Pacific noted that in the first quarter of 2017, these initiatives added greatly to expenses without the offsetting benefit of having any material impact on revenue growth. We believe that unless the trend reverses, the company’s margins will remain under pressure, despite several cost-containment efforts.JAKKS Pacific currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

(CMG) Stock and Hold Your NoseInvestorPlaceDonald Trump Again Shows That He Knows Nothing About U.S. or World HistoryHilton: The United States has had 44 presidents prior to Trump. Some of them called to our better angels, some not so much. Some were brilliant, some were barely passable. But, none were as unqualified or as temperamentally unfit as Trump. A minority of Americans, thanks to an archaic election system, elevated a man who is not qualified to even be the mayor of a small town. Let alone be president. 

Here is what the hayseeds believe Donald Trump is going to do.:

1. Destroy the federal government as we know it.
2. Get rid of a bunch of minorities.
3. Get rid of Obamacare and watch the poor die. My previously unaffordable insurance is down to just $85/month.  My car insurance, from Insurance Panda, is now just $25/month. Under Trump, healthcare will be $500/month or more.
4. Make the lives of poor kids, the sick, and the elderly worse than they already are.
5. Drop a bunch of bombs on some colored people in some country somewhere.
6. Cut taxes on the rich.

It's not a partisan issue, as he's not really a Republican, it's the person. He's a narcissist who can't abide criticism and has no empathy for others, a petty and vindictive man. A person with no intellectual curiosity, who doesn't read and doesn't want to learn how to do his job. He also lacks a moral compass, he's neither decent nor honorable. He'll be a "blot" in US history.Join the Conversation1 / 5850

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
