Fun, Easy & Profitable with No Risk!



 
DISCOVER THE DIFFERENCE!












Hundreds of Scout Groups nationwide use our ‘Guaranteed to Succeed Fundraiser’ each year to finance the activities of their boy scout troop.







We showcase our products and highlight our programs, giving everyone a chance to see what makes us the top national Holiday Fundraiser. Here is some information about our Boy Scout Wreath Fundraising.

Boy Scout Fundraising


 Fundraising Profit Margin
Scout Units want to look at the amount of profits or funds they will raise per item. The item needs to give your scouts enough of a return to be worth selling. Decide how much you need to raise and then figure out how many of each item you will need to sell to make what you need. Earn high profits from $5-$10 per product when choosing Mickman Brothers for your Boy Scout wreath fundraising!

 Reforestation Efforts
When you choose Mickman for your Christmas Boy Scout Wreaths Fundraiser, not only are you choosing a fundraiser that will “maximize your earnings while minimizing your effort” – you are also supporting a program to assist in reforesting our country!

 Patented Packaging
It may seem like such a silly thing but packaging can sell a product again next year. You don’t want the packaging or how the items arrive to be hard for either your boy scouts or your customers. Our innovative carton makes sure wreaths are never crushed or damaged.

 Fundraising Sales Aids
Does the company whose product your scouts are selling offer any helpful items or sales aides? These can be a great way to sell the items because sales aides are usually professional and offer a great way to showcase the items you are selling. Professional photos work so well when it comes to selling! We offer free sales aides as well as online tools to assist the Scout fundraising chair person.

 Ease of Sale
Some things are just easier to sell than others. Make sure the item your Scout Group chooses will be easy to sell to people in your area. Make sure the items match the economical ability of the people in the area you are going to sell in. Everyone loves big, pricey items to use as fundraisers because they raise the most funds, but if people can’t afford them, they won’t buy them and you won’t raise the funds you need. The quality and affordability of products from Mickman Brothers will make it easy for boy scouts and cub scouts to sell!

 Preselling
You don’t want to get involved with a boy scout fundraiser that you need to invest in first. Make sure the fundraiser allows your boy scouts to pre-sell items. This allows you the ability to know exactly how many to order without putting money out on items you don’t need. You want the risk of fundraising to be minimal so pre-selling is key and a great reason to choose Mickman Brothers Wreath Fundraising for your scout fundraiser!




Thank you so much for your wreath fundraiser. You make raising money a joy. Your program is by far the most simplest and successful fundraiser that we have ever encountered. We look forward to working with you next year. Enclosed is payment for the products we ordered.
We hope that you have a Merry Christmas!

The Mickman Brothers wreath fundraiser was a huge 
		success and we raised over $1,000! That money allowed 
		the theatre booster club to award two $500 college 
		scholarships to two very deserving senior theatre 
		students.
We are so excited about all the blessings that our theatre group has had and so grateful for the opportunities that the Mickman Brothers fundraisers have brought us.
Thank you so much!Jennifer M., President

This is the simplest fundraiser to sell! Quality product and very satisfied customers bring people back year after year to order again and again. It is as simple as that. Most of our customers come to us to place their order early, that is how well liked the product is in this area. The profits help defray costs for the individuals on our competitive team for uniforms, gymnastic meet expenses, equipment and supplies.
Emerald City Gymnastics Team



SUMMER FUN in San Diego and CHRISTMAS WREATHS wouldn't normally be found in the same paragraph, but our experience fundraising with Mickman's Wreaths has made it happen.
This was our FIRST YEAR selling Christmas wreaths for our boy scout troop and we wanted to pick a reputable company that would maximize money coming in to our fundraiser. Mickman came in #1 as our choice.
Ok, there was one problem though . . . . . When other people saw how awesome the wreaths, living trees, and candle centerpieces were as we were delivering to those who ordered them, they wanted some too.   We had a few extras, but we could have sold more. We know we are going to have a bigger and better year coming up.
THANK YOU MICKMAN for a successful fundraiser!   Can't wait to do it all over again this year.
 Laurie L. AZ Grand Canyon Council Boy Scout Troop 88



It is September 1, 2013 and the high today in Phoenix is forecast to be 105 degrees, not exactly the type of weather that evokes Christmas. But members of Boy Scout Troop 379 – and our repeat customers – are already asking when we will begin taking orders for Christmas wreaths and decorations We aren’t just selling wreaths, we’re selling nostalgia and tradition.
Over the past several years, our Scouts have earned more than $15,000 to help defray the costs of summer camp in places like Seattle, Connecticut and California; high-adventure trips to hike the Grand Canyon and canoe the Colorado River; and cover the costs of Troop dues and other related expenses. This is one of the simplest and most successful fundraisers available.
Troop 379 and Arizona love Mickman Brothers!
Boy Scout Troop 379Arizona



If it was not for this fundraiser for our Pack we could not do most of the things we need to do.  Like training our Leaders for the Scouts.  We need to be Leader specific every year and Youth Protected every 2 Years.  This pays for out Leader to be trained every year.  If it was not for this fundraiser we would not be able to pay for this from the Pack the Adults would have to pay for it themselves.
It also pays for our camping and activities.  It also helps the Boy’s who cannot afford to join be able to.  Without this we would not be able to help the Boy’s join our Pack.  It also pays for the Scouts when they earn their yearly rank.
Our Pack is so THANKFUL for this.  Without it we would not be able to do what we do to help them become AWSOME citizens.
Thanks so much for all you do to support our Pack.
Jodi R.Committee Chair of Pack 3514 


Our Gymnastics team has been selling wreaths through the Mickmans Wreath
Fundraiser for over 11 years!
The Mickmans Fundraiser has been the biggest and most important fundraiser for the SFHS Gymnastics Team over the years and is of great importance to the team primarily because it helps to cover the cost of important assistant coaches fees which must be covered by the team and the team’s booster club.
Working with Mickmans could not be easier! The fundraiser packets and fundraiser tools and spreadsheets are easy to use and easily accessible by mail or on their website. We have a customer service represenative assigned to our group which ensures we receive special atttention and understanding of our order.

HAPPY CUSTOMERS






Raised over £4000 “Nigel offered me the opportunity for Spelthorne District Scouts to raise money through selling the Christmas CDs last Christmas. Nigel was extremely enthusiastic and supportive, attending our GSL meeting to launch the idea. With 5 different groups taking up the opportunity, he ensured everything was ready for each group and was happy to meet their different requests when it came to collecting the CDs. The 5 groups all expressed their thanks to Nigel and enabling them collectively to raise over £4000.”S. HolmesAdministrator, Spelthorne District Explorer Scouts
Best ever fundraiser for our Scout Group “The sale of CDs at Christmas time has been the best ever fundraiser for our Scout Group. This idea was wholly the idea of one man, who is Nigel King our Cub Pack leader. Nigel brought his idea to our committee and we were far from sure. However we were bowled over with Nigel’s positivity and energy and we followed his strategy. With a combination of his expertise and our members’ willingness to engage, we had our most successful fund raising period ever.”P. LoweGSL 1st Englefield Green Scout Group

1 MORNINGSTAR RATING:
The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products
(including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts,
exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a
three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are
considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based
on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a
managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward
variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in
each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next
35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive
1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a
weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and
10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100%
three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40%
three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year
rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of
total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the
most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually
has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.As of Jun. 30, 2017, the Scout International Fund received the following star ratings among U.S. domiciled Foreign Large Blend Funds for the following time periods: 4 stars (among 595 funds) for the 3 year, 3 stars  (among 533 funds) for the 5 year and 4 stars  (among 342 funds) for the 10 year periods.The Fund may have experienced negative performance during one or more of the time periods represented by the Morningstar Analyst rating shown.

Scout Investments Launches Unconstrained Bond Fund






Business Wire




Sep 29, 2011 12:00 PM EDT













 


















































  Scout Investments  ®  (Scout) has expanded its mutual fund lineup with the launch of its Scout Unconstrained Bond Fund (SUBFX), a product designed to pursue relative value opportunities across all facets of the fixed-income universe.  “The Unconstrained strategy allows us to pursue what we feel are the best investment opportunities in the marketplace over the long term without the constraints of a benchmark,” said Mark Egan, the fund’s lead portfolio manager and managing director at Reams Asset Management (Reams), a division of Scout Investments.  The fund’s absolute fixed-income return focus will provide investors with an alternative strategy for the bond portion of their portfolios, particularly during periods of market volatility and the potential for rising interest rates.  “We remain committed to providing industry-leading investment solutions. We are pleased to provide a product that leverages the strength of our fixed-income team and has the opportunity to enhance performance in varying market environments,” said Andy Iseman, chief executive officer of Scout Investments.  Reams, acquired by Scout in 2010, specializes in fixed-income securities. The Scout Unconstrained Bond Fund aims to capitalize on what we believe to be Reams’ “best ideas” through a disciplined investment process that emphasizes relative value. The fund’s management will seek opportunities in all sectors, including investment grade and high-yield credit, governments, agencies, mortgage-backed, asset-backed, and foreign markets.  “Our team is excited about making this strategy available to a broader audience beyond the institutional marketplace,” Egan said. The launch of the Scout Unconstrained Bond Fund follows the introduction of the Scout Global Equity, Scout Core Bond and Scout Core Plus Bond funds earlier this year.  About Scout Investments  Scout Investments, Inc., headquartered in Kansas City, Mo., has $19 billion under management and offers equity and fixed income investment management strategies for institutions and individual investors through separate accounts and the Scout Funds.

2017 Troop Fall Product Manager Financial
  Agreement and Program Requirements


 Time Commitment
Fall Program: August-December
 

Overview of Volunteer Opportunity
The Fall Product Program is an integral part of the Girl Scout
  Leadership Experience, where girls gain hands-on practice with the
  five skills linked to leadership and financial literacy: goal setting,
  decision making, money management, people skills and business ethics.
The volunteer in this position will lead and manage the troop
  through the Fall Product Program. This volunteer will need proficient
  financial literacy skills with a strong computer aptitude. He or she
  must be detail-oriented with the ability to motivate and inspire girls.

Program Participation Requirements:
 I am a registered and background checked Girl Scout
  volunteer. I will inspire girls to participate in the Fall
    Product Program by emphasizing the lifelong skills learned by
    participating in the program. I will model and teach the
    girls in my troop to live by the Girl Scout Law and Promise. 
To be a successful Troop Product Manager, I will attend Fall
    Product Program training and host a parent/guardian training.
I will adhere to all guidelines listed in the manual or
    communicated through email and adhere to all deadlines. All
    girls selling in the programs are registered Girl Scouts.
The parent or guardian of each girl selling has signed and
    submitted the Financial Agreement and Program Requirements
      Permission Form. Product and Girl Rewards will be
    accurately assigned to girls in NutE in a timely manner. I
    will keep accurate records and issue receipts for all product going
    out and all money coming in.  I am able to maintain
    accurate records and keep all transaction receipts organized for one
    year.  

Critical Success Factors:
 
Communication is key! Running a successful program depends on
    staying current and up-to-date. I will read all emails from the
    Council and Service Unit Product Teams and disseminate that
    information to parents.  
All volunteers with Fall Product Program financial
    responsibilities have signed this agreement.  Netwoking
    with sister troops is an excellent way to transfer product in or out
    of your troop.  Parents decide the amount of product they
    feel comfortable selling. Girls will not be arbitrarily assigned a
    number of product she must sell. 

Financial Agreement:
 My troop is active with a Council-approved bank account. 
All money earned is the property of GSACPC. Product
    cannot be returned to the Council. All proceeds earned by a
    troop member belong to the troop, not the individual girl.
I am financially responsible for collecting money from girls and
    depositing it into the troop account in a timely manner. I
    am financially responsible for ALL fees associated with collecting
    money owed to GSACPC; including but not limited to, attorney and
    collection fees, court cost and interest that result because of the
    misuse of Girl Scout funds. Misuse of Girl Scout funds will
    result in prosecution to the fullest extent of the law. I
    am responsible for submitting a Parent/Guardian Outstanding Account
    Report to the Product Program Team by the due date listed in the
    manual or on the website for all parents/guardians who have not paid
    for Fall Product by the end of the sale. 

Program Agreement
By submitting this form, I understand that I am responsible for
  managing the Fall Product Program for my troop and will adhere to all
  job responsibilities listed above.
I have verified that the troop is active, has a Council-approved
  bank account, and all girls selling are registered Girl Scouts.
I understand that misuse of Girl Scouts funds will result in legal
  action and I will be held financially accountable for all fees
  associated with the collection of monies owed.

Fun, Easy & Profitable with No Risk!



 
DISCOVER THE DIFFERENCE!












Hundreds of Scout Groups nationwide use our ‘Guaranteed to Succeed Fundraiser’ each year to finance the activities of their boy scout troop.







We showcase our products and highlight our programs, giving everyone a chance to see what makes us the top national Holiday Fundraiser. Here is some information about our Boy Scout Wreath Fundraising.

Boy Scout Fundraising


 Fundraising Profit Margin
Scout Units want to look at the amount of profits or funds they will raise per item. The item needs to give your scouts enough of a return to be worth selling. Decide how much you need to raise and then figure out how many of each item you will need to sell to make what you need. Earn high profits from $5-$10 per product when choosing Mickman Brothers for your Boy Scout wreath fundraising!

 Reforestation Efforts
When you choose Mickman for your Christmas Boy Scout Wreaths Fundraiser, not only are you choosing a fundraiser that will “maximize your earnings while minimizing your effort” – you are also supporting a program to assist in reforesting our country!

 Patented Packaging
It may seem like such a silly thing but packaging can sell a product again next year. You don’t want the packaging or how the items arrive to be hard for either your boy scouts or your customers. Our innovative carton makes sure wreaths are never crushed or damaged.

 Fundraising Sales Aids
Does the company whose product your scouts are selling offer any helpful items or sales aides? These can be a great way to sell the items because sales aides are usually professional and offer a great way to showcase the items you are selling. Professional photos work so well when it comes to selling! We offer free sales aides as well as online tools to assist the Scout fundraising chair person.

 Ease of Sale
Some things are just easier to sell than others. Make sure the item your Scout Group chooses will be easy to sell to people in your area. Make sure the items match the economical ability of the people in the area you are going to sell in. Everyone loves big, pricey items to use as fundraisers because they raise the most funds, but if people can’t afford them, they won’t buy them and you won’t raise the funds you need. The quality and affordability of products from Mickman Brothers will make it easy for boy scouts and cub scouts to sell!

 Preselling
You don’t want to get involved with a boy scout fundraiser that you need to invest in first. Make sure the fundraiser allows your boy scouts to pre-sell items. This allows you the ability to know exactly how many to order without putting money out on items you don’t need. You want the risk of fundraising to be minimal so pre-selling is key and a great reason to choose Mickman Brothers Wreath Fundraising for your scout fundraiser!




Thank you so much for your wreath fundraiser. You make raising money a joy. Your program is by far the most simplest and successful fundraiser that we have ever encountered. We look forward to working with you next year. Enclosed is payment for the products we ordered.
We hope that you have a Merry Christmas!

The Mickman Brothers wreath fundraiser was a huge 
		success and we raised over $1,000! That money allowed 
		the theatre booster club to award two $500 college 
		scholarships to two very deserving senior theatre 
		students.
We are so excited about all the blessings that our theatre group has had and so grateful for the opportunities that the Mickman Brothers fundraisers have brought us.
Thank you so much!Jennifer M., President

This is the simplest fundraiser to sell! Quality product and very satisfied customers bring people back year after year to order again and again. It is as simple as that. Most of our customers come to us to place their order early, that is how well liked the product is in this area. The profits help defray costs for the individuals on our competitive team for uniforms, gymnastic meet expenses, equipment and supplies.
Emerald City Gymnastics Team



SUMMER FUN in San Diego and CHRISTMAS WREATHS wouldn't normally be found in the same paragraph, but our experience fundraising with Mickman's Wreaths has made it happen.
This was our FIRST YEAR selling Christmas wreaths for our boy scout troop and we wanted to pick a reputable company that would maximize money coming in to our fundraiser. Mickman came in #1 as our choice.
Ok, there was one problem though . . . . . When other people saw how awesome the wreaths, living trees, and candle centerpieces were as we were delivering to those who ordered them, they wanted some too.   We had a few extras, but we could have sold more. We know we are going to have a bigger and better year coming up.
THANK YOU MICKMAN for a successful fundraiser!   Can't wait to do it all over again this year.
 Laurie L. AZ Grand Canyon Council Boy Scout Troop 88



It is September 1, 2013 and the high today in Phoenix is forecast to be 105 degrees, not exactly the type of weather that evokes Christmas. But members of Boy Scout Troop 379 – and our repeat customers – are already asking when we will begin taking orders for Christmas wreaths and decorations We aren’t just selling wreaths, we’re selling nostalgia and tradition.
Over the past several years, our Scouts have earned more than $15,000 to help defray the costs of summer camp in places like Seattle, Connecticut and California; high-adventure trips to hike the Grand Canyon and canoe the Colorado River; and cover the costs of Troop dues and other related expenses. This is one of the simplest and most successful fundraisers available.
Troop 379 and Arizona love Mickman Brothers!

If it was not for this fundraiser for our Pack we could not do most of the things we need to do.  Like training our Leaders for the Scouts.  We need to be Leader specific every year and Youth Protected every 2 Years.  This pays for out Leader to be trained every year.  If it was not for this fundraiser we would not be able to pay for this from the Pack the Adults would have to pay for it themselves.
It also pays for our camping and activities.  It also helps the Boy’s who cannot afford to join be able to.  Without this we would not be able to help the Boy’s join our Pack.  It also pays for the Scouts when they earn their yearly rank.
Our Pack is so THANKFUL for this.  Without it we would not be able to do what we do to help them become AWSOME citizens.
Thanks so much for all you do to support our Pack.
Jodi R.Committee Chair of Pack 3514 


Our Gymnastics team has been selling wreaths through the Mickmans Wreath
Fundraiser for over 11 years!
The Mickmans Fundraiser has been the biggest and most important fundraiser for the SFHS Gymnastics Team over the years and is of great importance to the team primarily because it helps to cover the cost of important assistant coaches fees which must be covered by the team and the team’s booster club.
Working with Mickmans could not be easier! The fundraiser packets and fundraiser tools and spreadsheets are easy to use and easily accessible by mail or on their website. We have a customer service represenative assigned to our group which ensures we receive special atttention and understanding of our order.
