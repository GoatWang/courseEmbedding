Winston Churchill Character Jug. (Bottom mark: 1941 Winston Churchill Modelled by Frank A. Potts, for J. & G. Meakin, England.).  This rare Character Jug was made in 1941 in all white as their was a ban on decorated ceramics during parts of World War II.  Collector’s covet these white jugs as they are significant in the history and context of England during the war.  The Sculptor, F. Potts, captured Sir Winston Churchill’s steely gaze perfectly.
As Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Winston Churchill rallied the British people during WWII, and led his country from the brink of defeat to victory. He will forever have a place in the hearts of the British public and now you can add the great leader to your collection.

  After a lifetime of medicine, a consultant surgeon and university dean has finally realised a personal passion with the publication of a new book.


  Rodney J Croft, 70, of Queen’s Road, Buckhurst Hill, has had a lifelong interest in Sir Winston Churchill and his state and private funerals, and has now collected his knowledge into “Churchill’s Final Farewell”.


  It is Mr Croft’s first history book, following a number of professional scientific articles and theses written over his career as a surgeon and advisor.


  Mr Croft moved to Buckhurst Hill after studying at Cambridge in 1980, and has lived there with his wife Hazel since then.


  He retired from the NHS at North Middlesex University Hospital in 2004, although he still works as a private consultant, and he is also a dean of the School of Medicine at St George’s University in Grenada, the third largest school of medicine in the world.


  Now in his semi-retirement, Mr Croft has taken the chance to write about his great and longstanding interest in Sir Winston Churchill.


  He said: “It is a long story which goes back about 65 years. It started when my mother, when I was four, I remember she said I was just like Winston Churchill because I was born six weeks premature.


  “Then, in the 1960s, I watched together with 350 million other people Churchill’s funeral on BBC television, which had a major impact.”


  Mr Croft also met the famous England cricketer Alec Bedser, who knew the 16th Duke of Norfolk, the organiser of Churchill’s state funeral.


  Bedser told Mr Croft stories of the organisation of the state procession, and Mr Croft was encouraged to write these in to the quarterly Churchill publication Finest Hour.


  Although he was not published in the journal, Mr Croft continued his research and eventually came to write the book before an exhibition commemorating the 50th anniversary of Churchill’s funeral, Death of a Hero.


  He said: “It went from notes and what was in my head, to manuscript in 15 days and 15 nights.


  “I was getting out of bed at four and going to bed at two. That is what I did at university and that is what I did then.


  “It is 34,000 words, not a huge tome but I was told that people like small, manageable books.”


  Churchill's Final Farewell: The State and Private Funeral of Sir Winston Churchill is available online.

Churchill (Winston) Hangsen e-Liquid
Hangsen e-liquid is used for e-cigarettes and is a premium liquid produced through a tobacco extraction technique as opposed to synthetically created nicotine which originates in a lab.
Hangsen e-liquid is rigorously tested for safety and quality. Because Hangsen e-liquid uses a tobacco extraction technique, Hangsen e-liquid is able to provide a consistent, high-quality and robustly flavored e-liquid that meets the demands of even the most discriminating vaping customers.
The Hangsen e-liquid we offer is available in multiple sizes and strengths.

















VALERIE MINNICK 25-08-2016 22:37
Golden Tobacco (RY6) Hangsen is my all time favorite, but because I love it so much, I never ventured out to try others. I decided to put my FAVORITE to the test and ordered 30ml each of Hangsen Deluxe, Churchill(Winston) and RY4(Vanilla/Caramel). 

Deluxe was a little too heavy for me but CHURCHILL (Winston) was a definite challenger to RY6. The flavor is just smooth and easy tobacco. I really like this one and even tried it with a little menthol and couldn't put it down. I tried it in my Aspire K4 and also a Joyetech Evod Mega and the taste was very consistent. I will definitely keep this on my list!





Steve Oldenburger 06-05-2016 15:12
received this on 5-2-16 it had a shelf date of 4-16. sent them a message 4 days ago no response with this having that date code makes the product at least a year old or longer. so i will not even bother opening it . sad I was hoping for a good vendor to do business with .









R.L. 18-02-2016 23:10
Oh, so very good!!!









R.L. 13-02-2016 16:01
Very smooth, with great flavor.









Chris 15-10-2015 20:07
Fastest mail order co anywhere. Best service and advice. Best selection, quality, and price. Customer since 2013!









Anonymous Valued Customer 22-09-2015 14:25
It's a repeater for me ... enjoy the tobacco flavor.









farhad sadeghi 03-09-2015 00:53
I think the best way to quite cigarettes is using electronic cigarette









Anonymous Valued Customer 23-07-2015 19:59
This is my favorite. I've been vaping for 3 years now and this is my favorite tobacco liquid. My go to all day vape!  Can't beat the price or the service.









elaine hubbell 22-07-2015 19:21
I will never buy from anyone else this is the best vape juice!









Anonymous Valued Customer 15-07-2015 19:22
This has a nice, light cigarette taste. Can't beat the price or service. Will definitely reorder.









LibraRob 14-06-2015 02:44
I never smoked Winston.  But I would put it in the same category as Marlboro & Camel but its not as rough or bitter as Marlboro or Camel.  I like the flavor and has good amount of vapor on the exhale.









Jeanine R 03-06-2015 15:57
This is one of my favorites and it never disappoints me.  Great flavor and throat hit with plenty of vapor.  Give it a try!









Dennis 05-05-2015 17:17
This stuff is real good. medium tobacco flavor and smokes real smooth. Easy on the throat and could be in your top three. Try it you won't be sorry.









elaine 25-02-2015 13:47
the best vape juice i have found









elaine 16-02-2015 21:32
very good taste









Richard C 12-02-2015 06:51
This ejuice is awesome!!!  Butythis and you wont regret your purchase









Chris 30-11-2014 19:47
Great vaping when you use Churchill.  No after taste like some other tobacco liquids.  With a clean clearomizer and good battery, it's the best.  I have bought a lot of things online and you can't beat these guys.  It's the best service!!








Christine Stoute 22-08-2014 20:51
At first I almost sent it back as I detected the odor  of corn chips which is gross to me.  I used it because I didn't have anything on hand.  I now catch a wiff occasionally, but it is a good product for volume etc.  Unless you are totally into the sweet stuff, this is the best consistent smoke you can have without a real cig.









Harry 09-07-2014 14:04
A nice clean unwaivering tobacco taste.  Not to strong not to weak.  Just the all day smoke that I have come to enjoy in the Winston/Churchill tobacco liquid.
I would like if the mix was available in other PG/VG options.
Would purchase again definitely.






Anonymous Valued Customer 30-05-2014 14:39
I did not like this liquid. it did not taste like outher winston liquid that i have used. to me it has a pipe-cigar like after taste. i only purchased 10Ml @24mg so will vape this as a last resort if i run out of my regular Highway (T5).for me this is the best.









Clint Gates 25-02-2014 02:39
I have looked everywhere for a Winston flavor and this one hits all the right notes nothing sweet and fruity about this one if you are looking for just a tobacco flavor this one is for you!









Sam Tummo 21-02-2014 12:39
I tried the USA blend, a little to sweet.  Then ordered Churchill, perfect.  Would like to see a sampler pack to make the choice easier and more efficient.  Great customer service.  KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK! 
Thanks, Sam









Anonymous Valued Customer 22-01-2014 23:24
Caterpillar Vapor is the best site for e-cigs and e-juice.








J Howard 30-08-2013 23:20
I found a little aftertaste using this flavor. It does resemble the real Winston cigs but is not quite as good as the Turkish or USA liquids in my opinion. Shipping, prices and service are superb at this store.








Anonymous Valued Customer 23-07-2013 14:33
,I am having trouble getting used to the vapor thing! I really don't like the sound of the vapor pipe. I have not been able to use the vapor as much as I intended to when I bought it. I think it's a good idea but always find an excuse to smoke a regular cigarette. But, I am going to continue to try to use it.









Brian 29-06-2013 16:22
I didn't smoke Winston, but this is my favorite of the tobacco flavor juices. If you're looking for a tobacco flavor to help get off regular cigarettes I'd recommend giving Churchill a try.









Anonymous Valued Customer 21-06-2013 18:23
a lil strong!!!









Monte 24-05-2013 20:15
Tastes like a winston.Ive been vaping for about a year now.And ive tryed many of co's but this tastes closest to the real thing.Keep up the good work.








Anonymous Valued Customer 20-05-2013 20:19
would rate inbetween the us mix and camel.Would like to see in a light and larger sized bottles.









Ariel A. 12-02-2013 02:23
I'm new to eGo and you product was recommended by a friend. I was looking for something similar to my brand of cigarette and I have to say that this product has impress me. And you can't ask for better pricing. Thanks for the good work.









J. Robson 11-01-2013 10:43
I've tried many liquids and this is without a doubt the best. Also about half the price of anyone I've purchased from. Thx a lot.

                                Report abuseTranscript of Winston Churchill PresentationWinston Churchill Churchill grew up in an upper class family in Great Britain.  His father was a politician and his mother was an American Indian.  He was neglected as a child, but still respected his father.   He always had a keen interest in the military.  He attended military school and then became interested in politics.  As he delved into politics, he became well-known for his military knowledge.  He played a large part in WWI and became a source of military wisdom.  As the 1930's continued, he warned the British government about Hitler's rise to power.  No one listened until it was too late.  As the 1930's came to a close, people realized that Churchill was needed as the national leader.  He became a voice of hope and strength for the nation and propelled them through WWII. Churchill was also a relational leader.  This was clearly shown in his speeches, he possessed a certain self-confidence that allowed him to understand how to speak to the public.  His speeches pleaded to their inner morals concerning the war in Europe.  He was able to maintain an empowering view of the war, despite the tragedy that was going on all around him.  He used the issue of justice to show many people how terrible the actions of the enemy were. Churchill's desire to become a politician was instilled in him at a very young age because of his father.  However, this passion was not realized until later, when Churchill began to get into the ranks of the military, which affected his leadership style greatly.  It seems that Winston was both selected and selected himself through this process of leadership In the Wren book, the question is begged, how do leaders lead? Churchill was a man of charisma but also of stability.  His background in military affairs enabled him to lead with a seriousness and gained him the respect of many individuals.  He was a very frank man, which allowed him to get points across to people in a rather simple but direct way.  For Churchill, the process of becoming a leader was both transformational and transactional. Background How are leaders recruited and selected? RelationalLeadership conclusion Churchill was an average young man who put a great nation on his shoulders in order to bring justice to the world.  He was certainly a man to look to and no doubt, an active leader of men. How do leaders lead?Full transcriptMore presentations by

Natasha, Oklahoma

"My daughter recently went out for soccer. I decided it would be a good idea to run another player’s father through BeenVerified. Turns out this guy had been charged with indecent exposure and was on parole."


Maryann, New Jersey
Analyst
"I used BeenVerified to check into a guy that I had met online. It turns out he had lied to me about where he lived and his family. Needless to say, thanks to BV I severed contact with him and have not heard from him since. Thank you BV!"


Bob M, New Jersey
Retired Detective
"I am retired and have a ministry helping the dying and sick. I found a son and the mother was dying of cancer. She held on waiting for her son who had not been in touch for years."

About Sir Winston Churchill, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom


Sir Winston Leonard Spencer-Churchill, KG, OM, CH, TD, DL, FRS, Hon. RA (30 November 1874 – 24 January 1965) was a British politician who was Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1940 to 1945 (that is, for most of the Second World War) and again from 1951 to 1955. Widely regarded as one of the greatest wartime leaders of the 20th century, Churchill was also an officer in the British Army, a historian, a writer, and an artist. He is the only British Prime Minister to have received the Nobel Prize in Literature, and was also the first person to be made an honorary citizen of the United States.

Project note: Sir Churchill was a Freemason and a member of Studholme Alliance Lodge No. 1591 and Rosemary Lodge No. 2851. Sir Winston Leonard Spencer-Churchill KG OM CH TD PC DL FRS RA (30 November 1874 – 24 January 1965) was a British statesman who was the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1940 to 1945 and again from 1951 to 1955. Churchill was also an officer in the British Army, a non-academic historian, and a writer (as Winston S. Churchill). He won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1953 for his overall, lifetime body of work. In 1963, he was the first of only eight people to be made an honorary citizen of the United States.
Churchill was born into the family of the Dukes of Marlborough, a branch of the Spencer family. His father, Lord Randolph Churchill, was a charismatic politician who served as Chancellor of the Exchequer; his mother, Jennie Jerome, was an American socialite. As a young army officer, he saw action in British India, the Anglo–Sudan War, and the Second Boer War. He gained fame as a war correspondent and wrote books about his campaigns.
At the forefront of politics for fifty years, he held many political and cabinet positions. Before the First World War, he served as President of the Board of Trade, Home Secretary, and First Lord of the Admiralty as part of Asquith's Liberal government. During the war, he continued as First Lord of the Admiralty until the disastrous Gallipoli Campaign caused his departure from government. He then briefly resumed active army service on the Western Front as commander of the 6th Battalion of the Royal Scots Fusiliers. He returned to government under Lloyd George as Minister of Munitions, Secretary of State for War, Secretary of State for Air, then Secretary of State for the Colonies. After two years out of Parliament, he served as Chancellor of the Exchequer in Baldwin's Conservative government of 1924–1929, controversially returning the pound sterling in 1925 to the gold standard at its pre-war parity, a move widely seen as creating deflationary pressure on the UK economy.
Out of office and politically "in the wilderness" during the 1930s because of his opposition to increased home rule for India and his resistance to the 1936 abdication of Edward VIII, Churchill took the lead in warning about Nazi Germany and in campaigning for rearmament. At the outbreak of the Second World War, he was again appointed First Lord of the Admiralty. Following the resignation of Neville Chamberlain on 10 May 1940, Churchill became Prime Minister. His speeches and radio broadcasts helped inspire British resistance, especially during the difficult days of 1940–41 when the British Commonwealth and Empire stood almost alone in its active opposition to Adolf Hitler. He led Britain as Prime Minister until victory over Nazi Germany had been secured.
After the Conservative Party suffered an unexpected defeat in the 1945 general election, he became Leader of the Opposition to the Labour Government. He publicly warned of an "Iron Curtain" of Soviet influence in Europe and promoted European unity. After winning the 1951 election, Churchill again became Prime Minister. His second term was preoccupied by foreign affairs, including the Malayan Emergency, Mau Mau Uprising, Korean War, and a UK-backed coup d'état in Iran. Domestically his government laid great emphasis on house-building. Churchill suffered a serious stroke in 1953 and retired as Prime Minister in 1955, although he remained a Member of Parliament until 1964. Upon his death aged ninety in 1965, Elizabeth II granted him the honour of a state funeral, which saw one of the largest assemblies of world statesmen in history.
Named the Greatest Briton of all time in a 2002 poll, Churchill is widely regarded as being among the most influential people in British history, consistently ranking well in opinion polls of Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom. His highly complex legacy continues to stimulate intense debate amongst writers and historians.
Family and early life Born into the aristocratic family of the Dukes of Marlborough, a branch of the noble Spencer family, Winston Leonard Spencer-Churchill, like his father, used the surname "Churchill" in public life.
His ancestor George Spencer had changed his surname to Spencer-Churchill in 1817 when he became Duke of Marlborough, to highlight his descent from John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough. Churchill's father, Lord Randolph Churchill, the third son of John Spencer-Churchill, 7th Duke of Marlborough, was a politician; and his mother, Lady Randolph Churchill (née Jennie Jerome) was the daughter of American millionaire Leonard Jerome. Churchill was born on 30 November 1874, two months prematurely, in a bedroom in Blenheim Palace, Woodstock, Oxfordshire.
From age two to six, he lived in Dublin, where his grandfather had been appointed Viceroy and employed Churchill's father as his private secretary. Churchill's brother, John Strange Spencer-Churchill, was born during this time in Ireland. It has been claimed that the young Churchill first developed his fascination with military matters from watching the many parades pass by the Vice Regal Lodge (now Áras an Uachtaráin, the official residence of the President of Ireland).
Churchill's earliest exposure to education occurred in Dublin, where a governess tried teaching him reading, writing, and arithmetic (his first reading book was called 'Reading Without Tears'). With limited contact with his parents, Churchill became very close to his nanny, 'Mrs' Elizabeth Ann Everest, whom he called 'Old Woom' (some references 'Woomany'). She served as his confidante, nurse, and mother substitute. The two spent many happy hours playing in Phoenix Park.
Independent and rebellious by nature, Churchill generally had a poor academic record in school. He was educated at three independent schools: St. George's School, Ascot, Berkshire; Brunswick School in Hove, near Brighton (the school has since been renamed Stoke Brunswick School and relocated to Ashurst Wood in West Sussex); and at Harrow School from 17 April 1888. Within weeks of his arrival at Harrow, Churchill had joined the Harrow Rifle Corps.
Blenheim Palace, the Churchill family home When young Winston started attending Harrow School, he was listed under the S's as Spencer Churchill. At that time Winston was a stocky boy with red hair who talked with a stutter and a lisp. Winston did so well in mathematics in his Harrow entrance exam that he was put in the top division for that subject. In his first year at Harrow he was recognised as being the best in his division for history. Winston entered the school, however, as the boy with the lowest grades in the lowest class, and he remained in that position. Winston never made it into the upper school because he would not study the classics. Although he did poorly in his schoolwork, he grew to love the English language. He hated Harrow. His mother rarely visited him, and he wrote letters begging her either to come to the school or to allow him to come home. His relationship with his father was distant; he once remarked that they barely spoke to one another. His father died on 24 January 1895, aged 45, leaving Churchill with the conviction that he too would die young and so should be quick about making his mark on the world.
At age 18, while visiting his aunt, Lady Wimborne, in Bournemouth, Winston fell 29 feet from a bridge, leaving him unconscious for three days and bedridden for three months.
Winston Churchill was a Freemason and a member of the Loyal Waterloo Lodge of the National Independent Order of Odd Fellows.
Speech impediment Churchill had a lateral lisp that continued throughout his career, reported consistently by journalists of the time and later. Authors writing in the 1920s and 1930s, before sound recording became common, also mentioned Churchill having a stutter, describing it in terms such as "severe" or "agonising". The Churchill Centre and Museum says the majority of records show his impediment was a lateral lisp, while Churchill's stutter is a myth.
His dentures were specially designed to aid his speech. After many years of public speeches carefully prepared not only to inspire, but also to avoid hesitations, he could finally state, "My impediment is no hindrance".
Marriage and children
A young Winston Churchill and fiancée Clementine Hozier shortly before their marriage in 1908 Churchill met his future wife, Clementine Hozier, in 1904 at a ball in Crewe House, home of the Earl of Crewe and Crewe's wife Margaret Primrose (daughter of Archibald Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery, and Hannah Rothschild).[25] In 1908, they met again at a dinner party hosted by Lady St Helier. Churchill found himself seated beside Clementine, and they soon began a lifelong romance. He proposed to Clementine during a house party at Blenheim Palace on 10 August 1908, in a small Temple of Diana.
On 12 September 1908, he and Clementine were married in St. Margaret's, Westminster. The church was packed; the Bishop of St Asaph conducted the service. The couple spent their honeymoon at Highgrove House in Eastcote.In March 1909, the couple moved to a house at 33 Eccleston Square.
Their first child, Diana, was born in London on 11 July 1909. After the pregnancy, Clementine moved to Sussex to recover, while Diana stayed in London with her nanny. On 28 May 1911, their second child, Randolph, was born at 33 Eccleston Square. Their third child, Sarah, was born on 7 October 1914 at Admiralty House. The birth was marked with anxiety for Clementine, as Churchill had been sent to Antwerp by the Cabinet to "stiffen the resistance of the beleaguered city" after news that the Belgians intended to surrender the town.
Clementine gave birth to her fourth child, Marigold Frances Churchill, on 15 November 1918, four days after the official end of the First World War. In the early days of August 1921, the Churchills' children were entrusted to a French nursery governess in Kent, Mlle. Rose. Clementine traveled to Eaton Hall to play tennis with Hugh Grosvenor, 2nd Duke of Westminster, and his family. While still under the care of Mlle. Rose, Marigold had a cold, but was reported to have recovered from the illness. As the illness progressed with hardly any notice, it turned into septicaemia. Rose sent for Clementine, but the illness proved fatal on 23 August 1921, and Marigold was buried in the Kensal Green Cemetery three days later.
On 15 September 1922, the Churchills' last child, Mary, was born. Later that month, the Churchills bought Chartwell, which would be their home until Winston's death in 1965.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.
