If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator

deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

Technology[edit]
Coupa’s Cloud Spend Optimization SaaS product manages indirect purchases, invoices and expenses in real-time.[6][7] Built on Coupa’s cloud architecture, it provides executive dashboards,[8] alerts,[7] expense management[9] and real-time benchmarking[10] into a single user interface.[8][9] This spend optimization software suite focuses on three core spend areas including procurement, accounts payable, and expense management.
Coupa is cloud-based and built on Amazon Web Services infrastructure.[11][12] In 2007, the company launched a SaaS (Software-as-a-service) product called Coupa On Demand for SMBs (small and midsize businesses). This platform uses Amazon’s Elastic Compute Cloud Web services (EC2).[13]
Coupa’s software is based on the Ruby on Rails (RoR) platform.[14][12] With RoR, Coupa developed software that helps companies to better monitor costs[15] with less implementation time[16][17] and employee training[18] In 2006, its first free open-source product, Coupa Express, was built using RoR.[19] Coupa's application can be accessed by any user via their mobile device browser.
In November 2011, Coupa released its first spend analysis product called Coupa Spend Optimizer.[20][21] According to Coupa, this product provides spending insight to employees in both the procurement and finance sectors, with its easy-to-use interface.[22] Also, users have access to data from other platforms, like ERP or HR systems, so they have a broader understanding of spend across their companies.[23]
In August 2012, Coupa added an application called Coupa Contracts to its software suite. Companies can use the contracts repository to access their approved contracts and to leverage their negotiated pricing at the time of purchasing.
In May 2013, Coupa introduced applications Coupa Sourcing and Coupa Catalogs. The former makes it easier for companies to run sourcing events with suppliers to save money. With Coupa Catalogs, companies are able to use Coupa’s software platform as a shopping and catalog management front end to their ERP-based procurement system.
In April 2014, Coupa introduced Coupa Inventory which provides all employees in an organization real-time visibility into inventory availability while they are ordering, thus reducing wasteful spending.[24]
In October 2014, Coupa announced an update to its applications, which includes new features to optimize spend and supply chain management in the enterprise.[25]
Misappropriation of trade secrets[edit]
In May 2014, Ariba, a unit of SAP and a competitor of Coupa, filed a lawsuit alleging that Coupa misappropriated Ariba trade secrets. On September 24, 2015, the parties settled the lawsuit. Coupa acknowledged its possession of Ariba information and is required to abide by certain procedures to prevent any misappropriation in the future. Coupa paid Ariba an undisclosed amount.[26][27]
Customers and Partners[edit]
As of November 2014, Coupa indicated it had 450+ customers worldwide in 40 countries and in 150 currencies, including Concentrix, Coca-Cola Consolidated, Adidas, Subway, Amazon, Armstrong, Sears, Graham Packaging, BNP Paribas, TD Bank[28][29] Salesforce.com,[11] and Rent-A-Center.[2] In 2011, Coupa started working with the Independent Purchasing Cooperative (IPC) of Subway, to help its franchises in 98 countries with its cost management.[29] Salesforce.com has its sales managers use Coupa to monitor travel expenses and sales outcomes.[30] Rent-a-Center chose Coupa because the e-procurement product has an Amazon-like interface, which is easy for employees to use.[30]
In October 2014, Coupa and NetSuite (NYSE: N) announced a strategic partnership to jointly market the Coupa Cloud Procurement and Expense Management SuiteApp built for NetSuite.[31]
History[edit]
Dave Stephens and Noah Eisner[3] founded Coupa in 2006.[3] Stephens and Eisner previously worked at Oracle (enterprise procurement applications).[3] Rob Bernshteyn took over as Coupa's CEO in February 2009, after serving as Vice President of Global Product Marketing and Management at SuccessFactors, Inc.[4] Since then, the company has reported 26 consecutive quarters of subscription revenue growth.[32]
In 2011, Coupa was named a Cool Vendor in Procurement and Sourcing by Gartner, which cited Coupa’s solution usability.[33] In 2014, The Forrester Wave named Coupa a market leader.[34] Coupa was also positioned in the Leaders quadrant of the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Procure-to-Pay Suites for Indirect Procurement in March 2015.[35]
Former Yahoo CEO and PayPal president Scott Thompson joined the company’s board of directors in April 2013.[36] The company expanded globally in 2014, announcing new operations in Dublin, Ireland.[37] Coupa's other international operations include its offices in Australia and several EMEA and Asia Pacific locations.[38] Coupa expanded its leadership and governance in 2014 with the hiring of Tara Ryan as the company's CMO[39] and the appointment of Roger Siboni as a new member of the company's Board of Directors.[40]
In 2015, Coupa appointed Todd Ford as CFO.[41] In February 2015, Coupa acquired the assets of ZenPurchase, an enterprise procurement software company.[42] In July 2015, Coupa acquired InvoiceSmash, an e-invoicing vendor,[43] and TripScanner, an open booking vendor.[44] In January 2016, Coupa acquired Contractually, a cloud-based contract management solution.[45]
In October 2016, Coupa Software went public on the Nasdaq, trading as COUP. It raised over $133 million on its first day of trading. [46] Previously, Coupa had raised a total of $169 million in funding. [47]

Coupa acknowledged its possession of Ariba information and is required to abide by certain procedures to prevent any misappropriation in the future. Coupa paid Ariba an undisclosed amount.[26][27]

Technology[edit]
Coupa’s Cloud Spend Optimization SaaS product manages indirect purchases, invoices and expenses in real-time.[6][7] Built on Coupa’s cloud architecture, it provides executive dashboards,[8] alerts,[7] expense management[9] and real-time benchmarking[10] into a single user interface.[8][9] This spend optimization software suite focuses on three core spend areas including procurement, accounts payable, and expense management.
Coupa is cloud-based and built on Amazon Web Services infrastructure.[11][12] In 2007, the company launched a SaaS (Software-as-a-service) product called Coupa On Demand for SMBs (small and midsize businesses). This platform uses Amazon’s Elastic Compute Cloud Web services (EC2).[13]
Coupa’s software is based on the Ruby on Rails (RoR) platform.[14][12] With RoR, Coupa developed software that helps companies to better monitor costs[15] with less implementation time[16][17] and employee training[18] In 2006, its first free open-source product, Coupa Express, was built using RoR.[19] Coupa's application can be accessed by any user via their mobile device browser.
In November 2011, Coupa released its first spend analysis product called Coupa Spend Optimizer.[20][21] According to Coupa, this product provides spending insight to employees in both the procurement and finance sectors, with its easy-to-use interface.[22] Also, users have access to data from other platforms, like ERP or HR systems, so they have a broader understanding of spend across their companies.[23]
In August 2012, Coupa added an application called Coupa Contracts to its software suite. Companies can use the contracts repository to access their approved contracts and to leverage their negotiated pricing at the time of purchasing.
In May 2013, Coupa introduced applications Coupa Sourcing and Coupa Catalogs. The former makes it easier for companies to run sourcing events with suppliers to save money. With Coupa Catalogs, companies are able to use Coupa’s software platform as a shopping and catalog management front end to their ERP-based procurement system.
In April 2014, Coupa introduced Coupa Inventory which provides all employees in an organization real-time visibility into inventory availability while they are ordering, thus reducing wasteful spending.[24]
In October 2014, Coupa announced an update to its applications, which includes new features to optimize spend and supply chain management in the enterprise.[25]
Misappropriation of trade secrets[edit]
In May 2014, Ariba, a unit of SAP and a competitor of Coupa, filed a lawsuit alleging that Coupa misappropriated Ariba trade secrets. On September 24, 2015, the parties settled the lawsuit. Coupa acknowledged its possession of Ariba information and is required to abide by certain procedures to prevent any misappropriation in the future. Coupa paid Ariba an undisclosed amount.[26][27]
Customers and Partners[edit]
As of November 2014, Coupa indicated it had 450+ customers worldwide in 40 countries and in 150 currencies, including Concentrix, Coca-Cola Consolidated, Adidas, Subway, Amazon, Armstrong, Sears, Graham Packaging, BNP Paribas, TD Bank[28][29] Salesforce.com,[11] and Rent-A-Center.[2] In 2011, Coupa started working with the Independent Purchasing Cooperative (IPC) of Subway, to help its franchises in 98 countries with its cost management.[29] Salesforce.com has its sales managers use Coupa to monitor travel expenses and sales outcomes.[30] Rent-a-Center chose Coupa because the e-procurement product has an Amazon-like interface, which is easy for employees to use.[30]

Technology[edit]
Coupa’s Cloud Spend Optimization SaaS product manages indirect purchases, invoices and expenses in real-time.[6][7] Built on Coupa’s cloud architecture, it provides executive dashboards,[8] alerts,[7] expense management[9] and real-time benchmarking[10] into a single user interface.[8][9] This spend optimization software suite focuses on three core spend areas including procurement, accounts payable, and expense management.
Coupa is cloud-based and built on Amazon Web Services infrastructure.[11][12] In 2007, the company launched a SaaS (Software-as-a-service) product called Coupa On Demand for SMBs (small and midsize businesses). This platform uses Amazon’s Elastic Compute Cloud Web services (EC2).[13]
Coupa’s software is based on the Ruby on Rails (RoR) platform.[14][12] With RoR, Coupa developed software that helps companies to better monitor costs[15] with less implementation time[16][17] and employee training[18] In 2006, its first free open-source product, Coupa Express, was built using RoR.[19] Coupa's application can be accessed by any user via their mobile device browser.
In November 2011, Coupa released its first spend analysis product called Coupa Spend Optimizer.[20][21] According to Coupa, this product provides spending insight to employees in both the procurement and finance sectors, with its easy-to-use interface.[22] Also, users have access to data from other platforms, like ERP or HR systems, so they have a broader understanding of spend across their companies.[23]
In August 2012, Coupa added an application called Coupa Contracts to its software suite. Companies can use the contracts repository to access their approved contracts and to leverage their negotiated pricing at the time of purchasing.
In May 2013, Coupa introduced applications Coupa Sourcing and Coupa Catalogs. The former makes it easier for companies to run sourcing events with suppliers to save money. With Coupa Catalogs, companies are able to use Coupa’s software platform as a shopping and catalog management front end to their ERP-based procurement system.
In April 2014, Coupa introduced Coupa Inventory which provides all employees in an organization real-time visibility into inventory availability while they are ordering, thus reducing wasteful spending.[24]
In October 2014, Coupa announced an update to its applications, which includes new features to optimize spend and supply chain management in the enterprise.[25]
Misappropriation of trade secrets[edit]
In May 2014, Ariba, a unit of SAP and a competitor of Coupa, filed a lawsuit alleging that Coupa misappropriated Ariba trade secrets. On September 24, 2015, the parties settled the lawsuit. Coupa acknowledged its possession of Ariba information and is required to abide by certain procedures to prevent any misappropriation in the future. Coupa paid Ariba an undisclosed amount.[26][27]
Customers and Partners[edit]
As of November 2014, Coupa indicated it had 450+ customers worldwide in 40 countries and in 150 currencies, including Concentrix, Coca-Cola Consolidated, Adidas, Subway, Amazon, Armstrong, Sears, Graham Packaging, BNP Paribas, TD Bank[28][29] Salesforce.com,[11] and Rent-A-Center.[2] In 2011, Coupa started working with the Independent Purchasing Cooperative (IPC) of Subway, to help its franchises in 98 countries with its cost management.[29] Salesforce.com has its sales managers use Coupa to monitor travel expenses and sales outcomes.[30] Rent-a-Center chose Coupa because the e-procurement product has an Amazon-like interface, which is easy for employees to use.[30]
In October 2014, Coupa and NetSuite (NYSE: N) announced a strategic partnership to jointly market the Coupa Cloud Procurement and Expense Management SuiteApp built for NetSuite.[31]
History[edit]
Dave Stephens and Noah Eisner[3] founded Coupa in 2006.[3] Stephens and Eisner previously worked at Oracle (enterprise procurement applications).[3] Rob Bernshteyn took over as Coupa's CEO in February 2009, after serving as Vice President of Global Product Marketing and Management at SuccessFactors, Inc.[4] Since then, the company has reported 26 consecutive quarters of subscription revenue growth.[32]
In 2011, Coupa was named a Cool Vendor in Procurement and Sourcing by Gartner, which cited Coupa’s solution usability.[33] In 2014, The Forrester Wave named Coupa a market leader.[34] Coupa was also positioned in the Leaders quadrant of the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Procure-to-Pay Suites for Indirect Procurement in March 2015.[35]
Former Yahoo CEO and PayPal president Scott Thompson joined the company’s board of directors in April 2013.[36] The company expanded globally in 2014, announcing new operations in Dublin, Ireland.[37] Coupa's other international operations include its offices in Australia and several EMEA and Asia Pacific locations.[38] Coupa expanded its leadership and governance in 2014 with the hiring of Tara Ryan as the company's CMO[39] and the appointment of Roger Siboni as a new member of the company's Board of Directors.[40]
In 2015, Coupa appointed Todd Ford as CFO.[41] In February 2015, Coupa acquired the assets of ZenPurchase, an enterprise procurement software company.[42] In July 2015, Coupa acquired InvoiceSmash, an e-invoicing vendor,[43] and TripScanner, an open booking vendor.[44] In January 2016, Coupa acquired Contractually, a cloud-based contract management solution.[45]
In October 2016, Coupa Software went public on the Nasdaq, trading as COUP. It raised over $133 million on its first day of trading. [46] Previously, Coupa had raised a total of $169 million in funding. [47]

Technology[edit]
Coupa’s Cloud Spend Optimization SaaS product manages indirect purchases, invoices and expenses in real-time.[6][7] Built on Coupa’s cloud architecture, it provides executive dashboards,[8] alerts,[7] expense management[9] and real-time benchmarking[10] into a single user interface.[8][9] This spend optimization software suite focuses on three core spend areas including procurement, accounts payable, and expense management.
Coupa is cloud-based and built on Amazon Web Services infrastructure.[11][12] In 2007, the company launched a SaaS (Software-as-a-service) product called Coupa On Demand for SMBs (small and midsize businesses). This platform uses Amazon’s Elastic Compute Cloud Web services (EC2).[13]
Coupa’s software is based on the Ruby on Rails (RoR) platform.[14][12] With RoR, Coupa developed software that helps companies to better monitor costs[15] with less implementation time[16][17] and employee training[18] In 2006, its first free open-source product, Coupa Express, was built using RoR.[19] Coupa's application can be accessed by any user via their mobile device browser.
In November 2011, Coupa released its first spend analysis product called Coupa Spend Optimizer.[20][21] According to Coupa, this product provides spending insight to employees in both the procurement and finance sectors, with its easy-to-use interface.[22] Also, users have access to data from other platforms, like ERP or HR systems, so they have a broader understanding of spend across their companies.[23]
In August 2012, Coupa added an application called Coupa Contracts to its software suite. Companies can use the contracts repository to access their approved contracts and to leverage their negotiated pricing at the time of purchasing.
In May 2013, Coupa introduced applications Coupa Sourcing and Coupa Catalogs. The former makes it easier for companies to run sourcing events with suppliers to save money. With Coupa Catalogs, companies are able to use Coupa’s software platform as a shopping and catalog management front end to their ERP-based procurement system.
In April 2014, Coupa introduced Coupa Inventory which provides all employees in an organization real-time visibility into inventory availability while they are ordering, thus reducing wasteful spending.[24]
In October 2014, Coupa announced an update to its applications, which includes new features to optimize spend and supply chain management in the enterprise.[25]
Misappropriation of trade secrets[edit]
In May 2014, Ariba, a unit of SAP and a competitor of Coupa, filed a lawsuit alleging that Coupa misappropriated Ariba trade secrets. On September 24, 2015, the parties settled the lawsuit. Coupa acknowledged its possession of Ariba information and is required to abide by certain procedures to prevent any misappropriation in the future. Coupa paid Ariba an undisclosed amount.[26][27]
Customers and Partners[edit]
As of November 2014, Coupa indicated it had 450+ customers worldwide in 40 countries and in 150 currencies, including Concentrix, Coca-Cola Consolidated, Adidas, Subway, Amazon, Armstrong, Sears, Graham Packaging, BNP Paribas, TD Bank[28][29] Salesforce.com,[11] and Rent-A-Center.[2] In 2011, Coupa started working with the Independent Purchasing Cooperative (IPC) of Subway, to help its franchises in 98 countries with its cost management.[29] Salesforce.com has its sales managers use Coupa to monitor travel expenses and sales outcomes.[30] Rent-a-Center chose Coupa because the e-procurement product has an Amazon-like interface, which is easy for employees to use.[30]
In October 2014, Coupa and NetSuite (NYSE: N) announced a strategic partnership to jointly market the Coupa Cloud Procurement and Expense Management SuiteApp built for NetSuite.[31]
History[edit]
Dave Stephens and Noah Eisner[3] founded Coupa in 2006.[3] Stephens and Eisner previously worked at Oracle (enterprise procurement applications).[3] Rob Bernshteyn took over as Coupa's CEO in February 2009, after serving as Vice President of Global Product Marketing and Management at SuccessFactors, Inc.[4] Since then, the company has reported 26 consecutive quarters of subscription revenue growth.[32]
In 2011, Coupa was named a Cool Vendor in Procurement and Sourcing by Gartner, which cited Coupa’s solution usability.[33] In 2014, The Forrester Wave named Coupa a market leader.[34] Coupa was also positioned in the Leaders quadrant of the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Procure-to-Pay Suites for Indirect Procurement in March 2015.[35]
Former Yahoo CEO and PayPal president Scott Thompson joined the company’s board of directors in April 2013.[36] The company expanded globally in 2014, announcing new operations in Dublin, Ireland.[37] Coupa's other international operations include its offices in Australia and several EMEA and Asia Pacific locations.[38] Coupa expanded its leadership and governance in 2014 with the hiring of Tara Ryan as the company's CMO[39] and the appointment of Roger Siboni as a new member of the company's Board of Directors.[40]
In 2015, Coupa appointed Todd Ford as CFO.[41] In February 2015, Coupa acquired the assets of ZenPurchase, an enterprise procurement software company.[42] In July 2015, Coupa acquired InvoiceSmash, an e-invoicing vendor,[43] and TripScanner, an open booking vendor.[44] In January 2016, Coupa acquired Contractually, a cloud-based contract management solution.[45]
In October 2016, Coupa Software went public on the Nasdaq, trading as COUP. It raised over $133 million on its first day of trading. [46] Previously, Coupa had raised a total of $169 million in funding. [47]

Technology[edit]
Coupa’s Cloud Spend Optimization SaaS product manages indirect purchases, invoices and expenses in real-time.[6][7] Built on Coupa’s cloud architecture, it provides executive dashboards,[8] alerts,[7] expense management[9] and real-time benchmarking[10] into a single user interface.[8][9] This spend optimization software suite focuses on three core spend areas including procurement, accounts payable, and expense management.
Coupa is cloud-based and built on Amazon Web Services infrastructure.[11][12] In 2007, the company launched a SaaS (Software-as-a-service) product called Coupa On Demand for SMBs (small and midsize businesses). This platform uses Amazon’s Elastic Compute Cloud Web services (EC2).[13]
Coupa’s software is based on the Ruby on Rails (RoR) platform.[14][12] With RoR, Coupa developed software that helps companies to better monitor costs[15] with less implementation time[16][17] and employee training[18] In 2006, its first free open-source product, Coupa Express, was built using RoR.[19] Coupa's application can be accessed by any user via their mobile device browser.
In November 2011, Coupa released its first spend analysis product called Coupa Spend Optimizer.[20][21] According to Coupa, this product provides spending insight to employees in both the procurement and finance sectors, with its easy-to-use interface.[22] Also, users have access to data from other platforms, like ERP or HR systems, so they have a broader understanding of spend across their companies.[23]
In August 2012, Coupa added an application called Coupa Contracts to its software suite. Companies can use the contracts repository to access their approved contracts and to leverage their negotiated pricing at the time of purchasing.
In May 2013, Coupa introduced applications Coupa Sourcing and Coupa Catalogs. The former makes it easier for companies to run sourcing events with suppliers to save money. With Coupa Catalogs, companies are able to use Coupa’s software platform as a shopping and catalog management front end to their ERP-based procurement system.
In April 2014, Coupa introduced Coupa Inventory which provides all employees in an organization real-time visibility into inventory availability while they are ordering, thus reducing wasteful spending.[24]
In October 2014, Coupa announced an update to its applications, which includes new features to optimize spend and supply chain management in the enterprise.[25]
Misappropriation of trade secrets[edit]
In May 2014, Ariba, a unit of SAP and a competitor of Coupa, filed a lawsuit alleging that Coupa misappropriated Ariba trade secrets. On September 24, 2015, the parties settled the lawsuit. Coupa acknowledged its possession of Ariba information and is required to abide by certain procedures to prevent any misappropriation in the future. Coupa paid Ariba an undisclosed amount.[26][27]
Customers and Partners[edit]
As of November 2014, Coupa indicated it had 450+ customers worldwide in 40 countries and in 150 currencies, including Concentrix, Coca-Cola Consolidated, Adidas, Subway, Amazon, Armstrong, Sears, Graham Packaging, BNP Paribas, TD Bank[28][29] Salesforce.com,[11] and Rent-A-Center.[2] In 2011, Coupa started working with the Independent Purchasing Cooperative (IPC) of Subway, to help its franchises in 98 countries with its cost management.[29] Salesforce.com has its sales managers use Coupa to monitor travel expenses and sales outcomes.[30] Rent-a-Center chose Coupa because the e-procurement product has an Amazon-like interface, which is easy for employees to use.[30]
In October 2014, Coupa and NetSuite (NYSE: N) announced a strategic partnership to jointly market the Coupa Cloud Procurement and Expense Management SuiteApp built for NetSuite.[31]
History[edit]
Dave Stephens and Noah Eisner[3] founded Coupa in 2006.[3] Stephens and Eisner previously worked at Oracle (enterprise procurement applications).[3] Rob Bernshteyn took over as Coupa's CEO in February 2009, after serving as Vice President of Global Product Marketing and Management at SuccessFactors, Inc.[4] Since then, the company has reported 26 consecutive quarters of subscription revenue growth.[32]
In 2011, Coupa was named a Cool Vendor in Procurement and Sourcing by Gartner, which cited Coupa’s solution usability.[33] In 2014, The Forrester Wave named Coupa a market leader.[34] Coupa was also positioned in the Leaders quadrant of the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Procure-to-Pay Suites for Indirect Procurement in March 2015.[35]
Former Yahoo CEO and PayPal president Scott Thompson joined the company’s board of directors in April 2013.[36] The company expanded globally in 2014, announcing new operations in Dublin, Ireland.[37] Coupa's other international operations include its offices in Australia and several EMEA and Asia Pacific locations.[38] Coupa expanded its leadership and governance in 2014 with the hiring of Tara Ryan as the company's CMO[39] and the appointment of Roger Siboni as a new member of the company's Board of Directors.[40]
In 2015, Coupa appointed Todd Ford as CFO.[41] In February 2015, Coupa acquired the assets of ZenPurchase, an enterprise procurement software company.[42] In July 2015, Coupa acquired InvoiceSmash, an e-invoicing vendor,[43] and TripScanner, an open booking vendor.[44] In January 2016, Coupa acquired Contractually, a cloud-based contract management solution.[45]
In October 2016, Coupa Software went public on the Nasdaq, trading as COUP. It raised over $133 million on its first day of trading. [46] Previously, Coupa had raised a total of $169 million in funding. [47]

Cloud company Coupa snags $80 million to cut corporate spending | Fortune.comTechSearchSearchFordU.S. Expands Probe Into Ford Explorers Over Carbon Monoxide ConcernsWMPWThe World’s Most Powerful Women: July 28COMPARECARDSSPONSOREDUberUber’s CEO Searchlight Reportedly Hits Former GE Head Jeff ImmeltCourtesy of CoupaData SheetCloud software company Coupa snags $80 million to cut corporate spendingHeather ClancyJun 01, 2015Coupa Software, a software startup that helps the likes of Salesforce, Sanofi and Swiss Re drive down procurement costs, has nearly doubled its backing with an oversubscribed $80 million round.The financing was led by T. Rowe Price Associates along with Iconiq Capital and Premji Invest. Existing backers Crosslink Capital, Battery Ventures, and El Dorado Ventures also participated. The new money bring Coupa’s total funding to $165 million.Coupa CEO Rob Bernshteyn said his company “isn’t big on” discussing its valuation, but he confirmed it is in the billion-dollar range.More important, in his mind: the investment gives Coupa the cash to invest in more sales and marketing resources, along with additional research and development. The company, which employs about 400 people total, has more than doubled its engineering team in the past 18 months, Bernshteyn said.Coupa touts its flagship offering as a “savings as a service” system that helps businesses reduce the cost of buying everything from information technology to buying raw materials to orchestrating corporate travel. The company figures it has helped its more than 500 corporate customers save around $5 billion; its system handles more than 1 million transactions daily.“Coupa has established a leadership position in cloud solutions for spend management with a platform that’s agile enough to support everything from procurement, invoicing and sourcing to expense management, inventory, storefront and beyond,” said T. Rowe Price Associates research analyst Tom Watson, in a statement.Forrester Research recently rated the company as a “leader” in the e-procurement category. “Coupa is the most customer-centric organization with the most flexible product,” the firm wrote in a May report. “[Its software] has one of the best user interfaces combined with broad functionality and flexible configuration.”Although Coupa got its start with midmarket companies, its largest account today has more than 90,000 users. Aside from the customers already mentioned, the company works with American Express, Land O’Lakes, and UBS. It has found a particular following in manufacturing, financial services, retail, healthcare and high tech, Bernshteyn said.Coupa figures that it takes four to six months for its customers to realize a return on their investment. Many save up to 11% on total spending, according to the company’s marketing materials.The startup’s most vocal competitor is SAP, through its Concur and Fieldglass divisions, both focused on some aspect of corporate expense management.Sign up for Data Sheet, Fortune’s daily morning newsletter about the business of technology.Customer ServiceSite MapPrivacy PolicyAdvertisingAd ChoicesTerms of UseYour California Privacy RightsCareers© 2017 Time Inc.
