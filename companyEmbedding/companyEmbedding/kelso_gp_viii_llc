Kelso & Co offers exit to LPs in Fund VIII


July 20, 2015
By Chris Witkowsky
 Follow @chriswitkowsky




 


Kelso & Co is offering limited partners in its eighth fund the option to sell their interests at 100 percent of net asset value (as of December 31), according to three people with knowledge of the situation.
The tender offer process is being run by Park Hill Group. The buyer is Ardian. One of the people said Ardian also is an LP who already committed to Fund IX, which means the tender offer will not include an additional contribution of new capital, known as a staple. Ardian also is an LP in Kelso Fund VIII, the person said.
Kelso declined to comment.
It’s not clear why Kelso is offering Fund VIII LPs an exit. One LP said the firm is taking control of the secondary process for Fund VIII, which is sought after on the secondary market.
“Rather than just let secondary deals happen out there willy nilly as they would for any fund, they created this competitive process to capture full fair price for any LP that wants liquidity,” the LP said. “I have a GP managing my money not distracted by background noise related to a frothy secondaries market.”
Fund VIII closed on $5.1 billion in 2008. The fund was generating a 9.42 percent internal rate of return and a 1.31x multiple as of Dec. 31, 2014, according to alternative assets data provider Bison.
In a tender offer, the GP chooses a buyer before extending the offer to the LP base. Once a buyer is chosen, the GP informs LPs of the offer and LPs can choose to sell or not. This differs from a fund restructuring, in which LPs usually have the choice of selling or rolling into a new vehicle with the GP on reset terms.
Tenders frequently come with an injection of new capital, but in this case Kelso is offering LPs in Fund VIII an exit with “no strings attached,” said one Fund VIII LP.
“This would be an example of where a GP has come forward with a broad-based liquidity option for LPs, with no strings attached, which is somewhat unique,” the LP said.
Another Kelso LP said the buyer is paying Park Hill’s fee for work on the tender offer process. Who pays the agent differs from deal to deal. Sometimes existing LPs pay the fee.
The tender offer comes as Kelso seeks to raise $2.5 billion for its ninth fund, which has been in the market since May 2014. Keslo has collected $1.7 billion for Kelso Investment Associates IX LP, one of the people said. Kelso is making a 20 percent GP commitment to the fund, Buyouts previously reported.
Kelso expects to close Fund IX by the end of the year, according to a Kelso LP.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.

It's amazing what three letters can do.
Adding "Inc." or "LLC" to your business' name is more than a good look. It protects your personal assets, creates tax advantages, and much more.

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
