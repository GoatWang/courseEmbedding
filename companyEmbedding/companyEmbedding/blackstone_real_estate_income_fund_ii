				Access to the information contained in this website is restricted under applicable securities laws of the United States.  The Company has not been and will not be registered under the US Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "Investment Company Act") and, as such, holders of the securities of the Company mentioned in this website (the "Securities") will not be entitled to the benefits of the Investment Company Act.  No offer, sale, resale, pledge, delivery, distribution or transfer of the Securities may be made except under circumstances that will not result in the Company being required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act.  The Securities have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act, or with any securities regulatory authority of any state or other jurisdiction of the United States, and may not be offered, sold, resold, pledged, taken up, exercised, renounced, delivered, distributed or transferred, directly or indirectly, into or within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, US persons, except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and in compliance with any applicable securities laws of any state or other jurisdiction of the United States and in a manner which would not require the Company to register under the Investment Company Act.  No public offering of the Securities is being made in the United States.  The information contained in this website, therefore, is generally not available to persons in the United States or who are US Persons.
			

				With regard to persons in the United States or who are US Persons, access to this website is restricted solely to those who (a) are "Qualified Institutional Buyers" as defined in Rule 144A under the Securities Act and "Qualified Purchasers" as defined in Section 2(a)(51) and related rules of the Investment Company Act, or (b) own shares of the Company.

				You are a "Qualified Purchaser" if you are:
			

				(i)         a natural person (including any person who holds a joint, community property, or other similar shared ownership interest in an issuer that is excepted under Section 3(c)(7) of the US Investment Company Act with that person's Qualified Purchaser spouse) who owns not less than $5,000,000 in investments, as defined by the US Securities and Exchange Commission;
			

				(ii)        a company, partnership or trust that owns not less than $5,000,000 in investments and that is owned directly or indirectly by or for two or more natural persons who are related as siblings or spouse (including former spouses), or direct lineal descendants by birth or adoption, spouses of such persons, the estates of such persons, or foundations, charitable organisations, or trusts established by or for the benefit of such persons;

				(iv)       a person, acting for your own account or the accounts of other Qualified Purchasers, who in the aggregate owns and invests on a discretionary basis, not less than $25,000,000 in investments.

Accordingly, each acquirer of the securities will be deemed to represent that (i) it is either (a) a QP and is acting for its own account or the account of another QP, or (b) not a US Person and is acquiring the securities outside the United States in an "offshore transaction" meeting the requirements of Regulation S under the Securities Act; (ii) it understands that the Company may receive a list of all participants holding positions in its securities from one or more book-entry depositaries; and (iii) it will provide notice of applicable transfer restrictions to any subsequent transferees.

1.8         The Company delivers to its shareholders annual audited financial statements an unaudited interim report, and such other shareholder notices as the Company deems appropriate. Unless a shareholder indicates otherwise by written notice to the Company, the shareholder hereby consents to receive the Company's financial statements, shareholder newsletters, and other shareholder notices and materials via email to the shareholder's email address in the Company's records or via the Company's website.  Although the Company does not impose any additional charges for electronic delivery, the shareholder may, of course, incur costs associated with the shareholderâ€™s electronic access, such as usage charges from the shareholder's Internet access providers. The shareholder may revoke its election to receive such documents via electronic delivery at any time by written notice to the Company requesting that the Company send such documents via facsimile or in hard copy via the postal service to the address notified to the Company by the shareholder from time to time.
			

2.           Privacy policy - The Company respects the privacy of individuals who visit the Company's website and is careful to ensure that information disclosed to the Company in confidence is treated confidentially. Please see the Company's full privacy policy.

Blackstone preps nontraded real estate fund for the fee-only crowd
Fund comes with no sales load but 12(b)-1 fee, performance fee and expense ratio






Dec 30, 2013 @ 12:04 pm
By 
	Jason Kephart






















+ Zoom




      Private-equity powerhouse The Blackstone Group Inc. is raising funds for a new nontraded real estate mutual fund designed to appeal to fee-only financial advisers. Blackstone is raising money for the Blackstone Real Estate Income Fund II, which will offer shares that are not subject to a sales load, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Sales loads on nontraded real estate investment trusts, which are typically more than 10%, have made the products popular in the independent broker-dealer community, but have also been a major point of criticism from financial adviser channels that are more focused on fees, such as independent registered investment advisers.
				



Instead of a sales load, the Blackstone Real Estate Income Fund II will have an ongoing 12(b)-1 fee of 25 basis points and also have a 1.5% expense ratio and 15% performance fee, similar to a hedge fund. The fund will invest in the usual smorgasbord of real estate investments, such as commercial mortgage-backed securities, private real estate debt and loans. Blackstone expects to complete its fundraising by March 31, according to the filing. Peter Rose, a spokesman for the firm, declined to comment while the fund is in a quiet period. The Blackstone fund is the latest sign of innovation in the booming nontraded real estate fund space. In January, Bank of America Merrill Lynch became the first wirehouse to sell a nontraded REIT through its advisers. The Jones Lang LaSalle Income Property Trust that Merrill chose comes with a 2.5% sales load. Nontraded real estate investment trusts recorded a record $20 billion in sales in 2013, up from $10.3 billion in 2012, and industry watchers expect another strong year of growth in 2014.

Blackstone Enters Nontraded REIT Market With New Fund - Bloomberg






























































  
















Blackstone Enters Nontraded REIT Market With New Fund
By Hui-yong Yu
        
More stories by Hui-yong Yu

August 11, 2016, 6:53 PM EDT










                Move follows rule changes aimed at reducing conflicts, costs
            



                New REIT to invest in properties with stable rental income
            



Blackstone Group LP is seeking to raise $5 billion for its first nontraded real estate investment trust, targeting individual investors in a market that has been plagued by conflicts of interests, high commissions and poor performance.The move by the world’s biggest alternative-asset manager follows regulatory rule changes aimed at increasing transparency in the industry for nontraded REITs, which aren’t listed on exchanges and are primarily marketed by brokers to individual buyers. The rules include requiring such trusts to follow stricter guidelines on estimating the net asset values of their holdings and disclosing costs.Blackstone Real Estate Income Trust will be a perpetual-life fund and will invest in commercial properties that generate stable rental income, including apartments, shopping centers and hotels, according to a regulatory filing Wednesday. The new REIT hasn’t bought any assets yet. Christine Anderson, a spokeswoman for Blackstone, declined to comment beyond the filing.








“Historically, the fee load has been pretty significant for retail investors to get into these vehicles,” said Dirk Aulabaugh, a managing director in the advisory and consulting unit of Green Street Advisors LLC, a Newport Beach, California-based real estate research firm. Blackstone’s new fund appears to be “better aligned than what has historically been the case in the nontraded REIT space, and I think investors are going to welcome that, and they’ll be successful in raising capital along those lines.”‘Large-Scale’The nontraded REIT is Blackstone’s latest push into less-risky real estate investments. The company already has an open-end fund for institutions called Blackstone Property Partners. That fund buys so-called core-plus real estate -- properties that might require light renovation or leasing work to increase values. The core-plus strategy, which includes separately managed accounts for institutional clients, has grown to about $12 billion in assets, Blackstone Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Stephen Schwarzman said in April.“The prospects for growth in that business are huge,” Schwarzman said on the company’s first-quarter earnings conference call, on April 21. “As we move into the retail chain of distribution with this, we should be able to create a really very large-scale business.”




Higher YieldsNontraded REITs have been able to attract investors partly by offering higher dividend yields than publicly traded property owners. More attention was brought to such products in 2014 with the accounting scandal at American Realty Capital Properties Inc. The landlord was part of the real estate empire of Nicholas Schorsch, whose AR Capital LLC was the largest sponsor of nontraded REITs.“The market’s maturing and it is addressing some of the regulatory concerns over increasing the transparency or decreasing the front-end costs associated with these programs,” said Anthony Chereso, president and CEO of the Investment Program Association trade group. “What you’re going to see is a continuing evolution toward a product that’s going to be more broadly received, and you’ll see capital-raising improve as markets adjust to it.”

Sales of nontraded REITs have plunged. They raised $2.79 billion this year through July, down from $6.41 billion in the same period of 2015, according to Robert A. Stanger & Co. The decline followed a 36 percent drop for all of last year, the real estate investment bank said. Nontraded REITs had $90.9 billion of assets under management as of March 31, according to the Investment Program Association, citing figures from the bank.Returns from nontraded REITs generally lagged behind their publicly traded counterparts, shares of which also are easier to buy and sell, Aulabaugh said. Other nontraded REITs are looking at ways to reduce fees, he said. Blackstone’s track record of delivering strong returns in real estate ought to help it raise money for its new REIT, Aulabaugh said.“They’re going to make the business better,” he said. Blackstone’s entry “will force other players in the space to raise their game.”— With assistance by Devin Banerjee(Trade group corrects assets under management in ninth paragraph of story published Aug. 10.)

			Equity
			: Real Assets



			About Real Assets

			Real Assets are tangible raw materials, goods, property, buildings, roads, and other constructed items
			that are consumed, used to manufacture other items, or used to live in, work in, transport people and
			goods, and provide basic services like clean water, cellular service, and electricity. Real assets include
			commodities, real estate and REITs, infrastructure, pipelines, and collectibles. To encourage investments
			in these often-essential projects, governments sometimes grant special tax treatment to the returns
			or cash flows of some of these projects.
		

			Real assets are generally considered to be inflation hedges, since when the costs of goods and services
			rise (inflation increases), so does the demand for raw materials, energy, and physical systems also
			typically rise. In addition, they have historically had low 
				correlations with traditional financial assets such as stocks and bonds.



					About REITs

					Many real estate investments seek to provide attractive, growing dividends. A Real Estate Investment
					Trust (REIT) is a company that owns, and usually operates, income-producing commercial real estate,
					such as apartments, shopping centers, offices, hotels and warehouses. Most REITs are publicly-traded.
				

					A real estate investment trust is a tax designation for a corporate entity which can invest in real
					estate. The overall purpose of REITs designation is to reduce corporate income taxes, and in return
					REITs are required to distribute 90% of their taxable income to shareholders.
				

Historically, real estate investments such as REITs often have had relatively low correlations with other
						types of investments. Their total return typically relies on both cash flows from rents, and any capital
						appreciation. 


REIT performance is linked to the performance of the commercial real estate market. Property values and
						rents may fall due to economic, legal, or cultural developments. In addition, REITs depend on liquid
						credit markets, and there may also be special risks associated with particular sectors of the commercial
						real estate market. 


					For additional explanation please visit 
						NAREITs (the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts).
Nuveen Real Estate Income Fund (JRS)

			
					The fund invests at least 90% of its total assets in income producing common stocks, preferred stocks,
					convertible preferred stocks and debt securities issued by real estate companies; at least 80% of its
					total assets in income producing equity securities issued by REITs; and will not invest more than 25%
					of its total assets in non-investment grade preferred stocks, convertible preferred stocks and debt
					securities. The fund uses leverage.
				
				
					About Infrastructure

					Infrastructure refers to physical constructed items such as roads, bridges, water treatment, communications
					transmission, prisons, and other projects and systems that are needed or desired to support a country’s
					or business’s economic development. Infrastructure projects may be funded publicly, privately, or through
					public-private partnerships.
				

					Demand for financing infrastructure is influenced by worldwide population growth, urbanization, economic
					recovery, and maintenance and modernization of existing infrastructure.
				

The total return of infrastructure investments typically relies on cash flows from tolls or usage fees,
						as well as potential capital appreciation (when structured as an equity or stock) or pay back of principal
						(when structured as a bond or debt obligation). 


Like REITs, values, rents, and usage fees may fall due to economic, legal, or cultural developments.
						Some infrastructure investments may have smaller capitalization and thus lower liquidity, and global
						infrastructure investments may be subject to additional risks associated with emerging markets and different
						legal and financial systems.
Nuveen Real Asset Income and Growth
							Fund (JRI)

					Under normal market conditions, JRI’s Managed Assets will be invested:
					At least 80% in equity and debt securities issued by real asset related companies located anywhere in
						the world. 
No more than 40%, at the time of purchase, in debt securities. 
All of the Fund’s debt securities may be rated lower than investment grade quality (BB+/Ba1 or lower);
						no more than 10% the Fund’s Managed Assets may be invested in debt securities rated CCC+/Caa1 or lower
						at any time. 
At least 25% and no more than 75% in securities of non-U.S. issuers through the direct investment in
						securities of non-U.S. companies and depositary receipts.1


					JRI will employ, to a limited extent, an integrated and dynamic option writing strategy focused on securities
					issued by real asset related companies that seeks to generate option premiums for the purpose of enhancing
					the Fund’s risk-adjusted total returns over time. Initially, the notional value of the options will
					range from 5% to 10% of Managed Assets.2


					{1} A negotiable financial instrument issued by a bank to represent a foreign company’s publicly traded
					securities. The depositary receipt trades on a local stock exchange.
					

					{2} Over extended periods of time, the notional value of the call options written by the Fund may range
					from 0% to 25% of Managed Assets, depending on market conditions and Nuveen Asset Management’s ongoing
					assessment of the attractiveness of writing call options from a risk- adjusted return standpoint. There
					can be no assurance that the Fund’s options strategy will be successful. The Fund’s risk-adjusted returns
					over any particular period may be positive or negative.
				






								Investor Profile

								Are these CEFs right for you?
The features and investment objectives of these funds might be especially appealing to investors seeking:
							

Potential for enhanced portfolio returns; 
High current income potential; 
Opportunity for capital growth.


								What are potential risks of REITS?

REIT performance is linked to the performance of the commercial real estate market. Property values
									and rents may fall due to economic, legal, or cultural developments. 
REITs depend on liquid credit markets, and there may also be special risks associated with particular
									sectors of the commercial real estate market.

Chart Definitions
Income-oriented closed-end funds make payouts largely from interest	and dividends.
Income and capital appreciation funds seek regular cash	flow made up of interest and dividends, with the remainder from capital appreciation or, if necessary, return of capital.
Capital appreciation and income closed-end funds seek cash flow mainly from capital appreciation.
Single-asset-class funds invest primarily in one asset class, which can be used as components in a well-diversified income portfolio.
Pre-packaged combinations are funds featuring multiple asset types, which are designed to work together to diversify fund cash flow risks.

Closed the Income Gap®
with Nuveen Closed-End Funds



Closed-End Funds Offer Attractive Income Potential
In the search for increased income opportunities, closed-end funds can be a smart choice. Designed and built for income, closed-end funds seek to provide regular, stable cash flow over time and can serve as a compelling tool for optimizing an income portfolio.
Consider closed-end funds if you’re seeking to:1


1


Enhance Income and Cash Flow
Because of their unique closed structure and ability to use leverage,2 closed-end funds offer potentially higher distributions3 than traditional income investments.4


2


Manage Interest Rate Risk 
Floating rate, shorter duration or equity closed-end funds may help reduce a portfolio’s interest rate sensitivity.


3


Protect Purchasing Power
Closed-end funds that invest in real assets and dividend-paying stocks, which typically increase their payments with rising inflation, may help buffer the effects of rising inflation.


4


Maximize After-Tax Efficiency
Nuveen offers a wide array of national, state specific and AMT-free municipal closed-end funds that may help reduce your tax liability on investment income.5


5


Improve Diversification
With strategies that provide access to specialized asset classes, including alternatives, Nuveen closed-end funds may enhance portfolio diversification.

There is no guarantee that any of the funds will achieve their stated objectives. For detailed information on the specific risks associated with each fund, please view the fund overview by clicking on the fund name above.
1 Goal classifications represent common investor concerns when evaluating portfolio needs, are provided for informational purposes only, and are not intended to be relied upon as investment advice or recommendations.
2 Leverage typically magnifies the total return of a fund’s portfolio, whether that return is positive or negative, and creates an opportunity for increased common share net income as well as higher volatility of net asset value, market price, and distributions. There is no assurance that a fund’s leveraging strategy will be successful.
3 Potential distribution sources include net investment income, realized gains and return of capital.  
4 Different types of asset investments have different types of risks, which may provide higher returns but also greater volatility. In general, equity securities tend to be more volatile that fixed income securities. The value of, and income generated by, debt securities will decrease or increase based on changes in market interest rates. As interest rates risk, bond prices fall. In general, below investment grade (high-yield) debt securities tend to be more volatile than investment grade securities. Preferred securities are subordinated to bonds and other debt instruments in a company's capital structure, and therefore are subject to greater credit risk. The interest and principal payments of U.S. Treasury securities are guaranteed.
5 Income may be subject to state and local income taxes and the alternative minimum tax. Capital gains, if any, will be subject to capital gains tax.

Excludes certain securities in initial period of acquisition.
Includes short-term securities, accrued income and other assets less liabilities.
Prior to September 30, 2016, securities in the Real Estate sector were reported under the Financials sector.
Figures include convertible securities; totals may not reconcile due to rounding. Methodology notes: The equity breakdown by revenue reflects the fund’s publicly traded equity holdings and excludes cash (and fixed income securities, if applicable). Underlying revenue data were compiled by MSCI and account for disparities in the way companies report their revenues across geographic segments. MSCI breaks out each company’s reported revenues into country-by-country estimates. MSCI provides revenue data figures based on a proprietary, standardized model. Revenue exposure at the fund and index level was calculated by using FactSet, which takes these company revenue exposures and multiplies by the company’s weighting in the portfolio and index. In this breakdown, Israel has been included in Europe.

The model for the fixed-income style box is based on the two pillars of fixed-income performance: interest-rate sensitivity and credit quality. The three interest sensitivity groups are limited, moderate and extensive and the three credit quality groups are high, medium and low. These groupings display a portfolio's effective duration and third party credit ratings to provide an overall representation of the fund's risk orientation given the sensitivity to interest rate and credit rating of bonds in the portfolio.

Terms and Definitions


Beta: Beta relatively measures a fund's sensitivity to market movements over a specified period of time. The beta of the market (represented by the benchmark index) is equal to 1; a beta higher than 1 implies that a fund's return was more volatile than the market. A beta lower than 1 suggests that the fund was less volatile than the market. Generally the higher the R-squared measure, the more reliable the beta measurement will be. 
Bond Statistic  Average Coupon: The average coupon is the weighted average coupon rate of all the bonds in the fund.
Bond Statistic  Average Duration in Years: Expressed in years, average duration is a weighted average of the estimated price sensitivity of the bonds in the fund's portfolio to a given change in interest rates. With respect to individual bonds, for example, a duration of 4 years indicates that the price of a bond will rise/fall by approximately 4% if rates in general fall/rise by 1%. Typically, bonds with a longer duration pay higher interest but are more sensitive to interest rate changes.
Bond Statistic  Average Life in Years: Expressed in years, average life is time weighting the expected principal payments, taking into consideration the impact of calls and prepayments. In general, it is a better measure than average maturity for bonds that have the ability to prepay principal before they reach maturity (e.g., mortgages, mortgage-backed securities and asset-backed securities). Data shown is a weighted average of the bond funds held in the fund's portfolio.
Bond Statistic  Average Yield to Maturity: A weighted average of all the fund's bond holding's yield to maturities. Yield to maturity is the return a bond earns if held to maturity, based on its price and coupon. Assumes that coupon payments can be reinvested at the yield to maturity.
Capture Ratio  Downside: Capture ratios reflect the annualized product of fund vs. index returns for all months in which the index had a positive return (upside capture) or negative return (downside capture).
Capture Ratio  Upside: Capture ratios reflect the annualized product of fund vs. index returns for all months in which the index had a positive return (upside capture) or negative return (downside capture).
Distribution rate  12-month: The income per share paid by the fund over the past 12 months to an investor from dividends (including any special dividends). The distribution rate is expressed as a percentage of the current price.
Historical  Long-Term Capital Gains: When a capital gain distribution is paid, the net asset value per share is reduced by the amount of the payment plus or minus any change in the value of the fund's holdings. Read our explanation of the effect of a capital gain on a fund's price for details. Two types of capital gains are realized by our funds — short-term and long-term. Net short-term capital gains are distributed to shareholders as income dividends and are taxed at ordinary income tax rates. Long-term capital gain distributions are taxed at a maximum 15% rate. The information above classifies gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset held for more than one year as a long-term capital gain.
Historical  Regular Dividend: The share prices of all of our equity funds decrease when a dividend is paid. The share price of only one of our fixed-income funds, Capital World Bond Fund, also decreases when a dividend is paid. A fund pays a special dividend when the investment income generated by the fund exceeds the income the fund has paid in the form of dividends throughout the year. Special dividends are distributed with the last dividend payment at the end of the calendar year. Prior to January 1, 2003, short-term capital gains distributed to shareholders as income dividends and special dividends paid to shareholders were included in the aggregate income dividend dollar amount.
Historical  Short-Term Capital Gains: When a capital gain distribution is paid, the net asset value per share is reduced by the amount of the payment plus or minus any change in the value of the fund's holdings. Read our explanation of the effect of a capital gain on a fund's price for details. Two types of capital gains are realized by our funds — short-term and long-term. Net short-term capital gains are distributed to shareholders as income dividends and are taxed at ordinary income tax rates. Long-term capital gain distributions are taxed at a maximum 15% rate.
Historical  Special Dividend: The share prices of all of our equity funds decrease when a dividend is paid. The share price of only one of our fixed-income funds, Capital World Bond Fund, also decreases when a dividend is paid. A fund pays a special dividend when the investment income generated by the fund exceeds the income the fund has paid in the form of dividends throughout the year. Special dividends are distributed with the last dividend payment at the end of the calendar year. Prior to January 1, 2003, short-term capital gains distributed to shareholders as income dividends and special dividends paid to shareholders were included in the aggregate income dividend dollar amount.
R-Squared: R-squared is a measure of the correlation between a particular fund's return and that of its benchmark index. A measure of 100 indicates that all of the fund's return can be explained by movements in its benchmark. Generally the higher the R-squared measure, the more reliable the beta measurement will be. Calculated by Morningstar.
Standard Deviation: Annualized standard deviation (based on monthly returns) is a common measure of absolute volatility that tells how returns over time have varied from the mean. A lower number signifies lower volatility. Calculated by Morningstar.

Dividends Taken in Cash
Dividend Reinvested














Figures shown are past results and are not predictive of results in future periods. Current and future results may be lower or higher than those shown. Share prices and returns will vary, so investors may lose money. Investing for short periods makes losses more likely. View fund expense ratios and returns.
Returns shown at net asset value (NAV) have all distributions reinvested. If a sales charge had been deducted, the results would have been lower.
Investments are not FDIC-insured, nor are they deposits of or guaranteed by a bank or any other entity, so they may lose value.
Investors should carefully consider investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. This and other important information is contained in the fund prospectuses and summary prospectuses, which can be obtained from a financial professional and should be read carefully before investing.
The return of principal for bond funds and for funds with significant underlying bond holdings is not guaranteed. Fund shares are subject to the same interest rate, inflation and credit risks associated with the underlying bond holdings. Lower rated bonds are subject to greater fluctuations in value and risk of loss of income and principal than higher rated bonds.
For more information about the risks associated with each fund, go to its detailed fund information page or read the prospectus.
State-specific tax-exempt funds are more susceptible to factors adversely affecting issuers of their states' tax-exempt securities than more widely diversified municipal bond funds. Income from municipal bonds may be subject to state or local income taxes and/or the federal alternative minimum tax. Certain other income, as well as capital gain distributions, may be taxable.
Investment results assume all distributions are reinvested and reflect applicable fees and expenses.
When applicable, investment results reflect fee waivers and/or expense reimbursements, without which results would have been lower. Read details about how waivers and/or reimbursements affect the results for each fund. View results and yields without fee waiver and/or expense reimbursement

Returns shown at net asset value (NAV) have all distributions reinvested. If a sales charge had been deducted, the results would have been lower.
Returns with sales charge for Class A shares reflect payment of the -32768.00% maximum sales charge.

Income from municipal bonds may be subject to state or local income taxes and/or the federal alternative minimum tax. Certain other income, as well as capital gain distributions, may be taxable.
There may have been periods when the fund(s) lagged the index(es). Certain market indexes are unmanaged and, therefore, have no expenses. Investors cannot invest directly in an index.
Investment results assume all distributions are reinvested and reflect applicable fees and expenses.
When applicable, investment results reflect fee waivers and/or expense reimbursements, without which results would have been lower. Read details about how waivers and/or reimbursements affect the results for each fund. View results and yields without fee waiver and/or expense reimbursement

Barclays Municipal Virginia Index did not exist prior to June 30, 1993. Therefore, results are measured from June 30, 1993, and are based on the corresponding value of the hypothetical $10,000 investment in the fund on that date.
YTD (year-to-date return): the net change in the value of the fund's shares (in percentage terms) from January 1, 2017, to the current date shown above.
For bond funds, the maximum initial sales charge was 4.75% prior to 1/10/2000.

In general, it is a better measure than average maturity for bonds that have the ability to prepay principal before they reach maturity (e.g., mortgages, mortgage-backed securities and asset-backed securities). Data shown is a weighted average of the bond funds held in the fund's portfolio.
Bond Statistic  Average Yield to Maturity: A weighted average of all the fund's bond holding's yield to maturities. Yield to maturity is the return a bond earns if held to maturity, based on its price and coupon. Assumes that coupon payments can be reinvested at the yield to maturity.
Capture Ratio  Downside: Capture ratios reflect the annualized product of fund vs. index returns for all months in which the index had a positive return (upside capture) or negative return (downside capture).
Capture Ratio  Upside: Capture ratios reflect the annualized product of fund vs. index returns for all months in which the index had a positive return (upside capture) or negative return (downside capture).
Distribution rate  12-month: The income per share paid by the fund over the past 12 months to an investor from dividends (including any special dividends). The distribution rate is expressed as a percentage of the current price.
Historical  Long-Term Capital Gains: When a capital gain distribution is paid, the net asset value per share is reduced by the amount of the payment plus or minus any change in the value of the fund's holdings. Read our explanation of the effect of a capital gain on a fund's price for details. Two types of capital gains are realized by our funds — short-term and long-term. Net short-term capital gains are distributed to shareholders as income dividends and are taxed at ordinary income tax rates. Long-term capital gain distributions are taxed at a maximum 15% rate. The information above classifies gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset held for more than one year as a long-term capital gain.
Historical  Regular Dividend: The share prices of all of our equity funds decrease when a dividend is paid. The share price of only one of our fixed-income funds, Capital World Bond Fund, also decreases when a dividend is paid. A fund pays a special dividend when the investment income generated by the fund exceeds the income the fund has paid in the form of dividends throughout the year. Special dividends are distributed with the last dividend payment at the end of the calendar year. Prior to January 1, 2003, short-term capital gains distributed to shareholders as income dividends and special dividends paid to shareholders were included in the aggregate income dividend dollar amount.

Prior to January 1, 2003, short-term capital gains distributed to shareholders as income dividends and special dividends paid to shareholders were included in the aggregate income dividend dollar amount.
R-Squared: R-squared is a measure of the correlation between a particular fund's return and that of its benchmark index. A measure of 100 indicates that all of the fund's return can be explained by movements in its benchmark. Generally the higher the R-squared measure, the more reliable the beta measurement will be. Calculated by Morningstar.
Standard Deviation: Annualized standard deviation (based on monthly returns) is a common measure of absolute volatility that tells how returns over time have varied from the mean. A lower number signifies lower volatility. Calculated by Morningstar.

            About Our Funds
        













Investments are not FDIC-insured, nor are they deposits of or guaranteed by a bank or any other entity, so they may lose value.
Investors should carefully consider investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. This and other important information is contained in the fund prospectuses and summary prospectuses, which can be obtained from a financial professional and should be read carefully before investing.



Excludes certain securities in initial period of acquisition.
Includes short-term securities, accrued income and other assets less liabilities.
Prior to September 30, 2016, securities in the Real Estate sector were reported under the Financials sector.
Figures include convertible securities; totals may not reconcile due to rounding. Methodology notes: The equity breakdown by revenue reflects the fund’s publicly traded equity holdings and excludes cash (and fixed income securities, if applicable). Underlying revenue data were compiled by MSCI and account for disparities in the way companies report their revenues across geographic segments. MSCI breaks out each company’s reported revenues into country-by-country estimates. MSCI provides revenue data figures based on a proprietary, standardized model. Revenue exposure at the fund and index level was calculated by using FactSet, which takes these company revenue exposures and multiplies by the company’s weighting in the portfolio and index. In this breakdown, Israel has been included in Europe.
Calculated by American Funds. Due to differing calculation methods, the figures shown here may differ from those calculated by Morningstar.
Calculated by Morningstar. Due to differing calculation methods, the figures shown here may differ from those calculated by American Funds.
The months indicated for dividends and capital gains paid represent the anticipated current year ex-dividend date schedule for all share classes.
Expense ratios are as of the most recent prospectus.
Read more information about Morningstar Style Box methodology. The model for the fixed-income style box is based on the two pillars of fixed-income performance: interest-rate sensitivity and credit quality. The three interest sensitivity groups are limited, moderate and extensive and the three credit quality groups are high, medium and low. These groupings display a portfolio's effective duration and third party credit ratings to provide an overall representation of the fund's risk orientation given the sensitivity to interest rate and credit rating of bonds in the portfolio.

Terms and Definitions


Beta: Beta relatively measures a fund's sensitivity to market movements over a specified period of time. The beta of the market (represented by the benchmark index) is equal to 1; a beta higher than 1 implies that a fund's return was more volatile than the market. A beta lower than 1 suggests that the fund was less volatile than the market. Generally the higher the R-squared measure, the more reliable the beta measurement will be. 
Bond Statistic  Average Coupon: The average coupon is the weighted average coupon rate of all the bonds in the fund.
Bond Statistic  Average Duration in Years: Expressed in years, average duration is a weighted average of the estimated price sensitivity of the bonds in the fund's portfolio to a given change in interest rates. With respect to individual bonds, for example, a duration of 4 years indicates that the price of a bond will rise/fall by approximately 4% if rates in general fall/rise by 1%. Typically, bonds with a longer duration pay higher interest but are more sensitive to interest rate changes.
Bond Statistic  Average Life in Years: Expressed in years, average life is time weighting the expected principal payments, taking into consideration the impact of calls and prepayments.

There may have been periods when the fund(s) lagged the index(es). Certain market indexes are unmanaged and, therefore, have no expenses. Investors cannot invest directly in an index.
Investment results assume all distributions are reinvested and reflect applicable fees and expenses.
When applicable, investment results reflect fee waivers and/or expense reimbursements, without which results would have been lower. Read details about how waivers and/or reimbursements affect the results for each fund. View results and yields without fee waiver and/or expense reimbursement

Barclays Municipal Virginia Index did not exist prior to June 30, 1993. Therefore, results are measured from June 30, 1993, and are based on the corresponding value of the hypothetical $10,000 investment in the fund on that date.
YTD (year-to-date return): the net change in the value of the fund's shares (in percentage terms) from January 1, 2017, to the current date shown above.
For bond funds, the maximum initial sales charge was 4.75% prior to 1/10/2000.

            About Our Funds
        













Investments are not FDIC-insured, nor are they deposits of or guaranteed by a bank or any other entity, so they may lose value.
Investors should carefully consider investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. This and other important information is contained in the fund prospectuses and summary prospectuses, which can be obtained from a financial professional and should be read carefully before investing.



Excludes certain securities in initial period of acquisition.
Includes short-term securities, accrued income and other assets less liabilities.
Prior to September 30, 2016, securities in the Real Estate sector were reported under the Financials sector.
Figures include convertible securities; totals may not reconcile due to rounding. Methodology notes: The equity breakdown by revenue reflects the fund’s publicly traded equity holdings and excludes cash (and fixed income securities, if applicable). Underlying revenue data were compiled by MSCI and account for disparities in the way companies report their revenues across geographic segments. MSCI breaks out each company’s reported revenues into country-by-country estimates. MSCI provides revenue data figures based on a proprietary, standardized model. Revenue exposure at the fund and index level was calculated by using FactSet, which takes these company revenue exposures and multiplies by the company’s weighting in the portfolio and index. In this breakdown, Israel has been included in Europe.
Calculated by American Funds. Due to differing calculation methods, the figures shown here may differ from those calculated by Morningstar.
Calculated by Morningstar. Due to differing calculation methods, the figures shown here may differ from those calculated by American Funds.
The months indicated for dividends and capital gains paid represent the anticipated current year ex-dividend date schedule for all share classes.
Expense ratios are as of the most recent prospectus.
Read more information about Morningstar Style Box methodology. The model for the fixed-income style box is based on the two pillars of fixed-income performance: interest-rate sensitivity and credit quality. The three interest sensitivity groups are limited, moderate and extensive and the three credit quality groups are high, medium and low. These groupings display a portfolio's effective duration and third party credit ratings to provide an overall representation of the fund's risk orientation given the sensitivity to interest rate and credit rating of bonds in the portfolio.

Neither Morningstar, its content providers nor the American Funds are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information.

Terms and Definitions


Beta: Beta relatively measures a fund's sensitivity to market movements over a specified period of time. The beta of the market (represented by the benchmark index) is equal to 1; a beta higher than 1 implies that a fund's return was more volatile than the market. A beta lower than 1 suggests that the fund was less volatile than the market. Generally the higher the R-squared measure, the more reliable the beta measurement will be. 
Bond Statistic  Average Coupon: The average coupon is the weighted average coupon rate of all the bonds in the fund.
Bond Statistic  Average Duration in Years: Expressed in years, average duration is a weighted average of the estimated price sensitivity of the bonds in the fund's portfolio to a given change in interest rates. With respect to individual bonds, for example, a duration of 4 years indicates that the price of a bond will rise/fall by approximately 4% if rates in general fall/rise by 1%. Typically, bonds with a longer duration pay higher interest but are more sensitive to interest rate changes.
Bond Statistic  Average Life in Years: Expressed in years, average life is time weighting the expected principal payments, taking into consideration the impact of calls and prepayments. In general, it is a better measure than average maturity for bonds that have the ability to prepay principal before they reach maturity (e.g., mortgages, mortgage-backed securities and asset-backed securities). Data shown is a weighted average of the bond funds held in the fund's portfolio.
Bond Statistic  Average Yield to Maturity: A weighted average of all the fund's bond holding's yield to maturities. Yield to maturity is the return a bond earns if held to maturity, based on its price and coupon. Assumes that coupon payments can be reinvested at the yield to maturity.
Capture Ratio  Downside: Capture ratios reflect the annualized product of fund vs. index returns for all months in which the index had a positive return (upside capture) or negative return (downside capture).
Capture Ratio  Upside: Capture ratios reflect the annualized product of fund vs. index returns for all months in which the index had a positive return (upside capture) or negative return (downside capture).
Distribution rate  12-month: The income per share paid by the fund over the past 12 months to an investor from dividends (including any special dividends). The distribution rate is expressed as a percentage of the current price.
Historical  Long-Term Capital Gains: When a capital gain distribution is paid, the net asset value per share is reduced by the amount of the payment plus or minus any change in the value of the fund's holdings. Read our explanation of the effect of a capital gain on a fund's price for details. Two types of capital gains are realized by our funds — short-term and long-term. Net short-term capital gains are distributed to shareholders as income dividends and are taxed at ordinary income tax rates. Long-term capital gain distributions are taxed at a maximum 15% rate. The information above classifies gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset held for more than one year as a long-term capital gain.
Historical  Regular Dividend: The share prices of all of our equity funds decrease when a dividend is paid. The share price of only one of our fixed-income funds, Capital World Bond Fund, also decreases when a dividend is paid. A fund pays a special dividend when the investment income generated by the fund exceeds the income the fund has paid in the form of dividends throughout the year. Special dividends are distributed with the last dividend payment at the end of the calendar year. Prior to January 1, 2003, short-term capital gains distributed to shareholders as income dividends and special dividends paid to shareholders were included in the aggregate income dividend dollar amount.
Historical  Short-Term Capital Gains: When a capital gain distribution is paid, the net asset value per share is reduced by the amount of the payment plus or minus any change in the value of the fund's holdings. Read our explanation of the effect of a capital gain on a fund's price for details. Two types of capital gains are realized by our funds — short-term and long-term. Net short-term capital gains are distributed to shareholders as income dividends and are taxed at ordinary income tax rates. Long-term capital gain distributions are taxed at a maximum 15% rate.
Historical  Special Dividend: The share prices of all of our equity funds decrease when a dividend is paid. The share price of only one of our fixed-income funds, Capital World Bond Fund, also decreases when a dividend is paid. A fund pays a special dividend when the investment income generated by the fund exceeds the income the fund has paid in the form of dividends throughout the year. Special dividends are distributed with the last dividend payment at the end of the calendar year. Prior to January 1, 2003, short-term capital gains distributed to shareholders as income dividends and special dividends paid to shareholders were included in the aggregate income dividend dollar amount.
R-Squared: R-squared is a measure of the correlation between a particular fund's return and that of its benchmark index. A measure of 100 indicates that all of the fund's return can be explained by movements in its benchmark. Generally the higher the R-squared measure, the more reliable the beta measurement will be. Calculated by Morningstar.
Standard Deviation: Annualized standard deviation (based on monthly returns) is a common measure of absolute volatility that tells how returns over time have varied from the mean. A lower number signifies lower volatility. Calculated by Morningstar.

Figures shown are past results and are not predictive of results in future periods. Current and future results may be lower or higher than those shown. Share prices and returns will vary, so investors may lose money. Investing for short periods makes losses more likely. View fund expense ratios and returns.
Returns shown at net asset value (NAV) have all distributions reinvested. If a sales charge had been deducted, the results would have been lower.
Investments are not FDIC-insured, nor are they deposits of or guaranteed by a bank or any other entity, so they may lose value.
Investors should carefully consider investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. This and other important information is contained in the fund prospectuses and summary prospectuses, which can be obtained from a financial professional and should be read carefully before investing.
The return of principal for bond funds and for funds with significant underlying bond holdings is not guaranteed. Fund shares are subject to the same interest rate, inflation and credit risks associated with the underlying bond holdings. Lower rated bonds are subject to greater fluctuations in value and risk of loss of income and principal than higher rated bonds.
