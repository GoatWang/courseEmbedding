Aggregates
Aggregates are an engineered granular material consisting of crushed stone, gravel and sand of varying mineralogies, manufactured to specific sizes, grades and chemistry for use in construction, chemical and industrial applications.









Ready Mixed Concrete
Martin Marietta provides the highest quality products and services. We partner with our customers to finish all projects in a timely manner with superior results. To facilitate this, we offer unique performance-driven mix designs and a wide range of ancillary products to meet specification requirements and provide additional value to the construction community.








Asphalt
Asphalt is America’s most recycled material. Reclaimed asphalt is not just reusable as a "black rock" – the asphalt cement in the reclaimed pavement is reactivated to become an integral part of the new pavement. The recycled asphalt cement replaces part of the new asphalt cement and aggregate required for the pavement, reducing costs for road agencies and preserving valuable natural resources.








Cement
Martin Marietta operates energy-efficient and modern cement production facilities that are among the top tier in the United States, providing a sustainable building material critical for durable and resilient construction needs across all market segments. Commonly referred to as portland cement, these products range from general-purpose types to oil well cements and specialty masonry and plastering cements. Among the most widely-utilized building material in the world, cement touches virtually every aspect of our lives, and builds the homes, hospitals, offices, public buildings, ports, roads, bridges, highways, sidewalks and foundations across the country.








Cement Treated Materials
Cement Treated Material (CTM) is a simple, plant-mixed, highly compacted mixture of granular aggregates, Portland cement and water.  As the cement hydrates, the mixture becomes a hard, durable paving material.  A bituminous wearing surface is placed on the CTM to complete the pavement structure.

Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. Reports Second-Quarter Results


Record Consolidated Net Sales Leads to Earnings Growth


Aggregates Product Line Volume Up 13% and Pricing Up 5%


Company Raises Annual Aggregates Volume Guidance


Specialty Products Generates Record Net Sales and Earnings from

      Operations



 RALEIGH, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--

      Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. (NYSE: MLM) today reported its results

      for the second quarter ended June 30, 2014.

    

Ward Nye, Chairman, President and CEO of Martin Marietta, stated:

      "Second-quarter 2014 results reflect strong operational performance and

      demonstrate our ability to significantly grow overall earnings and

      expand margins as construction activity begins to recover from

      historically low levels. Aggregates product line shipments increased in

      all geographic groups, led by a 22% improvement in the West Group.

      Aggregates product line pricing increases for the quarter were also

      widespread, leading to an overall increase of 5% compared with the

      prior-year period. The powerful combination of increasing aggregates

      volume and pricing growth, along with quarterly record net sales for

      Specialty Products, resulted in record consolidated net sales of $602

      million. Based on our performance through the first half of the year and

      key economic indicators, we are raising our full-year aggregates product

      line volume guidance to a range of 6% to 8% over 2013 levels.

    


      "Employment growth, an important driver of construction activity, has

      been clearly evident in many of our key states and contributed to the

      continued expansion in private construction activity. We were also

      pleased to see greater stability in public-sector construction activity

      with certain Martin Marietta markets experiencing substantial growth. We

      view this level of activity as an indicator of strong underlying demand

      and expect further growth in the infrastructure market once funding

      stability is restored. We are encouraged by the bipartisan support for

      renewing long-term investment in the country's infrastructure system, as

      demonstrated by Congress' recent actions."

    

Mr. Nye continued, "We are enthusiastic about the prospects for our

      recent successfully completed acquisition of Texas Industries, Inc.

      ("TXI"), which was overwhelmingly approved by shareholders of both

      companies and closed in early July. The acquisition provides a broader

      platform for growth, an enhanced aggregates and concrete presence in the

      most dynamic markets in Texas as well as exposure to the expanding

      cement markets in Texas and California. I am grateful to all of our

      collective employees for their significant contributions to this

      combination and look forward to working with our new team members from

      TXI as we continue to focus on increasing shareholder value."

SEGMENT RESULTS (ALL COMPARISONS ARE VERSUS THE PRIOR-YEAR SECOND

      QUARTER)


Aggregates Business



      Aggregates product line shipments reflect growth in all end-use markets,

      with overall volume increasing 12.7%. The nonresidential market

      represented 31% of quarterly shipments and increased 16%, reflecting

      growth in the energy and commercial sectors. The Company continues to

      benefit from the nation's increasing investment in shale energy,

      particularly in South Texas. The residential end-use market accounted

      for 14% of quarterly shipments, and volumes to this market increased

      20%. Growth was strongest in the Southeast and West Groups. The

      ChemRock/Rail market accounted for 10% of volumes and increased 13% over

      the prior-year quarter.

    


      Shipments to the infrastructure market comprised the remaining 45% of

      the aggregates product line and increased 9% over the prior-year

      quarter. Growth was notable in Texas and Colorado, with each market

      continuing to show a commitment to securing alternative financing

      sources for infrastructure projects. Infrastructure shipments in Texas

      reflect the benefit of a robust state Department of Transportation

      program and the nearly $8 billion of projects awarded in 2013.

      Infrastructure shipments in Colorado also grew significantly, reflecting

      an increased state-level budget as well as reconstruction efforts,

      resulting from the historic flooding in 2013. Additionally, earlier this

      year, Colorado approved its first public-private partnership project,

      which will renovate and expand the U.S. 36 corridor.

    


      The current federal highway bill, Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st

      Century Act, or MAP-21, expires on September 30, 2014. While there

      is bipartisan support for renewing long-term investment in the country's

      infrastructure system, Congress has historically authorized continuing

      resolutions to bridge funding until the passage of a new bill. The

      Company also continues to monitor the status of the Highway Trust Fund.

      Recently, the House of Representatives passed a plan to provide $10.8

      billion to the Highway Trust Fund from a combination of general fund

      transfers and tax reform and extend MAP-21 under a continuing resolution

      until May 31, 2015. The Senate is expected to address highway

      legislation before Congress' August recess. While the Company expects

      the current uncertainty in federal funding to be resolved,

      infrastructure shipments in the second half of the year and the first

      half of 2015 could be negatively affected if funding concerns persist.

    


      As previously noted, aggregates shipments for the West Group increased

      22% compared with the prior-year quarter. Aggregates shipments for the

      Mid-America and Southeast Groups increased 5.1% and 7.3%, respectively.

      Recovery in eastern states is being led by private sector construction

      combined with some meaningful infrastructure projects, particularly in

      North Carolina, Georgia and Florida, where employment growth has

      accelerated and the residential construction segment is showing signs of

      more widespread growth. As the eastern U.S. construction recovery

      strengthens, the Company believes it will follow a growth pattern

      similar to that seen in many western markets.

    


      Aggregates product line pricing increased in each reportable group, led

      by a 10.3% improvement in the Southeast Group. Based on pricing trends

      through the first half of the year and mid-year price increases in many

      geographic areas, the Company is reaffirming its full-year aggregates

      product line pricing guidance.

    


      The vertically integrated product lines each reported growth in net

      sales. The ready mixed concrete product line achieved a 48% increase in

      net sales, which reflected volume and pricing improvements of 27% and

      12%, respectively, and led to an 800-basis-point improvement in the

      product line's gross margin (excluding freight and delivery revenues).

      The asphalt product line reported a 20% increase in net sales, due to

      increased shipments.

    


      Aggregates product line production increased 10.3%, as operations

      responded to current demand. Production cost per ton declined slightly

      as increased leverage was partially offset by higher repair costs. In

      addition to increased aggregates product line production, inventory on

      hand was utilized to meet demand, which negatively affected cost of

      sales by $13.3 million compared with the prior-year quarter. The

      Aggregates business gross margin (excluding freight and delivery

      revenues) was 20.7%, a 170-basis-point improvement over the prior-year

      quarter.

    

Specialty Products Business



      Specialty Products continued its strong performance and generated record

      net sales of $61.9 million, an increase of 9.3% over the prior-year

      quarter. Growth was primarily attributable to the chemicals product

      line. The business' gross margin (excluding freight and delivery

      revenues) of 37.8% increased 20 basis points. Second-quarter earnings

      from operations were $21.0 million compared with $18.7 million in the

      prior-year quarter.

    

CONSOLIDATED OPERATING RESULTS



      Consistent with expectations, consolidated SG&A declined $1.2 million,

      or 140 basis points as a percentage of net sales. Lower pension expense

      and the absence of information systems upgrade costs in 2013 account for

      the reduction. The Company incurred $5.3 million of business development

      and acquisition integration costs related to TXI. Excluding these

      expenses, adjusted consolidated earnings from operations were $101.5

      million. This compares with consolidated earnings from operations of

      $69.6 million in the prior-year quarter and reflects more than 30%

      improvement from 2013.

    

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES



      Cash provided by operating activities for the first six months of 2014

      was $70.4 million compared with $48.5 million in 2013, driven by higher

      earnings and despite the working capital build associated with improving

      business demand.

    


      At June 30, 2014, the ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated EBITDA,

      as defined, for the trailing twelve months was 2.49 times, in compliance

      with the leverage covenant. The Company recently amended the covenant to

      exclude acquisition fees and integration expenses related to TXI.

      Additionally, the leverage ratio maximum at September 30, 2014, has been

      increased to 3.75 times before stepping back to 3.50 times at December

      31, 2014, also related to the TXI acquisition.

    

ACQUISITION OF TXI



      On July 1, 2014, the Company completed the acquisition of TXI. The

      transaction enhances the Company's position as an aggregates-led,

      low-cost operator in the perennially largest and fastest growing

      geographies in the United States. With a leading U.S. aggregates

      position, the acquisition provides complementary, high-quality assets in

      cement and ready mix concrete, augmented by the Company's best-in-class

      long-haul transportation network. As of the completion of the

      acquisition, the Company had a market capitalization of approximately

      $8.8 billion.

    


      The Company expects the combination will generate annual pre-tax

      synergies of $70 million by calendar year 2017, corresponding to more

      than $500 million of total value creation for shareholders. Integration

      of the acquired business is under way and proceeding as planned. The

      Company anticipates the transition to its target operating model to be

      completed by the end of the year. The combination is expected to be

      accretive to both earnings per share in 2014, excluding one-time costs,

      and cash flow in the first full year following integration. In addition,

      the Company continues to expect to utilize TXI's more than $400 million

      in existing net operating loss, or NOL, carryforwards over the next few

      years. The Company also believes that there is an opportunity to realize

      incremental value from the expected divestiture of identified

      non-operating real estate assets.

    


      In June, the Company announced an agreement with the U.S. Department of

      Justice ("DOJ"), approved by the U.S. District Court for the District of

      Columbia, resolving all competition issues with respect to the

      acquisition of TXI. Under the terms of the agreement with the DOJ, in

      the second half of the year the Company will divest its North Troy

      aggregates quarry in Oklahoma and two rail yards located in Dallas and

      Frisco, Texas.

    


      In connection with the acquisition, the Company completed a private

      offering of $700 million of senior unsecured notes, which closed in

      early July, and amended its trade receivable securitization facility to

      increase available funding by $100 million to maximum borrowings of $250

      million, subject to the level of trade receivables. The private offering

      included $300 million of three-year variable-rate senior notes and $400

      million of 4.25% ten-year senior notes. The Company used the net

      proceeds from the offering, along with cash on hand and incremental

      drawings under the amended trade receivable securitization facility, to

      redeem $650 million of 9.25% notes due in 2020 assumed with TXI plus a

      make-whole premium and accrued unpaid interest. This refinancing is

      expected to reduce interest expense by $34 million on an annual basis

      based on current interest rates as compared with TXI's financing costs.

    

FULL-YEAR OUTLOOK



      The Company is encouraged by various positive trends in its business and

      markets, notably:

    



        Nonresidential construction is expected to grow in both the heavy

        industrial and commercial sectors.

      


        Shale development and related follow-on public and private

        construction activities are anticipated to remain strong.

      


        The commercial building sector is expected to benefit from improved

        market fundamentals, such as higher occupancies and rents,

        strengthened property values and increased real estate lending.

      


        Residential construction should continue to grow, driven by

        historically low levels of construction activity over the previous

        several years together with low mortgage rates, higher multi-family

        rental rates and rising housing prices. Total annual housing starts

        are anticipated to exceed one million units for the first time since

        2007.

      


        For the public sector, authorized highway funding from MAP-21 should

        increase slightly compared with 2013.

      


        Additionally, state initiatives to finance infrastructure projects are

        expected to grow and continue to play an expanded role in

        public-sector activity.

      



      Based on these trends and expectations, the Company anticipates the

      following, which excludes the impact of the TXI acquisition:

    



        Heritage aggregates end-use markets compared to 2013 levels:

        infrastructure shipments to increase slightly; nonresidential

        shipments to increase in the high single digits; residential shipments

        to experience double-digit growth; and ChemRock/Rail shipments to

        increase in the mid-to-high single digits.

      


        Heritage aggregates product line shipments to increase by 6% to 8%

        compared with 2013 levels.

      


        Heritage aggregates product line pricing to increase by 3% to 5% for

        the year compared with 2013.

      


        Heritage aggregates product line direct production cost per ton to

        decrease slightly compared with 2013.

      


        Heritage vertically integrated businesses to generate between $385

        million and $405 million of net sales and $40 million to $45 million

        of gross profit.

      


        Heritage SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales to decline

        compared with 2013, driven in part by $7.9 million of nonrecurring

        costs related primarily to the 2013 completion of the Company's

        information systems upgrade, as well as, lower pension costs.

      


        Net sales for the Specialty Products segment to be between $225

        million and $235 million, generating $85 million to $90 million of

        gross profit.

      


        Interest expense to remain relatively flat compared with 2013.

      


        Estimated effective income tax rate to approximate 29%, excluding

        discrete events.

      


        Capital expenditures to approximate $155 million.

      


Mr. Nye concluded, "This is an exciting time for Martin Marietta. We

      continue to see numerous positive indicators that underpin our

      confidence in the momentum and growth trajectory of our business.

      Additionally, our strategic acquisition of TXI enhanced our ability to

      benefit from the significant levels of construction activity in Texas

      and California. As we integrate the TXI operations and begin realizing

      expected synergies, we will remain focused on further improving our

      balance sheet and increasing our financial flexibility, which should

      lead to opportunities for additional value creation for our

      shareholders."

    

RISKS TO OUTLOOK



      The full-year outlook includes management's assessment of the likelihood

      of certain risk factors that will affect performance. The most

      significant risks to the Company's 2014 performance will be Congress'

      actions and timing surrounding the expiration of MAP-21 and uncertainty

      over the funding mechanism for the Highway Trust Fund. Further,

      additional government shutdown(s) and the impact of The Patient

      Protection and Affordable Care Act may further erode consumer

      confidence, which may negatively impact investment in construction

      projects. While both MAP-21 and The Transportation

      Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (TIFIA)

      credit assistance are excluded from the U.S. debt ceiling limit, this

      issue may have a significant impact on the economy and, consequently,

      construction activity. Other risks related to the Corporation's future

      performance include, but are not limited to, both price and volume and

      include a recurrence of widespread decline in aggregates volume

      negatively affecting aggregates price; the termination, capping and/or

      reduction of the federal and/or state gasoline tax(es) or other revenue

      related to infrastructure construction; a significant change in the

      funding patterns for traditional federal, state and/or local

      infrastructure projects; a reduction in defense spending, and the

      subsequent impact on construction activity on or near military bases; a

      decline in nonresidential construction, a decline in energy-related

      drilling activity resulting from certain regulatory or economic factors,

      a slowdown in the residential construction recovery, or some combination

      thereof; a reduction in economic activity in the Company's Midwest

      states resulting from reduced funding levels provided by the Agricultural

      Act of 2014 and declining coal traffic on the railroads; and the

      possibility that expected synergies and operating efficiencies in

      connection with the TXI acquisition are not realized within the expected

      time-frames or at all. Further, increased highway construction funding

      pressures resulting from either federal or state issues can affect

      profitability. If these negatively affect transportation budgets more

      than in the past, construction spending could be reduced. North

      Carolina, a state that disproportionately affects the Company's revenue

      and profitability, is among the states experiencing these fiscal

      pressures, although recent statistics indicate that transportation and

      tax revenues are increasing. The Specialty Products business essentially

      runs at capacity; therefore any unplanned changes in costs or

      realignment of customers introduce volatility to the earnings of this

      segment.

    


      The Company's principal business serves customers in aggregates-related

      construction markets. This concentration could increase the risk of

      potential losses on customer receivables; however, payment bonds

      normally posted on public projects, together with lien rights on private

      projects, help to mitigate the risk of uncollectible receivables. The

      level of aggregates demand in the Company's end-use markets, production

      levels and the management of production costs will affect the operating

      leverage of the Aggregates business and, therefore, profitability.

      Production costs in the Aggregates business are also sensitive to energy

      and raw material prices, both directly and indirectly. Diesel fuel and

      other consumables change production costs directly through consumption

      or indirectly by increased energy-related input costs, such as steel,

      explosives, tires and conveyor belts. Fluctuating diesel fuel pricing

      also affects transportation costs, primarily through fuel surcharges in

      the Company's long-haul distribution network. The Specialty Products

      business is sensitive to changes in domestic steel capacity utilization

      and the absolute price and fluctuations in the cost of natural gas.

    


      Transportation in the Company's long-haul network, particularly the

      supply of rail cars and locomotive power to move trains, affects the

      Company's ability to efficiently transport material into certain

      markets, most notably Texas, Florida and the Gulf Coast. The

      availability of trucks and drivers to transport the Company's product,

      particularly in markets experiencing increased demand due to

      energy-sector activity, is also a risk. The Aggregates business is also

      subject to weather-related risks that can significantly affect

      production schedules and profitability. The first and fourth quarters

      are most adversely affected by winter weather. Hurricane activity in the

      Atlantic Ocean and Gulf Coast generally is most active during the third

      and fourth quarters.

    


      Risks to the outlook also include shipment declines as a result of

      economic events beyond the Company's control. In addition to the impact

      on nonresidential and residential construction, the Company is exposed

      to risk in its estimated outlook from credit markets and the

      availability of and interest cost related to its debt.

    


      The Company's future performance is also exposed to risks from tax

      reform at the federal and state levels.

      transportation costs, including increases from higher passed-through

      energy and other costs to comply with tightening regulations as well as

      higher volumes of rail and water shipments; availability and cost of

      to successfully integrate acquisitions quickly and in a cost-effective

      manner and achieve anticipated profitability to maintain compliance with

      the Corporation's leverage ratio debt covenant; changes in tax laws, the

      interpretation of such laws and/or administrative practices that would

      increase the Corporation's tax rate; violation of the

      Corporation's debt covenant if price and/or volumes return to previous

      levels of instability; downward pressure on the Corporation's common

      stock price and its impact on goodwill impairment evaluations; reduction

            Gross margin as a percentage of net sales and operating margin as

            a percentage of net sales represent non-GAAP measures. The

            Corporation presents these ratios calculated based on net sales,

            as it is consistent with the basis by which management reviews the

            Corporation's operating results. Further, management believes it

            is consistent with the basis by which investors analyze the

            Corporation's operating results, given that freight and delivery

            revenues and costs represent pass-throughs and have no profit

            markup. Gross margin and operating margin calculated as

            percentages of total revenues represent the most directly

            comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with

            generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP").

          






            The following tables present the calculations of gross margin and

            operating margin for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014

            and 2013, in accordance with GAAP and reconciliations of the

            ratios as percentages of total revenues to percentages of net

            sales:

Martin Marietta to acquire Bluegrass Materials for $1.625 billion in cash
Building materials supplier Martin Marietta Materials Inc.  said Monday it has agreed to acquire Bluegrass Materials Co. for $1.625 billion in cash. Bluegrass is a privately held aggregates company with a portfolio of high-quality reserves, Martin Marietta said in a statement.

The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter and to boost earnings per share and free cash flow in its first year after closing.

Martin Marietta to acquire Bluegrass Materials for $1.625 billion in cash
Building materials supplier Martin Marietta Materials Inc.  said Monday it has agreed to acquire Bluegrass Materials Co. for $1.625 billion in cash. Bluegrass is a privately held aggregates company with a portfolio of high-quality reserves, Martin Marietta said in a statement. "As the leading aggregates producer in Maryland, Bluegrass will provide Martin Marietta with a strategic new growth platform within the southern portion of the Northeast Megaregion, serving the Baltimore, Frederick, Hagerstown and Maryland Eastern Shore metropolitan areas as well as Delaware," said the statement. The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter and to boost earnings per share and free cash flow in its first year after closing. Martin Marietta shares were not yet active premarket, but have gained 3% in 2017, while the S&P 500  has gained 9%.
