Rich Pharmaceuticals: Why This Illegal Spam Promotion Could Be Set To Drop - Rich Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (OTCMKTS:RCHA-OLD) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Rich Pharmaceuticals: Why This Illegal Spam Promotion Could Be Set To DropApr.11.14 | About: Rich Pharmaceuticals, (RCHA) Penny Stock Realist Short onlyPenny Stock RealistSummaryThere is illegal spam stock promotion being sent out.There are 300,000,000 free trading shares in insiders hands.They are even sending spam to government emails (not smart).Rich Pharmaceuticals, Inc.(OTCQB:RCHA) is a name that I believe is currently the target of an illegal spam penny-stock promotion scheme. It is my view that the stock's intrinsic value is somewhere near $0, and it is with conviction that I recommend that any investors currently in the name sell the entirety of their stakes immediately. Today's morning weakness could be a signal that the dump is near. I also believe that Rich Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a stock definitely worth shorting. My track record of identifying and publicly exposing such highly overvalued equities is excellent:
Company Background
Rich Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (RCHA) is a Biopharmaceutical Company developing a treatment for Acute Myelocytic Leukemia (AML)/white blood cell elevation and other blood related diseases. Rich Pharmaceuticals' goal is to extend refractory patients life expectancy and increase quality of life. Rich Pharmaceuticals' primary development stage product candidate which is known as PD-616 is being designed to treat blood and cancer related diseases through none evasive outpatient facilities. Find out more at richpharmaceuticals.com.
Little Revenue. Debts. No Business. Bright Future?
As is usually the case with these types of hyped up scams, it takes only one quick glance at the balance sheet to realize that the $142M market capitalization that this equity commands is beyond ludicrous. With no shot of any drugs being approved until 2016. That is expecting they pass all trials, which no one knows if they even will. It's my suspicion that the purpose of this company is not to succeed but to sell stock. The recent volume is due to overly bullish promotional spam.
Picture of $RCHAChart
You can see that trading in Rich Pharmaceuticals, Inc. started seeing really big increased volume on Apr 7, 2014. A simple twitter search and you can see multiple people reporting to have gotten spam on Sunday April 6th. Coincidence with the time of spam and increased volume in Rich Pharmaceuticals, Inc..? Absolutely not.


Spam Email


They are even sending spam to government emails (not smart). This raises the potential for a SEC halt.
Disclaimer
There is none. This is illegal
Reasoning for Spam
After going through all the filings you come to the conclusion that there are 300,024,000 free trading shares in anonymous shareholders hands. It is obvious that one or more of those shareholders has hired a spam group. Why would they do that? They did that because they are looking to cash out. You can't sell unless there are suckers to buy your free trading shares. As you can see the spam campaign has brought buyers. Insiders can dump their shares now. This will end ugly. You have been warned.
Recent SEC Halts
The SEC is finally cracking down on pump and dumps lately. Here is a list of big stock promotions that have been halted recently. I believe Rich Pharmaceuticals, Inc. has a chance to be next. My latest report on a illegal spam pump on Imogo Mobile Technologies Corp. was followed by an SEC halt. I believe the halt risk is very high for Rich Pharmaceuticals, Inc., especially with seeing tweets like this here. They are sending spam even to government employees (not smart). Stocks that get halted tend to reopen 2 weeks later down 70%+. My latest report on Imogo Mobile Technologies Corp was halted five trading days after my report was published. Makism 3D Corp. and Life Stem Genetics were two pumps that halted the day after my articles as well.


Imogo Mobile Technologies Corp. (OTCQB:IMTC) halted February 19, 2014.
Center Energy, Inc. (OTC:CNTO) halted February 11, 2014
Makism 3D Corp. (OTCQB:MDDD)halted December 13, 2013.

Guar Global Ltd.(GM:OTC:OTC:OTC:OTC:GGBL) halted December 6, 2013.

Neveda Gold Corp (GM:OTC:OTC:OTC:OTC:NVGC) halted November 27, 2013

Life Stem Genetics Inc (GM:) halted November 25, 2013

Sovereign Lithium (GM:OTC:OTC:OTC:OTC:SLCO) halted November 15, 2013

My Recommendation
If you own shares of this company, get out now. Do not hope that you can hang on to sell them to a greater fool. These shares are worthless. I have showed you that the reason for the promotional spam indicates that the individuals behind this stock scam are trying desperately to unload their worthless shares onto the unsuspecting public and book a huge profit before the inevitable collapse. If you are a more sophisticated investor and can get a borrow on these shares, then I believe that shorting this name will be highly lucrative for you. In this stage of the promotion with the stock halt risk it is not worth staying long overnight to make .05-.10 more in gains when there is a risk of 70% in losses. Spam promotions tend to do much worse then other promotions. If your interested in taking a look of some recent spam promotions take a look at $PRFC $IMTC $NVGC.

Facts about AML

Acute Myelocytic Leukemia (AML)

Acute myelocytic leukemia (AML), also known as acute myelogenous leukemia is the most common acute leukemia type that affects adults. Other names for AML that refer to the same disease are acute myeloid leukemia and acute myeloblastic leukemia. AML is sometimes referred to as acute myelo cancer, acute myelo leukemia and acute myeloid cancer.
What is Acute Myelocytic Leukemia (AML)?
AML is an aggressive form of cancer of the blood and the bone marrow, characterized by the rapid growth of abnormal white blood cells that accumulate in the bone marrow and interfere with the production of normal white blood cells. The myeloid blood stem cells of the bone marrow develop into abnormal, poorly formed myeloblasts and do not become healthy white blood cells.
The incidence of myeloblastic leukemia in the USA is of about 1 case in 100 000 persons per year during the first 20 years of life, with a later increase to around 20 cases in 100 000 persons per year for octogenarians. Myeloid leukemia progresses rapidly and can typically be fatal within weeks or months.
Acute Myelocytic Leukemia (AML) Symptoms
Most signs and symptoms of AML are caused by the decreased ability of the body to fight off infection due to the replacement of normal blood cells with leukemic cells.
The symptoms of myelogenous leukemia are generally vague and non-specific. All or some of the following symptoms may be experienced by the person affected:
• Lethargy, chronic fatigue
• Fever (usually of unknown origin)
• Shortness of breath
• Inexplicable weight loss
• Frequent infections
• Headaches
• Pale skin, skin rash
• Non-specific bone pain
• Easy bruising
• Unusual bleeding such as nose or gum bleeding
• Blood in urine or stools
• Enlarged lymph nodes and/or spleen
• Abdominal fullness
Other symptoms of myelo leukemia include anemia, tumors of leukemic cells in the lung, breast, brain, uterus, ovary, stomach or prostate.

BEVERLY HILLS, Calif., Feb. 10, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Rich Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (OTC Markets: RCHA) ("Rich Pharmaceuticals" or the "Company") today announced a 1-for-100 reverse split of its issued and outstanding shares of common stock effective at the opening of trading on Thursday, February 11, 2016. The Company's common stock will trade on a split-adjusted basis under new CUSIP number 76303T308 and temporary ticker symbol "RCHAD". After 20 trading days, the common stock will commence trading under the ticker symbol (RCHA). 
As a result of the stock split, every hundred shares of issued and outstanding Rich Pharmaceuticals' common stock will be converted into one share of common stock.  Proportional adjustments will be made to the Company's options, warrants and conversion terms in convertible notes.  Any fractional shares resulting from the reverse stock split will be rounded up to the next whole share.
"By completing this reverse stock split, we expect to gain broader access to the institutional investment community and to take one of the necessary steps toward listing on a major exchange.  This strengthened position is intended to provide the availability of common stock necessary to fund future transactions and clinical trials," said Ben Chang, CEO of Rich Pharmaceuticals. 
About Rich Pharmaceuticals:
Rich Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing innovative therapies in oncology, with initial concentration in treating AML, Hodgkin's Lymphoma and other blood related diseases.  Rich Pharmaceuticals' goal is to extend refractory patients life expectancy and increase quality of life.  Rich Pharmaceuticals' primary development stage product candidate, RP-323, is being designed to treat blood and cancer related diseases through non-evasive outpatient facilities.  RP-323 is a phorbol ester, which induces differentiation and/or apoptosis in multiple cell lines and primary cells, activates protein kinase C (PKC), and modulates the activity of multiple downstream cell signaling pathways, including mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways.  RP-323 induces PKC to produce NF kappa, which then produces NF kappa B that has the ability to regulate cellular responses by entering into the nucleus of cells.  NF kappa B binds to DNA and changes the nature of the cell and (1) induces differentiation; (2) induces proliferation; (3) cytokine induction; (4) and/or apoptosis.

Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements:
This news release contains "forward-looking statements" as that term is defined in Section 27(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

Actual results could differ from those projected in any forward-looking statements due to numerous factors. Such factors include, among others, the inherent uncertainties associated with developing new products or technologies and operating as a development stage company, our ability to raise the additional funding we will need to commence clinical trials and to continue to pursue our business and product development plans, our ability to develop and commercialize products based on our technology platform, competition in the industry in which we operate and market conditions. These forward-looking statements are made as of the date of this news release, and we assume no obligation to update the forward-looking statements, or to update the reasons why actual results could differ from those projected in the forward-looking statements.

Rich Pharmaceuticals.com Science and Technology TPA for treatment of AML

 


TPA for treatment of AML
Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) is an aggressive disease that generally warrants urgent and intensive therapy. The average patient age at AML diagnosis is 64 to 68 years and patients over the age of 60 treated with standard chemotherapy are cured of their disease less than 20 percent of the time. Patients who develop AML after an antecedent hematologic disorder or prior leukemogenic chemotherapy/radiation therapy have similarly poor outcomes as do patients whose disease is associated with specific cytogenetic and clinical features. Hence, most patients diagnosed with AML have patient and/or disease related features that are associated with a very poor prognosis. For patients with relapsed disease, no standard non-transplant therapy has demonstrated the capacity for cure. For these patients, AML is often a fatal disease. New approaches to therapy are needed.
TPA is an acronym for 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, a naturally occurring phorbol ester isolated from croton oil (Crotum tiglium)). TPA has been widely studied as a differentiating agent (1-20) a cytokine inducer (21-30). Phorbol esters activate protein kinase (pkc) and modulate the activity of multiple downstream cell signaling pathway (37-42).
The activity of TPA as a differentiating agent has been established by studies of HL-60 human promyelocytic cells and primary human leukemia cells obtained from patients. TPA induces a broad spectrum of biologic effects that provide a basis for suggesting that it may be useful in AML. At the cellular level, many of these effects may be mediated by protein kinase C. Protein kinase C is a family of phospholipid and calcium dependent isozymes that are activated by diacylglycerol. TPA appears to be able to activate protein kinase C in the absence of diacylglycerol. The targets of phosphorylation are incompletely defined but appear to result in the activation of several processes involved in cellular proliferation, differentiation, mitogenesis, neurotransmission and hormone secretion. Two well characterized transcription activation/repression pathways regulated by NF-kB and AP-1 transcription complexes appear to be regulated by protein kinase C (43-44).

    http://www.richpharmaceuticals.com/   http://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/RCHA/profile    RCHA Patent for Treatment of Hodgkin’s Lymphoma   http://www.richpharmaceuticals.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Rich-10_13_14-HL-Patent-Ownership-Rights.pdf  Under terms of the agreement, Rich Pharmaceuticals, Inc. will obtain complete ownership and all interest in the indication, patents and intellectual property related to treatment of Hodgkin’s Lymphoma, utility patent application number 61998397, entitled COMPOSITIONS AND METHODS OF USE OF PHORBOL ESTERS FOR THE TREATMENT OF HODGKIN’S LYMPHOMA.   Facts About Hodgkins Lymphoma Description of Hodgkins Lymphoma. Hodgkins Lymphoma is a cancer of the lymphatic system. Malignant Reed Sternberg cells invade and destroy the architecture of the lymph nodes and infiltrate major organs such as the liver and spleen in more advanced cases (Stages III and IV). Treatment options for Hodgkins Lymphoma are chemotherapy, radiotherapy or chemotherapy plus radiotherapy. More difficult cases may require high dose chemotherapy and stem cell transplant. In addition to the stage of the disease other factors such as age, general health and location of the disease are considered important in treatment decisions. In recent years PET/CT scans have been helpful in determining the extent of Hodgkins disease and assessing how well treatment is working. In some patients Hodgkins may never go away completely and regular treatments are required to control the disease while others experience relapses. Nowadays chemotherapy plus radiotherapy to involved areas is considered as standard treatment for patients with early stage Hodgkins Lymphoma (Stages I and II) and the incidence of survival in the U.S. after 5-years is about 90%. The 5-year survival rate for stage III patients is about 80% while it is 65% for stage IV patients. Due to long term adverse effects such as secondary malignancies causing both morbidity and mortality, the role of radiotherapy has been questioned and other means of treatment are being sought. Incidence of Hodgkins Lymphoma. This disease is a cancer that is found most frequently in two different age groups (15 to 35 and over 55) and occurs in both sexes although more common in males and individuals with HIV, and in the third decade of life.. The overall incidence of Hodgkins Lymphoma is 2.7 per 100,000 persons and in the U.S. 185,793 individuals were stricken with this disease in 2011. The worldwide estimate for treatment of Hodgkins Lymphoma is estimated to be $1 to 2 billion. The cause of Hodgkins Lymphoma is unknown but factors such as smoking and alcohol have been linked to this disease, and siblings of with parents with Hodgkins have an increased risk (2 to 5X) of developing this disease. The specific factors triggering the conversion of normal lymphocytes to Hodgkins Lymphoma cells is unknown. Facts about AML  Acute Myelocytic Leukemia (AML)  Acute myelocytic leukemia (AML), also known as acute myelogenous leukemia is the most common acute leukemia type that affects adults. Other names for AML that refer to the same disease are acute myeloid leukemia and acute myeloblastic leukemia. AML is sometimes referred to as acute myelo cancer, acute myelo leukemia and acute myeloid cancer. What is Acute Myelocytic Leukemia (AML)? AML is an aggressive form of cancer of the blood and the bone marrow, characterized by the rapid growth of abnormal white blood cells that accumulate in the bone marrow and interfere with the production of normal white blood cells. The myeloid blood stem cells of the bone marrow develop into abnormal, poorly formed myeloblasts and do not become healthy white blood cells. The incidence of myeloblastic leukemia in the USA is of about 1 case in 100 000 persons per year during the first 20 years of life, with a later increase to around 20 cases in 100 000 persons per year for octogenarians. Myeloid leukemia progresses rapidly and can typically be fatal within weeks or months. Acute Myelocytic Leukemia (AML) Symptoms Most signs and symptoms of AML are caused by the decreased ability of the body to fight off infection due to the replacement of normal blood cells with leukemic cells. The symptoms of myelogenous leukemia are generally vague and non-specific. All or some of the following symptoms may be experienced by the person affected: • Lethargy, chronic fatigue • Fever (usually of unknown origin) • Shortness of breath • Inexplicable weight loss • Frequent infections • Headaches • Pale skin, skin rash • Non-specific bone pain • Easy bruising • Unusual bleeding such as nose or gum bleeding • Blood in urine or stools • Enlarged lymph nodes and/or spleen • Abdominal fullness Other symptoms of myelo leukemia include anemia, tumors of leukemic cells in the lung, breast, brain, uterus, ovary, stomach or prostate.   RCHA Recent News       Rich Pharmaceuticals Announces Principal Doctor for Clinical Trials      June 21, 2017  Dr. Numbenjapon specializes in medical oncology, hematology, and stem cell transplantation. He has over 14 years of experience in Hematology and Oncology.  “We are confident that Dr. Numbenjapon is the best and most qualified physician to head our research abroad, and look forward to his guidance as we embark on the next phase of our clinical studies,” said Ben Chang, CEO.  Now that Rich Pharmaceuticals has filed an IND (https://youtu.be/0CCtXc43a0I) with the FDA and re- ceived approval to start phase I/II (https://youtu.be/1WvlzbzKGqE), operations have progressed to the site level at Phramongkutklao Hospital and a full package has been submitted to the hospitals IRB (Review Board). "Rich Pharmaceuticals is pleased to have reached such a milestone and we look forward to patient enrollment at Phramongkutklao Hospital with the help of Dr. Numbenjapon," stated Mr. Chang.         Rich Pharmaceuticals Announces Institutional Review Board Submission  June 8, 2017     Beverly Hills, California - Rich Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (OTCPK: RCHA) (“Rich” or the “Company”), a bio- pharmaceutical Company focused on developing and commercializing innovative therapies in oncology an- nounced today that has filed its submission package to the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of Phramongkutklao Hospital in Bangkok, Thailand.  The submission is part of a process that leads to a study for the treatment of Acute Myelocytic Leukemia (AML) in refractory patients in a Phase I/II trial. “We are happy we’ve reached this milestone and we look forward to communicating further developments on this effort and other clinical milestones over time,” said Ben Chang, CEO.  The Company IRB submission was completed on May 31, 2017. An IRB is a group that is formally desig- nated to review and monitor biomedical research involving human patients. This submission is an integral to the Clinical Trial and drug approval process.       Rich Pharmaceuticals Announces Clinical Site in Thailand  May 31, 2017      Beverly Hills, California - Rich Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (OTCPK: RCHA) (“Rich” or the “Company”), a bio- pharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing innovative therapies in oncology an- nounced today that it has selected a site and obtained investigator’s interest at Phramongkutklao Hospital in Bangkok, Thailand. Rich has engaged CMIC ASIA-PACIFIC, PTE. LTD. (“CMIC”) to assist in this project and they have already completed a site selection visit at Phramongkutklao Hospital, and the site has been cleared.  Rich and CMIC are preparing submission packages for the Hospital’s Internal Review Board (IRB) and the Thailand Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This package is near completion and the Company plans to submit it shortly. “The Company has purchased product liability insurance, the package is near completion and we hope to submit in the coming days,” said Ben Chang, CEO.       In cooperation with the Hospital, Rich is seeking to conduct a study for the treatment of Acute Myelocytic Leukemia (AML) in refractory patients in a Phase I/II trial. Acute Myelocytic Leukemia is a cancer of the myeloid line of blood cells, characterized by the rapid growth of abnormal white blood cells that build up in the bone marrow and interfere with the production of normal blood cells. AML is the most common acute leukemia affecting adults, and its incidence increases with age. Because the incidence increases with age, it is expected that incidence will rise as population rises.     Our Science Rich Pharmaceuticals currently is focused on the clinical development of the chemical molecule TPA (12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate) for the treatment of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). The Company has technical evidence to suggest that it may also be useful to treat other important diseases resulting in it being a widely used drug with major market potential. TPA TPA is a naturally occurring molecule that is isolated and purified from croton oil which is obtained from the seeds of Croton tiglium, a leafy shrub native to Southeast Asia. While this has been the major source of TPA for clinical studies conducted by Rich Company scientists recently devised a synthetic route for preparation of the drug which will ensure providing the necessary supply of highly pure drug for clinical use. TPA has characteristics that are unique to this chemical class including a potent ability to accelerate differentiation of the myeloid cell lines, HL-60 and THP-1, as well as mononuclear phagocytes from bone marrow and peripheral blood. The best characterized receptor for TPA is protein kinase C (PKC) which, once activated, induces substrate phosphorylation that propagates signals to the MAPK cascades. The effects of TPA on MAPK pathways may be particularly relevant to the differentiating and pro-apoptotic effects of TPA in certain cells. The capacity of TPA to activate PKC and to induce phenotypic changes characteristic of differentiation and/or apoptosis led investigators to study its effect in AML. What Justifies the Use of TPA to Treat AML? Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) is an aggressive disease that requires urgent and intensive therapy. Patients diagnosed with AML are, on average, between 64 and 68 years of age. Patients over 60 treated with standard chemotherapy are cured of their disease less that 20 percent of the time. In addition, patients who develop AML after an antecedent hematologic disorder or prior leukemogenic chemotherapy/radiation have similarly poor outcomes as do patients whose disease is associated with specific cytogenetic and clinical features. Most patients diagnosed with AML have a poor prognosis. For patients with relapsed disease, no standard non-transplant therapy has demonstrated the capacity for cure and AML is often fatal. In view of the above facts, it is obvious that new approaches to therapy are needed. The clinical studies completed and those currently in progress with TPA report feasibility and potential efficacy of this drug in patients with relapsed/refractory myeloid malignancies.          WuXi PharmaTech, Inc. trades on the NYSE in the area of $40.00 per share under the ticker of WX with a $2.8 Billion Market Cap:  http://finance.yahoo.com/q/ks?s=WX+Key+Statistics http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=wx&ql=1 http://www.wuxiapptec.com/    "We believe RP-323 has best-in-class potential and holds significant promise for patients suffering from AML and MDS," said Ben Chang, Rich Pharmaceuticals' Chief Executive Officer.  Mr. Chang further stated, "We are especially excited to have a partner in the manufacture of RP-323 of the high caliber of Wuxi Apptec.  We expect to pursue the approval of the IND promptly and to be in clinical studies in the very near term." Courtesy of Sibware:  http://investorshub.advfn.com/boards/read_msg.aspx?message_id=110569310    RCHA RP-323:Potential Market=$1 to 2 Billion/Year US.$5 Billion Worldwide.   Business Overview   The Company is developing RP-323 (formerly called PD-616) for the treatment of Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML), and to cause elevation of white blood cells (WBC) in patients depleted of these elements due to various conditions.   Clinical Studies in Acute Myelocytic Leukemia   Based on the known properties of RP-323, it was first administered in a pilot study in China, either alone or in combination with standard drugs and caused temporary remission of AML in some patients’ refractory to standard therapy. Several patients recovered sufficiently with RP-323 treatment to return to their normal occupations, symptom-free.  Interest in these findings led to a Phase I investigator-sponsored trial in 35 patients by a leading oncologist at a leading cancer hospital in New Jersey, the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey (UMDNJ).   Market Opportunities   AML   It is estimated that 40,000 people in the US have AML and an additional 14,000 are diagnosed annually with a yearly death rate of over 10,000. Based on this incidence,the potential market for RP-323 for the treatment of AML is approximately $1 to 2 billion peak sales annually in the US and more than $5 billion worldwide.   RCHA Key DD Posts:    Key RCHA & WX:NYSE Relationship http://investorshub.advfn.com/boards/read_msg.aspx?message_id=110555124   Respectfully, again, key with the Authorized Shares http://investorshub.advfn.com/boards/read_msg.aspx?message_id=110551465   RCHA NEWS    http://finance.yahoo.com/q/h?s=RCHA+Headlines http://www.richpharmaceuticals.com/category/news/   RCHA SEC FILINGS https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?action=getcompany&CIK=0001504389&owner=exclude&count=40   http://www.richpharmaceuticals.com/contact-us/  Contact Us 9595 Wilshire Boulevard, Ste. 900 Beverly Hills, CA 90045 P: 424.230.7001 F: 424.230.7003 E: info@richpharmaceuticals.com       Chart View
