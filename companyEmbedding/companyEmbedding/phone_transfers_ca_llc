How to Transfer Ownership of an LLC

How to Transfer Ownership of an LLC
by Jane Haskins, Esq., September 2014





Many limited liability companies have a change in ownership at some point during the life of the business.
Ownership changes happen for a variety of reasons, including:
A member decides to leave the company
The existing members want to bring in a new member
A member dies, becomes disabled or divorces
You decide sell the entire business
The procedure to transfer LLC ownership depends on whether you’re transferring the whole business or only changing the names and percentage ownerships of the members—such as when you take on a new member or buy out a departing member.
Transferring a Partial Interest in the LLC
Your LLC’s owners are called members. Each member owns a percentage of the business, which is known as a membership interest. If you want to change the percentage of ownership or add new members, you will need to transfer some of your LLC’s membership interests.
They key document that will guide you in how to transfer ownership in an LLC is your LLC operating agreement.
You most likely signed an operating agreement when you set up your LLC. The operating agreement is a contract among the LLC’s members that specifies the way the LLC will operate. If it includes buy-sell or buyout provisions, those will govern the way you transfer ownership. Alternatively, your LLC may have a separate buy-sell agreement.
The buy-sell provisions will typically specify a method for placing a value on the business and its membership interests. They also might place restrictions on who becomes a member, require the LLC to buy back shares from a departing member, or specify what needs to be done to approve a transfer.
If your operating agreement does not include a buy-sell agreement, you should check your state statutes for guidance on how to transfer membership interests. You may be able to negotiate a buy-sell agreement or a written agreement to transfer ownership. In some states, you may have to dissolve the company if your operating agreement does not provide for ownership transfers. Since these actions can have long-term consequences for your business, it’s wise to consult with a lawyer.
This is also a good time to review your operating agreement and make sure it is relevant and meets your needs now that your membership is changing. For example, an operating agreement for a single-member LLC may be missing some provisions that are needed for a multi-member LLC.
If your old operating agreement seems inadequate, you should prepare and sign a new one that reflects the new ownership structure. If you don’t need a new agreement, you can prepare an amendment that lists the new members.
You typically don’t need to file anything with the state to finalize the ownership transfer, but you’ll want to list the current members as part of any annual reports you make to the state.
Selling an LLC
Despite its name, a buy-sell agreement doesn’t offer guidance on how to sell your entire business to a third party—it only governs the way the members will transfer their membership interests among themselves and new members.
To sell an LLC, you need to find a buyer and agree on a price. This may involve using the services of a business valuation expert, having the buyer examine your business’s books and records, or a combination of the two. A buyer may want to purchase the entire LLC or may only want to purchase its assets.
Selling an LLC can have complex financial, legal and tax implications, so it’s best to consult a lawyer who has experience with buying and selling LLCs.
The terms of the sale may initially be memorialized in a term sheet or memorandum of understanding, followed by a more formal contract.
It’s always best to plan ahead for LLC ownership transfers by including buy-sell provisions in your operating agreement. Buy-sell provisions can help a transfer go smoothly and avoid disruptions to your business. If you don’t have a buy-sell agreement, or if you want to sell your entire business, you may need to seek legal advice.
For questions or advice on transferring ownership of an LLC, you can talk to a lawyer through the LegalZoom business legal plan.

Skip to main content







In addition to certain guarantees provided by law, LegalZoom guarantees your satisfaction with our services and support. Because our company was created by experienced attorneys, we strive to be the best legal document service on the web. If you are not satisfied with our services, please contact us immediately and we will correct the situation, provide a refund or offer credit that can be used for future LegalZoom orders.
LegalZoom Satisfaction Guarantee Details:

If you're not satisfied, simply call us toll-free at (800) 773-0888 during our normal business hours. All requests made under this guarantee must be made within 60 days of purchase. We will process your request within 5 business days after we've received all of the documents and materials sent to you. Unfortunately, we can't refund or credit any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order. We also cannot refund any money paid by you directly to third parties, such as payments made by you directly to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products.
If you want to exchange the product you ordered for a different one, you must request this exchange and complete your replacement order within 60 days of purchase. The purchase price of the original item, less any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order, will be credited to your LegalZoom account. Any payments made directly by you to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products are not eligible for exchange or credit. Any price difference between the original order and the replacement order or, if a replacement order is not completed within 60 days of purchase, the full original purchase price (in each case less any money paid to government entities or other third parties) will be credited to the original form of payment. If you paid for your original order by check, LegalZoom will mail a check for the applicable amount to your billing address.
Please note that we cannot guarantee the results or outcome of your particular procedure. For instance, the government may reject a trademark application for legal reasons beyond the scope of LegalZoom's service. In some cases, a government backlog can lead to long delays before your process is complete. Similarly, LegalZoom does not guarantee the results or outcomes of the services rendered by our legal plan attorneys or attorney-assisted products. Problems like these are beyond our control and are not covered by this guarantee.
Since we're dedicating time and effort to your legal document preparation, our guarantee only covers satisfaction issues caused by LegalZoom - not changes to your situation or your state of mind.

Products
The material handling industry utilizes ball transfers in their material conveying machinery. The advantage of these units over the common skate wheel or belt conveyor system is their ability to move in all directions. This feature makes them ideal for assembly lines that require product to make turns in the course of handling. They are also especially well suited for use at work stations, where they facilitate the rotation of heavy material in any direction. This eliminates the need for workers to lift or slide product to complete assembly work, providing equal access to all sides.
 
Today, Ball Transfer Systems, LLC manufactures over sixty different styles of ball transfers to meet the diverse needs of the material handling industry. Most units are constructed of carbon steel support cups holding approximately 80 1/8" carbon steel balls. On top of this base, a carbon steel retainer and 1" ball are placed then covered with either a simple cover or a flange-designed cover. For units requiring a mounting stud, the simple covered units are pressed into a stud cup with the appropriate size bolt protruding from the bottom. Variations to this configuration include larger main balls of 1 7/8" diameter, smaller main balls of 1/2" and 1" diameter, units made entirely of stainless steel, and customized bolt sizes based on customers' requests.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

Limited Liability Company (LLC)

An LLC is a hybrid business entity that blends elements of partnership and corporate structures. The LLC’s main advantage over a partnership is that, like the owners (shareholders) of a civil law corporation, the liability of the owners (members) of an LLC for debts and obligations of the LLC is limited to their financial investment. However, like a general partnership, members of an LLC have the right to participate in management of the LLC, and profit or losses flow through to its members. Certain  types of businesses that provide professional services requiring a state  professional license, such as legal or medical may not form an LLC. For California income tax purposes, an LLC will be classified as a partnership if it has more than one owner and will be treated as a disregarded entity if it has only one member. However, an LLC is allowed to elect to be treated (taxed) as a corporation. To be taxed as a corporation, the LLC files an election on Federal Form 8832, Entity Classification Election, with the Internal Revenue Service. California conforms to the federal entity classification regulations commonly known as "check-the-box regulations" that allow an LLC to elect to be taxed as a corporation.

Key Features

An LLC is a hybrid business entity that can be treated as a partnership, but it has the limited liability protection under civil law.  
An LLC is formed by filing "articles of organization" with the California Secretary of State prior to conducting business. An out-of-state LLC that conducts business in California should register with the Secretary of State.  
Forming an LLC is simpler and faster than forming and maintaining a civil law corporation.
Either before or after filing its articles of organization, the LLC members must enter into a verbal or written operating agreement. A formal, written agreement is advisable.
 Its  members typically manage an LLC, unless the members agree to have a manager handle the LLC’s business affairs.
An LLC may have one or more owners, and may have different classes of owners. In addition, an LLC may be owned by any combination of individuals or business entities. 
If the LLC has more than one owner, it will be treated as a partnership (subject to Subchapter K), unless it elected to be treated as a corporation. The items of income, deductions, and credits flow through from the LLC to each member’s California Schedule K-1, Members’ Share of Income, Deductions, Credits, etc., and distributive shares of property, payroll, and sales. Each member is responsible for paying taxes on their distributive share. If the LLC has a single member, it will be treated as a disregarded entity, and it will be treated as a sole proprietorship or a division of its owner, unless it elects to be taxable as a corporation.
A husband and wife owning an LLC may elect to be treated as a partnership or a disregarded entity. 
If the LLC elected to be taxed as a corporation, it is subject to corporation tax law and filing requirements. 
In general, all the owners (members) are shielded from individual liability for debts and obligations of the LLC.
LLCs do not issue stock and are not required to hold annual meetings or keep written minutes, which a corporation must do in order to preserve the liability shield for its owners.  
Either before or after filing its articles of organization, the LLC members must enter into a verbal or written operating agreement. A formal, written agreement is advisable. Its members typically manage an LLC, unless the members agree to have a manager handle the LLC’s business affairs.
Generally, members of an LLC that are taxed as a partnership may agree to share the profits and losses in any manner in compliance with Subchapter K. Members of an LLC classified as a corporation receive profits and losses in the same manner as shareholders of a corporation legally organized as such.
An LLC’s life is perpetual in nature. However, the members may agree to a date or event of termination.
LLC do not pay income tax but they are subject to the $800 annual tax and a fee. Refer to Filing Guidelines for more information.

Filing Guidelines
Return Due Date Change
For  tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, partnerships, LLCs  treated as partnerships, and Single Member Limited Liability Companies (SMLLC) owned by pass-through entities (S  corporations, partnerships, and LLCs treated as partnerships), the return due  date is the 15th day of the third month after the close of the tax year. For  all other SMLLCs, the return due date is the 15th day of the fourth month after  the close of the tax year. 
LLCs Treated As Partnerships 

All LLCs (not classified as a corporation) that are doing business in California, or file an article of organization or certificate of registration with the Secretary of State must file Form 568, Limited Liability Company Return of Income, pay the annual minimum franchise tax of $800, and LLC fee (if applicable).  
LLCs that have to file in California to report California source income but are not subject to the minimum franchise tax of $800 and the LLC fee (refer to above rules), must file Form 565, Partnership Return of Income, instead of Form 568, Limited Liability Company Return of Income.  
An LLC treated as a partnership provides each member with a California Schedule K-1 that states the member’s distributive share of the LLC’s items of income, deductions, credits, property, payroll and sales. 
An LLC treated as a partnership files FTB 3832, Limited Liability Company Nonresident Members’ Consent, with Form 568. FTB 3832 is signed by the nonresident individuals and foreign entity members to show their consent to California’s jurisdiction to tax their distributive share of income attributable to California source. The LLC must complete Schedule T and pay the tax for every nonresident member who did not sign a FTB 3832. 

LLCs Treated As Disregarded Entities 

If an individual wholly owns an LLC, it will be treated as a disregarded entity unless it elects to be treated as a corporation and all income and expenses of the LLC will be reported on the member’s tax return as a sole proprietorship, i.e. Schedule C business. 
If a corporation or other business entity wholly  owns an LLC,  it will be treated as a disregarded entity and all income and expenses of the LLC will be reported on the member’s tax return as a division of the company. 
All LLCs treated as disregarded entities are required to file Form 568, Side 1, Side 2, Side 6 (Schedule IW), and pay the annual tax and LLC fee (if applicable). If its only member is a nonresident and has not signed the Single Member LLC Information and Consent on bottom of Form 568 Side 1, consenting to California’s jurisdiction, then the LLC is required to complete Schedule T and pay the tax on behalf of its single owner. 
A Single Member LLC treated as a disregarded entity may also be required to file Schedule B and Schedule K if either of the following two items below are met:
					
The income or loss amount reported on Schedule B, line 1 or line 3 through line 11, is $3 million or more. 
The total distributive income/payment items on Schedule K, line 21a, is greater than or equal to $3 million or less than or equal to $-3 million.   



LLCs as Partnerships or Disregarded Entities

California Form 568 or 565 must be filed by the 15th day of the 3rd month after the close of the LLC’s taxable year.
The annual tax is due by the 15th day of the 4th month of the taxable year, and is paid using Form 3522, Limited Liability Company Tax Voucher.
The LLC must pay a fee if the California total income is equal to or greater than $250,000. The LLC must estimate the fee it will owe for the year and make an estimated fee payment. Refer to Estimated Payments below. Select the link on the last bullet for information on fee  amounts and how total income is determined.
All LLCs treated as partnerships and disregarded entities must complete Schedule EO, Pass-Through Entity Ownership (568), to report any ownership interest in other partnerships or limited liability companies regardless of whether these entities are required to file a tax return in California, or are subject to California annual tax or LLC fee. 
An LLC treated as a partnership, doing business or deriving income from within and outside of California will use Schedule R to determine their California source income.
To determine if you are doing business in California and/or if your members are also considered doing business in California, refer to Doing Business Rules in California. 
More filing information for LLCs.

LLCs as Corporations 

All LLCs classified as corporations that organize, register, or doing business in California, or receive California source income must file Form 100, Corporation Franchise or Income Tax Return, or Form 100S, S Corporation Franchise or Income Tax Return.
The Form 100 or Form 100S must be filed by the 15th day of the 3rd month after the close of the LLC’s taxable year. The LLC classified as a corporation is taxed at the corporation rate, and it is not subject to the fee or filing of the Schedule K-1, Schedule T, Schedule EO either. Also, follow C Corporation Filing Guidelines or S Corporation Filing Guidelines.

Estimated Payments 
If the limited liability company is classified as a partnership or disregarded entity and files Form 568, the following estimated tax guidelines apply:

Estimated LLC fee is due by the 15th day of the 6th month of the taxable year. LLC should use form FTB 3536, Estimated Fee for LLCs, to remit the estimated fee payment.
Members may have to make estimated tax payments for their own reporting purposes.
The LLC treated as a partnership may be required to withhold taxes if the partnership distributes California source taxable income to a nonresident member. For more information about partnership withholding, refer to FTB 1017, Resident and Nonresident Withholding Guidelines.

If the Limited Liability Company is classified as a corporation and files Form 100 or Form 100S, the following estimated tax guidelines apply.

The estimated tax is payable in four installments.
For calendar tax years, installments are due and payable on April 15, June 15, September 15, and December 15. For fiscal tax years, refer to When are my corporation’s estimate payments due?
Corporations complete Form 100-ES to report their estimated taxes.
Additionally, members may have to make estimated tax payments for their own reporting purposes.

Withholding on California Source Income 

An LLC is considered a withholding agent if they control, receive, have custody of, dispose of, or pay California source income. Get Small Business Withholding ToolPDF version. 
A withholding agent is required to withhold from all payments or distributions of California source income made to a nonresident payee unless the withholding agent receives authorization from us for a waiver or a reduced withholding amount. Withholding is optional, at the discretion of the withholding agent, on the first $1500 in payments made during the calendar year.
If a LLC is required to withhold and remit backup withholding to the Internal Revenue Service, they also are required to withhold and remit to Franchise Tax Board, except for instances that are specifically excluded for California purposes. 
The LLC may be required to withhold taxes if the LLC distributes California source taxable income to a nonresident member. For more information about withholding, refer to FTB 1017, Resident and Nonresident Withholding Guidelines.
