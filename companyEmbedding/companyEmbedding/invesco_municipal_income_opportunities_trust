Invesco Municipal Income Opportunities Trust

Rai Favela |
Viernes, Julio 28, 2017







Invesco California Value Municipal Income Trust (NYSE:VCV) institutional sentiment increased to 3.71 in 2016 Q4.Parabolic SAR (or PSAR) is a simple, compact indicator that can provide some useful information when taking into account additional trends and factors. Using the CCI as a leading indicator, technical analysts may use a +100 reading as an overbought signal and a -100 reading as an oversold indicator, suggesting a trend reversal. The ADX is typically used in conjunction with the Plus Directional Indicator (+DI) and Minus Directional Indicator (-DI) to help spot trend direction as well as trend strength. The stock's 50-day moving average is $7.85 and its 200 day moving average is $7.70. The 50 day moving average moved up $0.05 whereas the 200 day moving average was up $0.22 or +2.8347%. The stock had a trading volume of 91,945 shares.
SAR stands for stop and reverse and it is a trend following indicator, created to identify the turning point in price action. The moving average can be used as a reference point to assist with the discovery of buying and selling opportunities.Invesco Van Kampen California Value Municipal Income Trust, formerly Invesco California Value Municipal Income Trust, is a diversified, closed-end management investment trust. A reading from -80 to -100 would indicate an oversold situation. Presently, Yanlord Land Group Ltd (Z25.SI)'s Williams Percent Range or 14 day Williams %R is resting at -42.86. An oscillator is an indicator that is used as a counter trend showing when the market is overbought or oversold. Invesco Municipal Income Opportunities Trust was formed on September 19, 1988 and is domiciled in the United States. Active investors may choose to use this technical indicator as a stock evaluation tool. A value of 25-50 would indicate a strong trend.One of the basic tenets put forth by Charles Dow in the Dow Theory is that security prices do trend. Many technical analysts believe that an ADX value over 25 would suggest a strong trend. Accern also assigned press coverage about the investment management company an impact score of 0 out of 100, indicating that recent media coverage is extremely unlikely to have an impact on the stock's share price in the near term. This represents a $0.76 dividend on an annualized basis and a yield of 5.64%. The Williams %R oscillates in a range from 0 to -100. The goal is to analyze the current trend using trendlines and then either invest with the current trend until the trendline is broken, or wait for the trendline to be broken and then invest with the new (opposite) trend.Another technical indicator that may be a powerful resource for determining trend strength is the Average Directional Index or ADX. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a highly popular momentum indicator used for technical analysis. The RSI oscillates on a scale from 0 to 100. A reading over 70 would indicate that the stock is overbought, and possibly overvalued.

 Risk & Other Considerations
			 


				Fund characteristics are subject to change daily. Provided for informational purposes only and should not be deemed as a recommendation to buy or sell the securities mentioned or securities in the sectors shown above. Credit quality and credit allocation are shown as a percentage of total net assets. Sectors are shown as a percentage of long-term investments. Securities are classified by sectors that represent broad groupings of related industries. Credit quality allocations based upon ratings as issued by Standard and Poor's and Moody's, respectively.

This data is provided for informational purposes only and is not intended for trading or selling purposes. Closed end funds, unlike open end funds, are not continuously offered. There is a one time public offering and once issued, shares of closed end funds are sold in the open market.

There is no assurance that a closed end fund will achieve its investment objective. Like any stock, a closed end fund's share price will fluctuate with market conditions and other factors. At the time of sale, your shares may have a market price that is above or below net asset value, and may be worth more or less than your original investment. Accordingly, it is possible to lose money investing in the Trust.

These funds are subject to credit and interest-rate risk. Credit risk refers to the ability of an issuer to make timely payments of interest and principal. Investments in securities rated below investment grade present greater risk of loss to principal and interest than investment in higher-quality securities. Interest-rate risk refers to fluctuations in the value of a fixed-income security resulting from changes in the general level of interest rates. In a declining interest-rate environment, the portfolio may generate less income. In a rising interest-rate environment, bond prices fall. Should the funds employ leverage, the portfolios may experience increased volatility.

				Fund characteristics are subject to change daily. Provided for informational purposes only and should not be deemed as a recommendation to buy or sell the securities mentioned or securities in the sectors shown above. Credit quality and credit allocation are shown as a percentage of total net assets. Sectors are shown as a percentage of long-term investments. Securities are classified by sectors that represent broad groupings of related industries. Credit quality allocations based upon ratings as issued by Standard and Poor's and Moody's, respectively.

This data is provided for informational purposes only and is not intended for trading or selling purposes. Closed end funds, unlike open end funds, are not continuously offered. There is a one time public offering and once issued, shares of closed end funds are sold in the open market.

There is no assurance that a closed end fund will achieve its investment objective. Like any stock, a closed end fund's share price will fluctuate with market conditions and other factors. At the time of sale, your shares may have a market price that is above or below net asset value, and may be worth more or less than your original investment. Accordingly, it is possible to lose money investing in the Trust.

These funds are subject to credit and interest-rate risk. Credit risk refers to the ability of an issuer to make timely payments of interest and principal. Investments in securities rated below investment grade present greater risk of loss to principal and interest than investment in higher-quality securities. Interest-rate risk refers to fluctuations in the value of a fixed-income security resulting from changes in the general level of interest rates. In a declining interest-rate environment, the portfolio may generate less income. In a rising interest-rate environment, bond prices fall. Should the funds employ leverage, the portfolios may experience increased volatility.
