Black Hills Gold
Homestake Mine

 Black Hills Gold Today’s gold prices are a reflection of the costs associated with meeting the world’s demand for gold from increasingly lower grade deposits at the improbable extents of the planet. The trend of the industry to explore higher in the mountains, deeper into the jungle and into some of the most politically unstable regions of the world has undoubtedly increased the complexity of business risks, which cannot be simply managed by good operators. Industry publications today are well documenting technically successful programs that have run aground in environments of social unrest, uncertain tax and royalty structures and changing regulation. Good projects in difficult locals ultimately face difficulty attracting capital or partners necessary to continued project development and production.
Dakota Territory believes that opportunity is being created by today’s metal prices in much the same way that favorable prices and the application of modern technologies in the 1980′s generated a renaissance of exploration and mining activity in the historic districts of the United States by capitalizing on known mineral resources that had been previously uneconomic.
The Black Hills of South Dakota has yielded approximately 44.6 million ounces of gold over 136-years of continuous mine production, with the gold output of the Black Hills concentrated in a 100 square mile area known as the Homestake District. Large districts are the physical evidence of extensive gold systems, often with the potential to repeat in proximity. Despite the evolution of technology over the past century, exploration for gold today is largely the same business it has always been, in that the search is most commonly restricted to the places where the metal has first been discovered at surface. Without a gold showing on surface, there generally has not been a concerted effort to search for gold under the cover of overlying strata, even in the districts where the evidence for hidden deposits supports the case for it.
Exploration for gold deposits under cover can be a difficult proposition requiring extraordinary technical expertise and the substantial investment of up-front capital to narrow the possibilities and focus the search. Dakota Territory Resource Corp. is uniquely positioned by the experience of its management to leverage Homestake Mining Company’s 70 million dollar investment in the Black Hills during the 1980′s and 1990′s, beginning and focused at the point where the previous work left off.
The Black Hills of South Dakota is a safe low cost jurisdiction known for its rich mining heritage and culture based on generations of mines and miners. South Dakotan’s understand mining and are proud of the historically significant role that gold has played in local, state and regional economies. Regulatory authorities have consistently demonstrated a willingness to work with responsible operators to permit well-planned compliant projects and South Dakota’s exploration and mining regulations are reasonable and comparable to other jurisdictions within the United States and the throughout the world.
Dakota Territory Resource Corp. understands the risks inherent to minerals exploration and believes that opportunity and value are created for its shareholders through both the technical merits of its projects and through the reduction of business risks associated with the location of its properties.

 Blind Gold PropertyThe Blind Gold Property is Dakota Territory’s flagship property and is a target for both Tertiary-aged and Iron-formation gold mineralization.  The Blind Gold Property is located approximately 4 miles northwest and on structural trend with the Homestake Gold Mine that, having produced approximately 40 million ounces of gold over its 125-year mine-life, is historically the largest iron-formation-hosted gold deposit in the world.
> Technical Report – Blind Gold Project June 2013
In the 1980′s, Homestake Mining Company undertook a $70 million exploration program managed by Richard Bachman, president and chief executive officer of Dakota Territory that was focused primarily on the search for a repeat of the Homestake Mine.  For the first time, this program successfully demonstrated the repeatability of Homestake iron-formation hosted gold deposits within a structural corridor extending northwest of the mine.  Significant new gold mineralization was discovered by surface drilling approximately one mile down plunge from the surface expression of the Maitland fold structure at a depth of approximately 6,600 feet below surface.  To provide access for underground exploration, development and mining, Homestake undertook the excavation of a three mile long tunnel from the mine’s 6800 ft level called the “North Drift”.  As the North Drift was being advanced from the mine, two surface core holes identified the next in the series of repeating fold structures to the north called the “False Bottom” fold structure, with classic arsenopyrite-chlorite-gold mineralization intersected below the Maitland Mine Area at a depth of approximately 5600 feet below the surface. The up-plunge projection of this mineralization extends to Dakota Territory’s Blind Gold Property under the cover of approximately 400 feet of the younger Paleozoic Sedimentary & Tertiary Intrusive rocks.

In addition to the exploration potential for gold hosted in Homestake iron-formation, the Blind Gold Property is also located just north of the Maitland Mine. The Maitland Mine produced both gold and silver from a Tertiary-age replacement deposit typical of the District, with mineralization hosted in the Cambrian Deadwood formation.  The Deadwood formation was the preferred host for tertiary-age gold mineralization in the district and the Maitland Mine was the last in the string of nine mines that produced ores from the Deadwood formation host along a well defined structural trend. The Maitland Mine is located at the point where the Deadwood formation disappears under the cover of the Paha Sapa Limestone, which also hosts gold deposits within the District but to a lesser degree.

After Heidt, 1977 & Bachman, 1992 Spokane SME

The formation of Tertiary-aged gold-silver replacement deposits is generally dependent on fault and fracture structures necessary to the transportation of mineralizing fluids and proximity to the preferential intrusive bodies, both of which are present at the Blind Gold Property. Tertiary-age gold mineralization is evidenced across the property by numerous mapped prospect workings dating from the turn of the century in the Paha Sapa Limestone, Phonolite intrusive and Deadwood formation where it outcrops at the southwest corner of the property.  The Blind Gold Property is a high caliber exploration target for the on-trend continuation of Tertiary aged gold-silver replacement deposits in the preferred Deadwood formation host under the cover of the Paha Sapa limestone.
Dakota Territory’s exploration focus is on the search for a repeat of a Homestake Iron-formation gold deposit on the Blind Gold Property, primarily because of the size and grade potential of a deposit of this type and resulting economic opportunity associated with such a discovery.  While exploration for other gold deposit types is a secondary priority, the exploration program will be opportunistic as each hole drilled through the overlying cover rock holds additional potential for the discovery of Tertiary-aged gold-silver replacement deposits.

 City Creek PropertyThe City Creek Property is a target for Homestake iron-formation gold mineralization and is comprised of twenty-one unpatented lode mining claims located one mile northeast of the Homestake Open Cut and one mile northwest of the City of Deadwood. 

The Homestake iron-formation is the exclusive host for gold mineralization at the Homestake Mine, that having produced approximately 40 million ounces of gold over its 125-year mine-life, is historically the largest iron-formation-hosted gold deposit in the world. City Creek geology is dominated by rocks of the Homestake stratigraphic sequence, including the Ellison, Homestake and Poorman formations that outcrop across the property. The Homestake iron-formation outcrop on the City Creek property is complexly folded and represents the extension of Homestake iron-formation northeast from Caledonia and Main Ledge ore bodies at the Homestake Gold Mine. The Main Ledge and Caledonia ore bodies outcropped within a relatively small window on surface, yet accounted for more than 21 million ounces of gold production over the life of the Homestake Mine.  
Numerous gold prospect pits and shallow underground workings in quartz-veined Homestake formation have been located and mapped at City Creek and the stratigraphy at the property has also been mapped by both Homestake and USGS geologists over the years. The City Creek Property was drilled by Homestake Mining Company in the 1970’s and 1980’s, which produced intersections of weak gold mineralization in the Homestake iron-formation in the classic quartz vein, chlorite-arsenopyrite mineralization style of the Homestake Mine. The historic Homestake drilling was widely spaced and did not systematically test the northeast extension of the Homestake iron-formation away from the Homestake Mine and under Dakota Territory’s City Creek Property.

An airborne magnetic, electromagnetic (EM), and gravity geophysical survey is planned and scheduled for the 2013 summer field season. The survey will cover all of Dakota Territory’s properties and will be utilized to screen and refine drill targets including Homestake iron-formation, Homestake Paleoplacer, and Tertiary-age replacement gold mineralization.

Dakota Territory Resource Corp

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Homestake Gold Mine 1877


Dakota Territory Resource Corp, a Reno, Nevada corporation, is a publicly traded gold development company owning land in the historic Homestake District of the northern Black Hills of South Dakota, an area that once produced the second largest amount of gold in U.S. history. Otherwise known as the Homestake Mine or the Homestake Deposit, the 100-square-mile area yielded approximately 44 million ounces of gold in its 136-year-history, placing it second in U.S. gold production only to the Carlin District of northeast Nevada,[1] and ranking it the largest iron-formation-hosted gold deposit in the world.[2][3]
During the 1980s and 1990s, Richard Bachman, geologist and now president and director of Dakota Territory Resource Corp, managed a team for Homestake Mining Company that was successful in uncovering and expanding new significant gold mineralization areas.[4] While the mining at the Homestake Mine halted in 2002 due to low gold prices and high mining expenses, from 2011-2014, Dakota Territory Resource Corp acquired crucial sample data as well as mineral acres, broadening its property position in the Homestake District in efforts to restart a gold revitalization there similar to what was done two to three decades earlier. In a venture to continue exploration and development of this precious metals site, today Dakota Territory Resource Corp attempts to breathe new life into this once-profitable gold mining area. They cite a commitment to exploration of gold with sustainable practices.[5]
The total mineral area Dakota Territory Resource Corp owns covers 3,057 acres, including: the Blind Gold, City Creek, and Homestake Paleoplacer Properties. Dakota Territory Resource Corp trades under the symbol DTRC:OTCQB.
History[edit]
During the Gold Rush of the late 19th century, brothers Fred and Moses Manuel and their partners, Alex Engh and Hank Harney, staked out an area in the northern Black Hills of what was then considered Dakota Territory (today Lead, South Dakota). On April 9, 1876, they discovered there an outcropping of a vein of ore,[6] and quickly claimed the property theirs, naming it the "Homestake". Soon other miners followed suit, seeing great gold potential, and a town was built around the Homestake. A year later, three entrepreneurs, George Hearst (father of the famous newspaper tycoon William Randolph Hearst), Lloyd Tevis, and James Ben Ali Haggin, bought the Homestake from them for $70,000, and founded the Homestake Mining Company. Because of the remote location, mining equipment had to be brought in from Nebraska, but eventually a mill began crushing ore in July 1878. A year later, the three partners sold shares in the Homestake Mining Company, listing it on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), which would become one of the longest-listed stocks in the history of the NYSE (NYSE:HM).[7]
Management Team[edit]
Richard Bachman, president and director, previously worked for 22 years at Homestake Mining Company in various capacities including regional geologist, managing an exploration program focused on the discovery of a repeat of the Homestake Mine.[8] Gerald Aberle, vice president, COO, and director, also worked for 22 years with Homestake Mining Company, at the Homestake gold mine in Lead, South Dakota. He also consulted for 14 years with Homestake Mining Co. as well as Barrick Gold Corp.[9] Wm Chris Mathers is CFO,[10] and Anthony Kamin is director.[11]

	This Code of Business and Ethical Conduct (the “Code”) for Dakota Territory Resource Corp (the “Company”) has been adopted by the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) to maintain the Company’s reputation for integrity and ethical standards in all areas of conduct, disclosure, and regulatory compliance. Compliance with the Code is required of every employee, officer and director of the Company.  This Code outlines the broad principles of legal and ethical conduct embraced by the Company.  It is not a complete list of legal or ethical issues faced in the course of business, and, therefore, this Code must be applied using common sense and good judgment.   This Code supplements and does not replace or modify the Company’s other policies or procedures, including provisions in any employee handbooks, workplace rules, insider trading policies and other statements of policy or procedure issued from time to time.  
	This Code complies with requirements for a “code of ethics” under Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules promulgated thereunder, as well as the rules of the NYSE Amex.
II.	PRINCIPLES
A.	Compliance and Reporting
	Employees, officers and members of the Board should strive to identify and raise potential issues before they lead to problems, and should ask about the application of this Code whenever in doubt.  Any employee or member of the Board who becomes aware of any existing or potential violation of this Code should promptly notify the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, Rick Bachman, at 10580 N. McCarran Blvd., Building 115-208, Reno, Nevada 89503, (775) 721-8883, with a copy to Tad Mailander, outside counsel to the Company, 835 Fifth Avenue, Suites 312-313, San Diego, California 92101 (619) 239-9034.  Any questions relating to how these policies should be interpreted or applied should be addressed to the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, with a copy to our outside counsel.
The Company will take such disciplinary or preventive action as it deems appropriate to address any existing or potential violation of this Code brought to its attention.

B.	Personal Conflicts of Interest
A “personal conflict of interest” occurs when an individual’s private interest improperly interferes, or even appears to interfere, with the interests of the Company.  Personal conflicts of interest are prohibited as a matter of policy, unless they have been approved by the Company.  In particular, an employee or member of the Board must never use or attempt to use his or her position at the Company to obtain any improper personal benefit for himself or herself, for his or her family members, or for any other person. Loans to, or guarantees of obligations of, such persons are a special concern.
Service to the Company should never be subordinated to personal gain and advantage.  Conflicts of interest should, to the extent possible, be avoided. Any employee, officer or member of the Board who is aware of a material transaction or relationship that could reasonably be expected to give rise to a conflict of interest should disclose the matter promptly with the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, with a copy to our outside counsel. Conflicts of interest involving those with whom the Company does business should also be disclosed in writing to such third parties.  A waiver of any conflict of interest must be approved by the Board or an appropriate committee.
Officers of the Company are to disclose any conflict of interest or potential conflict of interest to the Board.  Members of the Board are to disclose any conflict of interest or potential conflict of interest to the entire Board as well as any committee on which they serve.  Directors are to excuse themselves from participation in any decision of the Board or a committee thereof in any matter in which there is a conflict of interest or potential conflict of interest.
C.	Corporate Opportunities
Employees, officers and members of the Board owe a duty to the Company to advance its legitimate business interests when the opportunity to do so arises.  Employees, officers and members of the Board are prohibited from taking for themselves (or directing to a third party) a business opportunity that is discovered through the use of corporate property, information or position, unless the Company already has been offered the opportunity and turned it down.  More generally, employees, officers and members of the Board are prohibited from using corporate property, information or position for personal gain or competing with the Company.
Sometimes the line between personal and Company benefits is difficult to draw.  The only prudent course of conduct for employees, officers and members of the Board is to make sure that any use of the Company’s property or services, or the acceptance of any opportunity, that is not solely for the benefit of the Company, has prior approval by the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, with a copy to our outside counsel.
D.	Confidentiality
In carrying out the Company’s business, employees, officers and members of the Board often learn confidential or proprietary information about the Company, its clients/customers, prospective clients/customers or other third parties.  Confidential or proprietary information relating to the Company is the property of the Company and the unauthorized disclosure of such information is strictly forbidden. Employees, officers and members of the Board must maintain the confidentiality of all information so entrusted to them, except when disclosure is authorized or legally mandated.  Confidential or proprietary information includes, among other things, any non-public information concerning the Company, including its businesses, financial performance, results or prospects, product specifications or trade secrets and any non-public information provided by a third party with the expectation that the information will be kept confidential and used solely for the business purpose for which it was conveyed.

E.	Public Disclosure
It is the Company’s policy that the information in its public communications, including Securities and Exchange Commission filings, be full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable.  All employees, officers and members of the Board who are involved in the Company’s disclosure process are responsible for acting in furtherance of this policy.  In particular, these individuals are required to maintain familiarity with the disclosure requirements applicable to the Company and are prohibited from knowingly misrepresenting, omitting, or causing others to misrepresent or omit, material facts about the Company to others, whether within or outside the Company, including the Company’s independent auditors.  In addition, any employee, officer or member of the Board who has a supervisory role in the Company’s disclosure process has an obligation to discharge his or her responsibilities diligently.  Please note that management and outside counsel will determine the types of information that must be disclosed and the timing of such disclosures.
F.	Compliance with Laws, Rules and Regulations
It is the Company’s policy to comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations.  It is the personal responsibility of each employee, officer and member of the Board to adhere to the standards and restrictions imposed by those laws, rules and regulations.  Employees, officers, members of the Board and consultants must not only comply with the requirements of applicable laws, rules, regulations, policies and this Code, they must ensure that their actions do not give the appearance of violating this Code or indicate a casual attitude towards compliance with such laws, rules, regulations, policies and this Code.

G.	Insider Trading
Employees, officers and directors who have access to confidential information are not permitted to use or share that information for stock trading purposes or for any other purpose except the conduct of our business.  All non-public information about the Company should be considered confidential information.  To use non-public information for personal financial benefit or to “tip “ others who might make an investment decision on the basis of this information is not only unethical but also illegal. To avoid even the appearance of impropriety, all employees and members of the Board are required to clear all trades in the Company’s stock through the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, with a copy to our outside counsel.  If you have any questions, please refer to the Company’s insider trading policy, with additional questions directed to the Company’s Chief Executive Officer or outside counsel.
H.	Fair Dealing
We do not seek competitive advantages through illegal or unethical business practices.  Each employee, officer and member of the Board should endeavor to deal fairly with the Company’s clients, service providers, suppliers, competitors and employees.  No employee or member of the Board should take unfair advantage of anyone through manipulation, concealment, abuse of privileged or proprietary information, misrepresentation of material facts, or any unfair dealing practice.
The purpose of business entertainment and gifts in a commercial setting is to create good will and sound working relationships, not to gain unfair advantage with customers.  Gifts or entertainment should not ever be offered, given, provided or accepted by any Company employee, family member of an employee or agent unless it:  (1) is not a cash gift, (2) is consistent with customary business practices, (3) is not excessive in value, (4) cannot be construed as a bribe or payoff and (5) does not violate any laws or regulations.  Please seek advice from the Company’s Chief Executive Officer or outside counsel regarding any gifts or proposed gifts which you are not certain are appropriate.
I.	Payments to Government Personnel; Political Contributions
The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act prohibits giving anything of value, directly or indirectly, to officials of foreign governments or foreign political candidates in order to obtain or retain business.  It is strictly prohibited to make illegal payments to government officials of any country. 
In addition, the U.S. government has a number of laws and regulations restricting the giving of business gratuities to U.S. government personnel.  The promise, offer or delivery to an official or employee of the U.S. government of a gift, favor or other gratuity in violation of these rules would not only violate Company policy but could also be a criminal offense.  State and local governments, as well as foreign governments, may have similar rules.
The Company does not contribute, directly or indirectly, to any political campaign or party.  Employees, officers and members of the Board may not use Company expense accounts to pay for any personal political contributions or seek any other form of Company reimbursement.  In addition, employees, officers or members of the Board should not use Company facilities or Company assets, including the time of Company personnel for the benefit of any party or candidate, including an employee, officer or member of the board individually running for office.
J.	Equal Employment Opportunity and Harassment
Our focus in personnel decisions is on merit and contribution to the Company’s success.  Concern for the personal dignity and individual worth of every person is an indispensable element in the standard of conduct that we have set for ourselves.  The Company affords equal employment opportunity to all qualified persons without regard to any impermissible criterion or circumstance.  This means equal opportunity in regard to each individual’s terms and conditions of employment and in regard to any other matter that affects in any way the working environment of the employee.  We do not tolerate or condone any type of discrimination prohibited by law, including harassment.
K.	Protection and Proper Use of the Company’s Assets
All employees, officers and members of the Board should endeavor to protect the Company’s assets and ensure their efficient use.  Theft, carelessness, and waste have a direct impact on the Company’s profitability.  Any suspected incident of fraud or theft should be immediately reported for investigation.  Company equipment should not be used for non-Company business, though incidental personal use may be permitted.
The obligation of employees, officers and members of the Board to protect the Company’s assets includes its proprietary information.  Proprietary information includes intellectual property such as trade secrets, patents, trademarks, and copyrights, as well as business, marketing and service plans, engineering and manufacturing ideas, designs, databases, records, salary information and any unpublished financial data and reports.  Unauthorized use or distribution of this information would violate Company policy.  It could also be illegal and result in civil or even criminal penalties.  Please see the Company’s policies on information technology usage and confidentiality for further guidance.
L.	Health and Safety
The Company strives to provide each employee with a safe and healthy work environment.  Each employee, officer and member of the Board has a responsibility for maintaining a safe and healthy workplace for all employees by following safety and health rules and practices and reporting accidents, injuries and unsafe equipment, practices or conditions.
The Company will not tolerate violence and threatening behavior.  Employees should report to work in condition to perform their duties, free from the influence of illegal drugs or alcohol.  The Company will not tolerate the use of illegal drugs or alcohol in the workplace or on the Company’s property.  
M.	Record-Keeping
The Company requires honest and accurate recording and reporting of information in order to make responsible business decisions.  For example, only the true and actual number of hours worked should be reported.
Business expense accounts used by employees must be documented and recorded accurately.  If you are not sure whether a certain expense is legitimate, please refer to the Company’s travel and entertainment policies for further guidance.  All of the Company’s books, records, accounts and financial statements must be maintained in reasonable detail, must appropriately reflect the Company’s transactions and must conform both to applicable legal requirements and to the Company’s system of internal controls.  Unrecorded or “off the books” funds or assets should not be maintained unless permitted by applicable law or regulation and approved in writing by the Chief Financial Officer.
Business records and communications often become public, and we should avoid exaggeration, derogatory remarks, guesswork, or inappropriate characterizations of people and companies that could be misunderstood.  This applies equally to e-mail, internal memos, and formal reports.  Records should always be retained or destroyed according to the Company’s record retention policies.  In accordance with those policies, in the event of litigation or governmental investigation, threatened or known, please consult with the Company’s Chief Executive Officer or outside counsel.
III.	REPORTING ILLEGAL OR UNETHICAL BEHAVIOR
A.	Reporting Illegal or Unethical Behavior
Employees, officers and members of the Board who suspect or know of violations of the Code or illegal or unethical business or workplace conduct by employees, officers or members of the Board have an obligation to contact their supervisor or superiors, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer or outside counsel.  If the individuals to whom such information is conveyed are not responsive, or if there is reason to believe that reporting to such individuals is inappropriate in particular cases, then the employee, officer or member of the Board may contact the Company’s Chief Executive Officer or outside counsel.  If the employee, officer or member of the Board is still not satisfied with the response, the employee may contact the Audit Committee of the Board of the Company (the “Audit Committee”). If concerns or complaints require confidentiality, then this confidentiality will be protected to the extent feasible, subject to applicable law.
B.	Accounting Complaints
Our policy is to comply with all applicable financial reporting and accounting regulations.  If any member of the Board, officer or employee of the Company has unresolved concerns or complaints regarding questionable accounting or auditing matters of the Company, then he or she is encouraged to submit those concerns or complaints (anonymously, confidentially or otherwise) to the Audit Committee (or the Board, as the case may be) pursuant to the Company’s procedures for complaints.  Subject to its legal duties, the Audit Committee and/or the Board will treat such submissions confidentially.  Such submissions may be directed to the attention of the Chief Executive Officer, with a copy to our outside counsel.  The Chief Executive Officer or outside counsel will forward all complaints to the Audit Committee or the Board.
C.	Non-Retaliation
Employees are encouraged to talk to supervisors, managers or other appropriate personnel about observed illegal or unethical behavior and when in doubt about the best course of action in a particular situation.  The Company will not retaliate in any manner against an employee who reports in good faith violations or suspected violations of this Code or other known or suspected illegal or unethical conduct.  Employees are expected to cooperate in internal investigations of misconduct.
IV.	PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL OFFICER, PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING OFFICER OR CONTROLLER, OR PERSONS PERFORMING SIMILAR FUNCTIONS (“SENIOR OFFICERS”)
All Senior Officers of the Company will:

Act with honesty and integrity, handle actual or apparent conflicts of interest in personal and professional relationships in accordance with the Code.
Produce full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports and documents that the Company files with, or submits to, the Securities and Exchange Commission and in other public communications made by the Company.
Comply with applicable rules and regulations of federal, state, provincial and local governments, and other appropriate private and public regulatory agencies.

Promptly report known or suspected violations of the Code in accordance with the Code.

Be accountable for adhering to the Code.

AMENDMENT, MODIFICATION AND WAIVER

The Code may be amended or modified only by the Board.  Waivers of the Code applicable to members of the Board or executive officers may only be granted on the recommendation of the Board or a committee of the Board with specific delegated authority.  However, no waiver as to any rights or remedies of the Company’s directors, officers, employees or consultants under any applicable laws relating to the reporting of any suspected violations of this Code shall be permitted. 
Waivers with respect to any other employee, agent or contractor must be approved in writing by the Company’s Chief Executive Officer or outside counsel.  Waivers applicable to members of the Board or officers of the Company will be disclosed to stockholders as required by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the rules thereunder and the applicable rules of the NYSE Amex or other such exchange where the Company’s securities are listed, as then applicable.  
VI.	ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ADHERENCE TO THE CODE
A violation of this Code may result in disciplinary action including termination of employment or other relationship(s) with the Company.
This Code is for the benefit of the Company, and no other person is entitled to enforce this Code.  This Code does not, and should not be construed to, create any private cause of action or remedy in any other person for a violation of the Code.  Moreover, violations of this code will not be presumed to create a violation of law, rule or regulation on the part of the Company.
The most current version of the Code can be obtained on the Company’s website at www.dakotatrc.com.  The Company will publicly disclose any substantive amendment of this Code as required by applicable law.
This Code of Ethics has been adopted by the Board of Directors of the Company as of the 14th day of May, 2013.

Homestake Gold Mine 1877


Dakota Territory Resource Corp, a Reno, Nevada corporation, is a publicly traded gold development company owning land in the historic Homestake District of the northern Black Hills of South Dakota, an area that once produced the second largest amount of gold in U.S. history. Otherwise known as the Homestake Mine or the Homestake Deposit, the 100-square-mile area yielded approximately 44 million ounces of gold in its 136-year-history, placing it second in U.S. gold production only to the Carlin District of northeast Nevada,[1] and ranking it the largest iron-formation-hosted gold deposit in the world.[2][3]
During the 1980s and 1990s, Richard Bachman, geologist and now president and director of Dakota Territory Resource Corp, managed a team for Homestake Mining Company that was successful in uncovering and expanding new significant gold mineralization areas.[4] While the mining at the Homestake Mine halted in 2002 due to low gold prices and high mining expenses, from 2011-2014, Dakota Territory Resource Corp acquired crucial sample data as well as mineral acres, broadening its property position in the Homestake District in efforts to restart a gold revitalization there similar to what was done two to three decades earlier. In a venture to continue exploration and development of this precious metals site, today Dakota Territory Resource Corp attempts to breathe new life into this once-profitable gold mining area. They cite a commitment to exploration of gold with sustainable practices.[5]
The total mineral area Dakota Territory Resource Corp owns covers 3,057 acres, including: the Blind Gold, City Creek, and Homestake Paleoplacer Properties. Dakota Territory Resource Corp trades under the symbol DTRC:OTCQB.
History[edit]
During the Gold Rush of the late 19th century, brothers Fred and Moses Manuel and their partners, Alex Engh and Hank Harney, staked out an area in the northern Black Hills of what was then considered Dakota Territory (today Lead, South Dakota). On April 9, 1876, they discovered there an outcropping of a vein of ore,[6] and quickly claimed the property theirs, naming it the "Homestake". Soon other miners followed suit, seeing great gold potential, and a town was built around the Homestake. A year later, three entrepreneurs, George Hearst (father of the famous newspaper tycoon William Randolph Hearst), Lloyd Tevis, and James Ben Ali Haggin, bought the Homestake from them for $70,000, and founded the Homestake Mining Company. Because of the remote location, mining equipment had to be brought in from Nebraska, but eventually a mill began crushing ore in July 1878. A year later, the three partners sold shares in the Homestake Mining Company, listing it on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), which would become one of the longest-listed stocks in the history of the NYSE (NYSE:HM).[7]
Management Team[edit]
Richard Bachman, president and director, previously worked for 22 years at Homestake Mining Company in various capacities including regional geologist, managing an exploration program focused on the discovery of a repeat of the Homestake Mine.[8] Gerald Aberle, vice president, COO, and director, also worked for 22 years with Homestake Mining Company, at the Homestake gold mine in Lead, South Dakota. He also consulted for 14 years with Homestake Mining Co. as well as Barrick Gold Corp.[9] Wm Chris Mathers is CFO,[10] and Anthony Kamin is director.[11]
