For each fund with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating™ based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Total Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund’s monthly performance (including the effects of sales charges, loads, and redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. (Each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages.) The Overall Morningstar Rating for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and ten-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The RMB Fund Class A was rated as of 6/30/17 against the following number of U.S. domiciled large growth funds over the following time periods: 1,277 funds in the last three years, 1,152 funds in the last 5 years, and 803 funds in the last 10 years. With respect to these large growth funds, the RMB Fund Class A received a Morningstar rating of 2, 1, and 3 stars for the 3, 5, and 10 year periods, respectively. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

   PHILOSOPHYInvestment Philosophy
The RMB Fund seeks capital appreciation, mainly long term; income is a secondary consideration. The Fund pursues its goals by investing in a diverse portfolio, primarily consisting of common stocks. It invests in large-capitalization stocks (i.e., companies with a capitalization generally of $14 billion or more, commonly known as “blue-chip”), which are usually issued by well-established companies. Under normal conditions, the advisor intends to remain fully invested with only minimal investments in cash, short-term debt instruments, or money market funds.
Investment Approach

Seek companies with product leadership and strong management with focus on shareholder value
Search for opportunities in companies currently restructuring or determined to be undervalued with a potential catalyst for recovery
Identify companies with potential for sustainable growth and/or offering steadily increasing dividends

Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information. The Morningstar Style Box™ reveals a fund’s investment strategy. For equity funds, the vertical axis shows the market capitalization of the long stocks owned and the horizontal axis shows investment style (value, blend or growth).
The Funds’ investment adviser, RMB Capital Management, LLC, has adopted a contractual expense limitation agreement for each fund through May 1, 2018, reducing the applicable fund’s operating expenses so that the fund’s total return and yield is increased. This may be continued from year to year thereafter if agreed upon by all parties. In the absence of such waivers and/or reimbursements, the applicable Fund’s total return and yield would be lower.
All investing involves risk including the possible loss of principal. The RMB Fund invests in larger, more established companies, which may not respond as quickly to competitive challenges or have higher growth rates than smaller companies might have during periods of economic expansion. There can be no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objective.
Different classes of shares carry different fees and expenses. The RMB Fund currently offers three classes (A, C and I shares). Class A has a maximum front-end sales charge of 5.0%, Class C has a maximum contingent deferred sales charge of 1.0%, and Class I has waived load with $100,000 minimum investment. Class A sales charges are waived for clients of investment intermediaries, or for those who purchase shares via no-transaction fee platforms. Each share class charges a 2.00% short-term redemption fee on proceeds from shares redeemed (either by selling or exchanging into another fund) within 30 days after purchase.
Index Definition

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

Funds and solutions - Overview
RMB core performance linked investment accounts

                RMB’s various performance linked investment accounts use a combination of alternative assets and equities, to provide an above average long-term real rate of return. These products differ in terms of structure, asset allocation, capital guarantee (if any), flexibility, instrument selection and liquidity parameters.
                
RMB core ETFs and ETNs

Unlike traditional Collective Investment Scheme (‘unit trust’) investments, RMB’s  Exchange Traded  Funds (ETFs) and Exchange Traded Notes (ETNs), are traded on the Johannesburg  Stock Exchange. In contrast to  traditional actively managed funds, they are passively managed - the performance  is index-linked and allocations are rules-based. The goal is to replicate the  performance of the index, rather than to strive for outperformance.

For more information on ETFs visit our RMB ETF microsite.

For more information on ETNs visit our RMB ETN microsite.
Bespoke solutions

RMB also offers bespoke investment solutions to meet your objectives in terms of liquidity, capital security, investment horizon and diversification. An experienced team with access to the extensive array of financial instruments across Rand Merchant Bank and the broader FirstRand Group, have the necessary experience, skills, tools and appetite for this unique area of specialisation to create bespoke investment solutions. A minimum investment size is applicable.

Trust products are turning China's world-famous savers into unwitting investors





Grab-bag financeTrust products are turning China's world-famous savers into unwitting investors

Wednesday, December 17, 2014

Share: 





Chinese savers are increasingly turning away from the mainland's traditional banking system, lured by the shadow banking sector's promise of significantly higher yields. Despite the dramatic title, shadow banking is essentially just a name for financial institutions that operate outside the traditional, heavily regulated banking sector. Its largest segment, the trust industry, has seen explosive growth in recent years: As of the end of June, the amount of outstanding trust assets in China had reached RMB12.5 trillion (US$2 trillion), according to the China Trustee Association's latest report (pdf). That's equivalent about half of the country's GDP in 2013. 
However, few of those jumping ship from traditional savings seem aware of exactly where their money is going, or how safe it is. Getting a handle on just what the trust industry is made up of, and what it's up to, can help shed light on its actual role in the Chinese economy and the risk it may pose to the general public's pocketbook.
Makes and models
Put simply, a trust is a basket of assets including anything from loans to property to stocks to bonds. Trust companies then split the financial exposure to these assets into securities, known as trust products, which are then sold to investors. There are a variety of different trust products in the Chinese market today, and in order to understand the range available they can be broken down in terms of structure and industry. For structure, types of trust products include:
• a single unit trust, where the trust company creates a product based on the requirements of the customer
• a combined trust, in which a product is developed by the company and then marketed to investors
• a property management trust, a broadly defined product which involves the management of non-monetary assets on behalf of the client such as physical assets or intangible assets
The major industries for such products include industrial and commercial, infrastructure, real estate and finance, among others.

Sources: China Banking Industry Wealth Management Market Year-end Reports for 2013(pdf), 2014(pdf)



The breakneck growth of the trust industry—with assets under management increasing by an average of 53% a year for the past three years, according to a column from Reuters—is unsurprising, given that they typically pay more than double the 3.3% maximum one-year deposit rate that savers can get from mainland banks. Indeed, the average annualized return to investors in trust products in the first half of 2014 was 5.2%, according to data from Bloomberg.
Such a profound gap in investment yield is luring more and more individuals and companies away from traditional bank deposits, fundamentally changing the way the Chinese populace holds its savings. Of the funds raised for trust products, a quarter comes from wealthy individuals and companies, with the remainder from banks selling the trust products as wealth management products (WMPs) to individual savers, according to one report from the Wall Street Journal.
Rate expectations
Many, including the International Monetary Fund, have expressed concern over the risk such products may pose to investors and the economy at large in light of such large premiums over the deposit rate. Strictly speaking, just because trust products offer a higher return compared to China's state-controlled deposit rate doesn't mean they are necessarily riskier; the returns could, in theory, be an approximation of what the real deposit rate might be without a government-imposed ceiling. But Chinese trust products go above and beyond making up for this gap, with returns outstripping levels one might expect from an ordinary deposit.
This suggests a significant risk premium is entailed by investing in these products. The most important factor contributing to this risk is the mismatch between short-term funds and longer-term investments. While many trust products only last for two to three years, borrowers may not be able to repay borrowings in such a short timeframe, especially those in the mining and infrastructure industries, according to a Reuters report. The two reports on the industry produced so far by the National Banking Wealth Management Registration System (overseen by the China Banking Regulatory Commission) show heavy investment in bonds & currency, cash & deposits and non-standardized creditor assets.

(Note: Non-standardized credit assets include creditor assets that are traded outside bank and stock exchange markets, including but not limited to credit assets, trust loans, entrusted loans, acceptance bills, letters of credit, accounts receivable, and equity financing with a buy-back clause.)
This leads to the broader question: How much risk is posed by the borrowers of all this cash? Most trust companies have ostensibly sound assets, but the trust sector can attract companies desperate for cash, such as overextended real estate, mining and local government developers. And while trust products are sold under the umbrella term of "wealth management products" (WMPs) through major banks, the banks don't always guarantee them. One notorious example came in 2012, when customers of Huaxia Bank who had been sold a WMP were told they would not be getting their money back. Chinese media portrayed it as a one-off event, but there have been several cases this year of trusts on the verge of default or who have delayed investor payouts. 
As for exactly who is stuffing all these assets into the baskets, there are around seventy members of the China Trustee Association, the largest members of which include the trust companies Citic Trust, China Foreign Economy and Trade Trust, China Credit Trust, Pingan Trust and Yingda International Trust, according to KPMG (pdf). Companies in the industry are mostly either state-owned, local government-controlled or have a large pool of diversified shareholders comprising government-owned and privately-owned businesses.
As a result of growing oversight by the PBRC, corporate governance in the industry at least appears to be steadily improving. A ratings system is used by the regulator to oversee trust companies in which companies with lower scores are subject to more regular and stringent oversight and restrictions. Of course, that may not guarantee the actual safety of these products for ordinary consumers, as anyone familiar with the role of credit rating agencies in the US subprime mortgage crisis of '08 can attest to. ♦
