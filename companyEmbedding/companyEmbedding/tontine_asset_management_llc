Hedge Fund Tontine Asset Management's Top Stock Picks | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Hedge Fund Tontine Asset Management's Top Stock PicksMay 17, 2013 10:25 AM ET|| Includes: BAC, C, IESC, PATK, WLBby: Insider MonkeyInsider Monkey Newsletter provider, fund holdings, insider ownershipInsider MonkeyBy Andrei Braghis
Tontine Asset Management has suffered notable losses in the aftermath of the financial crisis, but manager Jeffrey Gendell has managed to turn it around. He is a macro trader, that is, he invests in stocks that he believes will advance thanks to macroeconomic trends. In the most recent quarter, Gendell has made a significant addition to the fund's investment in Citigroup (NYSE:C) and has also added to the investment in Bank of America (NYSE:BAC).
The original 13F can be seen here. Retail investors can capitalize on this phenomenon, but they have to know where to look first (learn the secrets of this strategy here).
The tippy top
The fund's top position, Patrick Industries (NASDAQ:PATK), has been slightly diminished. Jeffrey Gendell has decreased the investment in the manufacturer of building products and materials by 6%. The reported value of the remaining 3.9 million shares is $62.7 million. Since the start of the year, the stock price has been oscillating around the value of $16 and only recently entered an uptrend. Shares currently change hands at a price of $21 and a trailing Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio of 7.86, well below the industry average of 20.40. For the first quarter of 2013, Patrick Industries reported revenues of $142.1 million and earnings of $0.55 per share. For the current quarter, analysts estimate earnings of $0.60.
The second-biggest investment of Tontine is Integrated Electrical Services (NASDAQ:IESC), the provider of electrical infrastructure. The fund management has made no changes in the number of shares owned. The reported 8.5 million shares have a value of $55.6 million - a 44% increase compared to the last quarter of 2012. The stock price has been growing steadily in 2013, advancing 40% to a value of approximately $6 per share. A beta of 2.26 makes this stock very volatile and a riskier than market-average investment. Integrated Electrical registered revenues of $122 million and losses of $0.06 per share in the second quarter of 2013. One of the company's subsidiaries has recently announced a partnership with Sunrun that will allow the company to further develop their offering of solar services.

The best of the rest
Jeffrey Gendell has made a massive addition to the fund's stake in Citigroup, increasing it by 44%. The current value of the 753,000 shares was reported as $33.3 million. The price of Citigroup shares has increased by 20% so far this year and is currently at approximately $49 per share. The stock is traded at a trailing P/E ratio of 17.96 and the forward P/E ratio of 9.18 suggests the market expects the financial giant to perform better in the near future. Citigroup stock has a beta of 1.86 and pays a dividend of $0.04, which represents a tiny yield of 0.1%. Analysts are bullish on this stock, 17 recommending it as a Buy and nine saying it's a Strong Buy. Only five analysts expect the stock to Perform or Under perform. They have set a price range of $36-$62.
A small 4% addition to the investment in Bank of America made it the 4th largest position of Tontine Asset Management. The fund manager has added 85,000 shares, taking the total investment to a reported value of $26 million. Bank of America delivered a profit in the first quarter of 2013 and missed the earnings estimates, but managed to surpass the expectations in terms of revenues. The financial giant registered EPS of $0.20 and revenues of $23.71 billion. With this in mind, analysts have set their expectations for the second quarter as follows: EPS of $0.25 and revenues of $22.63 billion. The stock is traded at a trailing P/E ratio of 40.75 and a forward P/E ratio of 10.11.
Last but certainly not least is Westmoreland Coal Company (NASDAQ:WLB), an energy company operating in the United States. The fund has decreased their holding of the stock by 6%, with the current position valued at approximately $24 million. The stock price has been in an uptrend, appreciating by 24% in 2013. Shares are traded at a forward P/E ratio of 11.89, with the company bleeding money at the moment. Westmoreland Coal reported revenues of $161 million, but losses of $0.19 per share in the first quarter of 2013.
Final remarks

Changes made by Jeffrey Gendell to Tontine's equity portfolio suggest that the management team is bullish on financial services providers, as they made a significant addition to the Citigroup stake. We suggest investors pay attention to this stock and to Bank of America, since both companies show signs of significant growth potential.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
