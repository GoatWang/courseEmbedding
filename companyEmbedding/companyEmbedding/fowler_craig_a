Overview

Greg has long been a trusted adviser and litigation counsel to several of the most successful multinational consumer product manufacturers in the world, including tobacco, alcohol and pharmaceutical/medical device producers, and, more recently soft drink, food and firearm producers. These companies, as well as others in the aeronautical and retail industries, have turned to Greg for guidance and counselling in strategic planning, regulatory compliance, risk management and commercial communications when it is needed the most. He has also managed and coordinated the defense of products claims and/or conducted product recalls for these clients in more than 60 countries on five continents. Greg was appointed managing partner of the London office, which effectively acts as the firm’s hub for all global product liability litigation and client counselling work, in January 2016.
When Who's Who Legal named Shook the 2017 Global Product Liability Law Firm of the Year (for the 13th consecutive year), it also recognized Greg as a key individual member of the firm's Product Liability Defense team. Greg has extensive experience in the management and litigation of individual product liability claims and mass tort litigation in state and federal courts throughout the United States and internationally in Asia, Australia, Latin America and Western Europe. He counsels manufacturers on developments in product liability law and regulatory issues arising in those regions as well. He has represented U.S. and international clients in Consumer Product Safety Commission recalls. Before returning to Shook London, Greg completed postings in the firm’s London (1999-2000) and Kansas City (2001-2015) offices, and in Melbourne, Australia (1992-1994).
International Litigation and Regulatory Matters - Greg has managed litigation working directly with in-country counsel in the defense of product liability and other complex litigation in Australia, Germany, Spain, Portugal, the Netherlands, Korea, Japan, Pakistan, the United Kingdom, Hong Kong and various other countries. He has also counseled the firm’s clients and provided assistance with regard to regulatory issues, developments in product liability and product safety laws as well as other issues of significance, in Asia, Western Europe and North America.
United States Product Liability Litigation - Greg has represented the firm’s tobacco, pharmaceutical and other consumer product clients in all phases of litigation since 1986. In tobacco litigation, he has represented Philip Morris and Lorillard Tobacco Company in individual lawsuits throughout the United States and was trial counsel in the first union trust fund class action reimbursement case, which resulted in a defense verdict in the U.S. District Court, Northern District of Ohio. He continues to manage and litigate individual cases and mass litigation for the firm’s tobacco, pharmaceutical and other consumer product clients.
International and U.S. Product Recalls - Greg has represented U.S. and international consumer product manufacturers in recalls before the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission and in related liability matters. He has conducted and managed recalls of consumer products in more than 65 countries.
Greg is the general editor and author of INTERNATIONAL PRODUCT LIABILITY LAW – A Worldwide Desk Reference (Aspatore, 2004). He is a contributing editor and chapter author ("United States") for Getting the Deal Through: Product Liability and a chapter author ("United States") for Getting the Deal Through: Product Recall. In 2008, he received a Burton Legal Writing Award for “Product Manufacturers, Take Heed: International Markets Bring International Regulatory Oversight, Safety Standards and Liability Concerns,” which was published in the January 2007 issue of the Bloomberg European Business Law Journal. He is frequently an invited speaker in the United States and internationally on issues relating to product liability litigation, product safety, product regulation, international litigation, comparative law and general tort law. He has published on these topics as well.

										Q
									:
								
How do I know how much house I can afford?




										A
									:
Generally speaking, you can purchase a home with a value of two or three times your annual household income.  However, the amount that you can borrow will also depend upon your employment history, credit history, current savings and debts, and the amount of down payment you are willing to make.  You may also be able to take advantage of special loan programs for first time buyers to purchase a home with a higher value.  Give us a call, and we can help you determine exactly how much you can afford.


 




										Q
									:
								
What is the difference between a fixed-rate loan and an adjustable-rate loan?




										A
									:
With a fixed-rate mortgage, the interest rate stays the same during the life of the loan.  With an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM), the interest changes periodically, typically in relation to an index.  While the monthly payments that you make with a fixed-rate mortgage are relatively stable, payments on an ARM loan will likely change.  There are advantages and disadvantages to each type of mortgage, and the best way to select a loan product is by talking to us.


 




										Q
									:
								
How is an index and margin used in an ARM?




										A
									:
An index is an economic indicator that lenders use to set the interest rate for an ARM.  Generally the interest rate that you pay is a combination of the index rate and a pre-specified margin.  Three commonly used indices are the One-Year Treasury Bill, the Cost of Funds of the 11th District Federal Home Loan Bank (COFI), and the London InterBank Offering Rate (LIBOR).


 




										Q
									:
								
How do I know which type of mortgage is best for me?




										A
									:
There is no simple formula to determine the type of mortgage that is best for you.  This choice depends on a number of factors, including your current financial picture and how long you intend to keep your house.  Craig Fowler Mortgage can help you evaluate your choices and help you make the most appropriate decision.


 




										Q
									:
								
What does my mortgage payment include?




										A
									:
For most homeowners, the monthly mortgage payments include three separate parts: Principal: Repayment on the amount borrowedInterest: Payment to the lender for the amount borrowedTaxes & Insurance:  Monthly payments are normally made into a special escrow account for items like hazard insurance and property taxes.  This feature is sometimes optional, in which case the fees will be paid by you directly to the County Tax Assessor and property insurance company.


 




										Q
									:
								
How much cash will I need to purchase a home?




										A
									:
The amount of cash that is necessary depends on a number of items.  Generally speaking, though, you will need to supply:Earnest Money:  The deposit that is supplied when you make an offer on the houseDown Payment:  A percentage of the cost of the home that is due at settlementClosing Costs:  Costs associated with processing paperwork to purchase or refinance a house
