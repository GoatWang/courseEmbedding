Disease Areas







Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD)/Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatosis (NASH) 

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) refers to a spectrum of hepatic lipid disorders characterized by hepatic steatosis with no known secondary cause (1). It is subcategorized into (a) nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL), defined as the presence of of steatosis in the absence of histological evidence of hepatocellular injury, and (b) nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), hepatic steatosis accompanied by hepatocyte injury and inflammation; NASH may occur with or without fibrosis, but may progress to fibrosis and cirrhosis. NAFLD is generally associated with energy metabolism pathologies, including obesity, dyslipidemia, diabetes and metabolic syndrome. The prevalence of NAFLD is high. Prevalence in the general population is estimated at 20%, with prevalence of NASH estimated to be 3-5% (1,2) Patients with obesity or diabetes demonstrate ~70% prevalence of NAFLD, and those with dyslipidemias are estimated to have a prevalence of ~50%. These therapeutic combinations are presently in clinical development.


Obesity

The global prevalence of obesity has doubled over the past three decades; the obesity epidemic now represents a significant public health risk in the US and other developed countries as well as in the developing world.  In the US, >35% of the adult population and 17% of the pediatric and adolescent populations are obese, and ~70% of the population is overweight or obese. Obesity results in a 5-13 year reduction in lifespan and there are more than 300,000 obesity-related deaths annually in the US.  Further, obesity increases the risk of co-morbidities, including cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, obstructive sleep apnea, and some cancers.  However, weight loss of just 5-10% reduces the risk and severity of these co-morbidities.
NuSirt has demonstrated that combining L-leucine with established therapeutic agents results in a shift in energy disposition from storage in adipose tissue to oxidation in skeletal muscle and significant decreases in body weight and fat, waist circumference and obesity co-morbidities, and is now developing these combinations as therapeutic modalities.



Type 2 Diabetes and Pre-Diabetes

In 2012, the American Diabetes Association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes jointly published a position statement on management of hyperglycemia. In this publication, metformin is listed as the first line drug of choice for newly diagnosed people with diabetes who cannot control their glucose with diet and exercise alone. Reports suggest that metformin is the most frequently prescribed medicine for diabetes. While metformin is considered a relatively safe medicine, use of metformin alone to treat T2DM has several drawbacks, including GI side effects that reduce compliance and/or lead to drug discontinuation. It is estimated that between 25-50% of patients who take metformin experience nausea, vomiting and/or diarrhea and these adverse events are dose related. In addition, metformin does not address other health risk factors common to diabetes, most notably the elevated inflammatory stress that contributes to cardiovascular risk in diabetics. Therefore, there remains a significant unmet therapeutic need to address drug efficacy, diabetes-related cardiovascular risk, and side effects.
NuSirt has demonstrated that L-leucine converges on the same signaling pathway (AMPK-Sirt1) activated by metformin to increase insulin sensitivity; accordingly, the company developed a product concept employing a proprietary combination of L-Leucine with significantly lower doses of metformin to achieve glucose control equivalent to the customarily used higher metformin doses.
Based on results from discovery and pre-clinical studies, NuSirt has developed a combination product intended for human use.  This product consists of a fixed dose combination of leucine and metformin with a goal to augment metformin efficacy and produce equivalent glucose control to customarily used higher does of metformin in patients with Type 2 diabetes. A Phase 2A clinical trial of this concept has been completed with results presented at the ADA 76th Annual Scientific Sessions, June 12, 2016.


Other Development Areas

NuSirt has clinical data demonstrating significant progress in the areas of hypertension and dyslipidemia.

Alan Cherrington, PhD
Professor of Molecular Physiology and Biophysics Vanderbilt University






 

Alan Cherrington, PhD
Professor of Molecular Physiology and Biophysics Vanderbilt University
Dr. Cherrington received his undergraduate degree in Biology from the University of New Brunswick in 1967 and his PhD in Physiology from the University of Toronto in 1973, where he worked with Dr. Mladen Vranic. He then undertook postgraduate training with Dr. Rollo Park at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. In 1975 he joined the faculty of Vanderbilt where he currently holds the positions of Professor in the Department of Molecular Physiology & Biophysics and in the Department of Medicine. He served as Chairman of the Molecular Physiology and Biophysics Department from 1998-2007. He currently holds the Jacquelyn A. Turner and Dr. Dorothy J. Turner Chair in Diabetes Research.
Dr. Cherrington’s work over the years has defined the effects of various hormonal and neuronal factors on liver glucose metabolism. Specifically, he has characterized the effects of insulin, glucagon, cortisol, epinephrine, and norepinephrine on the rates of hepatic glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis in vivo. More recently he has examined the roles these agents play in regulating glucose production during a variety of stressful situations (exercise, hypoglycemic, illness, or injury). He has also studied the response of the liver to glucose ingestion and has shown that postprandial glycogen deposition is dependent not only on the availability of glucose and insulin, but equally on an additional “portal” signal. The nature of the signal and the mechanism by which it works are currently under study. Dr. Cherrington has significantly advanced our understanding of the way in which hormones and neural mediators regulate the ability of the liver to supply glucose in times of need and to store it in times of plenty. He is recognized worldwide as an authority in this area having published 287 peer-review papers and 84 review articles over the past 40 years.
Dr. Cherrington is also considered an outstanding mentor and educator and has trained over 50 graduate students and postdoctoral fellows. Most of his trainees are now themselves active investigators in the diabetes field. The numbers do not do justice however, to the impact he has had on large numbers of students and colleagues who have witnessed first-hand the excitement and rigor with which he approaches research. He has served on the editorial boards of the journals Diabetes, Metabolism, Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism and as associate editor of the American Journal of Physiology. Currently, he serves as consulting editor for the Journal of Clinical Investigation.
Dr. Cherrington has been a member of the American Diabetes Association since 1972. He has served at the local, state and national levels, including membership on numerous committees. In addition to his many appointments, his elected position with the American Diabetes Association include Board of Directors, Tennessee Affiliate 1984-1992), president, Tennessee Affiliate (1990-1991), National Board of Directors (1986-1989 and 2002-2006), and as national president (2004-2005). Dr. Cherrington has received many professional honors over the years, including the Lilly Award, the Rachmiel Levine Award and the Banting Award from the American Diabetes Association, the David Rumbough Award from the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation, the R.E. Heist Award from the University of Toronto, and the Charles R. Park Faculty Award for Research from Vanderbilt University. In addition, Dr. Cherrington holds professional memberships in ADA Middle Tennessee Affiliate; American Diabetes Association; American Physiology Society; European Diabetes Association; American Association for the Advancement of Sciences; and the American Institute of Nutrition. In 2013 he was elected as a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Sciences.

NuSirt Sciences, Inc.

							  in Packaging 

NuSirt Sciences, Inc. empowers healthier living through an assortment of products, using all-natural ingredients. NuSirt first approached Kevin Robinson Design after they had already begun their marketing efforts for their product, NuShape, but they felt they were lacking something. After discussing their goals, KRD was able to come back with a more professional image for the product packaging as well as an updated look for their marketing collateral flyers. Here is how the product packaging came out…
One request that NuSirt had was to create a graphic that could be used on all types of media that helped support the message of how 15 minutes of exercise can equal 60 minutes of fat burning. This simple graphic was created to help communicate that aspect and the client was very pleased with it!

These marketing sheets were also updated to have a nice, cohesive look to all the materials. They are 2-sided and were printed on 100# gloss cover stock.

            COMMENTEMAILMORENuSirt Sciences Inc.'s mission is to help address Type 2 diabetes through a combination of natural ingredients not yet available in the marketplace.With 26 million people suffering from Type 2 diabetes in the U.S. and about 79 million prediabetics, its formula has massive potential, according to Chief Operating Officer Barbara Cannon, who leads the company that includes three researchers at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville."If this data translates from the animal model to the human model, it could be a game changer," said Cannon, based in Nashville. "The market for Type 2 diabetes is monstrous, not only here in Tennessee, but everywhere around the world."NuSirt's formula dramatically reduces the amount of generic drug metformin needed for blood sugar control. A lower dosage could help eliminate metformin's unwanted side effects that sometimes cause people to avoid consistent usage and disrupt blood sugar levels.After seeing success with animal trials, NuSirt has gained approval to begin clinical trials this summer at Vanderbilt University and other institutions and hopes to bring its product to market by 2016 or 2017.The company was born out of the University of Tennessee when then-nutrition professor Michael Zemel created a formula meant to help with weight management. As chief scientific officer, he is overseeing research in Knoxville.Nashville-based TNInvestco funds Limestone and Tennessee Community Ventures contributed $650,000 to NuSirt in 2010 and have since invested more than $3.3 million. That funding has been accompanied by more than $7.3 million in private capital, with $5.5 million coming from Tennessee private investors.MAIN STORY: $200 million later, was TNInvestco worth the risk?PROFILE: Overdog lets fans take on pro athletes in online video gamesPROFILE: NeighborMD founder credits TNInvestco for successPROFILE: InvisionHeart gets cash infusion for life-saving devicePROFILE: Change Healthcare offers tools for making wise choicesPROFILE: When crisis strikes, Digital Reasoning takes action

NuSirt Sciences, Inc. Key Developments

NuSirt Biopharma and OWL Metabolomics Partner to Advance Treatment of NASH / Non-alcoholic Steatohepatitis
Sep 21 16
NuSirt Biopharma and One Way Liver S.L. announced they have initiated a strategic partnership to develop novel diagnostic tools for ongoing drug evaluation trials for NuSirt's fatty liver drug research candidate, NS-0200. Through their research collaboration, NuSirt and OWL will evaluate drug-induced lipidomic changes in human trials for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and explore the potential of developing a unique liquid-biopsy companion diagnostic (CDx) for NS-0200. NuSirt has completed enrollment for their Phase 2 TRIPLN clinical trial designed to determine the effects of its patented drug technology on patients diagnosed with NAFLD/NASH. In addition to MRI-based diagnosis known as PDFF, serial patient liquid biopsy samples from trial participants will be further analyzed via OWL Metabolomics' lipidomic signature analysis at pre-determined time intervals.


NuSirt Sciences, Inc. Announces Clinical Trial Results Show Synergy between Nusirt Technology and Metformin in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes
Jan 26 16
NuSirt Biopharma announced results from a recently completed clinical trial in patients with type 2 diabetes using its patented technology combining leucine, an essential amino acid, and low doses of metformin. The data from this trial showed comparable improvement in several glucose measures coupled with greater improvement in liver enzymes when comparing a lower dose of metformin in combination with leucine versus full dose metformin. In November 2015, NuSirt initiated a clinical trial to treat patients who have confirmed NAFLD. The company has since received Fast Track designation from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for its NAFLD/NASH development program. Data from this clinical trial are expected later in 2016. The complete results from NuSirt’s Phase 2A type 2 diabetes trial are currently targeted for release at scientific sessions and in publications. While this study did not demonstrate superiority of NuSirt’s leucine and low dose metformin compared to full dose metformin in diabetes, results indicate there was a synergistic dose response when leucine was combined with metformin. These results and other NuSirt studies support the potential of the company’s related technologies in treating diseases of metabolic dysfunction and/or caloric excess such as NAFLD and NASH as well as diabetes and elevated cholesterol.


NuSirt Biophar Receives FDA Fast Track Designation for Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease Treatment and Starts Enrollment for its Phase 2A Clinical Trial Targeting the Disease
Dec 10 15
NuSirt Biopharma announced the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Fast Track designation for its development program focused on non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). NuSirt also announced the start of enrollment for its Phase 2A clinical trial targeting this disease at nine U.S. research sites. NuSirt’s patented technology combines a naturally occurring amino acid, leucine, with existing pharmaceuticals. In pre-clinical studies, NuSirt’s triple combination of leucine, metformin and sildenafil showed the potential to reverse NAFLD, reduce symptoms of the disease, and prevent the onset of NAFLD and NASH. Additional animal studies have shown that the triple combination could reverse obesity-induced liver fat accumulation, inflammation and fibrosis in mice. This research was presented at the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD)’s annual The Liver Meeting® in November 2015. The Phase 2A clinical trial, named TRIPLN, is a randomized, 16-week, placebo-controlled, double-blind study. The TRIPLN study is evaluating the change in liver fat content in subjects receiving two fixed-dose combinations of NuSirt’s patented triple combination of leucine, metformin and sildenafil. Secondary objectives include assessing a variety of liver, metabolic and inflammatory markers. Initial results of the TRIPLN study are expected in the second half of 2016.
