  Welcome! to the TXHD Board - Textmunication Holdings, Inc  For up to the minute Press Releases and Company updates Text TXHD to 87365 For up to the minute News and Company updates follow twitter: http://www.twitter.com/textmunication Latest Press Releases and 8k : Updated: May 04, 2017  TXHD Prepares to take on Twilio on SMS Capacity (NEW YORK) – Textmunication Holdings, Inc. (OTC: TXHD), a mobile marketing platform service provider, new GEN 3  Platform may rival industry leader Twilio in the short-code SMS market. Expanding SMS Capacity The Company recently announced that in order to keep up with the demand Textmunication was scaling its SMS software platform with the addition of two new Scalability Engineers from one of Silicon Valley’s leading technology firms. The Company is in the final process of implementing a robust and scalable platform capable of sending more than 40 million SMS per day, or up to 1 billion SMS per month. This could potentially position TXHD as an emerging competitor to the sector leader in SMS market, Twilio, Inc. (NYSE:TWLO). Leader in Short Code SMS Textmiunication new GEN 3 platform will be one of the most robust platforms in the industry - and ranked as a 'Top Tier' SMS provider as far as volume, speed and capability. On the short-code, which is SMS texts with five digits (like 87365), Textmunication is set to become an industry leader, and could draw in a large wave of new tech investors into their stock. Twilio current short-code capacity is around 100 SMS per second, where as Textmunication's new Gen 3 Platform will be able to achieve 450 SMS per second once fully rolled-out. This technology alone will put TXHD on the radar within the SMS industry, but also benefit their partnerships/alliances off this new scalable SMS platform. As of late April 2017, the Company has already begun migrating some of its clients to its new GEN 3 SMS Platform, and more updates on this roll-out could be expected through out the month of May. Revenue Potential On pricing schedule each customer could be different based on needs, and customized contracts, but in general TXHD pricing on this new platform could be in the range of $0.01 to $0.05 per SMS, give or take. Add in that this new GEN 3 Platform capacity could be up to 40 million SMS per day, or up to 1 billion SMS per month, and you can quickly see the dramatic revenue potential about to unfold here with TXHD.

Aspire Consulting Group LLC, a verified Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB), is headquartered in Washington, D.C. and provides IT consulting and solution-based services to commercial, state, and federal agencies. Aspire is connected to the government procurement community and has advisors who have served in state government cabinet positions and Fortune 500 companies. This network, along with the SDVOSB certification, positions Aspire as a sought after partner for government contracts. This recent contract is focuses on the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), which covers 100 million people through Medicare, Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program, and the Health Insurance Marketplace. It is available to all components within CMS, and all Health and Human Services (HHS) Operating Divisions, to procure IT System development services - from end to end. The recent bill was more on how insurance companies will cover, and deliver coverage on federal or state levels, and would not really be cuts to Medicaid or Medicare spending, which includes IT upgrades to the system. Additional Federal Contracts Pending Aspire recently submitted a proposal for the Veterans Affairs (VA) VECTOR SDVOSB contract. This is a $25 billion IDIQ centered on Management, Analysis, Training, Outreach, Supply Chain and Human Resource staffing. Aspire's team on VECTOR now awaits the award of this contract. Two other contracts are pending, with one for system modernization of a state's Motor Vehicle Administration (MVA) infrastructure, and other as a subcontractor on a key federal agency. Aspire has teaming agreements with Northrop Grumman - the #2 federal systems integrator, Tech Mahindra - one of the largest business transformation firms in the world and a Direct hiring agreement with Phase One Consulting Group on its Department of Transportation (DOT) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) programs. The SDVOSB certification helps these companies hit specific government goals as it relates to veteran-owned business credits. So regardless of the decision or vote in Washington on 'repeal and replace' Aprise contracts remain safe in place as they stand more on the infrastructure and IT side of CMS.

(OTC PINK: TXHD), a cloud-based mobile SMS marketing platform provider, is minority-owner of Aspire Consulting Group LLC ("Aspire"). On January 5, 2016, Textmunication Holdings, Inc. ("Textmunication") entered into a Share Exchange Agreement with Aspire Consulting Group, LLC ("Aspire"). Aspire is a verified Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB). Pursuant to the terms of the Exchange Agreement, Textmunication acquired 49% of all of the issued and outstanding membership units of Aspire. As a result of the Share Exchange Agreement, Textmunication became a minority owner of Aspire. Aspire Consulting Group & SDVOSB: Aspire is headquartered in the business hub of Washington, D.C. and provides IT consulting and solution-based services to commercial, state, and federal agencies. Aspire is connected to the government procurement community and has advisors who have served in state government cabinet positions and Fortune 500 companies. This network, along with the SDVOSB certification, positions Aspire as a sought after partner for government contracts. There are less than 6,000 verified SDVOSB firms in the Unites States. Aspire is verified through the Center for Verification and Evaluation (CVE) program within the Veterans Affairs Department. Aspire's acceptance into the "Veterans First Contracting Program" is critical. The purpose is to ensure legitimately owned and controlled VOSBs and SDVOSBs are able to compete for VA VOSB and SDVOSB set-aside contracts and are credited by VA's large prime contractors for subcontract plan achievements. Aspire Milestones: Aspire was notified, on March 1, 2017, that it was awarded a significant 10-year government contract. Aspire is a strategic teammate on the CMS SPARC Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracting vehicle. The ceiling on the IDIQ is $25B and is shared with multiple companies. The Prime requested Aspire join the team based on its healthcare past performance and powerful SDVOSB certification. Aspire successfully performed on a 2016 Cloud and Big Data healthcare project gaining critical past performance marks. The Aspire leadership team has substantial Health IT (HIT) experience and is connected to the HIT network in D.C. The remaining teammates come from Fortune 500 companies and well-known Federal System Integrators. Strategic teaming is key to winning the numerous task orders delivered under this long-term IDIQ vehicle. The Aspire SPARC team is divided into specialty areas and set-aside certifications. The SPARC agreement offers substantial revenue opportunity for Aspire. Once task orders within the IDIQ are won, announcements and revenue guidance will be made. Task order revenues vary in size, but most are substantial and are multi-year arrangements split amongst the teammates. There are strict SDVOSB work share mandates required by the U.S. government. The Veterans Benefit Act of 2003 requires each government agency to set aside at least 3% of contracts for SDVOSBs. On the state level, the percentages vary, but in most cases are higher. Aspire is competing for state contracts where the SDVOSB requirement is a minimum 7% of total revenue. The SPARC agreement also provides Aspire the necessary past performance credentials to compete long-term and be successful with future contracting proposals. Past performance is a critical benchmark, in addition to procurement set-aside certifications. Aspire's SDVOSB certification is one of the most coveted in government contracting. The CMS SPARC contract is one of the largest IDIQs in government and carries substantial past performance metrics. Aspire just submitted a proposal for the Veterans Affairs (VA) VECTOR SDVOSB contract. This is a $25B IDIQ centered on Management, Analysis, Training, Outreach, Supply Chain and Human Resource staffing. Aspire's team on VECTOR now awaits the award of this contract. Two other contracts are pending. One is for system modernization of a state's Motor Vehicle Administration (MVA) infrastructure. The other as a subcontractor on a key federal agency. Aspire has teaming agreements with Northrop Grumman - the #2 federal systems integrator, Tech Mahindra - one of the largest business transformation firms in the world and a Direct hiring agreement with Phase One Consulting Group on its Department of Transportation (DOT) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) programs. The SDVOSB certification helps these companies hit specific government goals as it relates to veteran-owned business credits.    Aspire - Textmunication Partnership:  Textmunication acquired a minority-stake in Aspire gaining government contracting access. The partnership also allows Aspire's management team to open new SMS verticals in the government sector. Aspire is building-out a government contracting operation for the long-term. The combination of government contracting access and new SMS opportunities makes the synergy strong. Textmunication will update the investment community once additional Aspire awards and task orders are won.   Text DEMO to shortcode 87365 to sign up for a demonstration on our SMS solution.  contemplated.

Builds for the Future    PLEASANT HILL, CA / ACCESSWIRE / March 13, 2017 / Textmunication Holdings, Inc. (OTC PINK: TXHD), a cloud-based mobile SMS marketing platform provider, is transforming the SMS landscape through innovative technology and partnerships. The company is in the process of upgrading its leading SMS platform meeting the demands of the growing market.    Textmunication just returned from the International Health, Racquet & Sportsclub Association (IHRSA) convention in Los Angeles. More than 10,000 attendees saw the latest in health club technology and equipment. Two of the biggest challenges facing the fitness industry are member retention and engagement. Textmunication offers a unique SMS platform for the industry. All the leading Club Management Software (CMS) companies use Textmunication's solution. The differentiators are API integration and automated SMS campaigns. Textmunication's software allows for mass delivery, timed messages and automation of the campaigns - versus manually uploading and sending separate text messaging to individual members.   In order to keep up with the demand, Textmunication has made a strategic decision to scale its software platform. Two new Scalability Engineers from one of Silicon Valley's leading technology firms recently joined Textmunication. They are in the final process of delivering a robust and scalable platform capable of sending more than 40M SMS per day.    In addition to the new software platform, Textmunication today signed a Letter of Intent (LOI) to acquire a software-rich and innovative solution addressing fitness, salons, retail, Quick Service Restaurants (QSR), and hospitality verticals. This solution can be integrated into the new SMS platform offering social media integration and engagement tools serving thousands of businesses across the United States. The Silicon Valley entrepreneur has put more than $2M of development resources into the platform and is looking for an innovative communication company to scale the software. An 8-K will be issued shortly on the LOI.    If this transaction is completed, it will provide Textmunication the necessary software to separate itself from the largest SMS providers and offer a proprietary solution substantially increasing the value of the company.                                                        Aspire Consulting Group Awarded Large Government Contract                                                                PLEASANT HILL, CA / ACCESSWIRE / March 6, 2017 / Textmunication Holdings, Inc.

SPARC is a $25B 10-year multiple award performance-based contract. It is available to all components within CMS and all Health and Human Services (HHS) Operating Divisions to procure IT System development services - from end to end. After a protest was filed, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) added Aspire's team to the list of awardees. CMS covers 100 million people through Medicare, Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) and the Health Insurance Marketplace. Awardees will be the primary groups driving any IT efforts at CMS related to 'repeal and replace' efforts and the future of TrumpCare.

	EXPLANATORY NOTE



	 


	This Registration Statement on Form S-1 (the “Registration
	Statement”) is being filed to register the sale of up to 10,000,000 Units at a fixed price of $0.10 per share in a direct
	offering (the “Primary Offering”) and the sale by the selling security holders of up to 22,349,305 common shares (the
	“Secondary Offering”) at a fixed price of $0.10 per share until such time as our common stock is quoted on the OTC
	Bulletin Board or OTCQB.  See “Plan of Distribution” contained in the prospectus.


	 


	We will only receive proceeds under
	the Primary Offering and we will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares in the Secondary Offering, unless warrant holders
	exercise warrants. See “Use of Proceeds,” “Plan of Distribution and Determination of Offering Price” and
	“Dilution” in contained in the prospectus.


	 


	This Registration Statement contains only one prospectus
	and such prospectus will be the sole prospectus for the Primary Offering and the Secondary Offering.



	 






	 









	 














	 





	SUBJECT TO COMPLETION, September
	17, 2014




	 



	The information contained in this prospectus is not complete
	and may be changed. The selling security holders may not sell these securities until the registration statement filed with the
	United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) is effective. This prospectus is not an offer to sell
	these securities and it is not soliciting an offer to buy these securities in any state where the offer or sale is not permitted.


	 



	TEXTMUNICATION HOLDINGS, INC.




	 




	PROSPECTUS



	 



	10,000,000 UNITS




	22,349,305 COMMON SHARES




	 



	We are offering up to 10,000,000 Units in a direct offering
	(the “Primary Offering”). Each Unit consists of one share of common stock and a warrant to purchase one share of common
	stock at an exercise price of $0.25 per share. The warrants expire on December 31, 2017.  Units will not be issued or
	certificated. The shares of common stock and warrants are immediately separable and will be issued separately, but will be purchased
	together in this Offering. The Units will be offered at a fixed price of $0.10 per Unit for the duration of the Primary Offering,
	even if our stock price in the market reflects differently. There is no minimum number of Units that must be sold by us for the
	Primary Offering to proceed and there is no assurance that we will sell any Units under the Primary Offering.  We will
	retain the proceeds from the sale of any of the offered Units.  The Units to be sold by us will be sold on our behalf
	by our President, Wais Asefi, on a best efforts basis.   Mr. Asefi will not receive any commission on proceeds from the
	sale of our common shares on our behalf.  See “Plan of Distribution and Determination of Offering Price.”


	 


	The selling security holders named in
	this prospectus are offering 22,349,305 common shares (the “Secondary Offering”), which includes 750,000 shares of
	common stock, 20,349,305 shares of common stock underlying convertible promissory notes and 1,250,000 shares of common stock underlying
	warrants, all discussed elsewhere in this Prospectus.  We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares being
	sold by selling security holders. We may receive the proceeds from the warrants if exercised.


	 


	The prices at which the selling security
	holders may sell their shares will be at a fixed price of $0.10 per share until such time as the shares of our common stock are
	traded on the OTC Bulletin Board sponsored by FINRA or OTCQB operated by OTC Markets Group, Inc. Although we intend to apply for
	quotation of our common stock on the OTC Bulletin Board or OTCQB through a market maker, public trading of our common stock may
	never materialize.  If our common stock becomes traded on the OTC Bulletin Board or OTCQB, then the sale price to the
	public will vary according to prevailing market prices or privately negotiated prices by the selling shareholders.


	 


	The selling security holders may resell
	their shares to or through underwriters, broker-dealers or agents, who may receive compensation in the form of discounts, concessions
	or commissions.  In addition, the selling security holders and any broker-dealers who execute sales for the selling security
	holders may be deemed to be an “underwriter” in connection with such sales.  The selling security holders
	named in this prospectus will bear the costs of all commission or discounts, if any, attributable to the sale of their shares.  We
	are bearing the costs, expenses and fees associated with the registration of the common shares in this prospectus.  See
	“Plan of Distribution and Determination of Offering Price.”


	 


	The Primary Offering and the Secondary
	Offering will terminate nine months after this registration statement is declared effective by the SEC.  We plan to continue
	to update the registration statement and prospectus for the exercise of the warrants that comprise the Units even after the Offering
	of the Units has terminated. We do not have any arrangements to place any proceeds of the offering in escrow, trust or any other

	SUMMARY



	 



	As used in this prospectus, unless
	the context otherwise requires, “we,” “us,” “our,” the “Company” and “TXHD”
	refers to Textmunication Holdings, Inc.  All dollar amounts in this prospectus are in U.S. dollars unless otherwise stated.
	You should read the entire prospectus before making an investment decision to purchase our common shares.



	 



	About Us



	 


	We were formed in October 1984 in the
	State of Georgia as Brock Control Systems.  Founded by Richard T. Brock, we were in the sales automation market and an
	early developer of enterprise customer management systems.  We went public at the end of March of 1993.  In
	February of 1996, we changed our name to Brock International Inc., and in March of 1998, we again changed our name to Firstwave
	Technologies, Inc.


	 


	In 2007, we deregistered our common
	stock in order to avoid the expenses of being a public company.  The company reported briefly on the OTC Disclosure &
	News Service in 2008 but not for long.  We again changed our name to FSTWV, Inc.


	 


	On October 28, 2013, we held a shareholder
	meeting to reincorporate our company in the State of Nevada and concurrently change our name to Textmunication Holdings, Inc.  We
	also voted to approve a 1 for 5 reverse split of our outstanding common stock.


	 


	Following our shareholder meeting, on
	November 16, 2013, we entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (SEA) with Textmunication, Inc. a California corporation and Wais
	Asefi (its sole shareholder), whereby we issued 65,640,207 new shares of common stock in exchange for 100% of the issued and outstanding
	shares of Textmunication, Inc. and simultaneously the major shareholder of the company retired 1,128,041 post reverse shares (pre-split:
	5,640,207) of our common stock to the company’s treasury.  As a result of the SEA, we acquired Textmunication,
	Inc. and have assumed its business operations. We are now in the mobile marketing business.


	 


	Our principal executive office is located
	at 1940 Contra Costa Blvd. Pleasant Hill, CA 94523 and our telephone number is (925)-777-2111.


	 



	Overview of Our Business



	 


	We are engaged in the mobile marketing
	and loyalty space industry, providing cutting-edge mobile marketing solutions, rewards and loyalty to our clients. With a powerful
	yet intuitive suite of services, clients are able to reach more customers faster and reward them for repeat business. We help clients
	reach their marketing and revenue goals by educating clients with the most effective tools in mobile marketing, rewards, paperless
	redemption and loyalty.


	 


	For the past 4 years, we have grown
	to over 800 clients in the United States, Canada and Mexico.  Our goal is to achieve 15,000 clients by the fourth quarter
	of 2014.  We hope to achieve this by expanding our focus to include more restaurants, retailers, entertainment venues
	and partnership opportunities, which already have a relationship with our target market to help both monetize and deliver ROI to
	joint clients.

	RISK FACTORS



	 


	An investment in our common shares involves a high degree
	of risk.  You should carefully consider the risks described below and the other information in this prospectus before
	investing in our common shares. If any of the following risks occur, our business, operating results and financial condition could
	be seriously harmed. The trading price of our common shares, if we publicly trade at a later date, could decline due to any of
	these risks, and you may lose all or part of your investment.


	 




	Risks Related to Our Financial Condition




	 



	If we do not obtain additional financing, our business
	expansion plans will be delayed and we may not achieve profitable operations.



	 


	We may not realize sufficient proceeds
	from this Offering to further business development, or to provide adequate cash flow for planned business activities. At June
	30, 2014 we had cash on hand of $6,627 and accumulated a deficit of $292,594. We currently have $594 cash on hand. Our monthly
	expenses have historically been approximately $18,000 and we have had sufficient revenues to cover those expenses in the past.
	The added costs of going public have resulted in a monthly burn rate of approximately $10,600 in recent months.  Thus,
	even though our revenues fund most of our operating expenses, we have taken on small loans to help bridge the gap with the onset
	of accounting and professional fees in connection with going public. We have raised approximately $160,000 in small loans since
	September 2013. There is no guarantee that these small loans will be available to us in the future. We expect that we will not
	be able to continue operations beyond 6 months with our current available capital resources, which presently consist of $594 in
	cash and our monthly revenues, without obtaining additional funding or generating more revenues. We will need at a minimum $100,000
	in capital to fund operations in the next 12 months.


	 


	We plan to ramp up operations to generate
	additional revenues beyond our existing revenues but this will require additional funding. We anticipate that additional funding
	will be needed for general administrative expenses, business development, marketing costs and support materials. We hope to raise
	$1,000,000 in this Offering to conduct such activities in the next twelve months.


	 


	We do not currently have any arrangements
	for financing and our obtaining additional financing will be subject to a number of factors, including general market conditions,
	investor acceptance of our plan of operations and initial results from our business operations.  There is no assurance
	that any additional financing will be available or if available, on terms that will be acceptable to us. Failure to raise additional
	financing will cause us to go out of business. If this happens, you could lose all or part of your investment.


	 


	If our resources are insufficient to
	satisfy our cash requirements, we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain a credit facility. The sale of
	additional equity securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders. The incurrence of indebtedness would result
	in increased debt service obligations and could result in operating and financing covenants that would restrict our operations.
	We cannot assure you that financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all.



	 




	We have a limited operating history
	and may never be able to carry out our plan of operations or achieve any significant revenues or profitability.  At this stage
	of our business, even with our good faith efforts, potential investors have a high probability of losing their entire investment.




	 



	We are subject to all of the risks inherent in the establishment
	of a new business enterprise. The likelihood of our success must be considered in light of the problems, expenses, difficulties,
	complications and delays frequently encountered by a small emerging growth company starting a new business enterprise and the highly
	competitive environment in which we will operate. Since we have a limited operating history, we cannot assure you that our business
	will be profitable or that we will ever generate sufficient revenues to fully meet our expenses and totally support our anticipated
	activities. Any profitability in the future from our business will be dependent upon the successful development, marketing and
	sales of our mobile marketing systems and future products. Accordingly, we may not be able to successfully carry out our plan of
	operations and any investor may lose their entire investment.


	 



	There is substantial doubt about our ability to continue
	as a going concern.



	 


	At June 30, 2014, we have a working
	capital deficit of $239,607 and an accumulated deficit of $292,594 since inception to June 30, 2014. These factors, among others,
	raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our ability to generate future revenues will depend
	on a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include general economic conditions, market acceptance
	of our mobile marketing systems, proposed products and competitive efforts. Due to these factors, we cannot anticipate with any
	degree of certainty what our revenues will be in future periods. As such, our independent registered public accountants have expressed
	substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. This opinion could materially limit our ability to raise additional
	funds by issuing new debt or equity securities or otherwise. You should consider our independent registered public accountant’s
	comments when determining if an investment our company is suitable.

	Risks Related To Our Business




	 



	We operate in an immature industry and have a relatively
	new business model, which makes it difficult to evaluate our business and prospects.



	 


	We derive nearly all of our revenue from the sale of marketing
	services, which is an immature industry that has undergone rapid and dramatic changes in its short history. The industry in which
	we operate is characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards, and changing user and client demands.
	Our business model is also evolving and is distinct from many other companies in our industry, and it may not be successful. As
	a result of these factors, the future revenue and income potential of our business is uncertain. Any evaluation of our business
	and our prospects must be considered in light of these factors and the risks and uncertainties often encountered by companies in
	an immature industry with an evolving business model such as ours. Some of these risks and uncertainties relate to our ability
	to:


	 




	 



	●




	maintain and expand client relationships;





	 



	●




	sustain and increase the number of customers on behalf of our clients marketing plans;





	 



	●




	manage our expanding operations and implement and improve our operational, financial and management controls;





	 



	●




	raise capital at attractive costs, or at all;





	 



	●




	successfully expand our footprint with existing clients and enter new client arrangments;





	 



	●




	respond effectively to competition and potential negative effects of competition on profit margins;





	 



	●




	attract and retain qualified management, employees and independent service providers;





	 



	●




	successfully introduce new processes and technologies and upgrade our existing technologies and services; and





	 



	●




	respond to government regulations relating to the Internet, marketing in our client verticals, personal data protection, email, software technologies and other aspects of our business.





	 


	If we are unable to address these risks, our business, results
	of operations and prospects could suffer.


	 



	Our operating results may fluctuate and our future revenues
	and profitability are uncertain.



	 


	Our operating results have varied in the past and may fluctuate
	significantly in the future as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside our control. These factors include the
	following:


	 




	 



	●




	current global economic and financial conditions as well as their impact on e-commerce, financial services, and the communications and Internet industries;





	 



	●




	our success in direct marketing and promotional campaigns;





	 



	●




	any changes to the scope and success of marketing efforts by third-parties;





	 



	●




	market acceptance of our services by our new customers;





	 



	●




	customer renewal rates and turnover of customers of our services,





	 



	●




	continued development of our distribution channels for our products and services;





	 



	●




	the impact of price changes in our products and services or our competitors' products and services;





	 



	●




	the impact of decisions by distributors to offer competing or replacement products or modify or cease their marketing practices;





	 



	●




	the availability of alternatives to our products;





	 



	●




	seasonal fluctuations in business activity;





	 



	●




	changes in marketing expenses related to promoting and distributing our services





	 



	●




	potential attacks, including hacktivism, by nefarious actors, which could threaten the perceived reliability of our products and services;





	 



	●




	changes in policies regarding Internet administration imposed by governments or governmental authorities outside the U.S.;





	 



	●




	potential disruptions in regional registration behaviors due to catastrophic natural events or armed conflict; and





	 



	●




	changes in the level of spending for information technology-related products and services by our customers.





	  







	4











	Table of Contents













	 


	Our operating expenses may increase.
	If an increase in our expenses is not accompanied by a corresponding increase in our revenues, our operating results will suffer,
	particularly as revenues from some of our services are recognized ratably over the term of the service, rather than immediately
	when the customer pays for them, unlike our sales and marketing expenditures, which are expensed in full when incurred. From our
	inception through June 30, 2014 we experienced a net loss of $292,594 from our business operations.


	 


	Due to all of the above factors, our revenues and operating
	results are difficult to forecast. Therefore, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our operating results will not necessarily
	be meaningful, and you should not rely upon them as an indication of future performance. Also, operating results may fall below
	our expectations and the expectations of securities analysts or investors in one or more future periods. If this were to occur,
	the market price of our common stock would likely decline.


	 



	The online and mobile marketing industry is highly competitive
	with many diverse competitors.



	 


	Many of our competitors are better funded than we are.  The
	technology we rely on to generate revenue is changing rapidly and we may not be able to keep up with the technological developments.  We
	do not hold patents or have any protectable intellectual property at this time that will prevent other competitors from developing
	our identical products and services and thereby controlling the market share of our industry.


	 



	If we do not effectively manage our growth, our operating
	performance will suffer and we may lose clients.



	 


	We hope to experience, and to a certain extent have experienced,
	rapid growth in our operations, and we expect to experience further growth in our business, both through acquisitions and internally.
	This growth has placed, and will continue to place, significant demands on our management and our operational and financial infrastructure.
	In particular, continued rapid growth and acquisitions may make it more difficult for us to accomplish the following:


	 




	 



	●




	Successfully scale our technology to accommodate a larger business and integrate acquisitions;





	 



	●




	maintain our standing with key vendors, including Internet search companies and third-party website publishers;





	 



	●




	maintain our client service standards; and





	 



	●




	develop and improve our operational, financial and management controls and maintain adequate reporting systems and procedures.






	In addition, our personnel, systems, procedures and controls may be inadequate to support our future operations. The improvements
	required to manage our growth will require us to make significant expenditures, expand, train and manage our employee base and
	allocate valuable management resources. If we fail to effectively manage our growth, our operating performance will suffer and
	we may lose clients, key vendors and key personnel.


	 



	We cannot assure you that our growth strategy will be
	successful which may result in a negative impact on our growth, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.



	 


	One of our strategies is to expand our client base through
	marketing and client acquisition programs. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully grow our client base to a
	level that is needed to sustain ourselves and become profitable. Our inability to implement this growth strategy successfully may
	have a negative impact on our growth, future financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.


	 



	Poor perception of our business or industry as a result
	of the actions of third parties could harm our reputation and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of
	operations.



	 


	Our business is dependent on attracting a large number of
	visitors to our clients’ websites and providing leads and clicks to our clients, which depends in part on our reputation
	within the industry and with our clients. There are companies within our industry that regularly engage in activities that our
	clients’ customers may view as unlawful or inappropriate. These activities, such as spyware or deceptive promotions, by third
	parties may be seen by clients as characteristic of participants in our industry and, therefore, may have an adverse effect on
	the reputation of all participants in our industry, including us. Any damage to our reputation, including from publicity from legal
	proceedings against us or companies that work within our industry, governmental proceedings, consumer class action litigation,
	or the disclosure of information security breaches or private information misuse, could adversely affect our business, financial
	condition and results of operations.

	If we fail to compete effectively against other online
	and mobile marketing companies and other competitors, we could lose clients and our revenue may decline.



	 


	The market for online and mobile marketing is intensely competitive.
	We expect this competition to continue to increase in the future. We perceive only limited barriers to entry to the online marketing
	industry. We plan to compete both for clients and for limited high quality advertising inventory. We also plan to compete for clients
	on the basis of a number of factors, including return on marketing expenditures, price, and client service.


	 


	We plan to compete with Internet and traditional media companies
	for a share of clients’ overall marketing budgets, including:


	 




	 



	●




	online or mobile marketing or media services providers;

	offline and online advertising agencies;





	 



	●




	major Internet portals and search engine companies with advertising networks such as Google, Yahoo!, MSN, and AOL;





	 



	●




	other online marketing service providers, including online affiliate advertising networks and industry-specific portals or lead generation companies;





	 



	●




	website publishers with their own sales forces that sell their online marketing services directly to clients;





	 



	●




	in-house marketing groups at current or potential clients;





	 



	●




	offline direct marketing agencies; and





	 



	●




	television, radio and print companies.






	As a result, we may not be able to compete successfully. Competition from other marketing service providers’ on- and offline
	offerings could affect both volume and price, and thus revenue. If we fail to deliver results that are superior to those that other
	online marketing service providers achieve, we could lose clients and our revenue may decline.


	 



	If the market for online marketing services fails to continue
	to develop, our future growth may be limited and our revenue may decrease.



	 


	The online and mobile marketing services market is relatively
	new and rapidly evolving, and it uses different measurements than traditional media to gauge its effectiveness. Some of our current
	or potential clients have little or no experience using the Internet for advertising and marketing purposes and have allocated
	only limited portions of their advertising and marketing budgets to the Internet. The adoption of Internet and mobile advertising,
	particularly by those entities that have historically relied upon traditional media for advertising, requires the acceptance of
	a new way of conducting business, exchanging information and evaluating new advertising and marketing technologies and services.
	In particular, we are dependent on our clients’ adoption of new metrics to measure the success of online marketing campaigns.
	We may also experience resistance from traditional advertising agencies who may be advising our clients. We cannot assure you that
	the market for online marketing services will continue to grow. If the market for online marketing services fails to continue to
	develop or develops more slowly than we anticipate, our ability to grow our business may be limited and our revenue may decrease.


	 



	Unauthorized access to or accidental disclosure of consumer
	personally-identifiable information that we collect may cause us to incur significant expenses and may negatively affect our credibility
	and business.



	 


	There is growing concern over the security of personal information
	transmitted over the Internet, consumer identity theft and user privacy. Despite our implementation of security measures, our computer
	systems may be susceptible to electronic or physical computer break-ins, viruses and other disruptions and security breaches. Any
	perceived or actual unauthorized disclosure of personally-identifiable information regarding website visitors, whether through
	breach of our network by an unauthorized party, employee theft, misuse or error or otherwise, could harm our reputation, impair
	our ability to attract website visitors and attract and retain our clients, or subject us to claims or litigation arising from
	damages suffered by consumers, and thereby harm our business and operating results. In addition, we could incur significant costs
	in complying with the multitude of state, federal and foreign laws regarding the unauthorized disclosure of personal information.

	If we fail to keep pace with rapidly-changing
	technologies and industry standards, we could lose clients or advertising inventory and our results of operations may suffer.



	 


	The business lines in which we currently compete are characterized
	by rapidly changing Internet and mobile marketing standards, changing technologies, frequent new product and service introductions,
	and changing user and client demands. The introduction of new technologies and services embodying new technologies and the emergence
	of new industry standards and practices could render our existing technologies and services obsolete and unmarketable or require
	unanticipated investments in technology. Our future success will depend in part on our ability to adapt to these rapidly-changing
	Internet and mobile media formats and other technologies. We will need to enhance our existing technologies and services and develop
	and introduce new technologies and services to address our clients’ changing demands. If we fail to adapt successfully to
	such developments or timely introduce new technologies and services, we could lose clients, our expenses could increase and we
	could lose advertising inventory.


	 



	Limitations on our ability to collect and use data derived
	from user activities could significantly diminish the value of our services and cause us to lose clients and revenue.



	 


	When a user visits our clients’ websites, we use technologies,
	including “cookies”, to collect information such as the user’s Internet Protocol, or IP, address, offerings delivered
	by us that have been previously viewed by the user and responses by the user to those offerings. In order to determine the effectiveness
	of a marketing campaign and to determine how to modify the campaign, we need to access and analyze this information. The use of
	cookies has been the subject of regulatory scrutiny and litigation and users are able to block or delete cookies from their browser.
	Periodically, certain of our clients and publishers seek to prohibit or limit our collection or use of this data. Interruptions,
	failures or defects in our data collection systems, as well as privacy concerns regarding the collection of user data, could also
	limit our ability to analyze data from our clients’ marketing campaigns. This risk is heightened when we deliver marketing
	services to clients in the financial and medical services client verticals. If our access to data is limited in the future, we
	may be unable to provide effective technologies and services to clients and we may lose clients and revenue.


	 



	We are exposed to the credit risk of our customers, which
	could result in material losses and negatively impact our operating results.



	 


	Most of our sales are on an open credit basis, with typical
	payment terms of net 30 days. If any of our customers becomes insolvent or suffers a deterioration in its financial or business
	condition and is unable to pay for our services, our results of operations could be harmed.


	 



	We are an “emerging growth company” and we
	cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less
	attractive to investors.



	 


	We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined
	in the Jumpstart our Business Startups Act of 2012, and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements
	that are applicable to other public companies, including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation
	requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic
	reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation
	and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We cannot predict if investors will find our
	common stock less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive
	as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.


	 


	Under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, “emerging
	growth companies” can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private
	companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves to this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore,
	we will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not “emerging growth
	companies.”

	Risks Related to Our Management and Control Persons




	 



	Because Wais Asefi currently owns 93% of our outstanding
	Common Stock, investors may find that corporate decisions influenced by Mr. Asefi are inconsistent with the best interests of other
	stockholders

	.




	 


	Mr. Asefi currently owns 93% of the outstanding shares of
	our Common Stock. Accordingly, Mr. Asefi will have a significant influence in determining the outcome of all corporate transactions
	or other matters, including mergers, consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets, and also the power
	to prevent or cause a change in control. While we have no current plans with regard to any merger, consolidation or sale of substantially
	all of our assets, the interests of Mr. Asefi may still differ from the interests of the other stockholders.


	 



	Our sole officer and director may leave us if we are unable
	to repay the $50,000 note that he guaranteed with his personal shares.



	 


	In order to obtain a loan of $50,000, our sole officer and
	director had to pledge 59,400,000 of his personal shares to the lender.  If we default on the loan, the lender could
	foreclose on those shares and there would be a considerable change in control of our company.  We may lose the services
	of Mr. Asefi if that happens, which will adversely impact our ability to implement our business plan and survive.


	 



	Because we have a substantial financial commitment to
	our Chief Executive Officer through an employment agreement, funds may be diverted away from other important matters in the development
	of our business plan and could negatively impact our financial position.



	 


	We entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Asefi, our
	officer and director. The agreement continues until May 1, 2017 and provides annual compensation of $100,000. This is a lot of
	money for us to pay. We have limited funds available and any money we are able to raise combined with our existing cash balances
	will be needed to fulfill this substantial financial commitment. We may not be able to raise enough money to fund the contract.
	In addition, money that could be spent elsewhere will be needed to fund the contract, and will divert funds away from other important
	matters in the development of our business plan and could negatively impact our financial position.


	 



	The loss of key management personnel could adversely affect
	our ability to continue operations.



	 


	We are entirely dependent on the efforts of our CEO, President
	and Chief Financial Officer because of the time and effort that he devotes to us. He is in charge of overseeing all development
	strategies, supervising any/all future personnel, including any consultants or contractors that we will engage to assist in developing
	our business model, and the establishment of our future sales team. Their loss, or other key personnel in the future, could have
	a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We do not maintain “key person”
	life insurance on our officers, directors or key employees. Our success will depend on the performance of Mr. Asefi and our ability
	to attract and motivate other key personnel.


	 



	The lack of public company experience of our sole officer
	and director could adversely impact our ability to comply with the reporting requirements of U.S. Securities laws.



	 


	Our sole officer and director, Mr. Asefi, has no experience
	managing a public company, which could adversely impact our ability to comply with legal, regulatory, and reporting requirements
	of U.S. Securities laws.  Our management may not be able to implement programs and policies in an effective and timely manner
	to adequately respond to such legal, regulatory and reporting requirements, including the establishment and maintenance of internal
	controls over financial reporting. Any such deficiencies, weaknesses or lack of compliance could have a materially adverse effect
	on our ability to comply with the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which are necessary to maintain
	public company status. If we were to fail to fulfill those obligations, our ability to operate as a U.S. public company would be
	in jeopardy in which event you could lose your entire investment in our company. Our ability to operate successfully may depend
	on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel with appropriate experience in the management of a public company.
	 Our ability to find and retain qualified personnel on our terms and budget may be very limited.

	Risks Related To Ownership of Our Shares




	 



	As there is no minimum for our Primary Offering, if only
	a few persons purchase Units, they may lose their investment as we may be unable to make a significant attempt to implement our
	business plan.



	 


	Since there is no minimum amount of Units that must be sold
	directly under this Primary Offering, if a limited number of Units are sold, we may not have enough capital to fully implement
	our plan of operations. As such, we may not be able to meet the objectives we state in this prospectus, or eliminate the “going
	concern” modification in the reports of our auditors as to uncertainty with respect to our ability to continue as a going
	concern. If we fail to raise sufficient capital, we would expect to have insufficient funds for our ongoing operating expenses.
	Any significant lack of funds will curtail the growth of our business and may cause our business to fail.  If our business
	fails, investors will lose their entire investment.


	 



	We are selling this Primary Offering without an underwriter
	and may be unable to sell any Units.



	 


	This Primary Offering is self-underwritten, that is, we are
	not going to engage the services of an underwriter to sell the Units.  We intend to sell our Units through our President,
	Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer who will receive no commissions or other remuneration from any sales made hereunder.
	They will offer the Units to friends, family members, and business associates; however, there is no guarantee that they will be
	able to sell any of the Units. Unless they are successful in selling all of the Units and we receive the maximum amount of proceeds
	from this Primary Offering, we may have to seek alternative financing to implement our plan of operations.

	We may have difficulty selling shares under our Primary
	Offering because the selling shareholders are concurrently offering their shares under the Secondary Offering.



	 


	We may have difficulty selling shares under our Primary Offering
	because we may be competing with the selling security holders who are concurrently offering their shares under the Secondary Offering.
	In the event that our common shares are quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board or OTCQB, the selling security holders will not be required
	to sell their shares at a fixed price of $0.10 per share.  Accordingly, the selling security holders may reduce the price
	of their shares which may hinder our ability to sell any shares under the Primary Offering.


	 



	If we do not keep this registration
	statement updated for the term of the warrants, the stockholders will not be able to exercise the warrants under the registration
	statement.



	 


	Warrant holders may seek to exercise
	their warrants to obtain common stock that they could sell in the public market. However, an effective registration statement and
	current prospectus must exist for the warrant holders to exercise their warrants. In the event a current prospectus is not available
	when a warrant holder wishes to exercise, the warrant holder will be unable to exercise their warrants at such time that the warrant
	holder wishes or when it would be economically advisable for the warrant holder. Upon exercise, the underlying common stock can
	be sold pursuant to this prospectus (which we intend to update for the earlier of September 30, 2017, the date the warrants expire,
	or until all the warrants have been exercised). There is no assurance that we will be able to keep such prospectus effective
	for that long.  In the event that the prospectus is not effective at a time that the shareholder wishes to sell common
	stock underlying the warrants, the shareholder may find it difficult to sell such common stock.


	 



	We will likely conduct further offerings
	of our equity securities in the future, in which case your proportionate interest may become diluted.



	 


	Since our inception, we have relied
	on sales of our common shares to fund our operations.  We will likely be required to conduct additional equity offerings
	in the future to finance our current projects or to finance subsequent projects that we decide to undertake. If common shares are
	issued in return for additional funds, the price per share could be lower than that paid by our current shareholders. We anticipate
	continuing to rely on equity sales of our common shares in order to fund our business operations. If we issue additional shares,
	your percentage interest in us could become diluted.


	 



	Because we do not plan to register
	our common stock under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act until December 31, 2014, we will be subject to periodic reporting requirements
	only under Section 15(d), which requirements are less extensive than those applicable to a fully reporting company that has registered
	a class of securities under Section 12 of the Exchange Act and thus there will be less publicly available information available
	to investors during such time.



	 


	As we will not register our common stock
	under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act until December of 2014, we will be subject to periodic reporting requirements under Section
	15(d) which are less extensive than those applicable to a fully reporting company that has registered a class of securities under
	Section 12 of the Exchange Act until such date. For example, as a Section 15(d) reporting company, we are not subject to the proxy
	rules, Section 16 short-swing profits prohibitions, and reporting requirements under Sections 13(d) and (g) of the Exchange Act
	that we would be if we did register our common stock under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act prior to December of 2014 and thus
	there will be less publicly available information available to investors during such time.

	If we do not file a registration
	statement under Form 8-A to become subject to the reporting requirements under Section 12 of the Exchange Act prior to December
	31, 2014, our periodic reporting obligations under Section 15(d) will be suspended in the event the number of record shareholders
	is less than 300, which could adversely affect investors in that less information would be available and we could lose the qualification
	of our securities to be quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board or OTCQB.




	 



	If we do not file a registration statement
	under Form 8-A to become subject to the reporting requirements under Section 12 of the Exchange Act prior to December 31, 2014,
	the end of our first full fiscal year during which time we are required to file periodic reports with the SEC under Section 15(d)
	of the Exchange Act [including an annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014], our periodic reporting
	obligations under Section 15(d) will be suspended in the event the number of record shareholders is less than 300, which could
	adversely affect investors in that less information would be available and we could lose the qualification of our securities to
	be quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board or OTCQB. We will no longer be obligated to file periodic reports with SEC and your access
	to our business information will be restricted.  In addition, if we do not become a reporting issuer, we will not be
	required to furnish proxy statements to security holders, and our directors, officers and principal beneficial owners will not
	be required to report their beneficial ownership of securities to the SEC pursuant to Section 16 of the Exchange Act.


	 



	If a market for our common shares
	does not develop, shareholders may be unable to sell their shares.



	 


	Our common stock is quoted on the
	OTCPinks operated by OTC Markets Group, Inc. under the symbol “TXHD.” On August 11, 2014, the last reported sale
	price of our common stock as reported on the OTCPinks was $0.20 per share.  There is not an active trading market for
	our stock. We intend to apply for quotation of our common shares on the OTC Bulletin Board or OTCQB.  However, we can
	provide no assurance that our shares will be approved for quotation on the OTC Bulletin Board or, if traded, that a public market
	will materialize.  If our common shares are not quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board or OTCQB or if a public market for
	our common shares does not develop, shareholders may not be able to re-sell the common shares that they have purchased and may
	lose all of their investment.


	 



	Because our directors are not independent they can make
	and control corporate decisions that may be disadvantageous to other common shareholders.



	 


	We intend to apply to have our common shares quoted on the
	OTC Bulletin Board inter-dealer quotation system or OTCQB, neither of which have director independence requirements.  Using
	the definition of “independent” in NASDAQ Rule 5605(a)(2), we have determined that none of our directors are independent.
	Our directors have a significant influence in determining the outcome of all corporate transactions or other matters, including
	mergers, consolidations, and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets.  They also have the power to prevent
	or cause a change in control. The interests of our directors may differ from the interests of the other stockholders and thus result
	in corporate decisions that are disadvantageous to other shareholders.


	 



	We have never declared or paid any cash dividends or distributions
	on our capital stock. And we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.



	 


	We have never declared or paid any cash dividends or distributions
	on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, to support operations and to finance expansion
	and therefore we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.


	 


	The declaration, payment and amount of any future dividends
	will be made at the discretion of the board of directors, and will depend upon, among other things, the results of our operations,
	cash flows and financial condition, operating and capital requirements, and other factors as the board of directors considers relevant.
	There is no assurance that future dividends will be paid, and, if dividends are paid, there is no assurance with respect to the
	amount of any such dividend.

	Our securities are considered a penny stock.



	 


	Because our securities are considered a penny stock, shareholders
	will be more limited in their ability to sell their shares. Broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in “penny
	stocks” are regulated by penny stock rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Penny stocks generally are
	equity securities with a price of less than $5.00 (other than securities registered on some national securities exchanges or quoted
	on Nasdaq). The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the
	rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document that provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level
	of risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for
	the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction, and, if the broker-dealer is the
	sole market maker, the broker-dealer must disclose this fact and the broker-dealer’s presumed control over the market, and
	monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer’s account. In addition, broker-dealers
	who sell these securities to persons other than established customers and “accredited investors” must make a special
	written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser’s written
	agreement to the transaction. Consequently, these requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity, if
	any, in the secondary market for a security subject to the penny stock rules, and investors in our common stock may find it difficult
	to sell their shares.



	 







	CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING
	STATEMENTS



	 



	This prospectus contains forward-looking statements that
	involve risks and uncertainties.  We use words such as anticipate, believe, plan, expect, future, intend and similar
	expressions to identify such forward-looking statements.  The actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking
	statements.  Our actual results are most likely to differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking
	statements for many reasons, including the risks faced by us described in this Risk Factors section and elsewhere in this prospectus.

	The principal purposes of this offering is to raise sufficient
	capital for us to implement our business plan, become a reporting under the Exchange Act and create a public market for our common
	shares.  If we are unable to sell any shares under the Primary Offering, we have sufficient funds to pay the costs of
	this offering.  However, expenses associated with meeting our reporting obligations under the Exchange Act will take
	priority over anything else.

	PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION AND DETERMINATION
	OF OFFERING PRICE



	 



	Primary Offering



	 


	We are offering 10,000,000 Units at a fixed price of $0.10
	per share even if a public trading market for our common shares develops.  The $0.10 fixed per Unit offering price for
	the duration of this offering was arbitrarily chosen by management. There is no relationship between this price and our assets,
	earnings, book value or any other objective criteria of value.


	 


	This offering is being made by us without the use of outside
	underwriters or broker-dealers.  The Units to be sold by us will be sold on our behalf by our President, Wais Asefi.  Mr.
	Asefi will not receive commissions or proceeds or other compensation from the sale of any shares on our behalf.


	 


	Mr. Asefi will not register as a broker-dealer pursuant to
	Section 15 of the Exchange Act, in reliance upon Rule 3a4-1, which sets forth those conditions under which a person associated
	with an issuer may participate in the offering of the issuer's securities and not be deemed to be a broker-dealer.


	 





	1




	Mr. Asefi is not subject to a statutory disqualification, as that term is defined in Section 3(a)(39) of the Act, at the time of his participation;





	 


	 





	2




	Mr. Asefi will not be compensated in connection with his participation by the payment of commissions or other remuneration based either directly or indirectly on transactions in securities;





	 


	 





	3




	Mr. Asefi is not, nor will he be at the time of participation in the offering, an associated person of a broker-dealer; and





	 


	 





	4




	Mr. Asefi meets the conditions of paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of Rule 3a4

	-

	1 of the Exchange Act, in that he: (A) primarily performs, or is intended primarily to perform at the end of the offering, substantial duties for or on behalf of our company, other than in connection with transactions in securities; and (B) is not a broker or dealer, or been an associated person of a broker or dealer, within the preceding twelve months; and (C) has not participated in selling and offering securities for any issuer more than once every twelve months other than in reliance on paragraphs (a)(4)(i) or (a)(4)(iii).





	 



	Secondary Offering



	 


	The selling security holders named in
	this prospectus may sell their shares on a continuous or delayed basis for a period of nine months after this registration statement
	is declared effective. We plan to continue to update the registration statement and prospectus for the exercise of the warrants
	that comprise the Units even after the Offering of the Units has terminated. The selling security holders may sell some or
	all of their shares in one or more transactions, including block transactions:


	 





	1




	On such public markets as the shares may from time to time be trading;





	 


	 





	2




	In privately negotiated transactions;





	 


	 





	3




	Through the writing of options on the shares;





	 


	 





	4




	In short sales; or





	 


	 





	5




	In any combination of these methods of distribution.





	 


	The selling security holders named in this prospectus may
	also sell their shares directly to market makers acting as agents in unsolicited brokerage transactions.  Any broker
	or dealer participating in such transactions as agent may receive a commission from the selling security holders, or, if they act
	as agent for the purchaser of such shares, from such purchaser. The selling security holders will likely pay the usual and customary
	brokerage fees for such services.


	 


	We are bearing all costs relating to
	the registration of this offering.  The selling security holders, however, will pay any commissions or other fees payable
	to brokers or dealers in connection with any sale of the shares.

	Table of Contents









	 



	Concurrent Offerings



	 


	Our Primary Offering will continue to
	have a fixed price of $0.10 per share even if a public trading market for our common shares develops. The selling shareholders
	can sell shares under the Secondary Offering at a fixed price of $0.10 per share until such time as the shares of our common stock
	are traded on the OTC Bulletin Board sponsored by FINRA or OTCQB operated by OTC Markets Group, Inc. Although we intend to apply
	for quotation of our common stock on the OTC Bulletin Board or OTCQB through a market maker, public trading of our common stock
	may never materialize.  If our common stock becomes traded on the OTC Bulletin Board or OTCQB, then the sale price to
	the public will vary according to prevailing market prices or privately negotiated prices by the selling shareholders.


	 



	Stabilization and Other Activities



	 


	The selling shareholders must comply with the requirements
	of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act in the offer and sale of the common stock.  In particular,
	during such times as the selling shareholders may be deemed to be engaged in a distribution of the common stock, and therefore
	be considered to be an underwriter, they must comply with applicable law and may, among other things:


	 




	 



	1. 




	not engage in any stabilization activities in connection with our common stock;





	 


	 


	 




	 



	2. 




	furnish each broker or dealer through which common stock may be offered, such copies of  this prospectus, as amended from time to time, as may be required by such broker or dealer; and;





	 


	 


	 




	 



	3. 




	not bid for or purchase any of our securities or attempt to induce any person  to purchase any of our securities other than as permitted under the Securities Exchange  Act.






	 







	DILUTION



	 


	Our historical net tangible book
	deficit as of June 30, 2014 was ($255,227) or ($0.00) per share. Historical net tangible book deficit per share of common stock
	is equal to our total tangible assets less total liabilities, divided by the number of shares of common stock outstanding as of
	June 30, 2014. Adjusted to give effect to the receipt of net proceeds of $963,129 from the sale of the maximum of 10,000,000 shares
	of common stock for gross proceeds of $1,000,000, net tan

	g

	ible book value will be approximately $0.01 per share. This will
	represent an immediate increase of approximately $0.01 per share to existing stockholders and an immediate and substantial dilution
	of approximately $0.09 per share, or approximately 90%, to new investors purchasing our securities in this offering. Dilution
	in pro forma net tangible book value per share represents the difference between the amount per share paid by purchasers of shares
	of our common stock in this offering and the pro forma net tangible book value per share of our common stock immediately following
	this offering.

	we will receive $713,129 after offering expenses have been deducted. If 50% of the offered Units are sold we would receive $463,129
	after offering expenses have been deducted.  We must sell 368,710 Units (or 4% of the Offering) to cover the estimated costs
	of this Offering. If we sell less than 368,710 of our Units under the Offering, we will not have sufficient proceeds to cover repaying
	our offering expenses and we will have to pay the remainder of such expenses out of additional financing we have not yet received.

	DESCRIPTION OF SECURITIES



	 


	Our authorized capital stock consists
	of 200,000,000 shares of common stock, with a par value of $0.001 per share, and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value
	$0.0001 per share. As of June 30, 2014 there were 67,082,167 shares of our common stock issued and outstanding. Our shares are
	currently held by 87 stockholders of record. We have not issued any shares of preferred stock.


	 



	Common Stock



	 


	Our common stock is entitled to one vote per share on all
	matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders, including the election of directors. Except as otherwise required by law or provided
	in any resolution adopted by our board of directors with respect to any series of preferred stock, the holders of our common stock
	will possess all voting power. Generally, all matters to be voted on by stockholders must be approved by a majority (or, in the
	case of election of directors, by a plurality) of the votes entitled to be cast by all shares of our common stock that are present
	in person or represented by proxy, subject to any voting rights granted to holders of any preferred stock. Holders of our common
	stock representing fifty percent (50%) of our capital stock issued, outstanding and entitled to vote, represented in person or
	by proxy, are necessary to constitute a quorum at any meeting of our stockholders. A vote by the holders of a majority of our outstanding
	shares is required to effectuate certain fundamental corporate changes such as liquidation, merger or an amendment to our Articles
	of Incorporation. Our Articles of Incorporation do not provide for cumulative voting in the election of directors.


	 


	Subject to any preferential rights of any outstanding series
	of preferred stock created by our board of directors from time to time, the holders of shares of our common stock will be entitled
	to such cash dividends as may be declared from time to time by our board of directors from funds available therefore.


	 


	Subject to any preferential rights of any outstanding series
	of preferred stock created from time to time by our board of directors, upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, the holders
	of shares of our common stock will be entitled to receive pro rata all assets available for distribution to such holders.


	 


	In the event of any merger or consolidation with or into
	another company in connection with which shares of our common stock are converted into or exchangeable for shares of stock, other
	securities or property (including cash), all holders of our common stock will be entitled to receive the same kind and amount of
	shares of stock and other securities and property (including cash). Holders of our common stock have no pre-emptive rights, no
	conversion rights and there are no redemption provisions applicable to our common stock.


	 



	Preferred Stock



	 


	Our board of directors may become authorized to authorize
	preferred shares of stock and to divide the authorized shares of our preferred stock into one or more series, each of which must
	be so designated as to distinguish the shares of each series of preferred stock from the shares of all other series and classes.
	Our board of directors is authorized, within any limitations prescribed by law and our articles of incorporation, to fix and determine
	the designations, rights, qualifications, preferences, limitations and terms of the shares of any series of preferred stock including,
	but not limited to, the following:


	 




	 



	1.

	Competition



	 


	In the past few years, the number of mobile marketing options
	and companies have grown rapidly. The markets for the products and services that we offer are very competitive, are rapidly evolving
	and have relatively low barriers to entry. We compete with all general advertising and marketing companies who eventually will
	want to include mobile marketing in their suite of product offerings, and who may develop their own similar products and compete
	with us for market share. These potential competitors may have more mature lines of distribution than us, be better financed than
	us, or may create a product offering that is superior to ours. Any of these factors can cause a competitor to take market share
	away from us or otherwise substantially hurt our business. We believe that competition in our market is based predominantly on:


	 




	 



	●




	Price





	 



	●




	brand recognition;





	 



	●




	product and service components and deliverables;





	 



	●




	track record of creating and keeping satisfied clients;





	 



	●




	success of underlying marketing programs; and





	 



	●




	order delivery performance and customer service.

	Government Regulation



	 


	We are subject to a number of laws and
	regulations that affect companies generally and specifically those conducting business in the mobile messaging market, many of
	which are still evolving and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business.  Existing and future laws and
	regulations may impede our growth. These regulations and laws may cover online marketing, e-mail marketing, telemarketing, taxation,
	privacy, data protection, pricing, content, copyrights, distribution, mobile communications, electronic contracts and other communications,
	consumer protection, web services, the provision of online payment services, unencumbered internet access to our services, the
	design and operation of websites, and the characteristics and quality of products and services. It is not clear how existing laws
	governing issues such as property ownership, libel, and personal privacy apply to the internet, e-commerce, digital content and
	web services. Unfavorable regulations and laws could diminish the demand for our products and services and increase our cost of
	doing business.


	 


	We expect that the regulation of our
	industry generally will continue to increase and that we will be required to devote increasing amounts of legal and other resources
	to address this regulation. In addition, the application of existing domestic and international laws and regulations relating to
	issues such as user privacy and data protection, marketing, advertising, consumer protection and mobile disclosures in many instances
	is unclear or unsettled.


	 


	In addition to its regulation of wireless
	telecommunications providers generally, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission, or FCC, has examined, or is currently examining,
	how and when consumers enroll in mobile services, what types of disclosures consumers receive, what services consumers are purchasing
	and how much consumers are charged. In addition, the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, has been asked to regulate how mobile marketers
	can use consumers’ personal information. Consumer advocates claim that many consumers do not know when their information
	is being collected from cell phones and how such information is retained, used and shared with other companies. Consumer groups
	have asked the FTC to: identify practices that may compromise privacy and consumer welfare; examine opt-in procedures to ensure
	consumers are aware of what data is at issue and how it will be used; investigate marketing tactics that target children; and create
	policies to halt abusive practices. The FTC has expressed interest in particular in the mobile environment and services that collect
	sensitive data, such as location-based information.


	 


	The principal laws and regulations that
	pertain to us and our customers in connection with their utilization of our platform, include:


	 




	 



	●





	Deceptive Trade Practice Law in the U.S

	. The FTC and state attorneys general are given broad powers by legislatures to curb unfair and deceptive trade practices. These laws and regulations apply to mobile marketing campaigns and behavioral advertising. The general guideline is that all material terms and conditions of the offer must be “clearly and conspicuously” disclosed to the consumer prior to the buying decision. The balancing of the desire to capture a potential customer's attention, while providing adequate disclosure, can be challenging in the mobile context due to the lack of screen space available to provide required disclosures.





	 




	 



	●





	Behavioral Advertising

	. Behavioral advertising is a technique used by online publishers and advertisers to increase the effectiveness of their campaigns. Behavioral advertising uses information collected from an individual's web-browsing behavior, such as the pages they have visited or the searches they have made, to select which advertisements to display to that individual. This data can be valuable for online marketers looking to personalize advertising initiatives or to provide geo-tags through mobile devices. Many businesses adhere to industry self-governing principles, including an opt-out regime whereby information may be collected until an individual indicates that he or she no longer agrees to have this information collected. The FTC is considering regulations in this area, which may include implementation of a more rigorous opt-in regime. An opt-in policy would prohibit businesses from collecting and using information from individuals who have not voluntarily consented. Among other things, the implementation of an opt-in regime could require substantial technical support and negatively impact the market for our mobile advertising products and services. A few states have also introduced bills in recent years that would restrict behavioral advertising within the state. These bills would likely have the practical effect of regulating behavioral advertising nationwide because of the difficulties behind implementing state-specific policies or identifying the location of a particular consumer. There have also been a large number of class action suits filed against companies engaged in behavioral advertising.

	. Our business is affected by U.S. federal and state laws and regulations governing the collection, use, retention, sharing and security of data that we receive from and about our users. In recent years, regulation has focused on the collection, use, disclosure and security of information that may be used to identify or that actually identifies an individual, such as an Internet Protocol address or a name. Although the mobile and Internet advertising privacy practices are currently largely self-regulated in the U.S., the FTC has conducted numerous discussions on this subject and suggested that more rigorous privacy regulation is appropriate, including regulation of non-personally identifiable information which could, with other information, be used to identify an individual.

	Marketing-Privacy Regulation

	. In addition, there are U.S. federal and state laws that govern SMS and telecommunications-based marketing, generally requiring senders to transmit messages (including those sent to mobile devices) only to recipients who have specifically consented to receiving such messages. U.S. federal laws also govern e-mail marketing, generally imposing an opt-out requirement for emails sent within an existing business relationship.

	SMS and Location-Based Marketing Best Practices and Guidelines

	. We are a member of the Mobile Marketing Association, or MMA, a global association of 700 agencies, advertisers, mobile device manufacturers, wireless operators and service providers and others interested in the potential of marketing via the mobile channel. The MMA has published a code of conduct and best practices guidelines for use by those involved in mobile messaging activities. The guidelines were developed by a collaboration of the major carriers and they require adherence to them as a condition of service. We voluntarily comply with the MMA code of conduct. In addition, the Cellular Telephone Industry Association, or CTIA, has developed Best Practices and Guidelines to promote and protect user privacy regarding location-based services. We also voluntarily comply with those guidelines, which generally require notice and user consent for delivery of location-based services.

	The United States Telephone Consumer Protection Act.

	  The TCPA prohibits unsolicited voice and text calls to cell phones through the use of an automatic telephone-dialing system (ATDS) unless the recipient has given prior consent. The statute also prohibits companies from initiating telephone solicitations to individuals on the national Do-Not-Call list, and restricts the hours when such messages may be sent. Violations of the TCPA can result in statutory damages of $500 per violation (i.e., for each individual text message). U.S. state laws impose additional regulations on voice and text calls. We believe that our platform does not employ an ATDS within the meaning of the TCPA based on case law construing that term.

	CAN-SPAM

	. The U.S. Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act, or CAN SPAM Act, prohibits all commercial e-mail messages, as defined in the law, to mobile phones unless the device owner has given "express prior authorization." Recipients of such messages must also be allowed to opt-out of receiving future messages the same way they opted-in. Senders have ten business days to honor opt-out requests. The FCC has compiled a list of domain names used by wireless service providers to which marketers may not send commercial e-mail messages. Senders have 30 days from the date the domain name is posted on the FCC site to stop sending unauthorized commercial e-mail to addresses containing the domain name. Violators are subject to fines of up to $6.0 million and up to one year in jail for some spamming activities. Carriers, the FTC, the FCC, and State Attorneys General may bring lawsuits to enforce alleged violations of the Act.

	Communications Privacy Acts

	. Foreign and U.S. federal and state laws impose liability for intercepting communications while in transit or accessing the contents of communications while in storage.

	Security Breach Notification Requirements

	. In the U.S., various states have enacted data breach notification laws, which require notification of individuals and sometimes state regulatory bodies in the event of breaches involving certain defined categories of personal information. This new trend suggests that breach notice statutes may be enacted in other jurisdictions, including by the U.S. at the federal level, as well.





	 




	 



	●





	Children

	. The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act prohibit the knowing collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 without verifiable parental consent, and strictly regulate the transmission of requests for personal information to such children. Other countries do not recognize the ability of children to consent to the collection of personal information. In addition, it is likely that behavioral advertising regulations will impose special restrictions on use of information collected from minors for this purpose.





	 



	Intellectual Property



	 


	Although we believe that our business
	methodology is proprietary in terms of how we deliver our service to our client, and how we use mobile marketing, we currently
	hold no patents, copyrights or trademarks. It is our plan to trademark our key products as we develop them, subject to applicable
	laws and regulations, however, we have not filed for any such protection as of yet. It is our policy to enter into confidentiality
	agreements with any outsourced sales or service providers so that our proprietary methodology, customer’s lists and business
	information are contractually protected, and we intend to enforce any such contractual provisions as the law allows in the event
	of a breach. We cannot assure you that these contractual arrangements will prevent third parties from acquiring or using our proprietary
	business information to compete against us.



	 





	Employees



	 


	We currently have 5 full-time and no part-time employees
	including our chief executive officer, director of sales, lead developer, VP of operations, and client success manager.  Also,
	we have 7 independent contractors that work with us on an as-needed basis.  We expect to increase our future employee
	levels on an as-needed basis in connection with our expected growth and available funds.



	 







	PROPERTIES



	 


	We currently do not own any real property.  Our
	principal executive office is located at 1940 Contra Costa Blvd. Pleasant Hill, CA 94523. We currently lease our executive offices
	at $2,767 per month.



	 







	LEGAL PROCEEDINGS



	 


	We are not a party to any other legal proceedings and, to
	our knowledge, no other legal proceedings are pending, threatened or contemplated.




	 







	MARKET FOR COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED
	SHAREHOLDER MATTERS



	 



	Holders of Our Shares



	 


	As of the date of this prospectus, there were 87 registered
	shareholders.


	 



	No Public Market for Common Shares



	 


	Our common stock is quoted on the
	OTCPinks operated by OTC Markets Group, Inc. under the symbol “TXHD.” On August 11, 2014, the last reported sale
	price of our common stock as reported on the OTCPinks was $0.20 per share.  There is no public information about our
	company, as noted by OTCPinks, and there is not an active trading market for our stock.

	Table of Contents











	 


	We anticipate making an application for quotation of our
	common shares on the OTC Bulletin Board or OTCQB upon: (i) the effectiveness of the registration statement of which this prospectus
	forms a part; and (ii) our obtaining a sufficient number of stockholders to enable our common shares to become quoted on the OTC
	Bulletin Board or OTCQB.  However, we can provide no assurance that our shares will be quoted on the bulletin board or,
	if quoted, that a public market will materialize.


	 


	The Securities Exchange Commission has adopted rules that
	regulate broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in penny stocks. Penny stocks are generally equity securities
	with a price of less than $5.00, other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or quoted on the NASDAQ
	system, provided that current price and volume information with respect to transactions in such securities is provided by the exchange
	or system.  The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock, to deliver a standardized
	risk disclosure document prepared by the Commission, that: (a) contains a description of the nature and level of risk in the market
	for penny stocks in both public offerings and secondary trading; (b) contains a description of the broker's or dealer's duties
	to the customer and of the rights and remedies available to the customer with respect to a violation to such duties or other requirements
	of Securities' laws; (c) contains a brief, clear, narrative description of a dealer market, including bid and ask prices for penny
	stocks and the significance of the spread between the bid and ask  price;(d) contains a toll-free telephone number for inquiries
	on disciplinary actions;(e) defines significant terms in the disclosure document or in the conduct of trading in penny stocks;
	and;(f) contains such other information and is in such form, including language, type, size and format, as the Commission shall
	require by rule or regulation.


	 


	The broker-dealer also must provide, prior to effecting any
	transaction in a penny stock, the customer with; (a) bid and offer quotations for the penny stock;(b) the compensation of the broker-dealer
	and its salesperson in the transaction;(c) the number of shares to which such bid and ask prices apply, or other comparable information
	relating to the depth and liquidity of the market for such stock; and (d) a monthly account statements showing the market value
	of each penny stock held in the customer's account.


	 


	In addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to
	a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules; the broker-dealer must make a special written determination
	that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser's written acknowledgment of the receipt
	of a risk disclosure statement, a written agreement to transactions involving penny stocks, and a signed and dated copy of a written
	suitability statement.


	 


	These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing
	the trading activity in the secondary market for our stock if it becomes subject to these penny stock rules. Therefore, because
	our common stock is subject to the penny stock rules, stockholders may have difficulty selling those securities.


	 



	Dividend Rights



	 


	We have never declared, nor paid, any dividend since our
	incorporation and does not foresee paying any dividend in the near future since all available funds will be used to conduct exploration
	activities.  Any future payment of dividends will depend on our financing requirements and financial condition and other
	factors which the board of directors, in its sole discretion, may consider appropriate.


	 


	There are no restrictions in our articles of incorporation
	or bylaws that prevent us from declaring dividends.  The Nevada Revised Statutes, however, do prohibit us from declaring dividends
	where after giving effect to the distribution of the dividend:


	 




	 



	1.




	we would not be able to pay our debts as they become due in the usual course of business, or;





	 




	 



	2.




	our total assets would be less than the sum of our total liabilities plus the amount that would be needed to satisfy the rights of shareholders who have preferential rights superior to those receiving the distribution.





	 


	We have not declared any dividends and we do not plan to
	declare any dividends in the foreseeable future.


	 



	Reports to Shareholders



	 


	As a result of this offering as required
	under Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, we will file periodic reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission
	through December 31, 2014, including a Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014, assuming this registration statement is
	declared effective before that date. At or prior to December 31, 2014, we intend voluntarily to file a registration statement on
	Form 8-A which will subject us to all of the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act. This will require us to file quarterly
	and annual reports with the SEC and will also subject us to the proxy rules of the SEC. In addition, our officers, directors and
	10% stockholders will be required to submit reports to the SEC on their stock ownership and stock trading activity.  We
	are not required under Section 12(g) or otherwise to become a mandatory Exchange Act filer unless we have more than 500 shareholders
	and total assets of more than $10 million on December 31, 2014.  If we do not file a registration statement on Form 8-A
	at or prior to December 31, 2014, we will continue as a voluntary reporting company and will not be subject to the proxy statement
	or other information requirements of the Exchange Act, our securities may no longer be quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board, and our
	officers, directors and 10% stockholders will not be required to submit reports to the SEC on their stock ownership and stock trading
	activity.

	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED
	PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM




	 


	To the Board of Directors and Stockholder


	Textmunication Holdings, Inc.


	Las Vegas, Nevada


	 


	We have audited the accompanying consolidated
	balance sheets of Textmunication Holdings, Inc. and subsidiary (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, and
	the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the two years then ended.
	These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
	on these financial statements based on our audit.


	 


	We conducted our audits in accordance
	with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
	perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.  An
	audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
	also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
	overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.


	 


	In our opinion, such financial statements
	present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2013 and 2012
	and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years then ended in conformity with accounting principles
	generally accepted in the United States of America.


	 


	The accompanying financial statements
	have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 3 to the financial statements,
	the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations and has a net capital deficiency that raises substantial doubt about
	its ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 3.
	The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

	Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements


	December 31, 2013 and 2012


	 



	Note 1 – ORGANIZATION



	 


	Textmunication Holdings, Inc. (Company)
	was formed in October 1984 in the State of Georgia as Brock Control Systems.  Founded by Richard T. Brock, the Company
	was in the sales automation market and an early developer of enterprise customer management systems.  The Company went
	public at the end of March of 1993.  In February of 1996, the Company changed its name to Brock International Inc.,
	and in March of 1998, the name was again changed to Firstwave Technologies, Inc.


	 


	In 2007, the Company had its common
	stock deregistered in order to avoid the expenses of being a public company.  The Company reported briefly on the OTC
	Disclosure & News Service in 2008. The Company again changed its name to FSTWV, Inc.


	 


	In April 2013 the FSTWV preferred stock
	holders A, B, C and D series converted their prefer shares into common shares of the Company. On October 28, 2013, the Company
	held a shareholder meeting to reincorporate the Company in the State of Nevada and concurrently change its name to Textmunication
	Holdings, Inc.  The Company also voted to approve a 1 for 5 reverse split of our outstanding common stock.. Per-share
	amounts in the accompanying financial statements have been adjusted for the split.


	 


	Following our shareholder meeting,
	on November 16, 2013, the Company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (SEA) with Textmunication, Inc. a California corporation
	and Wais Asefi (its sole shareholder), whereby we issued 65,640,207 new shares of common stock in exchange for 100% of the issued
	and outstanding shares of Textmunication, Inc. and simultaneously the major shareholder of the Company retired 1,128,041 post
	reverse shares (pre-split: 5,640,207) shares of our common stock to the Company’s treasury.  As a result of the
	SEA, we acquired Textmunication, Inc. and have assumed its business operations in the mobile marketing business.


	 


	For accounting purposes, the SEA transaction
	has been accounted for as a reverse recapitalization, with Textmunication Holdings, Inc. as the acquirer. The consolidated financial
	statements of Textmunication Holdings, Inc. for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013 represent a continuation of the financial
	statements of Textmunication, Inc., with one adjustment, which is to retroactively adjust the legal capital of Textmunication,
	Inc. to reflect the legal capital of Textmunication Holdings, Inc.

	Principles of Consolidation



	 


	The accompanying consolidated financial
	statements include the accounts of Textmunication Holdings, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Textmunication, Inc. (collectively
	referred to as the Company). All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in the consolidated financial
	statements.


	 



	Use of Estimates



	 


	The preparation of financial statements
	in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
	the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
	statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
	estimates.

	Note 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
	(Continued)



	 



	Basis of Presentation



	 


	The accompanying consolidated financial
	statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.


	 



	Going Concern



	 


	These financial statements have been
	prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization
	of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. As of December 31, 2013, the Company
	has an accumulated deficit of $166,129. The company’s ability to continue as a going concern is contingent upon the successful
	completion of additional financing arrangements and its ability to achieve and maintain profitable operations. While the Company
	is expanding its best efforts to achieve the above plans, there is no assurance that any such activity will generate funds that
	will be available for operations. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a
	going concern. These financial statements do not include any adjustments that might arise from this uncertainty.


	 



	Risks and Uncertainties



	 


	The Company is subject to substantial
	risks from, among other things, intense competition associated with the industry in general, other risks associated with financing,
	liquidity requirements, rapidly changing customer requirements, limited operating history and the volatility of public markets.


	 



	Fair Value Measurements



	 


	Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”)
	820-10, Fair Value Measurements, defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value under generally accepted
	accounting principles and enhances disclosures about fair value measurements. Fair value is defined under ASC 820-10 as the exchange
	price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the Note principal or the most advantageous
	market for an asset or liability in an orderly transaction between participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques
	used to measure fair value under ASC 820-10 must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.
	The standard describes a fair value hierarchy based on the levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable
	and the last unobservable, that may be used to measure fair value which are the following:


	 




	 



	●




	Level 1 - Quoted prices in
	active markets for identical assets or liabilities.





	 




	 



	●




	Level 2 - Inputs other than
	Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted
	prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or corroborated by observable market data or substantially
	the full term of the assets or liabilities.





	 




	 



	●




	Level
	3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the value of the assets
	or liabilities.





	 


	The fair value of the accounts receivable, accounts payable,
	notes payable are considered short term in nature and therefore their value is considered fair value.

	Note 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
	(Continued)



	 



	Convertible Instruments



	 


	The Company accounts for convertible
	debt with beneficial conversion features in accordance with ASC 470-20, which requires the Company to recognize separately, at
	issuance, the embedded beneficial conversion feature as a discount to the debt. The recognition is done by allocating a portion
	of the proceeds equal to the intrinsic value of that feature as a debt discount. The intrinsic value is calculated as the difference
	between the effective conversion price of the convertible debt and the fair value of the shares at issuance date.


	 



	Warrants



	 


	The Company accounts for warrants issued
	in conjunction with stock issuances under private placement using the fair value method. Under this method, the value of warrants
	issued is measured at fair value at the grant date using the Black-Scholes valuation model and recorded as share capital and additional
	paid-in capital.


	 


	The Company recognized the value of
	detachable warrants issued in conjunction with issuance of notes payable using the Black-Scholes pricing model. The Company recorded
	the relative fair value of the warrant as an increase to additional paid-in capital and discount against the related debt. The
	discount attributed to the value of the warrants is being amortized over the term of the underlying debt instrument.


	 



	Cash and cash equivalents



	 


	The Company considers all highly liquid
	instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.


	 


	The Company minimizes its credit risk
	associated with cash by periodically evaluating the credit quality of its primary financial institution.


	 



	Accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts 



	 


	Accounts receivable are stated at the
	amount management expects to collect. The Company generally does not require collateral to support customer receivables. The Company
	provides an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon a review of the outstanding accounts receivable, historical collection
	information and existing economic conditions. As of December 31, 2013 and 2012 the allowance for doubtful accounts was $0 and
	bad debt expense of $0 for each year respectively.


	 



	Advertising



	 


	Advertising expenses consist primarily
	of costs of promotion for corporate image and product. The Company expenses all advertising costs as incurred. For the year ended
	December 31, 2013 and 2012, advertising expenses were $0 and $175 respectively.

	Note 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
	(Continued)



	 



	Revenue Recognition



	 


	We recognize revenue in accordance
	with Accounting Standards Codification, or (“ASC”), 605, Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue when all of the
	following conditions are satisfied: (1) there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement; (2) the service has been provided to the
	customer; (3) the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable; and (4) the collection of our fees is reasonably
	assured.


	 


	Thus, we recognize subscription revenue
	on a monthly basis, as services are provided. Customers are billed for the subscription on a monthly, quarterly, semi-annual or
	annual basis, at the customer’s option.


	 



	Income Taxes



	 


	Income taxes are provided for the tax
	effects of transactions reported in the financial statements and consist of taxes currently due plus deferred taxes related primarily
	to differences between the bases of assets and liabilities for financial and income tax reporting. The deferred tax assets and
	liabilities represent the future tax return consequences of those differences, which will either be taxable or deductible when
	the assets and liabilities are recovered or settled. Deferred taxes are also recognized for operating losses that are available
	to offset future federal and state income taxes. Any interest charges on underpayment or other assessments are recorded as interest
	expense. Any penalties are recorded in Operating Expenses.


	 



	Net income (loss) per Common Share



	 


	Basic net income (loss) per share is
	computed by dividing the net loss attributable to the common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock
	outstanding during the period. Fully diluted loss per share is computed similar to basic loss per share except that the denominator
	is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common shares
	had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive.  


	 


	Since the Company reflected a net loss
	for the year ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, the effect of considering any common stock equivalents would have been anti-dilutive
	and therefore a separate computation of diluted loss per share is not presented.


	 



	Recent Accounting Pronouncements



	 


	No new accounting pronouncements issued
	or effective during the fiscal year has had or is expected to have a material impact on the financial statements.


	 



	Note 3 – ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND FACTORING AGREEMENT



	 


	In the ordinary course of business,
	the Company utilizes accounts receivable-credit card factoring agreements with third-party financing company in order to accelerate
	its cash collections from product sales. In addition, these agreements provide the Company with the ability to limit credit exposure
	to potential bad debts, to better manage costs related to collections as well as to enable customers to extend their credit terms.
	These agreements involve the ownership transfer of eligible trade accounts receivable, without recourse or discount, to a third
	party financial institution in exchange for cash.

	Note 3 – ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND FACTORING AGREEMENT (Continued)



	 


	The Company accounts for these transactions
	in accordance with ASC 860, "Transfers and Servicing" ("ASC 860"). ASC 860 allows for the ownership transfer
	of accounts receivable to qualify for sale treatment when the appropriate criteria is met, which permits the Company to present
	the balances sold under the program to be excluded from

	  Accounts receivable, net

	  on the Consolidated
	Balance Sheet. Receivables are considered sold when (i) they are transferred beyond the reach of the Company and its creditors,
	(ii) the purchaser has the right to pledge or exchange the receivables, and (iii) the Company has surrendered control over the
	transferred receivables. In addition, the Company provides no other forms of continued financial support to the purchaser of the
	receivables once the receivables are sold. Amounts due from the financial company are recorded with

	other current assets

	in the Balance Sheet. The amount sold and fees and recorded in other expense.


	 



	Note 4 – LOANS PAYABLE



	 


	In 2012 the Company has a loan outstanding
	with a former employee. The loan is due on demand and has no interest. During the year ended December 31, 2012 the Company entered
	into a settlement with the former employee which resulted in a loss on debt settlement of $2,044. Amounts outstanding as of December
	31, 2013 and 2012 were $1,112 and $10,000, respectively.


	 


	During the year ended December 31,
	2013 the Company received loans from a relative of the CEO. The loans are due on demand and have no interest. Amounts outstanding
	as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 were approximately $10,000 and $5,000, respectively.

	Description


	 


	2013


	 


	 


	2012


	 




	In connection with the SEA, the Company
	assumed three convertible promissory notes for an aggregate of $13,670, net of debt discount. The notes mature on September
	14, 2014 and accrue interest at a rate of 12% per annum. The note principal is convertible at a price of $.00382 per share.
	At issuance the fair market value of the Company’s common stock was $.013 per share. The conversion feature of the note
	is considered beneficial to the investor due to the conversion price for the convertible note being lower than the fair market
	value of the common stock on the date the note was issued. The beneficial conversion feature was recorded at the debt’s
	inception as a discount of the debt of $76,429 and is being amortized over the lives of the convertible debt. Amortization
	of debt discount during the period from November 16, 2013 (date of SEA) through December 31, 2013 and the year ended December
	31, 2012 was $9,528 and $0, respectively and the unamortized discount at December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012 was $53,231
	and $0, respectively. Interest expense recorded on the convertible notes for the period from November 16, 2013 (date of SEA)
	through December 31, 2013 and the year ended December 31, 2012 was $1,156 and $0, respectively.

	 

	One of the
	holders of the convertible promissory notes with a principal value of $25,476, entered into note purchase and assignment agreements
	whereby half of the principal of the note was assigned to two separate note holders. The original note was substituted and
	replaced by two amended and restated 12% convertible promissory notes with restated principal amounts of $12,738 each. All
	other terms of the original note remain in effect.

	 

	The principal balance outstanding on the loans as of December
	31, 2013 and 2012 was $76,429 and $0, respectively.

	Note 5 – CONVERTIBLE PROMISSORY NOTES (Continued)



	 




	In connection with the SEA, the Company
	assumed a convertible note for an aggregate of $36,363, net of debt discount. The note matures on November 7, 2014 and interest
	accrues at a rate of 20% per annum. The note principal is convertible into common stock at the rate of $.001 per share or
	50 million shares of the Company’s common stock but such conversion can only take effect upon default of the note. The
	note is secured by 59,400,000 shares of the Company’s common stock. In conjunction with the note the Company issued
	750,000 shares of restricted common stock and 1,000,000 common stock purchase warrants exercisable for twelve months at $.10
	per warrant for one share of Company common stock.

	 

	The relative fair value of the common stock and warrants
	at the debt’s inception of $6,884 and $9,121, respectively were recorded as a discount to the debt and are being amortized
	to debt discount over the life of the debt. The fair value of the warrants was calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing
	model with the following assumptions: expected life of 1.0 years; volatility of 606.16%; no dividend yield; and a risk free
	interest rate of 0.11%. Amortization of debt discount during the period from November 16, 2013 (date of SEA) through December
	31, 2013 and the year ended December 31, 2012 was $2,017 and $0, respectively and the unamortized discount at December 31,
	2013 and December 31, 2012 was $136,37 and $0, respectively. Interest expense recorded on the convertible note for the period
	from November 16, 2013 (date of SEA) through December 31, 2013 and the year ended December 31, 2012 was $1,260 and $0, respectively.
	The principal balance outstanding on the loan as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 was $50,000 and $0, respectively.

	On November 17, 2013, the Company issued a $10,000
	convertible promissory note. The note matures on May 17, 2015 and accrues interest at a rate of 12% per annum. The note principal
	and interest are convertible at a price of $.10 per share. In conjunction with the note, the Company issued 100,000 common
	stock purchase warrants exercisable for twelve months at a price of $.125 per share. The relative fair value of the warrants
	at inception of $1,297 was recorded as a discount to the debt and is being amortized to debt discount over the life of the
	debt. The fair value of the warrants was calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions:
	expected life of 1.0 years; volatility of 608.68%; no dividend yield; and a risk free interest rate of 0.13%.

	 

	Amortization
	of debt discount during the year ended December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012 was $104 and $0, respectively and the unamortized

	Note 6 – WARRANTS



	 


	On November 7, 2013, the Company issued
	1,000,000 warrants with an exercise price of $0.10 per share in conjunction with a $50,000 convertible promissory note. The warrants
	are exercisable at any time for one year following the execution of the agreement.


	 


	On November 17, 2013, the Company issued

	are exercisable at any time for one year following the execution of the agreement.

	Expected volatility is based primarily
	on historical volatility. Historical volatility was computed using daily pricing observations for recent periods that correspond
	to the term of the warrants. The Company’s management believes this method produces an estimate that is representative of
	the expectations of future volatility over the expected term of these warrants. The Company has no reason to believe future volatility
	over the expected remaining life of these warrants will likely differ materially from historical volatility. The expected life
	is based on the remaining term of the warrants. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury securities according to
	the remaining term of the financial instruments.

	Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements


	December 31, 2013 and 2012



	 




	Note 7 – STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY



	 


	For the year ended December 31, 2012
	a shareholder contributed capital in the amount of $1,524.


	 


	In April 2013 the FSTWV preferred stock
	holders A, B, C and D series converted their prefer shares into common shares of the Company.


	 


	On September 19, 2013 we issued 1,000,000
	shares of common stock to settle a note payable with our former shareholder.


	 


	On November 7, 2013 in conjunction
	with the issuance of a convertible note the Company issued 750,000 shares of restricted common stock and 1,000,000 common stock
	purchase warrants exercisable for twelve months at $.10 per warrant for one share of Company common stock.


	 


	On November 16, 2013 we entered into
	the SEA and effected our merger and recapitalization.


	 



	Note 8 – RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS



	 


	During the year ended December 31,
	2013 and 2012 the Company received loans from a relative of the CEO. The loans are due on demand and have no interest. Amounts
	outstanding as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 were $10,000 and $5,000, respectively.


	 



	Note 9 – INCOME TAX



	 


	We experienced a change of control
	coincident with the execution of the SEA. On that date we had cumulative net operating losses totaling approximately $166,000.
	Management has determined that due to the impact of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, the application of net operating
	loss carry forwards against future taxable income will be severally limited. Accordingly, we believe the tax benefit of such loses
	will be insignificant and we therefore chose not to present a deferred tax benefit or valuation allowance as of December 31, 2013
	and estimate that the cumulative value of timing differences between the carrying value of assets and liabilities for tax purposes
	is also insignificant.


	 



	Note 10 – COMMITMENTS AND
	CONTINGENCIES



	 



	Office Lease



	 


	On June 13, 2011 the Company signed
	an amendment to its lease originally signed on May 9, 2008. The amended lease commenced August 1, 2011 and expires July 31, 2014.
	Rent expense was approximately $39,754 and $17,109 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012, respectively.


	 


	Minimum future lease commitments are
	as follows:

	Note 10 – COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES (Continued)



	 


	Executive Employment Agreement


	 


	The Company has an employment agreement
	with the CEO/Chairman to perform duties and responsibilities as may be assigned by the Board of Directors. The base salary is
	in the amount of $100,000 per annum plus an annual discretionary bonus plus benefits commencing on December 17, 2013 and ending
	May 1, 2017 with an automatic renewal on each anniversary date (May 1) thereafter.


	 



	Litigations, Claims and Assessments



	 


	The Company may become involved in
	various lawsuits and legal proceedings, which arise in the ordinary course of business. However, litigation is subject to inherent
	uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise that may harm its business. The Company is currently
	not aware of any such legal proceedings or claims that they believe will have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse
	affect on its business, financial condition or operating results.


	 



	Note 11 – SUBSEQUENT EVENTS



	 


	The Company has evaluated subsequent
	events after the balance sheet date of December 31, 2013 through May 9, 2014, the date the financial statements are available
	to be issued and determined that there are certain reportable events to be disclosed as follows:


	 


	On January 20, 2014, the Company issued
	a $5,000 convertible promissory note. The note matures on August 1, 2015 and accrues interest at a rate of 6% per annum. The note
	principal and interest are convertible at a price of $.10 per share. In conjunction with the note, the Company issued 50,000 common
	stock purchase warrants exercisable for 12 months at a price of $.125 per share.


	 


	On February 13, 2014, the Company issued
	two $5,000 convertible promissory notes. The notes mature on May 31, 2015 and accrue interest at a rate of 12% per annum. The
	note principal and interest are convertible at a price of $.10 per share. In conjunction with the notes, the Company issued 100,000
	common stock purchase warrants exercisable for 12 months at a price of $.125 per share.


	 


	On April 17, 2014, the Company issued
	a $10,000 convertible promissory note. The note matures on October 17, 2015 and accrues interest at a rate of 12% per annum. The
	note principal and interest are convertible at a price of $.10 per share. In conjunction with the note, the Company issued 100,000
	common stock purchase warrants exercisable for 12 months at a price of $.125 per share.

	December 31, 2013 and 2012


	 



	Note 11 – SUBSEQUENT EVENTS (Continued)


	 


	In 2007, the
	Company had its common stock deregistered in order to avoid the expenses of being a public company.  The Company reported
	briefly on the OTC Disclosure & News Service in 2008. The Company again changed its name to FSTWV, Inc.


	 


	In April 2013 the FSTWV preferred stock holders A, B, C
	and D series converted their prefer shares into common shares of the Company. On October 28, 2013, the Company held a shareholder
	meeting to reincorporate the Company in the State of Nevada and concurrently change its name to Textmunication Holdings, Inc. The
	Company also voted to approve a 1 for 5 reverse split of our outstanding common stock. Per-share amounts in the accompanying consolidated
	financial statements have been adjusted for the split.

	 


	Following our shareholder meeting,
	on November 16, 2013, the Company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (SEA) with Textmunication, Inc. a California corporation
	and Wais Asefi (its sole shareholder), whereby we issued 65,640,207 new shares of common stock in exchange for 100% of the issued
	and outstanding shares of Textmunication, Inc. and simultaneously the major shareholder of the Company retired 1,128,041 post
	reverse shares (pre-split: 5,640,207) shares of our common stock to the Company’s treasury.  As a result of the
	SEA, we acquired Textmunication, Inc. and have assumed its business operations in the mobile marketing business.


	 


	For accounting purposes, the SEA transaction
	has been accounted for as a reverse recapitalization, with Textmunication Holdings, Inc. as the acquirer. The consolidated financial
	statements of Textmunication Holdings, Inc. for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013 represent a continuation of the consolidated
	financial statements of Textmunication, Inc., with one adjustment, which is to retroactively adjust the legal capital of Textmunication,
	Inc. to reflect the legal capital of Textmunication Holdings, Inc.

	Textmunication Holdings, Inc.





	Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements


	(Unaudited)


	 



	Note 1 – ORGANIZATION



	 


	Textmunication Holdings, Inc. (Company)
	was formed in October 1984 in the State of Georgia as Brock Control Systems.  Founded by Richard T. Brock, the Company
	was in the sales automation market and an early developer of enterprise customer management systems.  The Company went
	public at the end of March of 1993.  In February of 1996, the Company changed its name to Brock International Inc.,
	and in March of 1998, the name was again changed to Firstwave Technologies, Inc.


	 


	In 2007, the Company had its common stock
	deregistered in order to avoid the expenses of being a public company.  The Company reported briefly on the OTC Disclosure
	& News Service in 2008. The Company again changed its name to FSTWV, Inc.


	 


	In April 2013, the FSTWV preferred stock
	holders A, B, C and D series converted their prefer shares into common shares of the Company. On October 28, 2013, the Company
	held a shareholder meeting to reincorporate the Company in the State of Nevada and concurrently change its name to Textmunication
	Holdings, Inc. The Company also voted to approve a 1 for 5 reverse split of our outstanding common stock. Per-share amounts
	in the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been adjusted for the split.


	 


	Following our shareholder meeting, on November
	16, 2013, the Company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (SEA) with Textmunication, Inc. a California corporation and Wais
	Asefi (its sole shareholder), whereby we issued 65,640,207 new shares of common stock in exchange for 100% of the issued and outstanding
	shares of Textmunication, Inc. and simultaneously the major shareholder of the Company retired 1,128,041 post reverse shares (pre-split:
	5,640,207) shares of our common stock to the Company’s treasury.  As a result of the SEA, we acquired Textmunication,
	Inc. and have assumed its business operations in the mobile marketing business.


	 


	For accounting purposes, the SEA transaction
	has been accounted for as a reverse recapitalization, with Textmunication Holdings, Inc. as the acquirer. The consolidated financial
	statements of Textmunication Holdings, Inc. for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013 represent a continuation of the consolidated
	financial statements of Textmunication, Inc., with one adjustment, which is to retroactively adjust the legal capital of Textmunication,
	Inc. to reflect the legal capital of Textmunication Holdings, Inc.


	 



	Note 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
	ACCOUNTING POLICIES



	 



	Principles of Consolidation



	 


	The accompanying consolidated financial
	statements include the accounts of Textmunication Holdings, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Textmunication, Inc. (collectively
	referred to as the Company). All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in the consolidated financial
	statements.


	 



	Use of Estimates



	 


	The preparation of financial statements
	in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
	the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
	statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
	estimates.

	Note 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
	ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)



	 



	Basis of Presentation



	 


	The accompanying consolidated financial
	statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.


	 



	Going Concern



	 


	These consolidated financial statements
	have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applicable to a going concern, which contemplates
	the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. As of June 30,
	2014, the Company has an accumulated deficit of $292,594. The company’s ability to continue as a going concern is contingent
	upon the successful completion of additional financing arrangements and its ability to achieve and maintain profitable operations.
	While the Company is expanding its best efforts to achieve the above plans, there is no assurance that any such activity will
	generate funds that will be available for operations. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability
	to continue as a going concern. These consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might arise from this
	uncertainty.


	 



	Risks and Uncertainties



	 


	The Company is subject to substantial risks
	from, among other things, intense competition associated with the industry in general, other risks associated with financing,
	liquidity requirements, rapidly changing customer requirements, limited operating history and the volatility of public markets.


	 



	Fair Value Measurements



	 


	Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”)
	820-10, Fair Value Measurements, defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value under generally accepted
	accounting principles and enhances disclosures about fair value measurements. Fair value is defined under ASC 820-10 as the exchange
	price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the Note principal or the most advantageous
	market for an asset or liability in an orderly transaction between participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques
	used to measure fair value under ASC 820-10 must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.
	The standard describes a fair value hierarchy based on the levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable
	and the last unobservable, that may be used to measure fair value which are the following:


	 


	● Level 1 - Quoted prices in active
	markets for identical assets or liabilities.


	 


	● Level 2 - Inputs other than Level
	1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in
	markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or corroborated by observable market data or substantially the
	full term of the assets or liabilities.


	 


	● Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that
	are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the value of the assets or liabilities.


	 


	The fair value of the accounts receivable,
	accounts payable, notes payable are considered short term in nature and therefore their value is considered fair value.

	Note 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
	ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)



	 



	Convertible Instruments



	 


	The Company accounts for convertible debt
	with beneficial conversion features in accordance with ASC 470-20, which requires the Company to recognize separately, at issuance,
	the embedded beneficial conversion feature as a discount to the debt. The recognition is done by allocating a portion of the proceeds
	equal to the intrinsic value of that feature as a debt discount. The intrinsic value is calculated as the difference between the
	effective conversion price of the convertible debt and the fair value of the shares at issuance date.


	 



	Warrants



	 


	The Company accounts for warrants issued
	in conjunction with stock issuances under private placement using the fair value method. Under this method, the value of warrants
	issued is measured at fair value at the grant date using the Black-Scholes valuation model and recorded as share capital and additional
	paid-in capital.


	 


	The Company recognized the value of detachable
	warrants issued in conjunction with issuance of notes payable using the Black-Scholes pricing model. The Company recorded the
	relative fair value of the warrant as an increase to additional paid-in capital and discount against the related debt. The discount
	attributed to the value of the warrants is being amortized over the term of the underlying debt instrument.


	 



	Cash and cash equivalents



	 


	The Company considers all highly liquid
	instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.


	 


	The Company minimizes its credit risk associated
	with cash by periodically evaluating the credit quality of its primary financial institution.


	 



	Accounts receivable and allowance for
	doubtful accounts 



	 


	Accounts receivable are stated at the amount
	management expects to collect. The Company generally does not require collateral to support customer receivables. The Company
	provides an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon a review of the outstanding accounts receivable, historical collection
	information and existing economic conditions. As of June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 the allowance for doubtful accounts was
	$0 and bad debt expense was $0 for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013.


	 



	Advertising



	 


	Advertising expenses consist primarily
	of costs of promotion for corporate image and product. The Company expenses all advertising costs as incurred. For the three months
	ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, advertising expenses were $0 and $0, respectively.

	Note 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
	ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)



	 



	Revenue Recognition



	 


	We recognize revenue in accordance with
	Accounting Standards Codification, or (“ASC”), 605, Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue when all of the following
	conditions are satisfied: (1) there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement; (2) the service has been provided to the customer;
	(3) the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable; and (4) the collection of our fees is reasonably assured.


	 


	Thus, we recognize subscription revenue
	on a monthly basis, as services are provided. Customers are billed for the subscription on a monthly, quarterly, semi-annual or
	annual basis, at the customer’s option.


	 



	Income Taxes



	 


	Income taxes are provided for the tax effects
	of transactions reported in the financial statements and consist of taxes currently due plus deferred taxes related primarily
	to differences between the bases of assets and liabilities for financial and income tax reporting. The deferred tax assets and
	liabilities represent the future tax return consequences of those differences, which will either be taxable or deductible when
	the assets and liabilities are recovered or settled. Deferred taxes are also recognized for operating losses that are available
	to offset future federal and state income taxes. Any interest charges on underpayment or other assessments are recorded as interest
	expense. Any penalties are recorded in Operating Expenses.


	 



	Net income (loss) per Common Share



	 


	Basic net income (loss) per share is computed
	by dividing the net loss attributable to the common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding
	during the period.


	 


	Fully diluted loss per share is computed
	similar to basic loss per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that
	would have been outstanding if the potential common shares had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive.  


	 


	Since the Company reflected a net loss
	for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014, the effect of considering any common stock equivalents would have been anti-dilutive
	and therefore a separate computation of diluted loss per share is not presented. The Company did not have any common stock equivalents
	during the three and six months ended June 30, 2013.


	 



	Recent Accounting Pronouncements



	 


	No new accounting pronouncements issued
	or effective during the fiscal year has had or is expected to have a material impact on the financial statements.


	 



	Reclassifications




	 



	Certain financial statement line items
	in the 2013 amounts presented in the interim financial statement as of June 30, 2014, and for the periods then ended, have been
	reclassified to conform to the reporting method adopted for the interim financial statements. Such reclassifications had no significant
	impact on previously reported financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.


	 



	Note 3 – ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND
	FACTORING AGREEMENT



	 


	In the ordinary course of business, the
	Company utilizes accounts receivable-credit card factoring agreements with third-party financing company in order to accelerate
	its cash collections from product sales. In addition, these agreements provide the Company with the ability to limit credit exposure
	to potential bad debts, to better manage costs related to collections as well as to enable customers to extend their credit terms.
	These agreements involve the ownership transfer of eligible trade accounts receivable, without recourse or discount, to a third
	party financial institution in exchange for cash.

	Note 3 – ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND FACTORING AGREEMENT
	(Continued)



	 


	The Company accounts for these transactions
	in accordance with ASC 860, "Transfers and Servicing" ("ASC 860"). ASC 860 allows for the ownership transfer
	of accounts receivable to qualify for sale treatment when the appropriate criteria is met, which permits the Company to present
	the balances sold under the program to be excluded from

	  Accounts receivable, net

	  on the Consolidated
	Balance Sheet. Receivables are considered sold when (i) they are transferred beyond the reach of the Company and its creditors,
	(ii) the purchaser has the right to pledge or exchange the receivables, and (iii) the Company has surrendered control over the
	transferred receivables. In addition, the Company provides no other forms of continued financial support to the purchaser of the
	receivables once the receivables are sold. Amounts due from the financial company are recorded with

	other current assets

	In connection with the SEA, the Company
	assumed three convertible promissory notes for an aggregate of $13,670, net of debt discount. The notes mature on September
	14, 2014 and accrue interest at a rate of 12% per annum. The note principal is convertible at a price of $.00382 per share.
	At issuance the fair market value of the Company’s common stock was $.013 per share. The conversion feature of the note
	is considered beneficial to the investor due to the conversion price for the convertible note being lower than the fair market
	value of the common stock on the date the note was issued. The beneficial conversion feature was recorded at the debt’s
	inception as a discount of the debt of $76,429 and is being amortized over the lives of the convertible debt. Amortization
	of debt discount during the six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013 was $37,490 and $0, respectively and the unamortized discount
	at June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 was $15,741 and $0, respectively. Interest expense recorded on the convertible notes
	for the six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013 was $4,547 and $0, respectively.

	 


	One of the holders of the
	convertible promissory notes with a principal value of $25,476, entered into note purchase and assignment agreements whereby
	half of the principal of the note was assigned to two separate note holders. The original note was substituted and replaced
	by two amended and restated 12% convertible promissory notes with restated principal amounts of $12,738 each. All other terms
	of the original note remain in effect.

	Note 5 – CONVERTIBLE PROMISSORY NOTES (Continued)



	 




	In connection with the SEA, the Company assumed a convertible note for an aggregate
	of $36,363, net of debt discount. The note matures on November 7, 2014 and interest accrues at a rate of 20% per annum. The
	note principal is convertible into common stock at the rate of $.001 per share or 50 million shares of the Company’s
	common stock but such conversion can only take effect upon default of the note. The note is secured by 59,400,000 shares of
	the Company’s common stock. In conjunction with the note the Company issued 750,000 shares of restricted common stock
	and 1,000,000 common stock purchase warrants exercisable for twelve months at $.10 per warrant for one share of Company common
	stock.

	 

	The relative fair value of the common stock and warrants at the debt’s inception of $6,884 and
	$9,121, respectively were recorded as a discount to the debt and are being amortized to debt discount over the life of the
	debt. The fair value of the warrants was calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions:
	expected life of 1.0 years; volatility of 606.16%; no dividend yield; and a risk free interest rate of 0.11%. Amortization
	of debt discount during the six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013 was $7,936 and $0, respectively and the unamortized discount
	at June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 was $5,701 and $13,637, respectively. Interest expense recorded on the convertible

	Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements


	(Unaudited)


	 



	Note 7 – STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY



	 


	In April 2013 the FSTWV preferred stock
	holders A, B, C and D series converted their prefer shares into common shares of the Company.


	 


	On September 19, 2013 we issued 1,000,000
	shares of common stock to settle a note payable with our former shareholder.


	 


	On November 7, 2014 in conjunction with
	the issuance of a convertible note the Company issued 750,000 shares of restricted common stock and 1,000,000 common stock purchase
	warrants exercisable for twelve months at $.10 per warrant for one share of Company common stock.


	 


	On November 16, 2013 we entered into the
	SEA and effected our merger and recapitalization.


	 



	Note 8 – RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS



	 


	During the years ended December 31, 2013
	and 2012 the Company received loans from a relative of the CEO. The loans are due on demand and have no interest. Amounts outstanding
	as of June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 were $10,000 and $10,000, respectively.


	 



	Note 9 – INCOME TAX



	 


	We experienced a change of control coincident
	with the execution of the SEA. On that date we had cumulative net operating losses totaling approximately $166,000. Management
	has determined that due to the impact of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, the application of net operating loss carry
	forwards against future taxable income will be severally limited. Accordingly, we believe the tax benefit of such loses will be
	insignificant and we therefore chose not to present a deferred tax benefit or valuation allowance as of June 30, 2014 or December
	31, 2013 and estimate that the cumulative value of timing differences between the carrying value of assets and liabilities for
	tax purposes is also insignificant.


	 



	Note 10 – COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES



	 



	Office Lease



	 


	On June 13, 2011 the Company signed an
	amendment to its lease originally signed on May 9, 2008. The amended lease commenced August 1, 2011 and expires July 31, 2014.
	Rent expense was approximately $8,235 and $16,470 for the three months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively.


	 


	Minimum future lease commitments are as
	follows:

	Executive Employment Agreement



	 


	The Company has an employment agreement
	with the CEO/Chairman to perform duties and responsibilities as may be assigned by the Board of Directors. The base salary is
	in the amount of $100,000 per annum plus an annual discretionary bonus plus benefits commencing on December 17, 2013 and ending
	May 1, 2017 with an automatic renewal on each anniversary date (May 1) thereafter.

	Litigations, Claims and Assessments



	 


	The Company may become involved in various
	lawsuits and legal proceedings, which arise in the ordinary course of business. However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties,
	and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise that may harm its business. The Company is currently not aware of any
	such legal proceedings or claims that they believe will have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on its
	business, financial condition or operating results.


	 



	Note 11 – SUBSEQUENT EVENTS



	 


	The Company has evaluated subsequent events
	after the balance sheet date of June 30, 2014 through August13, 2014, the date the financial statements are available to be issued
	and determined that there are certain reportable events to be disclosed as follows:


	 


	On July 7, 2014, the Company issued two
	$10,000 convertible promissory notes. The notes mature on July 7, 2015 and accrues interest at a rate of 12% per annum. The notes
	principal and interest are convertible at a price of $.10 per share. In conjunction with the notes, the Company issued each note
	holder a 100,000 common stock purchase warrant exercisable for 12 months at a price of $.125 per share.

	MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION OF FINANCIAL
	CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION



	 



	Plan of Operation



	 


	Below is our plan of operations for the next twelve months.




	 






	Management




	 


	We will need to pay our management team and consultants that
	assist with managerial and administration efforts in the next twelve months.  We have 5 employees, including a CEO, Director
	of Sales, Lead Developer, VP of Operations, and Client Success Manager, and 7 consultants that assist with mobile consulting, systems
	engineering, social media efforts and graphic design, on an as-needed basis.  We do not have employment agreements or
	written consulting agreements with any of our personnel, except for our CEO, Asefi Wais.  His employment agreement obligates
	us to pay him $100,000 annually.  In order to compensate him and all of the above managerial and administrative support,
	we will require $385,000 in the next twelve months.


	 




	Marketing Plan and Personnel




	 


	The goal is to build engaging content for potential clients
	to make it clear what we do and that we excel at it. The target audience for potential and existing clients is primarily small
	to medium businesses.


	 


	Our objectives to meet this goal include the following:


	 




	 



	●




	revamping our website and setting up Google analytics for tracking SEO and keywords;





	 



	●




	setting up accounts for Facebook and LinkedIn for paid advertisements;





	 



	●




	designing and participating in various social media sites;





	 



	●




	blogging, preparing newsletters, and engaging in email campaigns; and





	 



	●




	hosting web seminars with attendance driven by the foregoing;





	 


	To accomplish these objectives, we will need to hire bloggers,
	programmers, and graphic, web and video developers.  We estimate the cost for these personnel at $115,000 in the next
	twelve months.


	 


	We also need to revamp our website, purchase marketing software
	and materials, Google Analytics, hire IR/PR consultants, set aside money for conventions, and advertise for Facebook, LinkedIn
	and other social media. We estimate these expenses at $340,000 for the next twelve months.


	 




	Sales Personnel




	 


	We intend to hire sales personnel to help grow our business.  Our
	anticipated sales force will work in teams of two. There will be a position for LDR (Lead Development & Research), who is responsible
	for originating new leads and converting those leads into scheduled appointments for an AR (Account Representative), who will perform
	an online demo overview about our company and the services we offer.  We expect to pay an LDR $25,000 annually and the
	AE $30,000 annually.


	 


	We hope to eventually have a team in place for each our targeted
	customer groups, which are as follows:

	 




	 




	1. 






	Lifestyle

	: salons, spas, health clubs, gyms, fitness centers, massage, hotels, etc.





	 




	2. 






	Entertainment

	: golf, comedy, bars & nightclubs, casinos, bowling, etc,





	 




	3. 






	Food & restaurant

	: QSR and restaurant style





	 




	4. 






	Retail

	: automotive, clothing, apparel, car washes





	 


	As we continue to grow, sales teams will be added in each
	targeted customer group according to geographic region.


	 


	From our past experience, one team should be able to reach
	out to 1,600 contacts, and yield 60 demos per month.  With this forecast, which is really just an estimate, one team
	could generate $6,000 in new sales per month. We hope to hire 2 teams for a total of $110,000 in the next twelve months.


	  







	27











	Table of Contents









	  


	We will have one Sales Director over teams and more may be
	added as our company grows and our geographical customer base expands.  The sales Director is responsible for leading
	and developing the sales team, organizing and assigning industry specifics and regions, and working hand in hand with current and
	new partners for sustained growth.   We have one Sales Director already and do not plan on using the proceeds of
	this Offering to hire anymore.


	 



	Professional Fees



	 


	We expect to spend roughly $50,000 in professional fees for
	legal and accounting support in the next twelve months.


	 



	Our Budget



	 


	We have broken down all of the above
	expenses in the section of this Prospectus titled, “Use of Proceeds.”  Our optimum level of growth for success
	will be achieved if we are able to raise $1,000,000 in the next twelve months.  With our Primary Offering, we hope to
	accomplish this goal.  However, funds are difficult to raise in today’s economic environment; thus, we have allocated
	funds in the Use of Proceeds if we are unable to raise $1,000,000 according to percentages of net proceeds received.  If
	we are unable to raise $1,000,000 our ability to implement our business plan and achieve our goals will be significantly diminished.
	We do not have a minimum amount of funds to raise in the Primary Offering. Thus, if we are unable to enough money to pay our expenses
	and meet our goals, you could lose your entire investment tin our business.


	 


	We have generated revenue but we
	have experienced a history of losses. At June 30, 2014 we had cash on hand of $6,627 and accumulated a deficit of $$292,594. We
	currently have $594 cash on hand. Our monthly expenses have historically been approximately $18,000 and we have had sufficient
	revenues to cover those expenses in the past. The added costs of going public have resulted in a monthly burn rate of approximately
	$10,600 in recent months.  Thus, even though our revenues fund most of our operating expenses, we have taken on small
	loans to help bridge the gap with the onset of accounting and professional fees in connection with going public. We have raised
	approximately $160,000 in small loans since September 2013. There is no guarantee that these small loans will be available to
	us in the future. We expect that we will not be able to continue operations beyond 6 months with our current available capital
	resources, which presently consist of $594 in cash and our monthly revenues, without obtaining additional funding or generating
	more revenues. We will need at a minimum $100,000 in capital to fund operations in the next 12 months.


	 


	We plan to ramp up operations to generate
	additional revenues beyond our existing revenues but this will require additional funding. We anticipate that additional funding
	will be needed for general administrative expenses, business development, marketing costs and support materials. We hope to raise
	$1,000,000 in this Offering to conduct such activities in the next twelve months.

	Results of Operation for the Years Ended December 31,
	2013 and 2012



	 




	Revenues




	 


	For the year ended December 31, 2013,
	we earned revenues in the amount of $339,533, as compared with revenues of $246,224 for the year ended December 31, 2012. Our
	increase revenues from 2012 to 2013 has been due to clients upgrading their accounts from smaller packages to larger monthly subscriptions
	as a result of the success they have been experiencing with their mobile marketing programs.  We have seen steady growth
	in sales from clients asking to increase their SMS volume, which in turn increases their monthly subscription costs.  We
	expect this trend to continue in our ongoing operations.


	 


	We believe our focus on select industries
	will provide better customer service and further increase sales in our ongoing operations.  Our future growth plans
	are in the following verticals: health and fitness, golf courses, and quick service restaurants.  Our plan is to onboard
	1000 new health and fitness gyms (to complement the 5500 in our existing sales pipeline) through our partner companies such as
	Clubready, ABC financial, Money movers, CFG retention group and other current partners in the health and fitness industry.  Based
	on our current targeted marketing vertical, we are also expecting to bring on 200 golf courses and 100 United States Air Force
	bases.


	 


	We believe there is a current trend
	to expand mobile marketing as an effective means of marketing to customers.  We are seeing more and more companies turning
	to mobile marketing as a way to communicate and engage with their members/customers.


	 


	We expect that our integration with
	Customer Relation Management (CRM) systems to collect a unified view of customer behavior with analytics and mobile usage behavior
	data as well as data from other sources, such as accounting or order processing systems, will become easier to integrate in 2015
	as most merchant software will have an open API to work with our client’s data base. This will allow our customers to compile
	customer data in a way that is more easily measurable and actionable. We believe this ease of use will stimulate increased sales
	in our ongoing operations.


	 


	We further anticipate that our revenues
	will increase in 2014, especially if we are able to raise funding sought in this prospectus to expand our footprint in the industry.




	 








	Operating Expenses




	 


	Our operating expenses were $346,836
	for the year ended December 31, 2013, as compared with $200,845 for the year ended December 31, 2012. Our operating expenses for

	ended December 31, 2013 consisted of $11,654 in amortization of debt discount, $2,561 in interest expenses, and $6,368 in factoring
	expenses.  Other expenses for the year ended December 31, 2012 consisted solely of loss on debt settlement.


	 




	Net Loss




	 


	We had a net loss of $111,947 for the
	year ended December 31, 2013, as compared with $25,460 for the year ended December 31, 2012.

	Results of Operation for Three
	Months Ended June 30, 2014 and 2013



	 




	Revenues




	 


	For the three months ended June
	30, 2014, we earned revenues in the amount of $72,439, as compared with revenues of $76,464 for the three months ended June 30,
	2013. The decrease of $4,025 is due to a temporary lull in sales.


	 




	Cost of sales




	 


	Cost of sales was $18,363 and $19,882
	for the three months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The decrease of $1,519 was attributed to the decrease in sales.


	 




	Operating Expenses




	 


	Our operating expenses were $73,109
	for the three months ended June 30, 2014, as compared with $61,243 for the three months ended June 30, 2013.  Our operating
	expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2014 mainly consisted of commissions of $6,185, consulting fees of $25,300, payroll
	of $4,022, and rent of $9,083 compared to commissions of $8,284, consulting fees of $26,360, payroll of $5,263 and rent of $8,713

	Net Loss




	 


	We had a net loss of $55,622 for
	the three months ended June 30, 2014, as compared with net loss of $4,661 for the three months ended June 30, 2013.

	Months Ended June 30, 2014 and 2013



	 




	Revenues




	 


	For the six months ended June 30,
	2014, we earned revenues in the amount of $182,307, as compared with revenues of $186,958 for the six months ended June 30, 2013.
	The decrease of $4,651 was due to a change in our target market. In the previous year, we focused our marketing effort on quick
	sale restaurants. In the current year we are focused on enterprise and API projects in the health and fitness industries.


	 




	Cost of sales




	 


	Cost of sales was $50,811 and $25,282
	for the six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The increase of $25,529 was due to additional costs incurred as
	we switched SMS service providers and expanded into Canada.




	 






	Operating Expenses




	 


	Our operating expenses were $187,124
	for the six months ended June 30, 2014, as compared with $153,364 for the six months ended June 30, 2013.  Our operating
	expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2014 mainly consisted of commissions of $12,444, consulting fees of $59,800, professional

	in factoring expenses.


	 


	We had a net loss of $126,465 for

	Liquidity and Capital Resources



	 


	As of June 30, 2014, we had total
	current assets of $17,147. Our total current liabilities as of June 30, 2014 were $256,754. We had a working capital deficit
	of $239,607 as of June 30, 2014.


	 




	Cashflows from Operating Activities




	 


	Operating activities used $61,657
	in cash the six months ended June 30, 2014. Our net loss of $126,465 was the main component of our negative operating cash flow,
	offset mainly by amortization of debt discount of $51,679 and stock based compensation of $6,113.


	 




	Cashflows from Financing Activities




	 


	Cash flows provided by financing
	activities during the six months ended June 30, 2014 amounted to $69,047 and consisted mostly of proceeds from the sale of convertible
	promissory notes and shareholder contributions.


	 


	Based upon our current financial
	condition, we do not have sufficient cash to operate our business at the current level for the next twelve months. We anticipate
	needing approximately $1,000,000 in the next 12 months. We only have $6,627 in cash as of June 30, 2014 and this amount is not
	sufficient for our needs.


	 


	We do not have any formal commitments
	or arrangements for the sales of stock or the advancement or loan of funds at this time. There can be no assurance that such additional
	financing will be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.



	 




	Going Concern



	 


	As of June 30, 2014, we have an
	accumulated deficit of $292,594. Our ability to continue as a going concern is contingent upon the successful completion of additional
	financing arrangements and our ability to achieve and maintain profitable operations. While we are expanding our best efforts
	to achieve the above plans, there is no assurance that any such activity will generate funds that will be available for operations.
	These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. These financial statements do not include
	any adjustments that might arise from this uncertainty.


	 



	Off Balance Sheet Arrangements



	 


	As of June 30, 2014, there were no off balance sheet
	arrangements.

	Emerging Growth Company Status



	 


	We are an "emerging growth company"
	as defined under the Jumpstart our Business Startups Act ("JOBS Act").  We will remain an "emerging growth
	company" for up to five years, or until the earliest of:

	In addition, section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an
	"emerging growth company" can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in section 7(a)(2)(B) of the
	Securities Act of 1933 (the "Securities Act") for complying with new or revised accounting standards. Under this provision,
	an "emerging growth company" can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise
	apply to private companies. However, we are choosing to "opt out" of such extended transition period and, as a result,
	we will comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for
	non-emerging growth companies. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that our decision to opt out of the extended transition period
	for complying with new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable.

	understanding, relationship, or otherwise has or shares: (i) voting power, which includes the power to vote, or to direct
	the voting of shares; and (ii) investment power, which includes the power to dispose or direct the disposition of shares.
	Certain shares may be deemed to be beneficially owned by more than one person (if, for example, persons share the power to
	vote or the power to dispose of the shares). In addition, shares are deemed to be beneficially owned by a person if the person
	has the right to acquire the shares (for example, upon exercise of an option) within 60 days of the date as of which the information
	is provided. In computing the percentage ownership of any person, the amount of shares outstanding is deemed to include the
	amount of shares beneficially owned by such person (and only such person) by reason of these acquisition rights. As of June
	30, 2014, there were 67,082,167 common shares issued and outstanding.

	Senior Secured Convertible Promissory Note



	 


	In November of 2013, the company issued
	a Senior Secured Convertible Promissory Note to Realty Capital Management in the principal amount of $50,000.  In order
	to induce the financing, our officer and director, Wais Asefi, agreed to pledge 59,400,000 of his personal shares as collateral
	to secure payment under the note.  Other material terms of the note are as follows:


	 




	 


	●



	Our attorneys will hold the 59,400,000 shares in escrow for the term of the note and the shares will either be returned to Mr. Asefi if full repayment is made on the note along with all interest due or, upon default, be delivered to Realty Capital Management. Mr. Asefi will retain all shareholders rights to these shares while they are in escrow.





	 




	 


	●



	The note matures on September 1, 2014.





	 




	 


	●



	The note accrues interest at 20% per annum payable quarterly. The first payment is due 30 days from execution of the note.





	 




	 


	●



	We agreed to issue 750,000 shares of restricted common stock to Realty Capital Management. These shares will have Piggyback Registration rights and may be sold under Rule 144 six months after issuance assuming we are current in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and Rule 144 applies. In addition, we agreed to give Realty Capital Management 1,000,000 12 month stock purchase warrants exercisable at the price of $0.10 per warrant for one share of company common stock. These warrants, when exercised will have Piggyback Registration rights and may be sold under Rule 144 six months after issuance assuming we are current in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and Rule 144 applies.





	 




	 


	●



	The note is convertible into common stock at the rate of $0.001 per share or 50 Million shares of our common stock. However, such conversion can only take effect upon Default of the note.

	●



	We may prepay the note within 180 days by paying 115% of the principal due plus all accrued interest. From day 181 to 365 the note can be pre-paid by paying 100% of the note plus all accrued interest.





	 




	 


	●



	In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up, Realty Capital Management will be entitled to receive any unpaid and accrued interest and principal under the note before anyone else.





	 




	 


	●



	During the life of the note, we will not issue any additional common shares or any type of hybrid shares providing super voting preference over our common stock. In addition, we will not sell, transfer or issue in any respect our preferred stock authorized without first seeking the written permission of Realty Capital Management, which permission shall not unreasonably be withheld.





	 





	DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE



	 


	We intend to apply to have our common shares quoted on the
	OTC Bulletin Board inter-dealer quotation system, which does not have director independence requirements.  Under NASDAQ
	Rule 5605(a)(2), a director is not considered to be independent if he or she is also an executive officer or employee of the corporation.  
	Wais Asefi is not an independent director as a result of his employment as President and CEO.  Accordingly, we do not
	have any independent members on our Board of Directors.


	 


	As a result of our limited operating history and minimal
	resources, our management believes that it will have difficulty in attracting independent directors.  In addition, we
	would likely be required to obtain directors and officers insurance coverage in order to attract and retain independent directors.  Our
	management believes that the costs associated with maintaining such insurance is prohibitive at this time.


	 





	DISCLOSURE OF COMMISSION POSITION
	ON INDEMNIFICATION FOR SECURITIES ACT LIABILITIES



	 


	Our Articles provide that we will indemnify an officer, director,
	or former officer or director, to the full extent permitted by law.  Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising
	under the Securities Act may be permitted to our directors, officers and controlling persons pursuant to the foregoing provisions,
	or otherwise, we have been advised that in the opinion of the SEC such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in
	the Securities Act, and is, therefore, unenforceable.


	 


	In the event that a claim for indemnification against such
	liabilities, other than the payment by us of expenses incurred or paid by one of our directors, officers, or controlling persons
	in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding, is asserted by one of our directors, officers, or controlling persons
	in connection with the securities being registered, we will, unless in the opinion of our counsel the matter has been settled by
	controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification is against public
	policy as expressed in the Securities Act, and we will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.

	INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS



	 


	Our officers and directors are indemnified as provided by
	the Nevada Revised Statutes and our bylaws.


	 


	Under the governing Nevada statutes, director immunity from
	liability to a company or its shareholders for monetary liabilities applies automatically unless it is specifically limited by
	a company's articles of incorporation. Our articles of incorporation do not contain any limiting language regarding director immunity
	from liability. Excepted from this immunity are:


	 




	 



	1.




	a willful failure to deal fairly with the company or its shareholders in connection with a matter in which the director has a material conflict of interest;





	 




	 



	2.




	a violation of criminal law (unless the director had reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was lawful or no reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was unlawful);





	 




	 



	3.




	a transaction from which the director derived an improper personal profit; and





	 




	 



	4.




	willful misconduct.





	  


	Our bylaws provide that we will indemnify our directors and
	officers to the fullest extent not prohibited by Nevada law; provided, however, that we may modify the extent of such indemnification
	by individual contracts with our directors and officers; and, provided, further, that we shall not be required to indemnify any
	director or officer in connection with any proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person unless:


	 




	 



	1.




	such indemnification is expressly required to be made by law;





	 




	 



	2.




	the proceeding was authorized by our Board of Directors;





	 




	 



	3.




	such indemnification is provided by us, in our sole discretion, pursuant to the powers vested us under Nevada law; or;





	 




	 



	4.




	such indemnification is required to be made pursuant to the bylaws.

	Our bylaws provide that we will advance
	to any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or
	proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that he is or was a director or officer,
	of the company, or is or was serving at the request of the company as a director or executive officer of another company, partnership,
	joint venture, trust or other enterprise, prior to the final disposition of the proceeding, promptly following request therefore,
	all expenses incurred by any director or officer in connection with such proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf
	of such person to repay said amounts if it should be determined ultimately that such person is not entitled to be indemnified under
	our bylaws or otherwise.


	 


	Our bylaws provide that no advance shall
	be made by us to an officer of the company, except by reason of the fact that such officer is or was a director of the company
	in which event this paragraph shall not apply, in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
	if a determination is reasonably and promptly made: (a) by the board of directors by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of
	directors who were not parties to the proceeding, or (b) if such quorum is not obtainable, or, even if obtainable, a quorum of
	disinterested directors so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, that the facts known to the decision-making
	party at the time such determination is made demonstrate clearly and convincingly that such person acted in bad faith or in a manner
	that such person did not believe to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the company.

	UNDERTAKINGS



	 


	The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes:


	 


	1. To file, during any period in which offers or sales are
	being made, a post-effective amendment to this registration statement;


	 


	(a) to include any prospectus required by Section 10(a)(3)
	of the Securities Act of 1933;


	 


	(b) to reflect in the prospectus any facts or events which,
	individually or together, represent a fundamental change in the information in the registration statement; and Notwithstanding
	the forgoing, any increase or decrease in volume of securities offered (if the total dollar value of securities offered would not
	exceed that which was registered) and any deviation From the low or high end of the estimated maximum offering range may be reflected
	in the form of prospects filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) if, in the aggregate, the changes in the volume and
	price represent no more than a 20% change in the maximum aggregate offering price set forth in the "Calculation of Registration
	Fee" table in the effective registration statement.; and


	 


	(c) to include any material information with respect to the
	plan of distribution not previously disclosed in this registration statement or any material change to such information in the
	registration statement.


	 


	2. That, for the purpose of determining any liability under
	the Securities Act, each such post-effective amendment shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities
	offered herein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.


	 


	3. To remove from registration by means of a post-effective
	amendment any of the securities being registered hereby which remain unsold at the termination of the offering.


	 


	Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under
	the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to our directors, officers and controlling persons pursuant to the provisions above,
	or otherwise, we been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public
	policy as expressed in the Securities Act of 1933, and is, therefore, unenforceable.


	 


	In the event that a claim for indemnification against such
	liabilities, other than the payment by us of expenses incurred or paid by one of our directors, officers, or controlling persons
	in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding, is asserted by one of our directors, officers, or controlling persons
	in connection with the securities being registered, we will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by
	controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification is against public
	policy as expressed in the Securities Act of 1933, and we will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.


	 


	4. That each prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) as
	part of a registration statement relating to the Offering shall be deemed to be part of and included in the registration statement
	as of the date it is first used after effectiveness. Provided, however, that no statement made in a registration statement or prospectus
	that is part of the registration statement or made in a document incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference into the registration
	statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement will, as to a purchaser with a time of contract of sale prior
	to such first use, supersede or modify any statement that was made in the registration statement or prospectus that was part of
	the registration statement or made in any such document immediately prior to such date of first use.


	 


	5. That, for the purpose of determining liability of the
	registrant under the Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser in the initial distribution of the securities:


	 


	The undersigned registrant undertakes that in a primary offering
	of securities of the undersigned registrant pursuant to this registration statement, regardless of the underwriting method used
	to sell the securities to the purchaser, if the securities are offered or sold to such purchaser by means of any of the following
	communications, the undersigned registrant will be a seller to the purchaser and will be considered to offer or sell such securities
	to such purchaser:


	 


	(i) Any preliminary prospectus or prospectus of the undersigned
	registrant relating to the offering required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424 (§230.424 of this chapter);


	 


	(ii) Any free writing prospectus relating to the offering
	prepared by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant or used or referred to by the undersigned registrant;


	 


	(iii) The portion of any other free writing prospectus relating
	to the offering containing material information about the undersigned registrant or its securities provided by or on behalf of
	the undersigned registrant; and


	 


	(iv) Any other communication that is an offer in the offering
	made by the undersigned registrant to the purchaser.

SMS, The Versatile Medium


How can the versatility of SMS be measured? Time never fails to produce new ideas and different innovative paths of utilization for almost anything. We are all familiar with the message body, it is a very important piece for displaying ad text. Before it is decorated with text, from a glance it is a blank canvas of white space. The psychology of white space tells us how it can be nutrient for sophistication.

SMS Notifications vs Push Notifications


Are SMS notifications more effective than push notifications? Kind of a weird questions to ask, but definitely something to think about if your try to figure out if you should build an application to communicate with your clients or just find a text messaging program. Let’s investigate a little about mobile applications. The thing is companies invest a lot of time in how their applications connect and communicate with us. From the perspective of the application, notifications and alerts are their voice. This is one of the most important features of any app because it is how the app will inform the user, which ultimately means how the company will.

Key Points When Deciding On Marketing and Advertising Tech


For every product or service business, marketing and advertising has an important role which can decide the success of the company. Well we all know that, but what about the technologies available that assist with branding, lead nurturing and loyalty? These words ultimately summarize the process on how your business is attracting your customers creatively and as the old fashion idiom goes the more you reach, the more you increase.

Benefits of White Labeling SMS


Expenditure towards the research and development of products and services can vary depending on the market you are trying to enter. Taking the time to define, frame and implement your product design can be costly, especially with how fast and destructively innovative certain product markets are becoming.

 Textmunication Holdings, Inc. (Form: 424B3, Received: 10/14/2014 16:13:21) 
















	  





	Prospectus







	 





	Filed
	Pursuant to Rule 424(b)(3)







	  





	File
	No. 333-196598







	 





	TEXTMUNICATION
	HOLDINGS, INC.





	 





	PROSPECTUS





	 





	10,000,000
	UNITS






	22,349,305
	COMMON SHARES





	 




	We
	are offering up to 10,000,000 Units in a direct offering (the “Primary Offering”). Each Unit consists of one share
	of common stock and a warrant to purchase one share of common stock at an exercise price of $0.25 per share. The warrants expire
	on December 31, 2017. Units will not be issued or certificated. The shares of common stock and warrants are immediately separable
	and will be issued separately, but will be purchased together in this Offering. The Units will be offered at a fixed price of
	$0.10 per Unit for the duration of the Primary Offering, even if our stock price in the market reflects differently. There is
	no minimum number of Units that must be sold by us for the Primary Offering to proceed and there is no assurance that we will
	sell any Units under the Primary Offering. We will retain the proceeds from the sale of any of the offered Units. The Units to
	be sold by us will be sold on our behalf by our President, Wais Asefi, on a best efforts basis. Mr. Asefi will not receive any
	commission on proceeds from the sale of our common shares on our behalf. See “Plan of Distribution and Determination of
	Offering Price.”




	 




	The
	selling security holders named in this prospectus are offering 22,349,305 common shares (the “Secondary Offering”),
	which includes 750,000 shares of common stock, 20,349,305 shares of common stock underlying convertible promissory notes and 1,250,000
	shares of common stock underlying warrants, all discussed elsewhere in this Prospectus. We will not receive any proceeds from
	the sale of shares being sold by selling security holders. We may receive the proceeds from the warrants if exercised.




	 




	The
	prices at which the selling security holders may sell their shares will be at a fixed price of $0.10 per share until such time
	as the shares of our common stock are traded on the OTC Bulletin Board sponsored by FINRA or OTCQB operated by OTC Markets Group,
	Inc. Although we intend to apply for quotation of our common stock on the OTC Bulletin Board or OTCQB through a market maker,
	public trading of our common stock may never materialize. If our common stock becomes traded on the OTC Bulletin Board or OTCQB,
	then the sale price to the public will vary according to prevailing market prices or privately negotiated prices by the selling
	shareholders.




	 




	The
	selling security holders may resell their shares to or through underwriters, broker-dealers or agents, who may receive compensation
	in the form of discounts, concessions or commissions. In addition, the selling security holders and any broker-dealers who execute
	sales for the selling security holders may be deemed to be an “underwriter” in connection with such sales. The selling
	security holders named in this prospectus will bear the costs of all commission or discounts, if any, attributable to the sale
	of their shares. We are bearing the costs, expenses and fees associated with the registration of the common shares in this prospectus.
	See “Plan of Distribution and Determination of Offering Price.”




	 




	The
	Primary Offering and the Secondary Offering will terminate nine months after this registration statement is declared effective
	by the SEC. We plan to continue to update the registration statement and prospectus for the exercise of the warrants that comprise
	the Units even after the Offering of the Units has terminated. We do not have any arrangements to place any proceeds of the offering
	in escrow, trust or any other similar account.




	 




	Our
	common stock is quoted on the OTCPinks operated by OTC Markets Group, Inc. under the symbol “TXHD.” On August 11,
	2014, the last reported sale price of our common stock as reported on the OTCPinks was $0.20 per share. There is not an active
	trading market for our stock. Although we intend to apply for quotation of our common shares on the OTC Bulletin Board or OTCQB,
	active trading of our common shares may never materialize.




	 




	We
	are an “emerging growth company” as that term is used in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS
	Act”). See "Description of Business” and “Risk Factors.”




	 





	The
	purchase of the securities offered through this prospectus involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully read and consider
	the section of this prospectus titled “Risk Factors” on page 4 before buying any common shares.





	 





	Neither
	the SEC nor any state securities commission has approved or disapproved of these securities or passed upon the adequacy or accuracy
	of this prospectus. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense.





	 





	This
	Prospectus is dated October 14, 2014

	SUMMARY





	 





	As
	used in this prospectus, unless the context otherwise requires, “we,” “us,” “our,” the “Company”
	and “TXHD” refers to Textmunication Holdings, Inc. All dollar amounts in this prospectus are in U.S. dollars unless
	otherwise stated. You should read the entire prospectus before making an investment decision to purchase our common shares.





	 





	About
	Us





	 




	We
	were formed in October 1984 in the State of Georgia as Brock Control Systems. Founded by Richard T. Brock, we were in the sales
	automation market and an early developer of enterprise customer management systems. We went public at the end of March of 1993.
	In February of 1996, we changed our name to Brock International Inc., and in March of 1998, we again changed our name to Firstwave
	Technologies, Inc.




	 




	In
	2007, we deregistered our common stock in order to avoid the expenses of being a public company. The company reported briefly
	on the OTC Disclosure & News Service in 2008 but not for long. We again changed our name to FSTWV, Inc.




	 




	On
	October 28, 2013, we held a shareholder meeting to reincorporate our company in the State of Nevada and concurrently change our
	name to Textmunication Holdings, Inc. We also voted to approve a 1 for 5 reverse split of our outstanding common stock.




	 




	Following
	our shareholder meeting, on November 16, 2013, we entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (SEA) with Textmunication, Inc. a California
	corporation and Wais Asefi (its sole shareholder), whereby we issued 65,640,207 new shares of common stock in exchange for 100%
	of the issued and outstanding shares of Textmunication, Inc. and simultaneously the major shareholder of the company retired 1,128,041
	post reverse shares (pre-split: 5,640,207) of our common stock to the company’s treasury. As a result of the SEA, we acquired
	Textmunication, Inc. and have assumed its business operations. We are now in the mobile marketing business.




	 




	Our
	principal executive office is located at 1940 Contra Costa Blvd. Pleasant Hill, CA 94523 and our telephone number is (925)-777-2111.




	 





	Overview
	of Our Business





	 




	We
	are engaged in the mobile marketing and loyalty space industry, providing cutting-edge mobile marketing solutions, rewards and
	loyalty to our clients. With a powerful yet intuitive suite of services, clients are able to reach more customers faster and reward
	them for repeat business. We help clients reach their marketing and revenue goals by educating clients with the most effective
	tools in mobile marketing, rewards, paperless redemption and loyalty.




	 




	For
	the past 4 years, we have grown to over 800 clients in the United States, Canada and Mexico. Our goal is to achieve 15,000 clients
	by the fourth quarter of 2014. We hope to achieve this by expanding our focus to include more restaurants, retailers, entertainment
	venues and partnership opportunities, which already have a relationship with our target market to help both monetize and deliver
	ROI to joint clients.

	The Offering





	 







	Common
	Shares Offered by Us:





	  




	10,000,000
	Units at a fixed price of $0.10 per Unit. Each Unit consists of one share of Common Stock and a warrant to purchase one share
	of Common Stock. The warrant may be exercised into one share of Common Stock at an exercise price of $0.25 per share and expires
	on December 31, 2017






	  




	  




	  







	Common
	Shares Offered by the Selling Security Holders:





	  




	22,349,305
	common shares at a fixed price of $0.10 per share. We intend to apply to the OTC Bulletin Board or OTCQB, through a market
	maker that is a licensed broker dealer, to allow the trading of our common stock upon our becoming a reporting entity under
	the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. If our common stock becomes so traded and a market for the stock develops, the actual
	price of stock will be determined by prevailing market prices at the time of sale or by private transactions negotiated by
	the selling shareholders.    The offering price would thus be determined by market factors and the independent
	decisions of the selling shareholders.






	  




	  




	  







	Minimum
	Number of Common Shares To Be Sold in This Offering:





	  




	None.






	  




	  




	  







	Number
	of Shares Outstanding Before the Offering:





	  




	67,082,167
	common shares are issued and outstanding as of the date of this prospectus.






	  




	  




	  







	Use of
	Proceeds:





	  




	Any
	proceeds that we receive from this offering will be used by us to pay for the expenses of this offering and as general working
	capital.

	RISK
	FACTORS





	 




	An
	investment in our common shares involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below and the
	other information in this prospectus before investing in our common shares. If any of the following risks occur, our business,
	operating results and financial condition could be seriously harmed. The trading price of our common shares, if we publicly trade
	at a later date, could decline due to any of these risks, and you may lose all or part of your investment.



	 





	Risks
	Related to Our Financial Condition






	 





	If
	we do not obtain additional financing, our business expansion plans will be delayed and we may not achieve profitable operations.





	 




	We
	may not realize sufficient proceeds from this Offering to further business development, or to provide adequate cash flow for planned
	business activities. At June 30, 2014 we had cash on hand of $6,627 and accumulated a deficit of $292,594. We currently have $594
	cash on hand. Our monthly expenses have historically been approximately $18,000 and we have had sufficient revenues to cover those
	expenses in the past. The added costs of going public have resulted in a monthly burn rate of approximately $10,600 in recent
	months. Thus, even though our revenues fund most of our operating expenses, we have taken on small loans to help bridge the gap
	with the onset of accounting and professional fees in connection with going public. We have raised approximately $160,000 in small
	loans since September 2013. There is no guarantee that these small loans will be available to us in the future. We expect that
	we will not be able to continue operations beyond 6 months with our current available capital resources, which presently consist
	of $594 in cash and our monthly revenues, without obtaining additional funding or generating more revenues. We will need at a
	minimum $100,000 in capital to fund operations in the next 12 months.




	 




	We
	plan to ramp up operations to generate additional revenues beyond our existing revenues but this will require additional funding.
	We anticipate that additional funding will be needed for general administrative expenses, business development, marketing costs
	and support materials. We hope to raise $1,000,000 in this Offering to conduct such activities in the next twelve months.




	 




	We
	do not currently have any arrangements for financing and our obtaining additional financing will be subject to a number of factors,
	including general market conditions, investor acceptance of our plan of operations and initial results from our business operations.
	There is no assurance that any additional financing will be available or if available, on terms that will be acceptable to us.
	Failure to raise additional financing will cause us to go out of business. If this happens, you could lose all or part of your
	investment.




	 




	If
	our resources are insufficient to satisfy our cash requirements, we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain
	a credit facility. The sale of additional equity securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders. The incurrence
	of indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and could result in operating and financing covenants that
	would restrict our operations. We cannot assure you that financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us,
	if at all.




	 





	We
	have a limited operating history and may never be able to carry out our plan of operations or achieve any significant revenues
	or profitability. At this stage of our business, even with our good faith efforts, potential investors have a high probability
	of losing their entire investment.





	 




	We
	are subject to all of the risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise. The likelihood of our success must
	be considered in light of the problems, expenses, difficulties, complications and delays frequently encountered by a small emerging
	growth company starting a new business enterprise and the highly competitive environment in which we will operate. Since we have
	a limited operating history, we cannot assure you that our business will be profitable or that we will ever generate sufficient
	revenues to fully meet our expenses and totally support our anticipated activities. Any profitability in the future from our business
	will be dependent upon the successful development, marketing and sales of our mobile marketing systems and future products. Accordingly,
	we may not be able to successfully carry out our plan of operations and any investor may lose their entire investment.




	 





	There
	is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.





	 




	At
	June 30, 2014, we have a working capital deficit of $239,607 and an accumulated deficit of $292,594 since inception to June 30,
	2014. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our ability to generate
	future revenues will depend on a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include general economic
	conditions, market acceptance of our mobile marketing systems, proposed products and competitive efforts. Due to these factors,
	we cannot anticipate with any degree of certainty what our revenues will be in future periods. As such, our independent registered
	public accountants have expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. This opinion could materially
	limit our ability to raise additional funds by issuing new debt or equity securities or otherwise. You should consider our independent
	registered public accountant’s comments when determining if an investment our company is suitable.

	Risks
	Related To Our Business






	 





	We
	operate in an immature industry and have a relatively new business model, which makes it difficult to evaluate our business and
	prospects.





	 




	We
	derive nearly all of our revenue from the sale of marketing services, which is an immature industry that has undergone rapid and
	dramatic changes in its short history. The industry in which we operate is characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving
	industry standards, and changing user and client demands. Our business model is also evolving and is distinct from many other
	companies in our industry, and it may not be successful. As a result of these factors, the future revenue and income potential
	of our business is uncertain. Any evaluation of our business and our prospects must be considered in light of these factors and
	the risks and uncertainties often encountered by companies in an immature industry with an evolving business model such as ours.
	Some of these risks and uncertainties relate to our ability to:




	 






	  




	●




	maintain
	and expand client relationships;






	  




	●




	sustain
	and increase the number of customers on behalf of our clients marketing plans;






	  




	●




	manage
	our expanding operations and implement and improve our operational, financial and management controls;






	  




	●




	raise
	capital at attractive costs, or at all;






	  




	●




	successfully
	expand our footprint with existing clients and enter new client arrangments;






	  




	●




	respond
	effectively to competition and potential negative effects of competition on profit margins;






	  




	●




	attract
	and retain qualified management, employees and independent service providers;






	  




	●




	successfully
	introduce new processes and technologies and upgrade our existing technologies and services; and






	  




	●




	respond
	to government regulations relating to the Internet, marketing in our client verticals, personal data protection, email, software
	technologies and other aspects of our business.






	 




	If we are
	unable to address these risks, our business, results of operations and prospects could suffer.




	 





	Our operating
	results may fluctuate and our future revenues and profitability are uncertain.





	 




	Our
	operating results have varied in the past and may fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of a variety of factors, many
	of which are outside our control. These factors include the following:




	 






	  




	●




	current
	global economic and financial conditions as well as their impact on e-commerce, financial services, and the communications
	and Internet industries;






	  




	●




	our
	success in direct marketing and promotional campaigns;






	  




	●




	any
	changes to the scope and success of marketing efforts by third-parties;






	  




	●




	market
	acceptance of our services by our new customers;






	  




	●




	customer
	renewal rates and turnover of customers of our services,






	  




	●




	continued
	development of our distribution channels for our products and services;






	  




	●




	the
	impact of price changes in our products and services or our competitors' products and services;






	  




	●




	the
	impact of decisions by distributors to offer competing or replacement products or modify or cease their marketing practices;






	  




	●




	the
	availability of alternatives to our products;






	  




	●




	seasonal
	fluctuations in business activity;






	  




	●




	changes
	in marketing expenses related to promoting and distributing our services






	  




	●




	potential
	attacks, including hacktivism, by nefarious actors, which could threaten the perceived reliability of our products and services;






	  




	●




	changes
	in policies regarding Internet administration imposed by governments or governmental authorities outside the U.S.;






	  




	●




	potential
	disruptions in regional registration behaviors due to catastrophic natural events or armed conflict; and






	  




	●




	changes
	in the level of spending for information technology-related products and services by our customers.

	Table of Contents








	 




	Our
	operating expenses may increase. If an increase in our expenses is not accompanied by a corresponding increase in our revenues,
	our operating results will suffer, particularly as revenues from some of our services are recognized ratably over the term of
	the service, rather than immediately when the customer pays for them, unlike our sales and marketing expenditures, which are expensed
	in full when incurred. From our inception through June 30, 2014 we experienced a net loss of $292,594 from our business operations.




	 




	Due
	to all of the above factors, our revenues and operating results are difficult to forecast. Therefore, we believe that period-to-period
	comparisons of our operating results will not necessarily be meaningful, and you should not rely upon them as an indication of
	future performance. Also, operating results may fall below our expectations and the expectations of securities analysts or investors
	in one or more future periods. If this were to occur, the market price of our common stock would likely decline.




	 





	The online
	and mobile marketing industry is highly competitive with many diverse competitors.





	 




	Many
	of our competitors are better funded than we are. The technology we rely on to generate revenue is changing rapidly and we may
	not be able to keep up with the technological developments. We do not hold patents or have any protectable intellectual property
	at this time that will prevent other competitors from developing our identical products and services and thereby controlling the
	market share of our industry.




	 





	If we
	do not effectively manage our growth, our operating performance will suffer and we may lose clients.





	 




	We
	hope to experience, and to a certain extent have experienced, rapid growth in our operations, and we expect to experience further
	growth in our business, both through acquisitions and internally. This growth has placed, and will continue to place, significant
	demands on our management and our operational and financial infrastructure. In particular, continued rapid growth and acquisitions
	may make it more difficult for us to accomplish the following:




	 








	  




	●




	Successfully
	scale our technology to accommodate a larger business and integrate acquisitions;






	  




	●




	maintain
	our standing with key vendors, including Internet search companies and third-party website publishers;






	  




	●




	maintain
	our client service standards; and






	  




	●




	develop
	and improve our operational, financial and management controls and maintain adequate reporting systems and procedures.






	 




	In addition, our personnel, systems, procedures and controls may be inadequate to support our future operations. The improvements
	required to manage our growth will require us to make significant expenditures, expand, train and manage our employee base and
	allocate valuable management resources. If we fail to effectively manage our growth, our operating performance will suffer and
	we may lose clients, key vendors and key personnel.




	 





	We
	cannot assure you that our growth strategy will be successful which may result in a negative impact on our growth, financial condition,
	results of operations and cash flow.





	 




	One
	of our strategies is to expand our client base through marketing and client acquisition programs. We cannot assure you that we
	will be able to successfully grow our client base to a level that is needed to sustain ourselves and become profitable. Our inability
	to implement this growth strategy successfully may have a negative impact on our growth, future financial condition, results of
	operations or cash flows.




	 





	Poor
	perception of our business or industry as a result of the actions of third parties could harm our reputation and adversely affect
	our business, financial condition and results of operations.





	 




	Our
	business is dependent on attracting a large number of visitors to our clients’ websites and providing leads and clicks to
	our clients, which depends in part on our reputation within the industry and with our clients. There are companies within our
	industry that regularly engage in activities that our clients’ customers may view as unlawful or inappropriate. These activities,
	such as spyware or deceptive promotions, by third parties may be seen by clients as characteristic of participants in our industry
	and, therefore, may have an adverse effect on the reputation of all participants in our industry, including us. Any damage to
	our reputation, including from publicity from legal proceedings against us or companies that work within our industry, governmental
	proceedings, consumer class action litigation, or the disclosure of information security breaches or private information misuse,
	could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

	If
	we fail to compete effectively against other online and mobile marketing companies and other competitors, we could lose clients
	and our revenue may decline.





	 




	The
	market for online and mobile marketing is intensely competitive. We expect this competition to continue to increase in the future.
	We perceive only limited barriers to entry to the online marketing industry. We plan to compete both for clients and for limited
	high quality advertising inventory. We also plan to compete for clients on the basis of a number of factors, including return
	on marketing expenditures, price, and client service.




	 




	We
	plan to compete with Internet and traditional media companies for a share of clients’ overall marketing budgets, including:



	 







	  




	●




	online
	or mobile marketing or media services providers;






	  




	●




	offline and
	online advertising agencies;






	  




	●




	major Internet
	portals and search engine companies with advertising networks such as Google, Yahoo!, MSN, and AOL;






	  




	●




	other
	online marketing service providers, including online affiliate advertising networks and industry-specific portals or lead
	generation companies;






	  




	●




	website publishers
	with their own sales forces that sell their online marketing services directly to clients;






	  




	●




	in-house
	marketing groups at current or potential clients;






	  




	●




	offline direct
	marketing agencies; and






	  




	●




	television,
	radio and print companies.






	 




	As a result, we may not be able to compete successfully. Competition from other marketing service providers’ on- and offline
	offerings could affect both volume and price, and thus revenue. If we fail to deliver results that are superior to those that
	other online marketing service providers achieve, we could lose clients and our revenue may decline.




	 





	If
	the market for online marketing services fails to continue to develop, our future growth may be limited and our revenue may decrease.





	 




	The
	online and mobile marketing services market is relatively new and rapidly evolving, and it uses different measurements than traditional
	media to gauge its effectiveness. Some of our current or potential clients have little or no experience using the Internet for
	advertising and marketing purposes and have allocated only limited portions of their advertising and marketing budgets to the
	Internet. The adoption of Internet and mobile advertising, particularly by those entities that have historically relied upon traditional
	media for advertising, requires the acceptance of a new way of conducting business, exchanging information and evaluating new
	advertising and marketing technologies and services. In particular, we are dependent on our clients’ adoption of new metrics
	to measure the success of online marketing campaigns. We may also experience resistance from traditional advertising agencies
	who may be advising our clients. We cannot assure you that the market for online marketing services will continue to grow. If
	the market for online marketing services fails to continue to develop or develops more slowly than we anticipate, our ability
	to grow our business may be limited and our revenue may decrease.




	 





	Unauthorized
	access to or accidental disclosure of consumer personally-identifiable information that we collect may cause us to incur significant
	expenses and may negatively affect our credibility and business.





	 




	There
	is growing concern over the security of personal information transmitted over the Internet, consumer identity theft and user privacy.
	Despite our implementation of security measures, our computer systems may be susceptible to electronic or physical computer break-ins,
	viruses and other disruptions and security breaches. Any perceived or actual unauthorized disclosure of personally-identifiable
	information regarding website visitors, whether through breach of our network by an unauthorized party, employee theft, misuse
	or error or otherwise, could harm our reputation, impair our ability to attract website visitors and attract and retain our clients,
	or subject us to claims or litigation arising from damages suffered by consumers, and thereby harm our business and operating
	results. In addition, we could incur significant costs in complying with the multitude of state, federal and foreign laws regarding
	the unauthorized disclosure of personal information.

	If
	we fail to keep pace with rapidly-changing technologies and industry standards, we could lose clients or advertising inventory
	and our results of operations may suffer.





	 




	The
	business lines in which we currently compete are characterized by rapidly changing Internet and mobile marketing standards, changing
	technologies, frequent new product and service introductions, and changing user and client demands. The introduction of new technologies
	and services embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards and practices could render our existing technologies
	and services obsolete and unmarketable or require unanticipated investments in technology. Our future success will depend in part
	on our ability to adapt to these rapidly-changing Internet and mobile media formats and other technologies. We will need to enhance
	our existing technologies and services and develop and introduce new technologies and services to address our clients’ changing
	demands. If we fail to adapt successfully to such developments or timely introduce new technologies and services, we could lose
	clients, our expenses could increase and we could lose advertising inventory.




	 





	Limitations
	on our ability to collect and use data derived from user activities could significantly diminish the value of our services and
	cause us to lose clients and revenue.





	 




	When
	a user visits our clients’ websites, we use technologies, including “cookies”, to collect information such as
	the user’s Internet Protocol, or IP, address, offerings delivered by us that have been previously viewed by the user and
	responses by the user to those offerings. In order to determine the effectiveness of a marketing campaign and to determine how
	to modify the campaign, we need to access and analyze this information. The use of cookies has been the subject of regulatory
	scrutiny and litigation and users are able to block or delete cookies from their browser. Periodically, certain of our clients
	and publishers seek to prohibit or limit our collection or use of this data. Interruptions, failures or defects in our data collection
	systems, as well as privacy concerns regarding the collection of user data, could also limit our ability to analyze data from
	our clients’ marketing campaigns. This risk is heightened when we deliver marketing services to clients in the financial
	and medical services client verticals. If our access to data is limited in the future, we may be unable to provide effective technologies
	and services to clients and we may lose clients and revenue.




	 





	We
	are exposed to the credit risk of our customers, which could result in material losses and negatively impact our operating results.





	 




	Most
	of our sales are on an open credit basis, with typical payment terms of net 30 days. If any of our customers becomes insolvent
	or suffers a deterioration in its financial or business condition and is unable to pay for our services, our results of operations
	could be harmed.




	 





	We
	are an “emerging growth company” and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging
	growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.





	 




	We
	are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the Jumpstart our Business Startups Act of 2012, and we may take advantage
	of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies, including, but not limited
	to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure
	obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements
	of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not
	previously approved. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions.
	If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common
	stock and our stock price may be more volatile.




	 




	Under
	the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, “emerging growth companies” can delay adopting new or revised accounting
	standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves to
	this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, we will be subject to the same new or revised accounting
	standards as other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies.”

	Risks
	Related to Our Management and Control Persons






	 





	Because
	Wais Asefi currently owns 93% of our outstanding Common Stock, investors may find that corporate decisions influenced by Mr. Asefi
	are inconsistent with the best interests of other stockholders

	.






	 




	Mr.
	Asefi currently owns 93% of the outstanding shares of our Common Stock. Accordingly, Mr. Asefi will have a significant influence
	in determining the outcome of all corporate transactions or other matters, including mergers, consolidations and the sale of all
	or substantially all of our assets, and also the power to prevent or cause a change in control. While we have no current plans
	with regard to any merger, consolidation or sale of substantially all of our assets, the interests of Mr. Asefi may still differ
	from the interests of the other stockholders.




	 





	Our
	sole officer and director may leave us if we are unable to repay the $50,000 note that he guaranteed with his personal shares.





	 




	In
	order to obtain a loan of $50,000, our sole officer and director had to pledge 59,400,000 of his personal shares to the lender.
	If we default on the loan, the lender could foreclose on those shares and there would be a considerable change in control of our
	company. We may lose the services of Mr. Asefi if that happens, which will adversely impact our ability to implement our business
	plan and survive.




	 





	Because
	we have a substantial financial commitment to our Chief Executive Officer through an employment agreement, funds may be diverted
	away from other important matters in the development of our business plan and could negatively impact our financial position.





	 




	We
	entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Asefi, our officer and director. The agreement continues until May 1, 2017 and provides
	annual compensation of $100,000. This is a lot of money for us to pay. We have limited funds available and any money we are able
	to raise combined with our existing cash balances will be needed to fulfill this substantial financial commitment. We may not
	be able to raise enough money to fund the contract. In addition, money that could be spent elsewhere will be needed to fund the
	contract, and will divert funds away from other important matters in the development of our business plan and could negatively
	impact our financial position.




	 





	The
	loss of key management personnel could adversely affect our ability to continue operations.





	 




	We
	are entirely dependent on the efforts of our CEO, President and Chief Financial Officer because of the time and effort that he
	devotes to us. He is in charge of overseeing all development strategies, supervising any/all future personnel, including any consultants
	or contractors that we will engage to assist in developing our business model, and the establishment of our future sales team.
	Their loss, or other key personnel in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
	results of operations. We do not maintain “key person” life insurance on our officers, directors or key employees.
	Our success will depend on the performance of Mr. Asefi and our ability to attract and motivate other key personnel.




	 





	The
	lack of public company experience of our sole officer and director could adversely impact our ability to comply with the reporting
	requirements of U.S. Securities laws.





	 




	Our
	sole officer and director, Mr. Asefi, has no experience managing a public company, which could adversely impact our ability to
	comply with legal, regulatory, and reporting requirements of U.S. Securities laws. Our management may not be able to implement
	programs and policies in an effective and timely manner to adequately respond to such legal, regulatory and reporting requirements,
	including the establishment and maintenance of internal controls over financial reporting. Any such deficiencies, weaknesses or
	lack of compliance could have a materially adverse effect on our ability to comply with the reporting requirements of the Securities
	Exchange Act of 1934, which are necessary to maintain public company status. If we were to fail to fulfill those obligations,
	our ability to operate as a U.S. public company would be in jeopardy in which event you could lose your entire investment in our
	company. Our ability to operate successfully may depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel with appropriate
	experience in the management of a public company. Our ability to find and retain qualified personnel on our terms and budget may
	be very limited.

	Risks
	Related To Ownership of Our Shares






	 





	As
	there is no minimum for our Primary Offering, if only a few persons purchase Units, they may lose their investment as we may be
	unable to make a significant attempt to implement our business plan.





	 




	Since
	there is no minimum amount of Units that must be sold directly under this Primary Offering, if a limited number of Units are sold,
	we may not have enough capital to fully implement our plan of operations. As such, we may not be able to meet the objectives we
	state in this prospectus, or eliminate the “going concern” modification in the reports of our auditors as to uncertainty
	with respect to our ability to continue as a going concern. If we fail to raise sufficient capital, we would expect to have insufficient
	funds for our ongoing operating expenses. Any significant lack of funds will curtail the growth of our business and may cause
	our business to fail. If our business fails, investors will lose their entire investment.




	 





	We
	are selling this Primary Offering without an underwriter and may be unable to sell any Units.





	 




	This
	Primary Offering is self-underwritten, that is, we are not going to engage the services of an underwriter to sell the Units. We
	intend to sell our Units through our President, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer who will receive no commissions
	or other remuneration from any sales made hereunder. They will offer the Units to friends, family members, and business associates;
	however, there is no guarantee that they will be able to sell any of the Units. Unless they are successful in selling all of the
	Units and we receive the maximum amount of proceeds from this Primary Offering, we may have to seek alternative financing to implement
	our plan of operations.




	 





	We
	may have difficulty selling shares under our Primary Offering because the selling shareholders are concurrently offering their
	shares under the Secondary Offering.





	 




	We
	may have difficulty selling shares under our Primary Offering because we may be competing with the selling security holders who
	are concurrently offering their shares under the Secondary Offering. In the event that our common shares are quoted on the OTC
	Bulletin Board or OTCQB, the selling security holders will not be required to sell their shares at a fixed price of $0.10 per
	share. Accordingly, the selling security holders may reduce the price of their shares which may hinder our ability to sell any
	shares under the Primary Offering.




	 





	If
	we do not keep this registration statement updated for the term of the warrants, the stockholders will not be able to exercise
	the warrants under the registration statement.





	 




	Warrant
	holders may seek to exercise their warrants to obtain common stock that they could sell in the public market. However, an effective
	registration statement and current prospectus must exist for the warrant holders to exercise their warrants. In the event a current
	prospectus is not available when a warrant holder wishes to exercise, the warrant holder will be unable to exercise their warrants
	at such time that the warrant holder wishes or when it would be economically advisable for the warrant holder. Upon exercise,
	the underlying common stock can be sold pursuant to this prospectus (which we intend to update for the earlier of September 30,
	2017, the date the warrants expire, or until all the warrants have been exercised). There is no assurance that we will be able
	to keep such prospectus effective for that long. In the event that the prospectus is not effective at a time that the shareholder
	wishes to sell common stock underlying the warrants, the shareholder may find it difficult to sell such common stock.




	 





	We
	will likely conduct further offerings of our equity securities in the future, in which case your proportionate interest may become
	diluted.





	 




	Since
	our inception, we have relied on sales of our common shares to fund our operations. We will likely be required to conduct additional
	equity offerings in the future to finance our current projects or to finance subsequent projects that we decide to undertake.
	If common shares are issued in return for additional funds, the price per share could be lower than that paid by our current shareholders.
	We anticipate continuing to rely on equity sales of our common shares in order to fund our business operations. If we issue additional
	shares, your percentage interest in us could become diluted.

	Because
	we do not plan to register our common stock under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act until December 31, 2014, we will be subject
	to periodic reporting requirements only under Section 15(d), which requirements are less extensive than those applicable to a
	fully reporting company that has registered a class of securities under Section 12 of the Exchange Act and thus there will be
	less publicly available information available to investors during such time.





	 




	As
	we will not register our common stock under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act until December of 2014, we will be subject to periodic
	reporting requirements under Section 15(d) which are less extensive than those applicable to a fully reporting company that has
	registered a class of securities under Section 12 of the Exchange Act until such date. For example, as a Section 15(d) reporting
	company, we are not subject to the proxy rules, Section 16 short-swing profits prohibitions, and reporting requirements under
	Sections 13(d) and (g) of the Exchange Act that we would be if we did register our common stock under Section 12(g) of the Exchange
	Act prior to December of 2014 and thus there will be less publicly available information available to investors during such time.




	 





	If
	we do not file a registration statement under Form 8-A to become subject to the reporting requirements under Section 12 of the
	Exchange Act prior to December 31, 2014, our periodic reporting obligations under Section 15(d) will be suspended in the event
	the number of record shareholders is less than 300, which could adversely affect investors in that less information would be available
	and we could lose the qualification of our securities to be quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board or OTCQB.





	 




	If
	we do not file a registration statement under Form 8-A to become subject to the reporting requirements under Section 12 of the
	Exchange Act prior to December 31, 2014, the end of our first full fiscal year during which time we are required to file periodic
	reports with the SEC under Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act [including an annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
	December 31, 2014], our periodic reporting obligations under Section 15(d) will be suspended in the event the number of record
	shareholders is less than 300, which could adversely affect investors in that less information would be available and we could
	lose the qualification of our securities to be quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board or OTCQB. We will no longer be obligated to file
	periodic reports with SEC and your access to our business information will be restricted. In addition, if we do not become a reporting
	issuer, we will not be required to furnish proxy statements to security holders, and our directors, officers and principal beneficial
	owners will not be required to report their beneficial ownership of securities to the SEC pursuant to Section 16 of the Exchange
	Act.




	 





	If
	a market for our common shares does not develop, shareholders may be unable to sell their shares.





	 




	Our
	common stock is quoted on the OTCPinks operated by OTC Markets Group, Inc. under the symbol “TXHD.” On August 11,
	2014, the last reported sale price of our common stock as reported on the OTCPinks was $0.20 per share. There is not an active
	trading market for our stock. We intend to apply for quotation of our common shares on the OTC Bulletin Board or OTCQB. However,
	we can provide no assurance that our shares will be approved for quotation on the OTC Bulletin Board or, if traded, that a public
	market will materialize. If our common shares are not quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board or OTCQB or if a public market for our
	common shares does not develop, shareholders may not be able to re-sell the common shares that they have purchased and may lose
	all of their investment.




	 





	Because
	our directors are not independent they can make and control corporate decisions that may be disadvantageous to other common shareholders.





	 




	We
	intend to apply to have our common shares quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board inter-dealer quotation system or OTCQB, neither of
	which have director independence requirements. Using the definition of “independent” in NASDAQ Rule 5605(a)(2), we
	have determined that none of our directors are independent. Our directors have a significant influence in determining the outcome
	of all corporate transactions or other matters, including mergers, consolidations, and the sale of all or substantially all of
	our assets. They also have the power to prevent or cause a change in control. The interests of our directors may differ from the
	interests of the other stockholders and thus result in corporate decisions that are disadvantageous to other shareholders.

	We
	have never declared or paid any cash dividends or distributions on our capital stock. And we do not anticipate paying any cash
	dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.





	 




	We
	have never declared or paid any cash dividends or distributions on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain our future
	earnings, if any, to support operations and to finance expansion and therefore we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends
	on our common stock in the foreseeable future.




	 




	The
	declaration, payment and amount of any future dividends will be made at the discretion of the board of directors, and will depend
	upon, among other things, the results of our operations, cash flows and financial condition, operating and capital requirements,
	and other factors as the board of directors considers relevant. There is no assurance that future dividends will be paid, and,
	if dividends are paid, there is no assurance with respect to the amount of any such dividend.




	 





	Our securities
	are considered a penny stock.





	 




	Because
	our securities are considered a penny stock, shareholders will be more limited in their ability to sell their shares. Broker-dealer
	practices in connection with transactions in “penny stocks” are regulated by penny stock rules adopted by the Securities
	and Exchange Commission. Penny stocks generally are equity securities with a price of less than $5.00 (other than securities registered
	on some national securities exchanges or quoted on Nasdaq). The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction
	in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document that provides information
	about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer
	with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction,
	and, if the broker-dealer is the sole market maker, the broker-dealer must disclose this fact and the broker-dealer’s presumed
	control over the market, and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer’s
	account. In addition, broker-dealers who sell these securities to persons other than established customers and “accredited
	investors” must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and
	receive the purchaser’s written agreement to the transaction. Consequently, these requirements may have the effect of reducing
	the level of trading activity, if any, in the secondary market for a security subject to the penny stock rules, and investors
	in our common stock may find it difficult to sell their shares.





	 









	CAUTIONARY
	NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS





	 





	This
	prospectus contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. We use words such as anticipate, believe,
	plan, expect, future, intend and similar expressions to identify such forward-looking statements. The actual results could differ
	materially from our forward-looking statements. Our actual results are most likely to differ materially from those anticipated
	in these forward-looking statements for many reasons, including the risks faced by us described in this Risk Factors section and
	elsewhere in this prospectus.

	The
	principal purposes of this offering is to raise sufficient capital for us to implement our business plan, become a reporting under
	the Exchange Act and create a public market for our common shares. If we are unable to sell any shares under the Primary Offering,
	we have sufficient funds to pay the costs of this offering. However, expenses associated with meeting our reporting obligations
	under the Exchange Act will take priority over anything else.




	 





	Secondary
	Offering





	 




	The
	common shares offered by the selling security holders are being registered for the account of the selling security holders identified
	in this prospectus. All net proceeds from the sale of these common shares will go to the respective selling security holders who
	offer and sell their common shares. We will not receive any part of the proceeds from such sales of common shares.

	Standby
	Equity Distribution Agreement





	 




	On
	January 2, 2014, we entered into the Standby Equity Distribution Agreement (the “Equity Distribution Agreement”) with
	Creative Capital Ventures Ltd. (“Creative”). On July 9, 2014, we entered into a termination agreement with Creative.
	Creative was originally named as a selling shareholder in this offering. As a result of the termination agreement, however, we
	will no longer have a financing relationship with Creative and it will not be a selling shareholder in this offering.




	 





	Convertible
	Promissory Notes





	 




	There
	are four convertible promissory notes that have an aggregate principal balance of $76,429, incur interest at 12% per annum, mature
	on September 14, 2014, and are convertible into common shares at $0.00382 per share. The notes are in favor of Realty Capital
	Management, Saint Jude Capital Management Inc., Mokus Estates Ltd., and Augustus Management Ltd.




	 




	There
	are three convertible notes that have an aggregate principal balance of $25,000, mature on August 1, 2015, October 17, 2015 and
	December 10, 2015 and are convertible into common shares at $0.10 per share. The notes are in favor of Anita Samim, Lawrence R.
	Read, and Cliff E. Burrage, respectively. The notes to Read and Burrage incur interest at 12% per annum and the note to Samin
	incurs interest at 6% per annum.




	 





	Warrants





	 




	There
	is one warrant to purchase 1,000,000 shares of our common stock issued to Realty Capital Management exercisable at $0.10 per share
	and expires on November 7, 2014.

	Table
	of Selling Shareholders





	 




	The
	selling security holders named in this prospectus are offering all of the 22,349,305 common shares offered through this prospectus.
	The offer under this prospectus is comprised of the securities provided above and specifically: (i) 20,007,591 shares issuable
	upon conversion of four outstanding convertible promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount of $76,429; (ii) 250,000 shares
	issuable upon conversion of three outstanding convertible promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount of $25,000; (iii)
	91,714 shares of common stock issuable as interest under the four convertible notes; (iv) 1,250,000 shares of common stock underlying
	warrants; and (v) 750,000 shares of common stock held by Realty Capital Management.




	 




	The
	number of shares underlying the convertible notes represents the principal amount of the notes divided by the conversion price
	of the convertible notes. The number also includes interest of 12% on four of the notes mentioned in (ii) above through September
	10, 2014 divided by the conversion price of the convertible notes. The other three notes mentioned in (iii) above are not registering
	any shares issuable as interest under their convertible promissory notes.




	 




	The
	following table provides as of June 30, 2014 information regarding the beneficial ownership of our common shares held by each
	of the selling security holders, including:




	 






	  




	1.




	the
	number of shares beneficially owned by each prior to this Offering;

	a security, or the sole or shared investment power with respect to a security (i.e., the power to dispose of, or to direct
	the disposition of, a security). In addition, for purposes of this table, a person is deemed, as of any date, to have "beneficial
	ownership" of any security that such person has the right to acquire within 60 days after such date.

	OF DISTRIBUTION AND DETERMINATION OF OFFERING PRICE





	 





	Primary
	Offering





	 




	We
	are offering 10,000,000 Units at a fixed price of $0.10 per share even if a public trading market for our common shares develops.
	The $0.10 fixed per Unit offering price for the duration of this offering was arbitrarily chosen by management. There is no relationship
	between this price and our assets, earnings, book value or any other objective criteria of value.




	 




	This
	offering is being made by us without the use of outside underwriters or broker-dealers. The Units to be sold by us will be sold
	on our behalf by our President, Wais Asefi. Mr. Asefi will not receive commissions or proceeds or other compensation from the
	sale of any shares on our behalf.




	 




	Mr.
	Asefi will not register as a broker-dealer pursuant to Section 15 of the Exchange Act, in reliance upon Rule 3a4-1, which sets
	forth those conditions under which a person associated with an issuer may participate in the offering of the issuer's securities
	and not be deemed to be a broker-dealer.




	 






	1




	Mr.
	Asefi is not subject to a statutory disqualification, as that term is defined in Section 3(a)(39) of the Act, at the time
	of his participation;






	  




	  






	2




	Mr.
	Asefi will not be compensated in connection with his participation by the payment of commissions or other remuneration based
	either directly or indirectly on transactions in securities;






	  




	  






	3




	Mr.
	Asefi is not, nor will he be at the time of participation in the offering, an associated person of a broker-dealer; and






	  




	  






	4




	Mr.
	Asefi meets the conditions of paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of Rule 3a4

	-

	1 of the Exchange Act, in that he: (A) primarily performs,
	or is intended primarily to perform at the end of the offering, substantial duties for or on behalf of our company, other
	than in connection with transactions in securities; and (B) is not a broker or dealer, or been an associated person of a broker
	or dealer, within the preceding twelve months; and (C) has not participated in selling and offering securities for any issuer
	more than once every twelve months other than in reliance on paragraphs (a)(4)(i) or (a)(4)(iii).






	 





	Secondary
	Offering





	 




	The
	selling security holders named in this prospectus may sell their shares on a continuous or delayed basis for a period of nine
	months after this registration statement is declared effective. We plan to continue to update the registration statement and prospectus
	for the exercise of the warrants that comprise the Units even after the Offering of the Units has terminated. The selling security
	holders may sell some or all of their shares in one or more transactions, including block transactions:




	 






	1




	On
	such public markets as the shares may from time to time be trading;






	  




	  






	2




	In privately
	negotiated transactions;






	  




	  






	3




	Through the
	writing of options on the shares;






	  




	  






	4




	In short
	sales; or






	  




	  






	5




	In any combination
	of these methods of distribution.






	 












	15











	Table of Contents








	 




	The
	selling security holders named in this prospectus may also sell their shares directly to market makers acting as agents in unsolicited
	brokerage transactions. Any broker or dealer participating in such transactions as agent may receive a commission from the selling
	security holders, or, if they act as agent for the purchaser of such shares, from such purchaser. The selling security holders
	will likely pay the usual and customary brokerage fees for such services.




	 




	We
	are bearing all costs relating to the registration of this offering. The selling security holders, however, will pay any commissions
	or other fees payable to brokers or dealers in connection with any sale of the shares.




	 





	Concurrent
	Offerings





	 




	Our
	Primary Offering will continue to have a fixed price of $0.10 per share even if a public trading market for our common shares
	develops. The selling shareholders can sell shares under the Secondary Offering at a fixed price of $0.10 per share until such
	time as the shares of our common stock are traded on the OTC Bulletin Board sponsored by FINRA or OTCQB operated by OTC Markets
	Group, Inc. Although we intend to apply for quotation of our common stock on the OTC Bulletin Board or OTCQB through a market
	maker, public trading of our common stock may never materialize. If our common stock becomes traded on the OTC Bulletin Board
	or OTCQB, then the sale price to the public will vary according to prevailing market prices or privately negotiated prices by
	the selling shareholders.




	 





	Stabilization
	and Other Activities





	 




	The
	selling shareholders must comply with the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act in the offer
	and sale of the common stock. In particular, during such times as the selling shareholders may be deemed to be engaged in a distribution
	of the common stock, and therefore be considered to be an underwriter, they must comply with applicable law and may, among other
	things:




	 






	  




	1.
	 




	not
	engage in any stabilization activities in connection with our common stock;






	  




	  




	  






	  




	2.  




	furnish
	each broker or dealer through which common stock may be offered, such copies of    this prospectus, as amended
	from time to time, as may be required by such broker or dealer; and;






	  




	  




	  






	  




	3.  




	not
	bid for or purchase any of our securities or attempt to induce any person    to purchase any of our securities
	other than as permitted under the Securities Exchange    Act.







	 









	DILUTION





	 




	Our
	historical net tangible book deficit as of June 30, 2014 was ($255,227) or ($0.00) per share. Historical net tangible book deficit
	per share of common stock is equal to our total tangible assets less total liabilities, divided by the number of shares of common
	stock outstanding as of June 30, 2014. Adjusted to give effect to the receipt of net proceeds of $963,129 from the sale of the
	maximum of 10,000,000 shares of common stock for gross proceeds of $1,000,000, net tan

	g

	ible book value will be approximately
	$0.01 per share. This will represent an immediate increase of approximately $0.01 per share to existing stockholders and an immediate
	and substantial dilution of approximately $0.09 per share, or approximately 90%, to new investors purchasing our securities in
	this offering. Dilution in pro forma net tangible book value per share represents the difference between the amount per share
	paid by purchasers of shares of our common stock in this offering and the pro forma net tangible book value per share of our common
	stock immediately following this offering.

	Units are sold we would receive $463,129 after offering expenses have been deducted. We must sell 368,710 Units (or 4% of the
	Offering) to cover the estimated costs of this Offering. If we sell less than 368,710 of our Units under the Offering, we will
	not have sufficient proceeds to cover repaying our offering expenses and we will have to pay the remainder of such expenses out
	of additional financing we have not yet received.

	DESCRIPTION
	OF SECURITIES





	 




	Our
	authorized capital stock consists of 200,000,000 shares of common stock, with a par value of $0.001 per share, and 10,000,000
	shares of preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share. As of June 30, 2014 there were 67,082,167 shares of our common stock issued
	and outstanding. Our shares are currently held by 87 stockholders of record. We have not issued any shares of preferred stock.




	 





	Common
	Stock





	 




	Our
	common stock is entitled to one vote per share on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders, including the election
	of directors. Except as otherwise required by law or provided in any resolution adopted by our board of directors with respect
	to any series of preferred stock, the holders of our common stock will possess all voting power. Generally, all matters to be
	voted on by stockholders must be approved by a majority (or, in the case of election of directors, by a plurality) of the votes
	entitled to be cast by all shares of our common stock that are present in person or represented by proxy, subject to any voting
	rights granted to holders of any preferred stock. Holders of our common stock representing fifty percent (50%) of our capital
	stock issued, outstanding and entitled to vote, represented in person or by proxy, are necessary to constitute a quorum at any
	meeting of our stockholders. A vote by the holders of a majority of our outstanding shares is required to effectuate certain fundamental
	corporate changes such as liquidation, merger or an amendment to our Articles of Incorporation. Our Articles of Incorporation
	do not provide for cumulative voting in the election of directors.




	 




	Subject
	to any preferential rights of any outstanding series of preferred stock created by our board of directors from time to time, the
	holders of shares of our common stock will be entitled to such cash dividends as may be declared from time to time by our board
	of directors from funds available therefore.




	 




	Subject
	to any preferential rights of any outstanding series of preferred stock created from time to time by our board of directors, upon
	liquidation, dissolution or winding up, the holders of shares of our common stock will be entitled to receive pro rata all assets
	available for distribution to such holders.




	 




	In
	the event of any merger or consolidation with or into another company in connection with which shares of our common stock are
	converted into or exchangeable for shares of stock, other securities or property (including cash), all holders of our common stock
	will be entitled to receive the same kind and amount of shares of stock and other securities and property (including cash). Holders
	of our common stock have no pre-emptive rights, no conversion rights and there are no redemption provisions applicable to our
	common stock.




	 





	Preferred
	Stock





	 




	Our
	board of directors may become authorized to authorize preferred shares of stock and to divide the authorized shares of our preferred
	stock into one or more series, each of which must be so designated as to distinguish the shares of each series of preferred stock
	from the shares of all other series and classes. Our board of directors is authorized, within any limitations prescribed by law
	and our articles of incorporation, to fix and determine the designations, rights, qualifications, preferences, limitations and
	terms of the shares of any series of preferred stock including, but not limited to, the following:




	 






	  




	1.
	 




	The
	number of shares constituting that series and the distinctive designation of that series, which may be by distinguishing number,
	letter or title;






	  




	  




	  






	  




	2.  




	The
	dividend rate on the shares of that series, whether dividends will be cumulative, and if so, from which date(s), and the relative
	rights of priority, if any, of payment of dividends on shares of that series;






	  




	  




	  






	  




	3.  




	Whether
	that series will have voting rights, in addition to the voting rights provided by law, and, if so, the terms of such voting
	rights;






	  




	  




	  






	  




	4.  




	Whether
	that series will have conversion privileges, and, if so, the terms and conditions of such conversion, including provision
	for adjustment of the conversion rate in such events as the Board of Directors determines;






	 












	17











	Table of Contents








	 






	  




	5.
	 




	Whether
	or not the shares of that series will be redeemable, and, if so, the terms and conditions of such redemption, including the
	date or date upon or after which they are redeemable, and the amount per share payable in case of redemption, which amount
	may vary under different conditions and at different redemption dates;






	  




	  




	  






	  




	6.  




	Whether
	that series will have a sinking fund for the redemption or purchase of shares of that series, and, if so, the terms and amount
	of such sinking fund;






	  




	  




	  






	  




	7.  




	The
	rights of the shares of that series in the event of voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
	corporation, and the relative rights of priority, if any, of payment of shares of that series; and






	  




	  




	  






	  




	8.  




	Any
	other relative rights, preferences and limitations of that series.







	 







	Dividend
	Policy





	 




	We
	have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock. We currently intend to retain future earnings, if any, to
	finance the expansion of our business. As a result, we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.




	 





	Options





	 




	We
	have not issued and do not have outstanding any options to purchase shares of our common stock.




	 





	Convertible
	Promissory Notes





	 




	In
	September of 2013, the company issued convertible promissory notes to several lenders in the aggregate principal amount of $76,429.
	The notes accrue interest at a rate of 12% per annum and mature on September 14, 2014. The principal amount may at any time be
	converted into shares of the company’s commons stock at a conversion price of $0.00382 per share. The shares that may be
	issued upon conversion are entitled to piggyback registration rights.

	Nevada
	Anti-Takeover Laws





	 




	Nevada
	Revised Statutes sections 78.378 to 78.379 provide state regulation over the acquisition of a controlling interest in certain
	Nevada corporations unless the articles of incorporation or bylaws of the corporation provide that the provisions of these sections
	do not apply. Our articles of incorporation and bylaws do not state that these provisions do not apply. The statute creates a
	number of restrictions on the ability of a person or entity to acquire control of a Nevada company by setting down certain rules
	of conduct and voting restrictions in any acquisition attempt, among other things. The statute is limited to corporations that
	are organized in the state of Nevada and that have 200 or more stockholders, at least 100 of whom are stockholders of record and
	residents of the State of Nevada; and does business in the State of Nevada directly or through an affiliated corporation. Because
	of these conditions, the statute currently does not apply to our company.

	Principal
	Products and Services





	 




	We
	are an online mobile marketing platform service that will connect merchants with their customers and allow them to drive loyalty
	and repeat business in a non-intrusive, value added medium. We provide a mobile marketing platform where merchants can send customers
	the most up-to-date offers, discounts, alerts and events schedules, such as, for instance, happy hours, trivia night, and other
	campaigns. The consumer can also access specials and promotions that merchants choose to distribute through us by opting keywords
	designated to the merchant’s keywords. This allows consumers to take their information wherever they go and learn about
	the latest buzz as soon as it is available, providing the consumer with events, deals, and messages on their cellphone via SMS
	messaging. We are a mobile marketing platform that connects the mass consumer to the content that they crave – anywhere,
	anytime, through virtually any mobile device for all local events and promotions.

	Competition





	 




	In
	the past few years, the number of mobile marketing options and companies have grown rapidly. The markets for the products and
	services that we offer are very competitive, are rapidly evolving and have relatively low barriers to entry. We compete with all
	general advertising and marketing companies who eventually will want to include mobile marketing in their suite of product offerings,
	and who may develop their own similar products and compete with us for market share. These potential competitors may have more
	mature lines of distribution than us, be better financed than us, or may create a product offering that is superior to ours. Any
	of these factors can cause a competitor to take market share away from us or otherwise substantially hurt our business. We believe
	that competition in our market is based predominantly on:




	 






	  




	●




	Price






	  




	●




	brand
	recognition;

	success
	of underlying marketing programs; and

	delivery performance and customer service.

	Government
	Regulation





	 




	We
	are subject to a number of laws and regulations that affect companies generally and specifically those conducting business in
	the mobile messaging market, many of which are still evolving and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. Existing
	and future laws and regulations may impede our growth. These regulations and laws may cover online marketing, e-mail marketing,
	telemarketing, taxation, privacy, data protection, pricing, content, copyrights, distribution, mobile communications, electronic
	contracts and other communications, consumer protection, web services, the provision of online payment services, unencumbered
	internet access to our services, the design and operation of websites, and the characteristics and quality of products and services.
	It is not clear how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership, libel, and personal privacy apply to the internet,
	e-commerce, digital content and web services. Unfavorable regulations and laws could diminish the demand for our products and
	services and increase our cost of doing business.




	 




	We
	expect that the regulation of our industry generally will continue to increase and that we will be required to devote increasing
	amounts of legal and other resources to address this regulation. In addition, the application of existing domestic and international
	laws and regulations relating to issues such as user privacy and data protection, marketing, advertising, consumer protection
	and mobile disclosures in many instances is unclear or unsettled.




	 




	In
	addition to its regulation of wireless telecommunications providers generally, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission, or
	FCC, has examined, or is currently examining, how and when consumers enroll in mobile services, what types of disclosures consumers
	receive, what services consumers are purchasing and how much consumers are charged. In addition, the Federal Trade Commission,
	or FTC, has been asked to regulate how mobile marketers can use consumers’ personal information. Consumer advocates claim
	that many consumers do not know when their information is being collected from cell phones and how such information is retained,
	used and shared with other companies. Consumer groups have asked the FTC to: identify practices that may compromise privacy and
	consumer welfare; examine opt-in procedures to ensure consumers are aware of what data is at issue and how it will be used; investigate
	marketing tactics that target children; and create policies to halt abusive practices. The FTC has expressed interest in particular
	in the mobile environment and services that collect sensitive data, such as location-based information.




	 




	The
	principal laws and regulations that pertain to us and our customers in connection with their utilization of our platform, include:




	 






	  




	●





	Deceptive
	Trade Practice Law in the U.S

	. The FTC and state attorneys general are given broad powers by legislatures to curb unfair
	and deceptive trade practices. These laws and regulations apply to mobile marketing campaigns and behavioral advertising.
	The general guideline is that all material terms and conditions of the offer must be “clearly and conspicuously”
	disclosed to the consumer prior to the buying decision. The balancing of the desire to capture a potential customer's attention,
	while providing adequate disclosure, can be challenging in the mobile context due to the lack of screen space available to
	provide required disclosures.





	 


	 


	 





	  




	●





	Behavioral
	Advertising

	. Behavioral advertising is a technique used by online publishers and advertisers to increase the effectiveness
	of their campaigns. Behavioral advertising uses information collected from an individual's web-browsing behavior, such as
	the pages they have visited or the searches they have made, to select which advertisements to display to that individual.
	This data can be valuable for online marketers looking to personalize advertising initiatives or to provide geo-tags through
	mobile devices. Many businesses adhere to industry self-governing principles, including an opt-out regime whereby information
	may be collected until an individual indicates that he or she no longer agrees to have this information collected. The FTC
	is considering regulations in this area, which may include implementation of a more rigorous opt-in regime. An opt-in policy
	would prohibit businesses from collecting and using information from individuals who have not voluntarily consented. Among
	other things, the implementation of an opt-in regime could require substantial technical support and negatively impact the
	market for our mobile advertising products and services. A few states have also introduced bills in recent years that would
	restrict behavioral advertising within the state. These bills would likely have the practical effect of regulating behavioral
	advertising nationwide because of the difficulties behind implementing state-specific policies or identifying the location
	of a particular consumer. There have also been a large number of class action suits filed against companies engaged in behavioral
	advertising.





	 


	 


	 





	  




	●





	Behavioral
	Advertising-Privacy Regulation

	. Our business is affected by U.S. federal and state laws and regulations governing the
	collection, use, retention, sharing and security of data that we receive from and about our users. In recent years, regulation
	has focused on the collection, use, disclosure and security of information that may be used to identify or that actually identifies
	an individual, such as an Internet Protocol address or a name. Although the mobile and Internet advertising privacy practices
	are currently largely self-regulated in the U.S., the FTC has conducted numerous discussions on this subject and suggested
	that more rigorous privacy regulation is appropriate, including regulation of non-personally identifiable information which
	could, with other information, be used to identify an individual.

	Marketing-Privacy
	Regulation

	. In addition, there are U.S. federal and state laws that govern SMS and telecommunications-based marketing,
	generally requiring senders to transmit messages (including those sent to mobile devices) only to recipients who have specifically
	consented to receiving such messages. U.S. federal laws also govern e-mail marketing, generally imposing an opt-out requirement
	for emails sent within an existing business relationship.

	SMS
	and Location-Based Marketing Best Practices and Guidelines

	. We are a member of the Mobile Marketing Association, or MMA,
	a global association of 700 agencies, advertisers, mobile device manufacturers, wireless operators and service providers and
	others interested in the potential of marketing via the mobile channel. The MMA has published a code of conduct and best practices
	guidelines for use by those involved in mobile messaging activities. The guidelines were developed by a collaboration of the
	major carriers and they require adherence to them as a condition of service. We voluntarily comply with the MMA code of conduct.
	In addition, the Cellular Telephone Industry Association, or CTIA, has developed Best Practices and Guidelines to promote
	and protect user privacy regarding location-based services. We also voluntarily comply with those guidelines, which generally
	require notice and user consent for delivery of location-based services.

	The
	United States Telephone Consumer Protection Act.

	   The TCPA prohibits unsolicited voice and text calls
	to cell phones through the use of an automatic telephone-dialing system (ATDS) unless the recipient has given prior consent.
	The statute also prohibits companies from initiating telephone solicitations to individuals on the national Do-Not-Call list,
	and restricts the hours when such messages may be sent. Violations of the TCPA can result in statutory damages of $500 per
	violation (i.e., for each individual text message). U.S. state laws impose additional regulations on voice and text calls.
	We believe that our platform does not employ an ATDS within the meaning of the TCPA based on case law construing that term.





	 


	 


	 





	  




	●





	CAN-SPAM

	.
	The U.S. Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act, or CAN SPAM Act, prohibits all commercial
	e-mail messages, as defined in the law, to mobile phones unless the device owner has given "express prior authorization."
	Recipients of such messages must also be allowed to opt-out of receiving future messages the same way they opted-in. Senders
	have ten business days to honor opt-out requests. The FCC has compiled a list of domain names used by wireless service providers
	to which marketers may not send commercial e-mail messages. Senders have 30 days from the date the domain name is posted on
	the FCC site to stop sending unauthorized commercial e-mail to addresses containing the domain name. Violators are subject
	to fines of up to $6.0 million and up to one year in jail for some spamming activities. Carriers, the FTC, the FCC, and State
	Attorneys General may bring lawsuits to enforce alleged violations of the Act.





	 


	 


	 





	  




	●





	Communications
	Privacy Acts

	. Foreign and U.S. federal and state laws impose liability for intercepting communications while in transit
	or accessing the contents of communications while in storage.





	 


	 


	 





	  




	●





	Security
	Breach Notification Requirements

	. In the U.S., various states have enacted data breach notification laws, which require
	notification of individuals and sometimes state regulatory bodies in the event of breaches involving certain defined categories
	of personal information. This new trend suggests that breach notice statutes may be enacted in other jurisdictions, including
	by the U.S. at the federal level, as well.





	 


	 


	 





	  




	●





	Children

	.
	The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act prohibit the knowing collection of personal information from children under the
	age of 13 without verifiable parental consent, and strictly regulate the transmission of requests for personal information
	to such children. Other countries do not recognize the ability of children to consent to the collection of personal information.
	In addition, it is likely that behavioral advertising regulations will impose special restrictions on use of information collected
	from minors for this purpose.

	Intellectual
	Property





	 




	Although
	we believe that our business methodology is proprietary in terms of how we deliver our service to our client, and how we use mobile
	marketing, we currently hold no patents, copyrights or trademarks. It is our plan to trademark our key products as we develop
	them, subject to applicable laws and regulations, however, we have not filed for any such protection as of yet. It is our policy
	to enter into confidentiality agreements with any outsourced sales or service providers so that our proprietary methodology, customer’s
	lists and business information are contractually protected, and we intend to enforce any such contractual provisions as the law
	allows in the event of a breach. We cannot assure you that these contractual arrangements will prevent third parties from acquiring
	or using our proprietary business information to compete against us.





	 







	Employees





	 




	We
	currently have 5 full-time and no part-time employees including our chief executive officer, director of sales, lead developer,

	MARKET
	FOR COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED SHAREHOLDER MATTERS





	 





	Holders
	of Our Shares





	 




	As
	of the date of this prospectus, there were 87 registered shareholders.




	 





	No Public
	Market for Common Shares





	 




	Our
	common stock is quoted on the OTCPinks operated by OTC Markets Group, Inc. under the symbol “TXHD.” On August 11,
	2014, the last reported sale price of our common stock as reported on the OTCPinks was $0.20 per share. There is no public information
	about our company, as noted by OTCPinks, and there is not an active trading market for our stock.




	 




	We
	anticipate making an application for quotation of our common shares on the OTC Bulletin Board or OTCQB upon: (i) the effectiveness
	of the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part; and (ii) our obtaining a sufficient number of stockholders
	to enable our common shares to become quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board or OTCQB. However, we can provide no assurance that our
	shares will be quoted on the bulletin board or, if quoted, that a public market will materialize.




	 




	The
	Securities Exchange Commission has adopted rules that regulate broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in penny
	stocks. Penny stocks are generally equity securities with a price of less than $5.00, other than securities registered on certain
	national securities exchanges or quoted on the NASDAQ system, provided that current price and volume information with respect
	to transactions in such securities is provided by the exchange or system. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior
	to a transaction in a penny stock, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document prepared by the Commission, that: (a) contains
	a description of the nature and level of risk in the market for penny stocks in both public offerings and secondary trading; (b)
	contains a description of the broker's or dealer's duties to the customer and of the rights and remedies available to the customer
	with respect to a violation to such duties or other requirements of Securities' laws; (c) contains a brief, clear, narrative description
	of a dealer market, including bid and ask prices for penny stocks and the significance of the spread between the bid and ask price;(d)
	contains a toll-free telephone number for inquiries on disciplinary actions;(e) defines significant terms in the disclosure document
	or in the conduct of trading in penny stocks; and;(f) contains such other information and is in such form, including language,
	type, size and format, as the Commission shall require by rule or regulation.




	 












	26











	Table of Contents








	 




	The
	broker-dealer also must provide, prior to effecting any transaction in a penny stock, the customer with; (a) bid and offer quotations
	for the penny stock;(b) the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction;(c) the number of shares
	to which such bid and ask prices apply, or other comparable information relating to the depth and liquidity of the market for
	such stock; and (d) a monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer's account.




	 




	In
	addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules; the
	broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive
	the purchaser's written acknowledgment of the receipt of a risk disclosure statement, a written agreement to transactions involving
	penny stocks, and a signed and dated copy of a written suitability statement.




	 




	These
	disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the trading activity in the secondary market for our stock if it becomes
	subject to these penny stock rules. Therefore, because our common stock is subject to the penny stock rules, stockholders may
	have difficulty selling those securities.




	 





	Dividend
	Rights





	 




	We
	have never declared, nor paid, any dividend since our incorporation and does not foresee paying any dividend in the near future
	since all available funds will be used to conduct exploration activities. Any future payment of dividends will depend on our financing
	requirements and financial condition and other factors which the board of directors, in its sole discretion, may consider appropriate.




	 




	There
	are no restrictions in our articles of incorporation or bylaws that prevent us from declaring dividends. The Nevada Revised Statutes,
	however, do prohibit us from declaring dividends where after giving effect to the distribution of the dividend:




	 






	  




	1.




	we
	would not be able to pay our debts as they become due in the usual course of business, or;





	 


	 


	 





	  




	2.




	our
	total assets would be less than the sum of our total liabilities plus the amount that would be needed to satisfy the rights
	of shareholders who have preferential rights superior to those receiving the distribution.






	 




	We
	have not declared any dividends and we do not plan to declare any dividends in the foreseeable future.




	 





	Reports
	to Shareholders





	 




	As
	a result of this offering as required under Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, we will file periodic reports
	with the Securities and Exchange Commission through December 31, 2014, including a Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014,
	assuming this registration statement is declared effective before that date. At or prior to December 31, 2014, we intend voluntarily
	to file a registration statement on Form 8-A which will subject us to all of the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act. This
	will require us to file quarterly and annual reports with the SEC and will also subject us to the proxy rules of the SEC. In addition,
	our officers, directors and 10% stockholders will be required to submit reports to the SEC on their stock ownership and stock

	REPORT
	OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM






	 




	To the Board
	of Directors and Stockholder




	Textmunication
	Holdings, Inc.




	Las Vegas,
	Nevada




	 




	We
	have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Textmunication Holdings, Inc. and subsidiary (the “Company”)
	as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity, and cash
	flows for each of the two years then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management.
	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.




	 




	We
	conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
	standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
	free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
	the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,
	as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for
	our opinion.




	 




	In
	our opinion, such financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company
	as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years then ended in
	conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.




	 




	The
	accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed
	in Note 3 to the financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations and has a net capital deficiency
	that raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans in regard to these matters
	are also described in Note 3. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this
	uncertainty.

	Textmunication Holdings,
	Inc.






	Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements


	December 31, 2013 and 2012


	 



	Note 1 – ORGANIZATION



	 


	Textmunication Holdings, Inc. (Company) was
	formed in October 1984 in the State of Georgia as Brock Control Systems.  Founded by Richard T. Brock, the Company was
	in the sales automation market and an early developer of enterprise customer management systems.  The Company went public
	at the end of March of 1993.  In February of 1996, the Company changed its name to Brock International Inc., and in March
	of 1998, the name was again changed to Firstwave Technologies, Inc.


	 


	In 2007, the Company had its common stock deregistered
	in order to avoid the expenses of being a public company.  The Company reported briefly on the OTC Disclosure & News
	Service in 2008. The Company again changed its name to FSTWV, Inc.


	 


	In April 2013 the FSTWV preferred stock holders
	A, B, C and D series converted their prefer shares into common shares of the Company. On October 28, 2013, the Company held a shareholder
	meeting to reincorporate the Company in the State of Nevada and concurrently change its name to Textmunication Holdings, Inc.  The
	Company also voted to approve a 1 for 5 reverse split of our outstanding common stock.. Per-share amounts in the accompanying financial
	statements have been adjusted for the split.


	 


	Following our shareholder meeting, on November
	16, 2013, the Company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (SEA) with Textmunication, Inc. a California corporation and Wais
	Asefi (its sole shareholder), whereby we issued 65,640,207 new shares of common stock in exchange for 100% of the issued and outstanding
	shares of Textmunication, Inc. and simultaneously the major shareholder of the Company retired 1,128,041 post reverse shares (pre-split:
	5,640,207) shares of our common stock to the Company’s treasury.  As a result of the SEA, we acquired Textmunication,
	Inc. and have assumed its business operations in the mobile marketing business.


	 


	For accounting purposes, the SEA transaction
	has been accounted for as a reverse recapitalization, with Textmunication Holdings, Inc. as the acquirer. The consolidated financial
	statements of Textmunication Holdings, Inc. for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013 represent a continuation of the financial
	statements of Textmunication, Inc., with one adjustment, which is to retroactively adjust the legal capital of Textmunication,
	Inc. to reflect the legal capital of Textmunication Holdings, Inc.


	 



	Note 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES



	 



	Principles of Consolidation



	 


	The accompanying consolidated financial statements
	include the accounts of Textmunication Holdings, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Textmunication, Inc. (collectively referred
	to as the Company). All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements.


	 



	Use of Estimates



	 


	The preparation of financial statements in
	conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
	reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
	and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

	Note 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)



	 



	Basis of Presentation



	 


	The accompanying consolidated financial statements
	have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.


	 



	Going Concern



	 


	These financial statements have been prepared
	in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of
	assets and the satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. As of December 31, 2013, the Company
	has an accumulated deficit of $166,129. The company’s ability to continue as a going concern is contingent upon the successful
	completion of additional financing arrangements and its ability to achieve and maintain profitable operations. While the Company
	is expanding its best efforts to achieve the above plans, there is no assurance that any such activity will generate funds that
	will be available for operations. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going
	concern. These financial statements do not include any adjustments that might arise from this uncertainty.


	 



	Risks and Uncertainties



	 


	The Company is subject to substantial risks
	from, among other things, intense competition associated with the industry in general, other risks associated with financing, liquidity
	requirements, rapidly changing customer requirements, limited operating history and the volatility of public markets.


	 



	Fair Value Measurements



	 


	Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”)
	820-10, Fair Value Measurements, defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value under generally accepted
	accounting principles and enhances disclosures about fair value measurements. Fair value is defined under ASC 820-10 as the exchange
	price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the Note principal or the most advantageous
	market for an asset or liability in an orderly transaction between participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques used
	to measure fair value under ASC 820-10 must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.
	The standard describes a fair value hierarchy based on the levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and
	the last unobservable, that may be used to measure fair value which are the following:


	 




	 


	●


	Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.




	 


	 


	 




	 


	●


	Level 2 - Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or corroborated by observable market data or substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.




	 


	 


	 




	 


	●


	Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the value of the assets or liabilities.




	 


	The fair value of the accounts receivable,
	accounts payable, notes payable are considered short term in nature and therefore their value is considered fair value.

	Note 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)



	 



	Convertible Instruments



	 


	The Company accounts for convertible debt with
	beneficial conversion features in accordance with ASC 470-20, which requires the Company to recognize separately, at issuance,
	the embedded beneficial conversion feature as a discount to the debt. The recognition is done by allocating a portion of the proceeds
	equal to the intrinsic value of that feature as a debt discount. The intrinsic value is calculated as the difference between the
	effective conversion price of the convertible debt and the fair value of the shares at issuance date.


	 



	Warrants



	 


	The Company accounts for warrants issued in
	conjunction with stock issuances under private placement using the fair value method. Under this method, the value of warrants
	issued is measured at fair value at the grant date using the Black-Scholes valuation model and recorded as share capital and additional
	paid-in capital.


	 


	The Company recognized the value of detachable
	warrants issued in conjunction with issuance of notes payable using the Black-Scholes pricing model. The Company recorded the relative
	fair value of the warrant as an increase to additional paid-in capital and discount against the related debt. The discount attributed
	to the value of the warrants is being amortized over the term of the underlying debt instrument.


	 



	Cash and cash equivalents



	 


	The Company considers all highly liquid instruments
	purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.


	 


	The Company minimizes its credit risk associated
	with cash by periodically evaluating the credit quality of its primary financial institution.


	 



	Accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts 



	 


	Accounts receivable are stated at the amount
	management expects to collect. The Company generally does not require collateral to support customer receivables. The Company provides
	an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon a review of the outstanding accounts receivable, historical collection information
	and existing economic conditions. As of December 31, 2013 and 2012 the allowance for doubtful accounts was $0 and bad debt expense
	of $0 for each year respectively.


	 



	Advertising



	 


	Advertising expenses consist primarily of costs
	of promotion for corporate image and product. The Company expenses all advertising costs as incurred. For the year ended December
	31, 2013 and 2012, advertising expenses were $0 and $175 respectively.

	Note 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)



	 



	Revenue Recognition



	 


	We recognize revenue in accordance with Accounting
	Standards Codification, or (“ASC”), 605, Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue when all of the following conditions
	are satisfied: (1) there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement; (2) the service has been provided to the customer; (3) the amount
	of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable; and (4) the collection of our fees is reasonably assured.


	 


	Thus, we recognize subscription revenue on
	a monthly basis, as services are provided. Customers are billed for the subscription on a monthly, quarterly, semi-annual or annual
	basis, at the customer’s option.


	 



	Income Taxes



	 


	Income taxes are provided for the tax effects
	of transactions reported in the financial statements and consist of taxes currently due plus deferred taxes related primarily to
	differences between the bases of assets and liabilities for financial and income tax reporting. The deferred tax assets and liabilities
	represent the future tax return consequences of those differences, which will either be taxable or deductible when the assets and
	liabilities are recovered or settled. Deferred taxes are also recognized for operating losses that are available to offset future
	federal and state income taxes. Any interest charges on underpayment or other assessments are recorded as interest expense. Any
	penalties are recorded in Operating Expenses.


	 



	Net income (loss) per Common Share



	 


	Basic net income (loss) per share is computed
	by dividing the net loss attributable to the common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding
	during the period. Fully diluted loss per share is computed similar to basic loss per share except that the denominator is increased
	to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common shares had been issued
	and if the additional common shares were dilutive.  


	 


	Since the Company reflected a net loss for
	the year ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, the effect of considering any common stock equivalents would have been anti-dilutive
	and therefore a separate computation of diluted loss per share is not presented.


	 



	Recent Accounting Pronouncements



	 


	No new accounting pronouncements issued or
	effective during the fiscal year has had or is expected to have a material impact on the financial statements.


	 



	Note 3 – ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND FACTORING AGREEMENT



	 


	In the ordinary course of business, the Company
	utilizes accounts receivable-credit card factoring agreements with third-party financing company in order to accelerate its cash
	collections from product sales. In addition, these agreements provide the Company with the ability to limit credit exposure to
	potential bad debts, to better manage costs related to collections as well as to enable customers to extend their credit terms.
	These agreements involve the ownership transfer of eligible trade accounts receivable, without recourse or discount, to a third
	party financial institution in exchange for cash.

	Note 3 – ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND FACTORING AGREEMENT (Continued)



	 


	The Company accounts for these transactions
	in accordance with ASC 860, "Transfers and Servicing" ("ASC 860"). ASC 860 allows for the ownership transfer
	of accounts receivable to qualify for sale treatment when the appropriate criteria is met, which permits the Company to present
	the balances sold under the program to be excluded from

	  Accounts receivable, net

	  on the Consolidated
	Balance Sheet. Receivables are considered sold when (i) they are transferred beyond the reach of the Company and its creditors,
	(ii) the purchaser has the right to pledge or exchange the receivables, and (iii) the Company has surrendered control over the

	In connection with the SEA, the Company assumed three convertible promissory notes for an aggregate of $13,670, net of debt discount. The notes mature on September 14, 2014 and accrue interest at a rate of 12% per annum. The note principal is convertible at a price of $.00382 per share. At issuance the fair market value of the Company’s common stock was $.013 per share. The conversion feature of the note is considered beneficial to the investor due to the conversion price for the convertible note being lower than the fair market value of the common stock on the date the note was issued. The beneficial conversion feature was recorded at the debt’s inception as a discount of the debt of $76,429 and is being amortized over the lives of the convertible debt. Amortization of debt discount during the period from November 16, 2013 (date of SEA) through December 31, 2013 and the year ended December 31, 2012 was $9,528 and $0, respectively and the unamortized discount at December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012 was $53,231 and $0, respectively. Interest expense recorded on the convertible notes for the period from November 16, 2013 (date of SEA) through December 31, 2013 and the year ended December 31, 2012 was $1,156 and $0, respectively.

	 

	One of the holders of the convertible promissory notes with a principal value of $25,476, entered into note purchase and assignment agreements whereby half of the principal of the note was assigned to two separate note holders. The original note was substituted and replaced by two amended and restated 12% convertible promissory notes with restated principal amounts of $12,738 each. All other terms of the original note remain in effect.

	 

	The principal balance outstanding on the loans as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 was $76,429 and $0, respectively.

	Note 5 – CONVERTIBLE PROMISSORY NOTES (Continued)



	 




	In connection with the SEA, the Company assumed a convertible note for an aggregate of $36,363, net of debt discount. The note matures on November 7, 2014 and interest accrues at a rate of 20% per annum. The note principal is convertible into common stock at the rate of $.001 per share or 50 million shares of the Company’s common stock but such conversion can only take effect upon default of the note. The note is secured by 59,400,000 shares of the Company’s common stock. In conjunction with the note the Company issued 750,000 shares of restricted common stock and 1,000,000 common stock purchase warrants exercisable for twelve months at $.10 per warrant for one share of Company common stock.

	 

	The relative fair value of the common stock and warrants at the debt’s inception of $6,884 and $9,121, respectively were recorded as a discount to the debt and are being amortized to debt discount over the life of the debt. The fair value of the warrants was calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions: expected life of 1.0 years; volatility of 606.16%; no dividend yield; and a risk free interest rate of 0.11%. Amortization of debt discount during the period from November 16, 2013 (date of SEA) through December 31, 2013 and the year ended December 31, 2012 was $2,017 and $0, respectively and the unamortized discount at December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012 was $136,37 and $0, respectively. Interest expense recorded on the convertible note for the period from November 16, 2013 (date of SEA) through December 31, 2013 and the year ended December 31, 2012 was $1,260 and $0, respectively. The principal balance outstanding on the loan as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 was $50,000 and $0, respectively.

	On November 17, 2013, the Company issued a $10,000 convertible promissory note. The note matures on May 17, 2015 and accrues interest at a rate of 12% per annum. The note principal and interest are convertible at a price of $.10 per share. In conjunction with the note, the Company issued 100,000 common stock purchase warrants exercisable for twelve months at a price of $.125 per share. The relative fair value of the warrants at inception of $1,297 was recorded as a discount to the debt and is being amortized to debt discount over the life of the debt. The fair value of the warrants was calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions: expected life of 1.0 years; volatility of 608.68%; no dividend yield; and a risk free interest rate of 0.13%.

	 

	Amortization of debt discount during the year ended December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012 was $104 and $0, respectively and the unamortized discount at December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012 was $1,193 and $0, respectively. Interest expense recorded on the convertible note for the year ended December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012 was $145 and $0, respectively.

	Note 6 – WARRANTS



	 


	On November 7, 2013, the Company issued 1,000,000
	warrants with an exercise price of $0.10 per share in conjunction with a $50,000 convertible promissory note. The warrants are
	exercisable at any time for one year following the execution of the agreement.


	 


	On November 17, 2013, the Company issued 100,000
	warrants with an exercise price of $0.125 per share in conjunction with a $10,000 convertible promissory note. The warrants are
	exercisable at any time for one year following the execution of the agreement.

	Expected volatility is based primarily on historical
	volatility. Historical volatility was computed using daily pricing observations for recent periods that correspond to the term
	of the warrants. The Company’s management believes this method produces an estimate that is representative of the expectations
	of future volatility over the expected term of these warrants. The Company has no reason to believe future volatility over the
	expected remaining life of these warrants will likely differ materially from historical volatility. The expected life is based
	on the remaining term of the warrants. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury securities according to the remaining
	term of the financial instruments.

	Note 7 – STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY



	 


	For the year ended December 31, 2012 a shareholder
	contributed capital in the amount of $1,524.


	 


	In April 2013 the FSTWV preferred stock holders
	A, B, C and D series converted their prefer shares into common shares of the Company.


	 


	On September 19, 2013 we issued 1,000,000 shares
	of common stock to settle a note payable with our former shareholder.


	 


	On November 7, 2013 in conjunction with the
	issuance of a convertible note the Company issued 750,000 shares of restricted common stock and 1,000,000 common stock purchase
	warrants exercisable for twelve months at $.10 per warrant for one share of Company common stock.


	 


	On November 16, 2013 we entered into the SEA
	and effected our merger and recapitalization.


	 



	Note 8 – RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS



	 


	During the year ended December 31, 2013 and
	2012 the Company received loans from a relative of the CEO. The loans are due on demand and have no interest. Amounts outstanding
	as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 were $10,000 and $5,000, respectively.


	 



	Note 9 – INCOME TAX



	 


	We experienced a change of control coincident
	with the execution of the SEA. On that date we had cumulative net operating losses totaling approximately $166,000. Management
	has determined that due to the impact of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, the application of net operating loss carry
	forwards against future taxable income will be severally limited. Accordingly, we believe the tax benefit of such loses will be
	insignificant and we therefore chose not to present a deferred tax benefit or valuation allowance as of December 31, 2013 and estimate
	that the cumulative value of timing differences between the carrying value of assets and liabilities for tax purposes is also insignificant.


	 



	Note 10 – COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES



	 



	Office Lease



	 


	On June 13, 2011 the Company signed an amendment
	to its lease originally signed on May 9, 2008. The amended lease commenced August 1, 2011 and expires July 31, 2014. Rent expense
	was approximately $39,754 and $17,109 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012, respectively.

	and determined that there are certain reportable events to be disclosed as follows:


	 


	On January 20, 2014, the Company issued a $5,000
	convertible promissory note. The note matures on August 1, 2015 and accrues interest at a rate of 6% per annum. The note principal
	and interest are convertible at a price of $.10 per share. In conjunction with the note, the Company issued 50,000 common stock

	Note 11 – SUBSEQUENT EVENTS (Continued)




	 



	In 2007, the Company had its common stock deregistered
	in order to avoid the expenses of being a public company.  The Company reported briefly on the OTC Disclosure & News
	Service in 2008. The Company again changed its name to FSTWV, Inc.


	 


	In April 2013 the FSTWV preferred stock holders
	A, B, C and D series converted their prefer shares into common shares of the Company. On October 28, 2013, the Company held a shareholder
	meeting to reincorporate the Company in the State of Nevada and concurrently change its name to Textmunication Holdings, Inc. The
	Company also voted to approve a 1 for 5 reverse split of our outstanding common stock. Per-share amounts in the accompanying consolidated
	financial statements have been adjusted for the split.

	 


	Following our shareholder meeting, on November
	16, 2013, the Company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (SEA) with Textmunication, Inc. a California corporation and Wais
	Asefi (its sole shareholder), whereby we issued 65,640,207 new shares of common stock in exchange for 100% of the issued and outstanding
	shares of Textmunication, Inc. and simultaneously the major shareholder of the Company retired 1,128,041 post reverse shares (pre-split:
	5,640,207) shares of our common stock to the Company’s treasury.  As a result of the SEA, we acquired Textmunication,
	Inc. and have assumed its business operations in the mobile marketing business.


	 


	For accounting purposes, the SEA transaction
	has been accounted for as a reverse recapitalization, with Textmunication Holdings, Inc. as the acquirer. The consolidated financial
	statements of Textmunication Holdings, Inc. for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013 represent a continuation of the consolidated
	financial statements of Textmunication, Inc., with one adjustment, which is to retroactively adjust the legal capital of Textmunication,
	Inc. to reflect the legal capital of Textmunication Holdings, Inc.

	Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

	Note 1 – ORGANIZATION




	 



	Textmunication Holdings, Inc. (Company) was
	formed in October 1984 in the State of Georgia as Brock Control Systems.  Founded by Richard T. Brock, the Company was
	in the sales automation market and an early developer of enterprise customer management systems.  The Company went public
	at the end of March of 1993.  In February of 1996, the Company changed its name to Brock International Inc., and in March
	of 1998, the name was again changed to Firstwave Technologies, Inc.


	 


	In 2007, the Company had its common stock deregistered
	in order to avoid the expenses of being a public company.  The Company reported briefly on the OTC Disclosure & News
	Service in 2008. The Company again changed its name to FSTWV, Inc.


	 


	In April 2013, the FSTWV preferred stock holders
	A, B, C and D series converted their prefer shares into common shares of the Company. On October 28, 2013, the Company held a shareholder
	meeting to reincorporate the Company in the State of Nevada and concurrently change its name to Textmunication Holdings, Inc. The
	Company also voted to approve a 1 for 5 reverse split of our outstanding common stock. Per-share amounts in the accompanying consolidated
	financial statements have been adjusted for the split.


	 


	Following our shareholder meeting, on November
	16, 2013, the Company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (SEA) with Textmunication, Inc. a California corporation and Wais
	Asefi (its sole shareholder), whereby we issued 65,640,207 new shares of common stock in exchange for 100% of the issued and outstanding
	shares of Textmunication, Inc. and simultaneously the major shareholder of the Company retired 1,128,041 post reverse shares (pre-split:
	5,640,207) shares of our common stock to the Company’s treasury.  As a result of the SEA, we acquired Textmunication,
	Inc. and have assumed its business operations in the mobile marketing business.


	 


	For accounting purposes, the SEA transaction
	has been accounted for as a reverse recapitalization, with Textmunication Holdings, Inc. as the acquirer. The consolidated financial
	statements of Textmunication Holdings, Inc. for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013 represent a continuation of the consolidated
	financial statements of Textmunication, Inc., with one adjustment, which is to retroactively adjust the legal capital of Textmunication,
	Inc. to reflect the legal capital of Textmunication Holdings, Inc.

	POLICIES




	 




	Principles of Consolidation




	 



	The accompanying consolidated financial statements
	include the accounts of Textmunication Holdings, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Textmunication, Inc. (collectively referred
	to as the Company). All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements.



	 




	Use of Estimates




	 



	The preparation of financial statements in
	conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
	reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
	and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

	Note 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
	POLICIES (Continued)




	 




	Basis of Presentation



	 


	The accompanying consolidated financial statements
	have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.



	 




	Going Concern




	 



	These consolidated financial statements have
	been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the
	realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. As of June 30, 2014,
	the Company has an accumulated deficit of $292,594. The company’s ability to continue as a going concern is contingent upon
	the successful completion of additional financing arrangements and its ability to achieve and maintain profitable operations. While
	the Company is expanding its best efforts to achieve the above plans, there is no assurance that any such activity will generate
	funds that will be available for operations. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue
	as a going concern. These consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might arise from this uncertainty.



	 




	Risks and Uncertainties



	 


	The Company is subject to substantial risks
	from, among other things, intense competition associated with the industry in general, other risks associated with financing, liquidity
	requirements, rapidly changing customer requirements, limited operating history and the volatility of public markets.



	 




	Fair Value Measurements




	 



	Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”)
	820-10, Fair Value Measurements, defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value under generally accepted
	accounting principles and enhances disclosures about fair value measurements. Fair value is defined under ASC 820-10 as the exchange
	price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the Note principal or the most advantageous
	market for an asset or liability in an orderly transaction between participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques used
	to measure fair value under ASC 820-10 must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.
	The standard describes a fair value hierarchy based on the levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and
	the last unobservable, that may be used to measure fair value which are the following:


	 




	 


	●


	Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.




	 


	 


	 




	 


	●


	Level 2 - Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets
	or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or corroborated by observable
	market data or substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.




	 


	 


	 




	 


	●


	Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the value of the
	assets or liabilities.




	 


	The fair value of the accounts receivable,
	accounts payable, notes payable are considered short term in nature and therefore their value is considered fair value.

	Note 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
	POLICIES (Continued)




	 




	Convertible Instruments




	 



	The Company accounts for convertible debt with
	beneficial conversion features in accordance with ASC 470-20, which requires the Company to recognize separately, at issuance,
	the embedded beneficial conversion feature as a discount to the debt. The recognition is done by allocating a portion of the proceeds
	equal to the intrinsic value of that feature as a debt discount. The intrinsic value is calculated as the difference between the
	effective conversion price of the convertible debt and the fair value of the shares at issuance date.


	 



	Warrants




	 



	The Company accounts for warrants issued in
	conjunction with stock issuances under private placement using the fair value method. Under this method, the value of warrants
	issued is measured at fair value at the grant date using the Black-Scholes valuation model and recorded as share capital and additional
	paid-in capital.


	 


	The Company recognized the value of detachable
	warrants issued in conjunction with issuance of notes payable using the Black-Scholes pricing model. The Company recorded the relative
	fair value of the warrant as an increase to additional paid-in capital and discount against the related debt. The discount attributed
	to the value of the warrants is being amortized over the term of the underlying debt instrument.



	 




	Cash and cash equivalents




	 



	The Company considers all highly liquid instruments
	purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.


	 


	The Company minimizes its credit risk associated
	with cash by periodically evaluating the credit quality of its primary financial institution.



	 




	Accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful
	accounts 



	 


	Accounts receivable are stated at the amount
	management expects to collect. The Company generally does not require collateral to support customer receivables. The Company provides
	an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon a review of the outstanding accounts receivable, historical collection information
	and existing economic conditions. As of June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 the allowance for doubtful accounts was $0 and bad
	debt expense was $0 for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013.


	 



	Advertising




	 



	Advertising expenses consist primarily of costs
	of promotion for corporate image and product. The Company expenses all advertising costs as incurred. For the three months ended
	June 30, 2014 and 2013, advertising expenses were $0 and $0, respectively.

	Revenue Recognition




	 



	We recognize revenue in accordance with Accounting
	Standards Codification, or (“ASC”), 605, Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue when all of the following conditions
	are satisfied: (1) there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement; (2) the service has been provided to the customer; (3) the amount
	of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable; and (4) the collection of our fees is reasonably assured.


	 


	Thus, we recognize subscription revenue on
	a monthly basis, as services are provided. Customers are billed for the subscription on a monthly, quarterly, semi-annual or annual
	basis, at the customer’s option.



	 




	Income Taxes



	 


	Income taxes are provided for the tax effects
	of transactions reported in the financial statements and consist of taxes currently due plus deferred taxes related primarily to
	differences between the bases of assets and liabilities for financial and income tax reporting. The deferred tax assets and liabilities
	represent the future tax return consequences of those differences, which will either be taxable or deductible when the assets and
	liabilities are recovered or settled. Deferred taxes are also recognized for operating losses that are available to offset future
	federal and state income taxes. Any interest charges on underpayment or other assessments are recorded as interest expense. Any
	penalties are recorded in Operating Expenses.



	 




	Net income (loss) per Common Share




	 



	Basic net income (loss) per share is computed
	by dividing the net loss attributable to the common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding
	during the period.


	 


	Fully diluted loss per share is computed similar
	to basic loss per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have
	been outstanding if the potential common shares had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive.  


	 


	Since the Company reflected a net loss for
	the three and six months ended June 30, 2014, the effect of considering any common stock equivalents would have been anti-dilutive
	and therefore a separate computation of diluted loss per share is not presented. The Company did not have any common stock equivalents
	during the three and six months ended June 30, 2013.



	 




	Recent Accounting Pronouncements




	 



	No new accounting pronouncements issued or
	effective during the fiscal year has had or is expected to have a material impact on the financial statements.



	 




	Reclassifications




	 



	Certain financial statement line items in the
	2013 amounts presented in the interim financial statement as of June 30, 2014, and for the periods then ended, have been reclassified
	to conform to the reporting method adopted for the interim financial statements. Such reclassifications had no significant impact
	on previously reported financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.



	 




	Note 3 – ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND FACTORING
	AGREEMENT




	 



	In the ordinary course of business, the Company
	utilizes accounts receivable-credit card factoring agreements with third-party financing company in order to accelerate its cash
	collections from product sales. In addition, these agreements provide the Company with the ability to limit credit exposure to
	potential bad debts, to better manage costs related to collections as well as to enable customers to extend their credit terms.
	These agreements involve the ownership transfer of eligible trade accounts receivable, without recourse or discount, to a third
	party financial institution in exchange for cash.

	Note 3 – ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND FACTORING AGREEMENT (Continued)




	 



	The Company accounts for these transactions
	in accordance with ASC 860, "Transfers and Servicing" ("ASC 860"). ASC 860 allows for the ownership transfer
	of accounts receivable to qualify for sale treatment when the appropriate criteria is met, which permits the Company to present
	the balances sold under the program to be excluded from

	  Accounts receivable, net

	  on the Consolidated
	Balance Sheet. Receivables are considered sold when (i) they are transferred beyond the reach of the Company and its creditors,
	(ii) the purchaser has the right to pledge or exchange the receivables, and (iii) the Company has surrendered control over the
	transferred receivables. In addition, the Company provides no other forms of continued financial support to the purchaser of the
	receivables once the receivables are sold. Amounts due from the financial company are recorded with

	other current assets

	in the Balance Sheet. The amount sold and fees and recorded in other expense.



	 




	Note 4 – LOANS PAYABLE



	 


	In 2012 the Company has a loan outstanding
	with a former employee. The loan is non-interest bearing and due on demand. During the year ended December 31, 2012 the Company
	entered into a settlement with the former employee which resulted in a loss on debt settlement of $2,044. Amounts outstanding as
	of June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 were $0 and $1,112, respectively. In addition, during the three months ended June 30, 2014,

	In connection with the SEA, the Company assumed three convertible promissory notes for an aggregate of $13,670, net of debt discount. The notes mature on September 14, 2014 and accrue interest at a rate of 12% per annum. The note principal is convertible at a price of $.00382 per share. At issuance the fair market value of the Company’s common stock was $.013 per share. The conversion feature of the note is considered beneficial to the investor due to the conversion price for the convertible note being lower than the fair market value of the common stock on the date the note was issued. The beneficial conversion feature was recorded at the debt’s inception as a discount of the debt of $76,429 and is being amortized over the lives of the convertible debt. Amortization of debt discount during the six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013 was $37,490 and $0, respectively and the unamortized discount at June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 was $15,741 and $0, respectively. Interest expense recorded on the convertible notes for the six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013 was $4,547 and $0, respectively.

	 


	One of the holders of the convertible promissory notes with a principal value of $25,476, entered into note purchase and assignment agreements whereby half of the principal of the note was assigned to two separate note holders. The original note was substituted and replaced by two amended and restated 12% convertible promissory notes with restated principal amounts of $12,738 each. All other terms of the original note remain in effect.

	In connection with the SEA, the Company assumed a convertible note for an aggregate of $36,363, net of debt discount. The note matures on November 7, 2014 and interest accrues at a rate of 20% per annum. The note principal is convertible into common stock at the rate of $.001 per share or 50 million shares of the Company’s common stock but such conversion can only take effect upon default of the note. The note is secured by 59,400,000 shares of the Company’s common stock. In conjunction with the note the Company issued 750,000 shares of restricted common stock and 1,000,000 common stock purchase warrants exercisable for twelve months at $.10 per warrant for one share of Company common stock.

	 

	The relative fair value of the common stock and warrants at the debt’s inception of $6,884 and $9,121, respectively were recorded as a discount to the debt and are being amortized to debt discount over the life of the debt. The fair value of the warrants was calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions: expected life of 1.0 years; volatility of 606.16%; no dividend yield; and a risk free interest rate of 0.11%. Amortization of debt discount during the six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013 was $7,936 and $0, respectively and the unamortized discount at June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 was $5,701 and $13,637, respectively.

The fair value of the warrants was calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions: expected life of 1.0 years; volatility of 444.14%; no dividend yield; and a risk free interest rate of 0.11%.

	 

	Amortization of debt discount during the six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013 was $1,995 and $0, respectively and the unamortized discount at June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 was $6,005 and $0, respectively. Interest expense recorded on the convertible note for the six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013 was $243 and $0, respectively.

	Note 7 – STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY




	 



	In April 2013 the FSTWV preferred stock holders
	A, B, C and D series converted their prefer shares into common shares of the Company.



	 



	On September 19, 2013 we issued 1,000,000 shares
	of common stock to settle a note payable with our former shareholder.


	 


	On November 7, 2014 in conjunction with the
	issuance of a convertible note the Company issued 750,000 shares of restricted common stock and 1,000,000 common stock purchase
	warrants exercisable for twelve months at $.10 per warrant for one share of Company common stock.


	 


	On November 16, 2013 we entered into the SEA
	and effected our merger and recapitalization.



	 




	Note 8 – RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS




	 



	During the years ended December 31, 2013 and
	2012 the Company received loans from a relative of the CEO. The loans are due on demand and have no interest. Amounts outstanding
	as of June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 were $10,000 and $10,000, respectively.



	 




	Note 9 – INCOME TAX




	 



	We experienced a change of control coincident
	with the execution of the SEA. On that date we had cumulative net operating losses totaling approximately $166,000. Management
	has determined that due to the impact of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, the application of net operating loss carry
	forwards against future taxable income will be severally limited. Accordingly, we believe the tax benefit of such loses will be
	insignificant and we therefore chose not to present a deferred tax benefit or valuation allowance as of June 30, 2014 or December
	31, 2013 and estimate that the cumulative value of timing differences between the carrying value of assets and liabilities for
	tax purposes is also insignificant.



	 




	Note 10 – COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES




	 




	Office Lease




	 



	On June 13, 2011 the Company signed an amendment
	to its lease originally signed on May 9, 2008. The amended lease commenced August 1, 2011 and expires July 31, 2014. Rent expense
	was approximately $8,235 and $16,470 for the three months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

	The Company has an employment agreement with
	the CEO/Chairman to perform duties and responsibilities as may be assigned by the Board of Directors. The base salary is in the
	amount of $100,000 per annum plus an annual discretionary bonus plus benefits commencing on December 17, 2013 and ending May 1,
	2017 with an automatic renewal on each anniversary date (May 1) thereafter.

	The Company may become involved in various

	Note 11 – SUBSEQUENT EVENTS



	 


	The Company has evaluated subsequent events
	after the balance sheet date of June 30, 2014 through August13, 2014, the date the financial statements are available to be issued
	and determined that there are certain reportable events to be disclosed as follows:


	 


	On July 7, 2014, the Company issued two $10,000
	convertible promissory notes. The notes mature on July 7, 2015 and accrues interest at a rate of 12% per annum. The notes principal
	and interest are convertible at a price of $.10 per share. In conjunction with the notes, the Company issued each note holder a
	100,000 common stock purchase warrant exercisable for 12 months at a price of $.125 per share.

	MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION
	OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION




	 




	Plan of Operation




	 



	Below is our plan of operations for the next twelve months.





	 







	Management





	 



	We will need to pay our management team and
	consultants that assist with managerial and administration efforts in the next twelve months.  We have 5 employees, including
	a CEO, Director of Sales, Lead Developer, VP of Operations, and Client Success Manager, and 7 consultants that assist with mobile
	consulting, systems engineering, social media efforts and graphic design, on an as-needed basis.  We do not have employment
	agreements or written consulting agreements with any of our personnel, except for our CEO, Asefi Wais.  His employment
	agreement obligates us to pay him $100,000 annually.  In order to compensate him and all of the above managerial and
	administrative support, we will require $385,000 in the next twelve months.



	 





	Marketing Plan and Personnel




	 


	The goal is to build engaging content for potential
	clients to make it clear what we do and that we excel at it. The target audience for potential and existing clients is primarily
	small to medium businesses.


	 


	Our objectives to meet this goal include the following:



	 





	 


	●


	revamping our website and setting up Google analytics for tracking SEO and keywords;




	 


	 


	 




	 


	●


	setting up accounts for Facebook and LinkedIn for paid advertisements;




	 


	 


	 




	 


	●


	designing and participating in various social media sites;




	 


	 


	 




	 


	●


	blogging, preparing newsletters, and engaging in email campaigns; and




	 


	 


	 




	 


	●


	hosting web seminars with attendance driven by the foregoing;





	 



	To accomplish these objectives, we will need
	to hire bloggers, programmers, and graphic, web and video developers.  We estimate the cost for these personnel at $115,000
	in the next twelve months.


	 


	We also need to revamp our website, purchase
	marketing software and materials, Google Analytics, hire IR/PR consultants, set aside money for conventions, and advertise for
	Facebook, LinkedIn and other social media. We estimate these expenses at $340,000 for the next twelve months.

	Sales Personnel





	 



	We intend to hire sales personnel to help grow
	our business.  Our anticipated sales force will work in teams of two. There will be a position for LDR (Lead Development
	& Research), who is responsible for originating new leads and converting those leads into scheduled appointments for an AR
	(Account Representative), who will perform an online demo overview about our company and the services we offer.  We expect
	to pay an LDR $25,000 annually and the AE $30,000 annually.


	 


	We hope to eventually have a team in place for each our targeted
	customer groups, which are as follows:


	 





	 



	1. 




	Lifestyle

	: salons, spas, health clubs, gyms, fitness centers, massage, hotels, etc.




	 



	2. 




	Entertainment

	: golf, comedy, bars & nightclubs, casinos, bowling, etc,




	 



	3. 




	Food & restaurant

	: QSR and restaurant style




	 



	4. 




	Retail

	: automotive, clothing, apparel, car washes





	 



	As we continue to grow, sales teams will be
	added in each targeted customer group according to geographic region.


	 


	From our past experience, one team should be
	able to reach out to 1,600 contacts, and yield 60 demos per month.  With this forecast, which is really just an estimate,
	one team could generate $6,000 in new sales per month. We hope to hire 2 teams for a total of $110,000 in the next twelve months.


	    


	We will have one Sales Director over teams
	and more may be added as our company grows and our geographical customer base expands.  The sales Director is responsible
	for leading and developing the sales team, organizing and assigning industry specifics and regions, and working hand in hand with
	current and new partners for sustained growth.   We have one Sales Director already and do not plan on using the
	proceeds of this Offering to hire anymore.



	 




	Professional Fees




	 



	We expect to spend roughly $50,000 in professional
	fees for legal and accounting support in the next twelve months.



	 




	Our Budget




	 



	We have broken down all of the above expenses
	in the section of this Prospectus titled, “Use of Proceeds.”  Our optimum level of growth for success will
	be achieved if we are able to raise $1,000,000 in the next twelve months.  With our Primary Offering, we hope to accomplish
	this goal.  However, funds are difficult to raise in today’s economic environment; thus, we have allocated funds
	in the Use of Proceeds if we are unable to raise $1,000,000 according to percentages of net proceeds received.  If we
	are unable to raise $1,000,000 our ability to implement our business plan and achieve our goals will be significantly diminished.
	We do not have a minimum amount of funds to raise in the Primary Offering. Thus, if we are unable to enough money to pay our expenses
	and meet our goals, you could lose your entire investment tin our business.


	 


	We have generated revenue but we have experienced
	a history of losses. At June 30, 2014 we had cash on hand of $6,627 and accumulated a deficit of $$292,594. We currently have $594
	cash on hand. Our monthly expenses have historically been approximately $18,000 and we have had sufficient revenues to cover those
	expenses in the past. The added costs of going public have resulted in a monthly burn rate of approximately $10,600 in recent months.  Thus,
	even though our revenues fund most of our operating expenses, we have taken on small loans to help bridge the gap with the onset
	of accounting and professional fees in connection with going public. We have raised approximately $160,000 in small loans since
	September 2013. There is no guarantee that these small loans will be available to us in the future. We expect that we will not
	be able to continue operations beyond 6 months with our current available capital resources, which presently consist of $594 in
	cash and our monthly revenues, without obtaining additional funding or generating more revenues. We will need at a minimum $100,000
	in capital to fund operations in the next 12 months.


	 


	We plan to ramp up operations to generate additional
	revenues beyond our existing revenues but this will require additional funding. We anticipate that additional funding will be needed
	for general administrative expenses, business development, marketing costs and support materials. We hope to raise $1,000,000 in
	this Offering to conduct such activities in the next twelve months.

	revenues in the amount of $339,533, as compared with


	revenues of $246,224 for the year ended December 31, 2012. Our increase
	revenues from 2012 to 2013 has been due to clients upgrading their accounts from smaller packages to larger monthly subscriptions
	as a result of the success they have been experiencing with their mobile marketing programs.  We have seen steady growth
	in sales from clients asking to increase their SMS volume, which in turn increases their monthly subscription costs.  We
	expect this trend to continue in our ongoing operations.


	 


	We believe our focus on select industries will
	provide better customer service and further increase sales in our ongoing operations.  Our future growth plans are in
	the following verticals: health and fitness, golf courses, and quick service restaurants.  Our plan is to onboard 1000
	new health and fitness gyms (to complement the 5500 in our existing sales pipeline) through our partner companies such as Clubready,
	ABC financial, Money movers, CFG retention group and other current partners in the health and fitness industry.  Based
	on our current targeted marketing vertical, we are also expecting to bring on 200 golf courses and 100 United States Air Force
	bases.


	 


	We believe there is a current trend to expand
	mobile marketing as an effective means of marketing to customers.  We are seeing more and more companies turning to mobile
	marketing as a way to communicate and engage with their members/customers.


	 


	We expect that our integration with Customer
	Relation Management (CRM) systems to collect a unified view of customer behavior with analytics and mobile usage behavior data
	as well as data from other sources, such as accounting or order processing systems, will become easier to integrate in 2015 as
	most merchant software will have an open API to work with our client’s data base. This will allow our customers to compile
	customer data in a way that is more easily measurable and actionable. We believe this ease of use will stimulate increased sales
	in our ongoing operations.


	 


	We further anticipate that our revenues will
	increase in 2014, especially if we are able to raise funding sought in this prospectus to expand our footprint in the industry.

	Revenues





	 



	For the three months ended June 30, 2014, we
	earned revenues in the amount of $72,439, as compared with revenues of $76,464 for the three months ended June 30, 2013. The decrease
	of $4,025 is due to a temporary lull in sales.



	 





	Cost of sales




	 


	Cost of sales was $18,363 and $19,882 for the
	three months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The decrease of $1,519 was attributed to the decrease in sales.



	 





	Operating Expenses




	 


	Our operating expenses were $73,109 for the
	three months ended June 30, 2014, as compared with $61,243 for the three months ended June 30, 2013.  Our operating expenses

	Results of Operation for Six Months Ended
	June 30, 2014 and 2013




	 





	Revenues





	 



	For the six months ended June 30, 2014, we
	earned revenues in the amount of $182,307, as compared with revenues of $186,958 for the six months ended June 30, 2013. The decrease
	of $4,651 was due to a change in our target market. In the previous year, we focused our marketing effort on quick sale restaurants.
	In the current year we are focused on enterprise and API projects in the health and fitness industries.



	 





	Cost of sales




	 


	Cost of sales was $50,811 and $25,282 for the
	six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The increase of $25,529 was due to additional costs incurred as we switched
	SMS service providers and expanded into Canada.




	 






	Operating Expenses





	 



	Our operating expenses were $187,124 for the
	six months ended June 30, 2014, as compared with $153,364 for the six months ended June 30, 2013.  Our operating expenses
	for the six months ended June 30, 2014 mainly consisted of commissions of $12,444, consulting fees of $59,800, professional fees
	of $10,000, payroll of $10,707 and rent of $17,384 compared to commissions of $47,094, consulting fees of $56,735, professional
	fees of $0, payroll of $10,438 and rent of $13,070 for the six months ended June 30, 2013.

	months ended June 30, 2014 with no other expenses for the same period ended June 30, 2013. Other expenses for the six months ended
	June 30, 2014 consisted of $51,679 in amortization of debt discount, $16,025 in interest expenses, and $3,133 in factoring expenses.

	We had a net loss of $126,465 for the six months
	ended June 30, 2014, as compared with net income of $8,312 for the six months ended June 30, 2013.




	   






	Liquidity and Capital Resources




	 



	As of June 30, 2014, we had total current assets
	of $17,147. Our total current liabilities as of June 30, 2014 were $256,754. We had a working capital deficit of $239,607
	as of June 30, 2014.



	 





	Cashflows from Operating Activities





	 



	Operating activities used $61,657 in cash the
	six months ended June 30, 2014. Our net loss of $126,465 was the main component of our negative operating cash flow, offset mainly
	by amortization of debt discount of $51,679 and stock based compensation of $6,113.



	 





	Cashflows from Financing Activities





	 



	Cash flows provided by financing activities
	during the six months ended June 30, 2014 amounted to $69,047 and consisted mostly of proceeds from the sale of convertible promissory
	notes and shareholder contributions.


	 


	Based upon our current financial condition,
	we do not have sufficient cash to operate our business at the current level for the next twelve months. We anticipate needing approximately
	$1,000,000 in the next 12 months. We only have $6,627 in cash as of June 30, 2014 and this amount is not sufficient for our needs.


	 


	We do not have any formal commitments or arrangements
	for the sales of stock or the advancement or loan of funds at this time. There can be no assurance that such additional financing
	will be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.



	 




	Going Concern




	 



	As of June 30, 2014, we have an accumulated
	deficit of $292,594. Our ability to continue as a going concern is contingent upon the successful completion of additional financing
	arrangements and our ability to achieve and maintain profitable operations. While we are expanding our best efforts to achieve
	the above plans, there is no assurance that any such activity will generate funds that will be available for operations. These
	conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. These financial statements do not include
	any adjustments that might arise from this uncertainty.



	 




	Off Balance Sheet Arrangements




	 



	As of June 30, 2014, there were no off balance sheet arrangements.



	  




	Emerging Growth Company Status




	 



	We are an "emerging growth company"
	as defined under the Jumpstart our Business Startups Act ("JOBS Act").  We will remain an "emerging growth
	company" for up to five years, or until the earliest of:



	 





	 


	1


	the last day of the first fiscal year in which our total annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion, 




	 


	 


	 




	 


	2. 


	the date that we become a “large accelerated filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which would occur if the market value of our ordinary shares that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, or 




	 


	 


	 




	 


	3. 


	the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three year period.

	Table of Contents








	 




	As an "emerging growth company",
	we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that
	are not "emerging growth companies" including, but not limited to:




	 





	 


	●


	not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (“Sarbanes Oxley”) (we also will not be subject to the auditor attestation requirements of section 404(b) as long as we are a "smaller reporting company", which includes issuers that had a public float of less than $75 million as of the last business day of their most recently completed second fiscal quarter); 




	 


	 


	 




	 


	●


	reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements; and 




	 


	 


	 




	 


	●


	exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.





	 



	In addition, section 107 of the JOBS Act provides
	that an "emerging growth company" can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in section 7(a)(2)(B)
	of the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Securities Act") for complying with new or revised accounting standards. Under this
	provision, an "emerging growth company" can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards
	would otherwise apply to private companies. However, we are choosing to "opt out" of such extended transition period
	and, as a result, we will comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards
	is required for non-emerging growth companies. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that our decision to opt out of the extended
	transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable.

In addition, shares are deemed to be beneficially owned by a person if the person has the right to acquire the shares (for example, upon exercise of an option) within 60 days of the date as of which the information is provided. In computing the percentage ownership of any person, the amount of shares outstanding is deemed to include the amount of shares beneficially owned by such person (and only such person) by reason of these acquisition rights.

	note that has a principal balance of $10,000, incurs interest at 12% per annum, matures on December 10, 2015, and is convertible
	into common shares at $0.10 per share. The note is in favor of Yama Asefi. Yama Asefi is the brother of Wais Asefi, our officer
	and director. We issued a warrant to purchase 100,000 shares of common stock with an exercise price of $0.125 per share in conjunction
	with the convertible promissory note. The warrant is exercisable at any time for one year following the execution of the agreement.


	 





	DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE




	 



	We intend to apply to have our common shares
	quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board inter-dealer quotation system, which does not have director independence requirements.  Under
	NASDAQ Rule 5605(a)(2), a director is not considered to be independent if he or she is also an executive officer or employee of
	the corporation.   Wais Asefi is not an independent director as a result of his employment as President and CEO.  Accordingly,
	we do not have any independent members on our Board of Directors.


	 


	As a result of our limited operating history
	and minimal resources, our management believes that it will have difficulty in attracting independent directors.  In
	addition, we would likely be required to obtain directors and officers insurance coverage in order to attract and retain independent
	directors.  Our management believes that the costs associated with maintaining such insurance is prohibitive at this
	time.



	 






	DISCLOSURE OF COMMISSION
	POSITION ON INDEMNIFICATION FOR SECURITIES ACT LIABILITIES



	 


	Our Articles provide that we will indemnify
	an officer, director, or former officer or director, to the full extent permitted by law.  Insofar as indemnification
	for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to our directors, officers and controlling persons pursuant to
	the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, we have been advised that in the opinion of the SEC such indemnification is against public
	policy as expressed in the Securities Act, and is, therefore, unenforceable.


	 


	In the event that a claim for indemnification
	against such liabilities, other than the payment by us of expenses incurred or paid by one of our directors, officers, or controlling
	persons in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding, is asserted by one of our directors, officers, or controlling
	persons in connection with the securities being registered, we will, unless in the opinion of our counsel the matter has been settled
	by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification is against public
	policy as expressed in the Securities Act, and we will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.
