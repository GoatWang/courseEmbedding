An investment in a fund involves significant risks. Potential investors should pay particular attention to the information in “Risk Factors” found in the current fund prospectus.
Investors shall undertake to respect the legal, regulatory and deontological measures relative to the fight against money laundering, as well as the texts that govern their application, and if modified investors shall ensure compliance with the applicable texts.

Past investment results are not necessarily indicative of future investment results.
Past performance is no guarantee of future results.
The value of all investments and the income derived therefrom can decrease as well as increase. This may be partly due to exchange rate fluctuations in investments that have an exposure to currencies other than the base currency of the fund.
Reference to market indices or other measures of relative market performance over a specified period of time are provided for your information only. Reference to an index does not imply that the portfolio will achieve returns, volatility or other results similar to the index.

The composition of the index will not reflect the manner in which a portfolio is constructed.
The information and any opinions have been obtained from or are based on sources believed to be reliable, but accuracy can not be guaranteed.

What are analysts saying about Ecolab stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Ecolab stock: 
1. Canaccord Genuity analysts commented, "We find Ecolab very well positioned to benefit from the convergence of population growth, resource volatility and rapid industrialization across the world. The company’s recurring services model drives high visibility (even in a variable macro environment)." (3/15/2017)
2. According to Zacks Investment Research, "Ecolab Inc. exited fourth quarter 2016 on a tepid note missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate for both earnings and sales. The downside came mainly from lower-than-expected volume in the energy and institutional businesses. Nevertheless, we believe that a robust product portfolio and an expanding customer base will drive organic sales. In fact, the realization of targeted synergies associated with acquisitions should also pave way for margin expansion. Also management expects the tide to turn in 2017 wherein higher margins and volumes are expected to bring in good tides for the industrial segment. The company expects water, food and beverage, and paper businesses all to benefit in 2017. Finally the stocks overvaluation reflects a relatively dull scenario that might be a cause for investors’ concern." (2/24/2017)

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Ecolab (NYSE:ECL) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 1 Sell Rating, 7 Hold Ratings, 8 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.44)Consensus Price Target: $129.31 (2.81% downside)
