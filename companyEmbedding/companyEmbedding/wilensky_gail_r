PBS- Healthcare Crisis: Gail R. Wilensky, PhD




























































































































What 
              are some of the dangers we're facing now?





                    Gail R. Wilensky, PhD
John M. Olin Senior Fellow Project 
                    HOPE Chair,
Medicare 
                    Payment 
                    Advisory Commission 


It's 
              pretty clear right now that the problems that we're facing are not 
              going to correct themselves. The fact that we've seen the number 
              of people who are without insurance grow, in part, reflects the 
              problem we have relying on employer-sponsored insurance in an era 
              when that may not make much sense for at least all of the under 
              65 population. We have an aging population. Seventy-eight million 
              Baby Boomers are going to start to retire at the end of this decade. 
              That'll put enormous stresses on the pension and Medicare system. 
              We need to think about what makes sense for the 21st century, whether 
              or not it's what made sense for the 20th century. And we keep having 
              advances in medical technology and ways to keep people alive longer, 
              so that raises a whole set of questions that we haven't dealt with.
Are 
              there opportunities inside this crisis?
There 
              are peculiarities in how we have insurance coverage today that we 
              probably wouldn't duplicate. It may be possible that we can evolve 
              into a more sensible strategy over time. It's important to have 
              an idea about where you want to go, what you would like health care 
              financing delivery to look like. It's just how you get there and 
              whether you attempt to displace or destroy what you have now, which 
              works pretty well for large numbers of the population. That's something 
              we're not inclined to do, as opposed to making gradual steps and 
              improvements to try to get to a better type of delivery system.
Do 
              ethics play or should they play a role in 
              health care policy?
Ethics 
              will always play some role for the individuals who are involved. 
              Ethical decisions get raised in hospitals on a daily basis, in the 
              life and death decisions that are involved between the physician 
              and a patient. The real question that people frequently mean is, 
              should ethical issues be a part of national health policy? It's 
              a hard question to answer, but I believe they really won't be in 
              the sense in which people generally use the term. And I think that 
              because we are a very different, heterogeneous population, very 
              different background ethnically, religiously, racially, very different 
              views about the appropriateness and efficacy of medicine. And I 
              think it would be very difficult for us to have a single uniform 
              policy with regard to rationing of health care, that is, limiting 
              on an official policy health care that the medical system thought 
              was beneficial. I don't see that we would be able the do it. 
Talk 
              about your ideas on government assistance.
When 
              I look at the issue of social obligation or a sense of responsibility, 
              it seems to me we are clearer for some populations. I believe most 
              people would agree that the poor, and there are a lot of discussions 
              about exactly who you put into that category, will need some or 
              a lot of help in terms of financing their own health care. When 
              it starts becoming more difficult is as people rise up the income 
              scale, should they be paying for their own health insurance coverage 
              or do they need some subsidy, some help? And should there be the 
              same amount of assistance no matter how wealthy or how poor those 
              individuals are? For my own values, I wish we would start with the 
              lowest income. It seems to me that is an area in which there is 
              widespread agreement, and one of the great frustrations I have is 
              in the '93-94 period, both Republicans and Democrats included legislative 
              proposals that at least included everybody below the poverty line 
              and frequently substantial subsidies for people up to 150 percent 
              of the poverty line. And yet there wasn't a willingness to say, 
              "Even if we should do more, let's at least make sure we do this," 
              because it had been, as far as I can remember the first time, that 
              both political parties were on record as saying there should be 
              a minimum benefit package for at least the very poorest. To my mind, 
              it was just shameful that we let that period slip away. These opportunities 
              come along, we ought to take advantage of them, make progress and 
              then come back to the table. 
Why 
              is maintaining the status quo bad?
There 
              are some problems we can see right now, mostly for the individuals, 
              some stresses and pressures for the provider community, but they 
              seem to generally be able to take care of themselves pretty well, 
              as we can see from this last give-back of $16 billion in refinements 
              to the Balanced Budget Act. But there are some individuals who are 
              clearly at risk. Whether or not it will be an issue will depend 
              on what else happens, where they live, whether they actually get 
              a major illness. People without insurance coverage are at risk. 
              They may only have routine expenses and if they're not poor or very 
              poor, they should be able to take care of routine expenses. Even 
              if they're middle or upper middle class, if they start having a 
              serious medical illness, that can present some real financial problems. 
              So those individuals are at risk and some number of them will have 
              real problems. The aging of the population's going to have a lot 
              of repercussions. We have this bulge in the age distribution of 
              the population, the people who were born between 1945 and 1965 who 
              are aging and beginning to edge near retirement, and we need to 
              think about how to sensibly pay for the pension and health care 
              needs of an older population. I think it's going to cause us to 
              re-think whether or not we're serious about social insurance. 
Talk 
              about Medicare.
There 
              are a number of problems with Medicare. Let me say first as somebody 
              who's formerly Director of Medicare, it's a very popular social 
              program and it has accomplished the major objective that it was 
              set out to accomplish, which was to make sure that seniors had access 
              to medical care. So when I criticize it, it's almost in a friendly 
              benighted way rather than as a major criticism. But it's a peculiar 
              program, because it doesn't provide any catastrophic protection. 
              That's a very odd insurance program. It doesn't now cover what we 
              regard as part of mainstream coverage, that is, outpatient prescription 
              drugs. And even more importantly, the level of coverage is not enough 
              for the poorest and probably more than needs to be for the wealthiest 
              among the seniors. I don't see us willing to publicly finance a 
              program that covers for all seniors what the poorest seniors need. 
              I don't want to turn it into a welfare program. I think there are 
              good arguments for losing the support of mainstream population if 
              you make it into a welfare program. But I think you can have a sliding 
              contribution that the government makes as people's incomes increase. 
              We do it all the time in the tax system, so this is not a new concept 
              .
We 
              pay twice as much for healthcare as any other country. Why?
There 
              are lots of reasons. We're an inpatient population. We're very keen 
              on new technology and procedures, and we don't have to want to wait 
              for them or have to travel long distances. I think we will always 
              spend substantially more relative to our Gross National Product 
              than other countries. And as a wealthy industrialized country, there 
              isn't any reason why we ought not to allow ourselves to do that. 
              The question that we ought to ask is whether or not we think we're 
              getting our money's worth. Do we have good incentives built into 
              the decision-making about spending on health care. I think that's 
              the much more important. Much of what we buy in health care has 
              very little to do with life and death at the moment. It has a lot 
              to do with convenience, information, assurance for the worried well 
              or the worried sick, and a lot about quality of life
Where 
              do you see this going in five to ten years?
I think 
              we are going to actively struggle early on with the issues of the 
              uninsured and the role of employer-sponsored insurance in the 21st 
              century. It is going to be very difficult to avoid this. Even in 
              our prosperous economy we see the number growing. If we at some 
              point have a slow-down in the economy, let alone anything as serious 
              as a recession, those numbers are likely to jump up in a substantial 
              way. We have to think about what makes sense for people who aren't 
              offered employer-sponsored insurance because they're part-time workers 
              or full-time entrepreneurs. What is the appropriate responsibility 
              and obligation of the individual? Do we want to try to encourage 
              employers to offer insurance who now tend not to, such as small 
              employers, low wage employers? Or is it something that we want to 
              try to make available to individuals through some mechanism? What 
              are we going to do for people who are primarily low income? Are 
              we going to continue what we've started with the children's health 
              insurance program that is part of the states' programs? Are we going 
              to let some people go without insurance coverage if they choose 
              to go without insurance coverage? Do we need something for catastrophic 
              care available? I think we're going to start, once again, to look 
              at these issues. We did it in 1993-94. I just hope we're a little 
              more honest with ourselves about what we really are willing to pay 
              for and for whom.
We're 
              in the most prosperous time in the nation's history and yet the 
              number of uninsured has doubled in the last ten years in this country.
Well, 
              the issue of doing away with a mechanism that provides health insurance 
              to large numbers of the under-65 ought to be approached very gingerly. 
              I don't know very many people who would today advocate starting 
              an employer-based insurance system. Economists, such as myself, 
              believe that the employer contribution is just part of the compensation 
              package which would otherwise go to the employee. So it's really 
              the employee's money that the employer is spending. They do so because 
              of tax provisions that encourage part of the compensation to be 
              provided as this kind of fringe benefit. It tends to have the employee 
              think it's free and not care about what happens.
The 
              question about why the numbers of uninsured have increased during 
              this time of prosperity also need to be thought about in terms of 
              the income groups that are affected. There are some individuals 
              who are transitioning off welfare who are not on Medicaid now and 
              going into jobs that do not provide insurance coverage as part of 
              their job. Now some of these individuals actually could continue 
              to be on Medicaid, but for a variety of reasons have chosen not 
              to do that. For some other individuals, we're beginning to see something 
              that had not been present in the 10 or 20 years before. It's not 
              a large number, although it might be as many as 20 percent of the 
              working uninsured, of people who were offered insurance employer-sponsored 
              coverage and said, "Thanks, but no thanks." Presumably, their contribution 
              was larger than they were able or willing to spend in terms of buying 
              insurance coverage.
One 
              of the lessons that I really learned when I was running Medicare 
              and Medicaid is the different attitude toward government that exists 
              around the country. I grew up in the Midwest and I have spent much 
              of my adult life in Washington and in the Northeast, and in both 
              those places people tend to not be quite as mistrustful of the government 
              as they are in other parts of the country. When I would go out to 
              places like Wyoming or Montana or South Dakota, I was really surprised 
              to find out for many of the individuals in the provider communities, 
              how much they basically thought the problem was the federal government 
              and that if I would get out of their way, they could resolve their 
              problems on their own, thank you. It's not a question of whether 
              that's right or wrong. It's important to remember that we are a 
              very big and diverse country with very different attitudes toward 
              social responsibility and government responsibility and the appropriateness 
              of government in various spheres of our life. And if we ignore that 
              when we're trying to resolve these very difficult social issues, 
              the chances are they aren't going to get resolved.
The 
              President of Humana stated back in the '80s that he wanted to have 
              health care as consistent as a McDonald's hamburger.
There 
              are a lot of issues that we need to deal with. Making sure that 
              good outcomes are the expectation and the result, lowering medical 
              errors, reducing complications because of inappropriate use of pharmaceuticals 
              or drug interactions is very important. I don't know that most people 
              would necessarily feel comfortable with the notion of the McDonald 
              analogy to health care, but the idea that you ought to feel pretty 
              comfortable that you will have a good product or service reliably 
              provided each and every time you go is not a bad goal for health 
              care.
Are 
              things in health care better now than 
              they were 25 years ago?
I think 
              things are much better in many dimensions now than they were 25 
              years ago. Our romanticizing Marcus Welby ignored the fact that 
              house calls made sense when there wasn't very much you could do 
              anyway and so allowing people to stay in the comfort of their houses 
              made a lot of sense. When you have somebody who's really sick now, 
              you want them in an emergency room environment or an intensive care 
              environment where there are many things that can really make a difference 
              that you're not likely to be able to pick and carry with you into 
              someone's home. But we have some problems. I think we would do well 
              not to always flagellate ourselves with our problems and remember 
              some of our successes, but to get serious about what we're willing 
              to do to resolve some of the problems with regard to the uninsured, 
              especially the poorest uninsured. Let's start with them first. Think 
              about what we want to do with the aging Baby Boomer population, 
              and then worry about long-term care. And if I had my druthers, I'd 
              do it in that order.
Bruce 
              Vladeck said that if you're rich, you get healthcare, if you're 
              poor, you don't. What do you think about the two-tiered system approach?
I think 
              if you're rich, you get care. Some of it's very good. Some of it 
              probably isn't, but you get a lot of it. I believe if you're poor, 
              you are usually able to get, a fair amount of care, a lot of care 
              in some cases, some of which is very good, some of which is not. 
              Some of the lower middle class probably are at the most risk. They 
              may not have insurance or their insurance may not be as complete 
              and they're not easily eligible for assistance. That's probably 
              our biggest problem, the lower-middle income working uninsured population 
              or maybe even underinsured population.
Vladeck 
              also described the Medicare industrial complex. Can you comment 
              on the trillion-billion of health care in this country.
$225 
              billion being spent on Medicare and the provider community wonders 
              why the government is bothering them. It's a lot of money. Much 
              of it is well spent. Some of it is not. It is reasonable and appropriate 
              to go after fraud and abuse. It's a very complicated program, enormous 
              amount of regulations. It frustrates a lot of people. One of the 
              concerns I have had is even when run by well-meaning, hard-working 
              people, is it really possible to have the federal government decide 
              on the appropriate price for each unit of service, and whether the 
              quality with which it occurred was appropriate? This goes to the 
              issue about what we want Medicare for the 21st century to look like. 
              But being vigilant about making sure that what the government is 
              funding is really provided and was needed and was provided at an 
              acceptable quality level is an appropriate role for government even 
              if it irritates some of the people on the other side.
To 
              the extent that the health care system makes it possible, should 
              the child of a gas station at attendant have the same chance of 
              dying of particular illness as a child of a corporation executive?
It 
              may depend a little bit on what the risk is being caused by. And 
              let me share that with you. We ought to be making sure that people, 
              particularly the lowest income among us, have basic coverage. Doesn't 
              necessarily mean that it has to be government funded, but we ought 
              to make sure of that. I am less concerned about multi-tiers as long 
              as what we're providing for the lowest income is acceptable to us 
              as a country in terms of what it provides and the quality of care 
              with which it is provided. There will be some areas of illness where 
              in order to try and resolve that illness will involve taking great 
              long shots using technology that is at the cutting edge or still 
              in experimental stages that will involved even therapeutics that 
              are the equivalent of hail-Marys in medical care. And I think it 
              is not reasonable to say we won't let a rich person spend their 
              money that way, if they want to. I think it is unreasonable and 
              unlikely that we would do that for every individual in our country. 
              And if we get too hung-up on that issue, we'll never resolve the 
              fact that we a have a third of our uninsured population who are 
              at or very near the poverty line. That's something surely we can 
              fix.

Comparative Effectiveness Research And Medicare: Gail Wilensky’s View
Gail R. Wilensky
February 2, 2011





































Editor’s Note: In the October issue of Health Affairs, Steven Pearson and Peter Bach proposed a new Medicare payment model incorporating comparative effectiveness research. Under the model, services offering greater health benefits than an existing alternative would receive cost-based reimbursement, but services offering benefits only comparable to an existing alternative would receive a “reference price” equal to the reimbursement rate for that alternative. New services for which comparative effectiveness evidence was inconclusive would receive cost-based reimbursement for a limited time, but they would then drop back to the reimbursement rate for existing alternatives if new evidence demonstrating superior benefits did not emerge.
Below, Gail Wilensky reacts to this proposal. Other Health Affairs Blog posts today offer reactions from Kathy Buto and Sean Tunis.
The article by Steve Pearson and Peter Bach, “How Medicare Could Use Comparative Effectiveness Research in Deciding on New Coverage and Reimbursement,” raises several important issues about the way coverage and reimbursement decisions are currently made for Medicare. It also suggests some ways to incorporate the principles underlying comparative effectiveness research (CER) into CMS decision-making. 
The arcane procedures that are part of current-law policy are important to understanding the stove-piped nature of Medicare payments as well as some of the peculiar outcomes of the current system. The complexity of the coverage and reimbursement specifics that are produced with these different calculations are breath-taking.  Fixing these problems is—well—daunting, at best.
As Pearson and Bach remind us, decisions regarding coverage and reimbursement reflect a lot of history.  Coverage may reflect a national decision for coverage or may follow the local coverage decisions of various carriers.  On occasion, Congress directs Medicare to cover a disease or procedure such as they did with End Stage Renal Disease. 
Reimbursement decisions are much more complicated than coverage decisions, and the structure that they follow tends to be setting-specific, which is why the same service that is performed in different settings can be reimbursed so differently.  For more than a decade — including the time when I chaired the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission — MedPAC commissioners and others have been expressing frustration at this inconsistency; rehab services provided in nursing homes versus rehab services provided in other settings has been a frequently cited example.  Similar problems exist whenever the same service is provided in multiple settings.  While it would be possible to “force” a common reimbursement across settings, if done in isolation this would distort whatever relationship exists between the service involved and the various other services provided within the same setting.  Redoing entire reimbursement systems, even when there is wide-spread agreement that they are fundamentally flawed, is extremely difficult, as evidenced by our current struggles over the Sustainable Growth Rate and the Medicare physician fee schedule.
Proposed Strategy
Despite the significant differences in how Medicare reimbursement strategies are designed, as Pearson and Bach note, Medicare reimbursement generally reflects the cost of the service, directly or based on historical estimates that are then periodically updated. Basically, the strategy that Pearson and Bach propose for incorporating comparative effectiveness research into reimbursement would only change Medicare’s reliance on cost as the basis for reimbursement in a limited way.  Reimbursement would continue to reflect cost, but for those services or products that are found to be clinically comparable to an existing service or product, the reimbursement would reflect the cost of the comparable service or product rather than its own cost.  This is similar to reference pricing, a reimbursement strategy that is used frequently in other countries, particularly for pharmaceuticals.  It is also similar to a strategy that is used occasionally in Medicare known as “least costly alternative” where reimbursement may be limited to the reimbursement for a lower priced product.  It is my understanding that there has been considerable dispute about how and when CMS can make use of the “least costly alternative” principle and in some instances, Congress and the courts have intervened and prohibited its use.
The innovation that Pearson and Bach bring is to explicitly tie the reimbursement of a new product or service to its comparative effectiveness relative to an existing product or service.  Those that can be shown to be clinically “superior” would be reimbursed using the customary cost-related reimbursement strategy.  Those that were not clinically superior would be reimbursed at the existing comparable product’s level.  Those for which there is insufficient evidence would be reimbursed at the higher level that would normally be set for a new product for an initial three year period, after which they would be re-evaluated for evidence of clinical superiority.  If clinical superiority can be demonstrated, the higher price would continue; otherwise the reimbursement would fall to the level of the competitor product.
I support the basic strategy Pearson and Bach present, especially separating the relevance of CER for reimbursement as opposed to coverage.  Although some may argue that distinguishing lack of coverage from the lack of appropriate reimbursement is a difference without meaning, conceptually the distinction is important.  If the product or service is safe and effective, it should be able to be provided. However, if it doesn’t do more than what is already on the market, it’s not clear why there should be any higher payment.  The principle is clear enough.  Establishing the answer empirically may be more of a challenge.
I’m not quite sure why Pearson and Bach seem so concerned about whether three years will be precisely the right period of time for all innovations.  The answer is it will surely be inadequate for evaluating some innovations and perhaps generous for others.  It seems to me that CMS could be authorized to allow an additional two-year extension of the original reimbursement whenever there appeared to be convincing evidence that the manufacturer had attempted to collect evidence in an expeditious way but that significant questions remained unanswered or unresolved after three years.
Challenges
The challenges are both technical and political.  Pearson and Bach clearly appreciate the difficulties in defining what will be termed “superior” versus “comparable” clinical effectiveness.  The discussion regarding the potential challenges of amassing an adequate base of evidence within 3 years also indicates that they are not underestimating the challenges associated with comparator measurements.  They also recognize both the importance of and the difficulties associated with measuring patient preferences in establishing comparable or superior comparative clinical effectiveness.  They also raise the question as to whether this approach should be only for new products and services or for existing ones as well.
The resolution of these as well as other technical and measurement issues will require greater consensus than now exists but should be aided by the methodology committee that was established by the Affordable Care Act to advise the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI).  Whatever views ultimately prevail, any changes will need to go through the rule-making process if they are to become a part of Medicare reimbursement strategy, assuming legislative authority is provided.  Given the controversial nature of these issues, rule-making is likely to be an arduous process. 
As to whether this approach should be used only for new products and services or existing ones as well, a reasonable strategy is to start with new products and services in order to clearly establish the principle.   Over time, however, whenever there are several different products or services in the same space that are both high-cost and high-volume, an assessment to establish clinical superiority for the higher reimbursed products should also be undertaken.  Because the “push-back” for existing products is likely to be greater than for new products and services, this assessment should only be undertaken after the principle of superior clinical effectiveness in exchange for higher reimbursement has been clearly established.
The technical issues involved with establishing superiority versus comparability in terms of clinical effectiveness are not likely to be as challenging as the political challenges.  Congress, or at least some members of Congress, was skittish about including cost-effectiveness analyses as part of CER, as well as about how CER might ultimately be used. This was reflected in the various provisions and limitations relating to CER in the economic stimulus legislation (ARRA), as well as in provisions in the Affordable Care Act. For example, although PCORI was not envisioned as a decision-making body, the ACA makes clear that it isn’t to mandate coverage, reimbursement , etc.  In addition to these prohibitions, the language reflects the intent of the Congress that evidence from research should be part of a larger process used for coverage decisions, rather than the sole basis for such decisions, and that evidence should not be used in such a way that benefits to people with disabilities would be assigned lower values. 
None of the prohibitions in the statutory language either of ARRA or the Affordable Care Act directly relate to the use of a form of reference pricing that reflects clinical effectiveness comparability such as is being suggested.  Of course, nothing in the statute allows it either, and CMS would need statutory authority to establish this type of reimbursement strategy.
As a side-bar, in their discussion of the use of two prices for intensity-modulated radiation therapy (one for higher risk patients and a lower one for other patients), Pearson and Bach say that Medicare has never tried making such differential payments, but that is not quite accurate.   When I was the HCFA Administrator, the agency was struggling about when to pay the higher costs associated with the use of low osmolar-density contrast material.  The American College of Radiology was asked (or offered—I can’t remember which) to identify the conditions where the use of the more expensive contrast medium was clinically important.  In those cases, a higher payment was made; in all other cases payment was based on the lower-cost contrast material, although hospitals were free to use whichever contrast medium they preferred.
An Alternative Framework for Using CER in Medicare 
As I’ve indicated, I support the strategy of not providing higher reimbursement for products and services that do not provide clinically superior outcomes (or only providing higher reimbursements for the subgroups where superiority can be demonstrated).  I also support the notion of providing a limited time frame for companies to be able to claim superiority without actually being able to prove it.  Companies that need more than three years could even be asked to assume partial risk for the differential payment. 
The question is whether there might be a concept that is more comfortable than Pearson’s and Bach’s framework for the Congress and the public to use that also incorporates CER into Medicare’s reimbursement policies; what is the best way to push these ideas forward?  My suggestion is to think about incorporating the concepts of CER into Medicare reimbursement as part of the more general move to value-based insurance and value-based reimbursement, rather than as a stand-along change. 
The concept of value-based reimbursement is present in several provisions of the Affordable Care Act, including the use of a value-based purchasing for hospitals in 2012, as well as the development of plans for value-based purchasing for nursing homes, home care and ambulatory surgical centers.  Limiting higher levels of reimbursement only to those services and products that have demonstrably superior clinical outcomes is completely consistent with the use of VBR and should be regarded as part of the more general move to VBR.
It would be even more useful to incorporate notions of Value-Based Insurance into this process.  Under VBI principles, the lowest co-payments would be used for those products and services that have the best clinical outcome, in general or for a particular subset of the population.  Similarly, products and services whose outcomes are highly uncertain or of less clinical value, would have higher co-payments.  This type of tiered copayment is very familiar to the public, since most insurance policies have used some variant of it for pharmaceutical benefits for more than a decade.  The difference is that now the lowest co-insurance or co-pays would be for the services with the highest (or more certain) clinical outcomes.
Just as the adoption of tiered copayments by Part D Medicare drug plans was a non-event following several years of use by the private sector, perhaps the adoption of tiered co-payments reflecting comparative clinical effectiveness could become a non-event for Medicare if it were to be adopted first by the private sector.  Unlike Medicare, employers sponsoring coverage and private insurance companies don’t need the Congress’ permission to adopt innovative payment strategies although the ACA places some limits on changes that can be introduced by plans that wish to be considered as grandfathered.
Thus, to me, the best way to incorporate CER into Medicare reimbursement is to think of it as part of the move to VBI and VBR and to push hard for innovative employers and private sector insurance to begin adopting these principles as soon as possible.  Fortunately this seems to have been happening already, as evidenced by some of the material in the November issue of Health Affairs.

Budget Implications of Medicare Policy

  TESTIMONY
Presented to
Committee on Budget
  U.S. Senate
By
Gail R. Wilensky, Ph.D.
  John M. Olin Senior Fellow
  Project HOPE
  on
  January 23, 1997

Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee, thank you for inviting me to appear 
  before you. My name is Gail Wilensky. I am the John M. Olin Senior Fellow at 
  Project HOPE, an international health education foundation, and Chair of the 
  Physician Payment Review Commission. I am also a former Administrator of the 
  Health Care Financing Administration. However, I am here today to present only 
  my own views on Medicare, and my testimony should not be regarded as representing 
  the position of Project HOPE or PPRC.
In my comments, I will discuss some of the short and long term implications 
  of changes in Medicare policy. My concern is that most of the reforms considered 
  in the last session of Congress and those already being raised in this session 
  do not resolve the long term problems of Medicare and in most cases, not even 
  the intermediate financing needs of Medicare. The public needs to be more aware 
  of the magnitude of the changes needed to keep the Hospital Insurance Trust 
  Fund afloat for the next decade.
The Need for Reform
Although Medicare has been one of our most popular social programs, it has 
  some major weaknesses and is in serious need of reform. The most significant 
  problems concern the financing of Medicare and the need to restructure Medicare 
  so that the benefits that have been promised to our seniors can be delivered 
  at a sustainable rate of growth in spending.
Medicare’s current financing problems pose short term, intermediate term 
  and long term difficulties for the program. In the short term, Medicare Part 
  B represents a major drain on the budget since three-quarters of its spending 
  is financed from general revenue. This spending exacerbates the deficit and 
  makes it more difficult to reach a balanced budget. In the intermediate term, 
  the Hospital Insurance (HI) Trust Fund will become bankrupt in the next four 
  years and under current projections will accumulate enormous deficits over the 
  next ten years. In the longer term, with the retirement of the baby boomers, 
  Medicare is not financially viable and its future insolvency raises serious 
  questions about the design of a program that will be sustainable in the 21st 
  Century.
Spending Rates and Solvency Issues
At a time when spending in the private sector has slowed significantly, spending 
  on Medicare continues at unsustainable rates. Using the recently released Congressional 
  Budget Office January 1997 baseline estimates, Medicare is still projected to 
  grow at a rate of almost 8 1/2 percent per year over the next five year budget 
  period. Comparatively, during this same period total Federal Budget Outlays 
  are only projected to grow at an average annual rate of 5.2 percent and the 
  Gross Domestic Product is projected to only grow at an average annual rate of 
  4.8 percent.
The projections for the solvency of the HI Trust Fund remain alarming. Most 
  of the lower spending growth (.5 percent per year) projected for Medicare from 
  the 1997 baseline came from Part B reductions. The Trust Fund is still projected 
  to be bankrupt in 2001, with accumulated deficits of more than half a trillion 
  dollars by 2007. In order for the Trust Fund to survive another decade, we would 
  have to find a way to sustain an annual growth rate of 4.3 percent per year 
  instead of the 8 percent growth rate currently projected for Part A. This is 
  a much more radical change than any of the proposals of the last session had 
  contemplated.
Present Structure of Medicare
Despite all of the changes occurring in the private sector, Medicare continues 
  to remain primarily a fee-for-service program, with limited availability of 
  and participation in managed care. The projections for 1997 indicate an expected 
  enrollment of 4.4 million seniors in risk-based HMO’s, representing 11.5% 
  of all enrollees. While the enrollment in HMO’s has grown rapidly over 
  the last several years, and is expected to continue growing rapidly for the 
  next decade, even by 2007, it is expected that two thirds of the Medicare population 
  will still remain in the traditional program.
There are several reasons that explain the relatively small numbers of seniors 
  in managed care. But one of the most important reasons is the limited types 
  of non-HMO managed care options available to the Medicare population, the very 
  population that most needs and probably most desires flexibility. Medicare Select, 
  a PPO offering for Medigap, is finally available across the country and a heavily 
  regulated type of point-of-service plan was made available in 1996 but is not 
  yet available everywhere. A Medicare Choices demonstration is setting up a number 
  of provider service network and partial capitation models, but it will be years 
  before an evaluation of this limited set of options is available.
In addition to the limited options that have been available and lack of incentives 
  for the elderly to be cost conscious, there are some significant problems with 
  the way payments are made to HMO’s. Payments to HMO’s reflect the 
  Medicare spending per capita that occurs within that geographic area. These 
  payments, called the Adjusted Average Per Capita Cost (AAPCC), vary enormously 
  from a high of around $750 per person per month to a low of $220 per person 
  per month.
Differences in the AAPCC primarily reflect very different practice styles and 
  volumes of services used, although to a lesser extent, they also reflect differences 
  in costs of living. Not surprisingly, HMO growth has been greatest in the areas 
  where the capitation rate is very high and HMO’s are able to offer many 
  extra benefits at no additional cost to the senior. 
By setting the capitation payment rate at 95% of the rate of spending that 
  occurs under the traditional program and having the traditional program operate 
  as an open-ended entitlement, the government guarantees it cannot save money 
  by having seniors choose an HMO other than the 5% it would save assuming there 
  was no favorable risk selection. The issue of risk selection, however, has raised 
  the possibility that the capitation payment may actually cost the government 
  money. This would happen if the elderly choosing HMO’s are healthier than 
  the elderly in their same age/sex categories and if they would spend less than 
  95% of the average were they to stay in traditional Medicare. While it appears 
  that the elderly choosing an HMO use less services and are healthier the year 
  before they enter an HMO, it is unclear whether favorable selection persists 
  over time for those who remain in HMO’s.
In sum, the present structure of Medicare hardly makes it surprising that it 
  is facing financing problems. The elderly have limited options in the health 
  care plans available to them. Medicare pays most of the costs for the services 
  it covers and almost all of the elderly have coverage that is supplemental to 
  Medicare, either privately purchased Medigap or Medicaid. That means there is 
  little reason for an elderly person to seek out cost-effective physicians or 
  hospitals, or to use lower cost durable medical equipment, laboratories or outpatient 
  hospitals. Hospitals and physicians also have little reason to provide cost-effective 
  care if there is any medical gain to be had from providing more services and 
  some reason to fear legal repercussions if they do less than they might have 
  done and the patient has an adverse outcome. Payments to capitation plans follow 
  payments in fee for service and to the extent risk selection occurs, may even 
  cost the government money. Ultimately, we need to reward the elderly for choosing 
  more cost-effective health care, to provide incentives for physicians and hospitals 
  to order and prescribe cost-effective medicine, and be willing to share the 
  savings which an aggressive reorganization of health care can produce.
Restructuring Medicare
The use of a better designed AAPCC, the payment currently used for HMO’s, 
  could become the basis for a voucher type payment which would encourage more 
  cost-effective choices by seniors. In order to make this transformation, it 
  would be necessary to redesign the determinants of the AAPCC to make it more 
  stable than it is now and to take better account of risk selection than appears 
  to occur. It also needs to be decoupled from spending in an open-ended entitlement, 
  either being set by competitive bid or by administrative fiat. Government spending 
  in the traditional Medicare program also needs to be limited to the same rate 
  of increase as in the capitated plans if seniors are to be encouraged to choose 
  between traditional Medicare and capitated plans and among capitated plans on 
  the basis of their cost-effectiveness.
The closest approximation of the structure I believe would be a better model 
  for a reformed Medicare program is the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan 
  (FEHB) in which traditional Medicare would become one of the plan offerings 
  and the premium payment by the government would be the same irrespective of 
  the choice made. This model assumes many more choices available to seniors than 
  is currently available, an annual enrollment process, more information available 
  to seniors about the choices available, monitoring or control of the enrollment 
  process and oversight of plan performance. The level of payment could be set 
  by a weighted average of plans available, by a competitive bid of plans in an 
  area or as a percent increase over existing rates.
Some Specific Medicare Problems
Aside from the more general issues of restructuring Medicare, there are some 
  specific problems facing the Medicare program which need to be resolved.
The traditional Medicare program is expected to be the dominant program for 
  at least the next decade. There are management strategies which are routinely 
  used by the private sector to improve efficiency which could be used in Medicare. 
  These include physician profiling, case management, practice guideline and the 
  bundling of payments. Several of these have or are currently being tried by 
  HCFA as part of a demonstration but HCFA needs to be able to take the early 
  results of demonstrations and move on them more rapidly than has seemed possible 
  in the past.
There are several areas in Part A of Medicare that need to be addressed in 
  the near term. These include strategies for slowing the growth in home health, 
  hospice and other non-hospital services through prospective payment, co-payments 
  or other policies, and reforming payment methodologies for hospital outpatient 
  departments.
There are also several areas concerning physician payment under Part B that 
  need to be addressed in the near term. These include the implementation of resource-based 
  practice expense values and the move to a single conversion factor under the 
  relative value system.
Finally, there are several areas concerning the AAPCC that need to be addressed, 
  regardless of whether it becomes the basis for restructuring the entire Medicare 
  program. These include limiting the extreme variations in the AAPCC and introducing 
  better risk adjusters. Also both as part of the AAPCC and as a more general 
  issue in Medicare, reforms need to be made in the payments that are being made 
  for graduate medical education.
Much of the attention in the months ahead will be on ways to produce Medicare 
  savings needed for a balanced budget bill. It will be very important that the 
  Congress be selective about the types of short term savings that are pursued 
  to be sure that they are consistent with a reformed Medicare structure. 
Some changes are consistent with the move to an incentive-based choice structure, 
  some are neutral and some may move the system in the wrong direction. For example, 
  adding a 10 percent coinsurance for home health, or a fixed copayment for rehabilitation 
  Hospital admissions would raise additional revenue, lower utilization in these 
  areas, and make managed care options more attractive. Similarly, “bundling” 
  post-acute care services, capitating those areas of Part A which have been growing 
  very rapidly over the last several years and will continue to grow more rapidly 
  than the remainder of Part A for the rest of the decade, will also make managed 
  care plans that tend to cover these components more attractive and discourage 
  their utilization in the fee-for-service world. Reducing payments to indirect 
  medical education or direct medical education would be neutral with respect 
  to its effect of the choice of the elderly regarding cost-effective health care 
  plans although it would obviously affect academic health centers and teaching 
  hospitals. But large reductions in overall physician fees could lead physicians 
  to compensate with substantial volume increases in their own services or in 
  ancillary services in their offices, which would mitigate some of the savings 
  and exacerbate the divisions between fee-for-service and at-risk medical practice.
It is possible to accommodate the need for short-term revenue increases and 
  also set the stage for the more fundamental changes in the incentives, information 
  and options that are needed to reform the Medicare program. Since it will take 
  some time to restructure Medicare and to realize the gains from reforming Medicare, 
  it is important that these reforms be started as soon as possible. This session 
  of Congress is none too soon to start.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
