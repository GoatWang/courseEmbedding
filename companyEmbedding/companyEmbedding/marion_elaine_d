Why order flowers through us?
Buying flowers from us ensures that your order will be fulfilled through working with a network florists that are trusted by local funeral homes and recognized partners of the funeral industry. A customized message, along with a photo of your selected arrangement will remain in perpetuity within this memorial website. This service also includes “Smart Select” whereby the store notifies you if your floral selection has already been selected by another sender. This allows you the opportunity to choose a different product to ensure the family has a beautiful and unique selection of unique floral arrangements.
The price of these selections also includes the funeral home’s care of the flowers after the funeral and the delivery to the family or facility of choice where they can be rearranged and enjoyed by others for a longer period.

Memorial Candles
A Perpetual Tribute
The solitude and quiet peace of a flickering candle has long been a symbol of remembrance. Each candle lit will remain lit within this memorial website for the period you select. Your thoughtful gesture will be captured both in the candle as well as listed in perpetuity within the tributes section.

Go to the Heartfelt Sympathies store






Memorial Trees
Circle of Life
In today’s changing world with climate change and environment concerns, “Honoring a Life” allows for
  family and friends to plant a memorial tree in honor of their loved one and friend. The purchase of a tree creates a beautiful permanent record on the Honoring a Life website, www.honoringalife.org. Each tree is planted through the efforts of Forestry Services throughout North America who determine where the greatest needs for reforestation are. Once planted, the geographical location where the tree is planted will be added to the record. A beautiful card is also sent to the family signifying your thoughtful gesture.

Item Description: Columbia University Press, United States, 1999. Paperback. Book Condition: New. 2nd ed.. Language: English . This book usually ship within 10-15 business days and we will endeavor to dispatch orders quicker than this where possible. Brand New Book. Social work professionals generally agree that one of the most critical components of the learning process for a practitioner in training is field education, and that the field instructor has the greatest influence on a student s approaching career. In Marion Bogo and Elaine Vayda s text, field instructors will find a model for pedagogy based on the authors many years of experience both in field and classroom environments.Now in its second edition--completely revised and updated--The Practice of Field Instruction in Social Work remains the only volume specifically intended for use by field instructors. Bogo and Vayda address how the teaching professional can systematically address the critical societal, organizational, psycho-social, and interactive components of social work practice. They discuss all phases of the field educator s work, from student orientation to assessment and contracting, from shepherding students learning processes to evaluating their work. In addition, they bring to the table the many practical concerns that affect today s teaching professional, including the uses and abuses of the instructor-student relationship, ethical issues, and working with students where differences in age, ethnicity, gender, or disability may be important considerations.This book also includes eight teaching modules, each one a complete curriculum with numerous examples and exercises, for use by field coordinators in the seminar setting and by field instructors. Throughout the modules, Bogo and Vayda present a wealth of case examples drawn from their teaching experience and that of others who have applied their highly effective pedagogical framework.
