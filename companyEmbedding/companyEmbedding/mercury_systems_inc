Products Overview



Products Overview


                    Helping customers address the broad range of sensor processing Mercury has evolved into a provider of open, end-to-end sensor processing subsystems. We now offer a product set that spans the entire ISR sensor processing chain, from acquisition to dissemination. Explore the sensor chain below.
                

                    Capturing a signal is the first stage of the signal processing chain. In the RF space, the initial challenge is often detecting the signal. Mercury’s ultra-fast RF tuners help the sensor focus on a particular signal of interest before it ends or shifts to another frequency. The result of fast tuning speed, combined with a wide band of frequency coverage is a very high probability of intercept for SIGINT and EW applications.
                

                    Signals are converted from analog to digital in the Digitize phase. Mercury’s digital receivers feature multiple analog-to-digital converters (ADC) and specially programmed FPGAs. These components condition the data to preserve high fidelity, thereby maximizing signal-to-noise ratio and dynamic range, essential for subsequent stages. In addition, Mercury’s ability to integrate multiple receivers on the same system creates multi-channel coherency, vital for direction finding.
                

                    The third stage in the signal processing chain is Process, where the digital signal is analyzed, measured, deciphered or turned into an image. EW/SIGINT signals, for instance, might be compared to other signals for matching purposes, while synthetic aperture radar signals become pictures of terrain with photographic quality. In both cases, Mercury’s server-class Intel-based digital signal processing (DSP) modules make complex real-time processing possible.
                

                    Storage enables analysts to work with the data from any stage of the signal processing chain. Mercury offers ultra-dense digital storage units (DSU) to house the terabytes of data collected by platforms such as unmanned aerial vehicles. The innovative, modular design of our DSU solutions enables you to deploy storage that meets your specific application needs. You can specify SWaP constraints, environmental requirements, redundancy needs, data interface protocols and data security technologies.
                

                    A determination is made about the signal or image captured by the platform. Does the tread in the dirt belong to an enemy tank? Is the person of interest on the ground carrying a weapon? Today, exploitation is performed by humans, but ultimately, it will be performed on board the platform — an undertaking that will require a massive amount of processing power. Fortunately, advances in general purpose GPUs (GPGPUS) make it possible.
                

                    At this stage, the sensor data stream has been modified and is ready to be transmitted, either as information or as an electronic countermeasure (ECM). For some applications, the information extracted from the sensor data stream is disseminated to people who need it. For radar jamming and other ECM applications, the sensor stream is processed and a response is transmitted with very low latency to confuse enemy devices.

CAPABILITIES ACROSS THE SENSOR PROCESSING CHAIN


            Mercury Systems is the first commercial company with domain capability across the
            whole sensor processing chain. From RF/Microwave signal processing, to analog/digital
            conversion, to secure computing and actionable intelligence dissemination, Mercury has
            for over 30-years consistently invested 15-20% of revenues developing our Ensemble®
            interoperable building blocks for EW/EA, SIGINT and Radar processing subassemblies.
            Our IRAD investment in Modular Open Systems Architectures (MOSAs) solutions
            significantly lowers program risk and integration costs, leading to faster times to solution
            and market, while delivering high technology readiness levels, interoperability, and rapid
            technology adoption.
        
TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT


            Our technology development model champions interoperable MOSA building blocks to leverage the
            best commercial technology and has enabled us to develop the broadest and most contemporary
            suite of sensor chain building blocks available. Mercury’ Ensemble sensor chain building blocks
            are aligned with the US Department of Defense’s Better Buying Power initiatives for increased
            affordability, interoperability, and efficient access to technology from the American industrial base.
            Mercury continues to seek better, faster, and more affordable ways to deliver ever smaller (lower
            SWaP), more powerful solutions with new capabilities and techniques that better protect and inform
            our warfighters and allies alike.

OpenRFM Technical White Paper (PDF)
             


            Within the defense industrial base, adherence to standards such as IEEE and ISO are nothing new. However,
            there has been very little standards-based activity born out of defense. Meaning, when a standards-based
            approach is called for, almost all of the activity comes out of the commercial sector. Mercury Systems has
            worked closely with VITA (VME International Trade Association), the governing body that helps set de facto
            military processing and related technical standards. This position paper addresses the issue of open systems
            architectures and highlights actions Mercury Systems is taking in the latest, most important open
            architecture discussion in all of defense electronics.

            OpenRFM™ FAQ
        

            What is OpenRFM™?
        

            OpenRFM™ is a modular, open architecture that combines hardware, firmware, and software that can be applied to EW and SIGINT challenges.
        

            What are its benefits?
        

            As applied to critical defense applications in EW, EA, and SIGINT it supports technologies and solutions that provide:
        


                Affordability driven by high channel density, modular design, advanced connector technology, and the integration of digital signal processing and RF technologies
            

                Sustainability with a solution that provides maximum re-use of standardized technology that will protect your investment for the long haul- making it “future proof”
            

                Flexibility by providing many system designs with multiple building blocks
            

                Interoperability driven by modular architecture, standardized control plane, and advanced software design
            


            What led Mercury to tackle this type of technology architecture?
        

            Mercury has extensive experience in building and promoting standardized solutions in the world of embedded computing. Mercury helped establish the now widely adopted embedded computing standard, OpenVPX. We helped establish and lead the working group that was formed behind OpenVPX in January 2009. In June 2010, ANSI, the standards governing body, formally ratified OpenVPX as a true open architecture and standard in embedded computing.
        

            Within the RF and Microwave domain, much of the technology supporting EW, EA, and SIGINT applications require much the same standardized, modular, open systems architecture approach applied in embedded computing. On top of this consideration, the US Department of Defense has issued directives for some time asking that the defense industrial base employ open system architectures (OSA) wherever possible.
        

            In short, Mercury Systems has announced OpenRFM as a first step in building a standardized, open system architecture that customers and the DoD has been asking for. This OSA can and will be applied to key EW, EA, and SIGINT applications.
        

         

            Any other considerations on why Mercury has taken the lead with OpenRFM?
        

            There is one other very important consideration that is born out of both a desire to lead and also from a requirement to integrate many disparate products. Over the last 10+ years, Mercury has acquired several companies within the digital signal processing, RF and microwave space. Starting with ARC in the early 2000’s, then Echotek in 2005, LNX in 2011 and Micronetics in 2012, Mercury found itself with several leading RF and microwave technologies and capabilities and the need to bring together, integrate, make modular, and standardize these technologies. Also Mercury could build solutions in a sustainable, scalable, and affordable way for customers.
        

            As a company, Mercury Systems has gotten very good at integrating and standardizing RF and microwave solutions. This skill set that has been acquired over several years is now applied to customers, both prime contractors and the DoD, need to standardize around an open systems architecture in RF and microwave solutions. OpenRFM takes advantage of Mercury’s ability to take several leading technologies and make them work as one. Without this important skill set it would be nearly impossible to develop the kinds of open, affordable, standardized solutions that are called for today within the RF and microwave domain.
        

            Is OpenRFM a standard already?
        

            No not yet, Mercury is in the early stages to drive OpenRFM to becoming a true standard. In the meantime, Mercury Systems is already working with select customers on standardized, modular solutions that are being applied to key programs that require advanced EW, EA, and SIGINT capabilities. Mercury Systems is launching OpenRFM as a standardized modular approach to RF and microwave solutions that is supported with products and company representatives readily on hand to answer questions. As it did with OpenVPX, Mercury intends to initiate work and possibly establish a working group to help create an ecosystem and drive adoption of OpenRFM as a true standard. In the meantime, the benefits of OpenRFM, and the ability to provide a modular open architecture in the RF and microwave space, can be taken full advantage of by customers right away. The improvements in affordability driven by this type of technology are not something that is in the distant future. Mercury has examples of how it can work today and we are happy to sit down and discuss in more detail.

Products Overview



Products Overview


                    Helping customers address the broad range of sensor processing Mercury has evolved into a provider of open, end-to-end sensor processing subsystems. We now offer a product set that spans the entire ISR sensor processing chain, from acquisition to dissemination. Explore the sensor chain below.
                

                    Capturing a signal is the first stage of the signal processing chain. In the RF space, the initial challenge is often detecting the signal. Mercury’s ultra-fast RF tuners help the sensor focus on a particular signal of interest before it ends or shifts to another frequency. The result of fast tuning speed, combined with a wide band of frequency coverage is a very high probability of intercept for SIGINT and EW applications.
                

                    Signals are converted from analog to digital in the Digitize phase. Mercury’s digital receivers feature multiple analog-to-digital converters (ADC) and specially programmed FPGAs. These components condition the data to preserve high fidelity, thereby maximizing signal-to-noise ratio and dynamic range, essential for subsequent stages. In addition, Mercury’s ability to integrate multiple receivers on the same system creates multi-channel coherency, vital for direction finding.
                

                    The third stage in the signal processing chain is Process, where the digital signal is analyzed, measured, deciphered or turned into an image. EW/SIGINT signals, for instance, might be compared to other signals for matching purposes, while synthetic aperture radar signals become pictures of terrain with photographic quality. In both cases, Mercury’s server-class Intel-based digital signal processing (DSP) modules make complex real-time processing possible.
                

                    Storage enables analysts to work with the data from any stage of the signal processing chain. Mercury offers ultra-dense digital storage units (DSU) to house the terabytes of data collected by platforms such as unmanned aerial vehicles. The innovative, modular design of our DSU solutions enables you to deploy storage that meets your specific application needs. You can specify SWaP constraints, environmental requirements, redundancy needs, data interface protocols and data security technologies.
                

                    A determination is made about the signal or image captured by the platform. Does the tread in the dirt belong to an enemy tank? Is the person of interest on the ground carrying a weapon? Today, exploitation is performed by humans, but ultimately, it will be performed on board the platform — an undertaking that will require a massive amount of processing power. Fortunately, advances in general purpose GPUs (GPGPUS) make it possible.
                

                    At this stage, the sensor data stream has been modified and is ready to be transmitted, either as information or as an electronic countermeasure (ECM). For some applications, the information extracted from the sensor data stream is disseminated to people who need it. For radar jamming and other ECM applications, the sensor stream is processed and a response is transmitted with very low latency to confuse enemy devices.

CAPABILITIES ACROSS THE SENSOR PROCESSING CHAIN


            Mercury Systems is the first commercial company with domain capability across the
            whole sensor processing chain. From RF/Microwave signal processing, to analog/digital
            conversion, to secure computing and actionable intelligence dissemination, Mercury has
            for over 30-years consistently invested 15-20% of revenues developing our Ensemble®
            interoperable building blocks for EW/EA, SIGINT and Radar processing subassemblies.
            Our IRAD investment in Modular Open Systems Architectures (MOSAs) solutions
            significantly lowers program risk and integration costs, leading to faster times to solution
            and market, while delivering high technology readiness levels, interoperability, and rapid
            technology adoption.
        
TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT


            Our technology development model champions interoperable MOSA building blocks to leverage the
            best commercial technology and has enabled us to develop the broadest and most contemporary
            suite of sensor chain building blocks available. Mercury’ Ensemble sensor chain building blocks
            are aligned with the US Department of Defense’s Better Buying Power initiatives for increased
            affordability, interoperability, and efficient access to technology from the American industrial base.
            Mercury continues to seek better, faster, and more affordable ways to deliver ever smaller (lower
            SWaP), more powerful solutions with new capabilities and techniques that better protect and inform
            our warfighters and allies alike.

Products and Services[edit]
Mercury's Next Generation Business Model[edit]
To meet Department of Defense (DOD) defense electronics procurement reform objectives, Mercury created a Next Generation Business Model.[14] Defense procurement reform objectives are captured by the Department’s Better Buying Power 3.0 (BBP3.0)[15] under the overarching theme of “Achieving Dominant Capabilities through Technical Excellence and Innovation.”
BBP3.0 highlights the need to leverage commercial technology through open system architectures thereby meeting agility, performance, interoperability and affordability objectives. Augmenting the requirements of BBP3.0 is the need to build security in to all defense processing systems to counter emerging threats, cyberattacks and reverse engineering.[16] Mercury’s next-generation defense electronics business model meets BBP3.0 and counter contemporary security objectives by:[14]
• Quickly adopting the best commercial technology in support of defense programs and missions
• Investing in R&D to complement the Pentagon’s, prime-contractors’, defense and non-profit labs’ own initiatives
• Creating secure processing subsystem building-blocks for pre-integrating into defense programs
Open System Architecture (OSA) for Digital and RF/Microwave Processing[edit]
Mercury has a systematic approach to the creation of defense processing subsystems using a sensor processing chain methodology to define reusable building blocks.[17] This business approach leverages best commercial technology making Mercury processing building blocks interoperable and standardized, so defense processing subsystems are quickly developed.



Open system architectures (OSA) are fundamental to meeting the DOD’s BBP 3.0 objectives and are aligned with Mercury’s business posture.[18] The company pioneered many of today’s embedded protocols and processing standards including RapidIO and OpenVPX (ANSI/VITA 65 standard) which is the de facto embedded digital processing standard.
Currently, the company is investing in OpenRFM for Radio Frequency (RF) and microwave processing that will bring interoperability to the RF/microwave domain, as OpenVPX did in the digital realm. OpenRFM standardizes the profiles, interfaces and protocols for RF and microwave processing enabling sensor chain applications to be fully open systems compliant.[19] Mercury applies open systems architectures to software as well as hardware. This approach, applied to middleware preserves the software and application investments while adding new capabilities through tech-refreshes.
Built-in Security for Sensor Processing[edit]
Mercury's third generation security framework is built into all their processing building blocks for system-wide security that is personalized and private for each application. This agnostic built-in security foundation spans 3U and 6U OpenVPX, secure-AdvancedTCA and rackmount ATX architectures enabling processing solutions to span platforms and form-factors.
Built-in Safety for Mission Computing[edit]
Mercury’s acquisition of CES brought Design Assurance Level (DAL) capabilities to the company’s portfolio, for both DO-254 (software) and DO-178 (hardware). These capabilities are required for safety-critical mission computing used in commercial and military, manned and unmanned platforms.
The integration of CES’s flight safety capabilities and Mercury’s secure sensor processing capabilities is enabling the connection of the effects grid to the sensor grid through affordable open systems architectures.[20]
Major innovations[edit]

OpenVPX — Open architecture framework that drives VPX system-level interoperability and lowers costs
RapidIO — Open standard, high-performance, embedded switch fabric architecture
POET — Provides low-latency, high-bandwidth communications between PCIe, RapidIO and other fabrics
RACE++

Facilities[edit]
Corporate Headquarters[edit]
Mercury is headquartered in Andover, Massachusetts within a secure and Defense Microelectronics Activity (DMEA) certified state-of-the-art facility.[21] The facility incorporates a world-class design and engineering capability and an Innovation Center. Mercury Innovation Centers showcase the company’s sensor and mission processing solutions.[22]
Manufacturing Centers[edit]
Mercury has redundant, scalable Advanced Microelectronic Centers (AMCs). AMCs are dedicated to the production of defense industry subsystems within a world-class, domestic manufacturing environment. AMCs are operated in New England, New York Metro-area, Southern California and a trusted DMEA facility in the Southwest, which also has Missile Defense Agency approval and AS9100 certification.[21]
Company structure[edit]
Mercury has three major product lines:
• Advanced Microelectronic Solutions / RF & Digital Solutions
• Sensor and Mission Processing - Mercury Mission Systems; Safety-critical avionics, mission processing, networking, and communication; Secure high-performance sensor processing, storage, and networking
• Mercury Defense Systems – Electronic Warfare; Secure Processing Solutions; Test & Simulation
Mercury’s businesses are supported by several dedicated international operations including: Silchester, United Kingdom, Tokyo, Japan and Geneva, Switzerland. [23]

History[edit]

Founded on July 14, 1981, Mercury Systems is based in Andover, Massachusetts, with more than 1000 employees in offices around the world and annual revenues of approximately US$270 million.[2]
July 2005, Mercury Computer Systems acquired Echotek Corporation for approximately US$49 million.[6]
January 2011, Mercury Computer Systems acquired LNX Corporation.[7]
August 2012, Mercury Computer Systems acquired Micronetics for US$74.9 Million.[8]
November 2012, the company changed its name from Mercury Computer Systems to Mercury Systems.[9]
December 2015, Mercury Systems acquired Lewis Innovative Technologies, Inc. (LIT). LIT’s security solutions significantly extend Mercury's leadership in secure embedded computing.[10]
May 2016, Mercury Systems acquired the embedded security, RF and microwave, and custom microelectronics businesses of Microsemi Corporation for a total purchase prices of US$300 million. The acquisition expands Mercury's capabilities, along the sensor processing chain, and positions Mercury as the defense industry’s largest commercial embedded secure processing company.[11]
November 2016, Mercury Systems acquires CES Creative Electronic Systems, S.A. (“CES”). The total purchase price for the transaction is approximately US$38 million. The addition of CES adds capabilities in mission computing, safety-critical avionics and platform management.[12]
April 2017, Mercury Systems acquires Delta Microwave, LLC (“Delta”) for US$40.5 million. This acquisition will enable Mercury to expand into the satellite communications (SatCom), datalinks and space launch markets.[13]

Products and Services[edit]
Mercury's Next Generation Business Model[edit]
To meet Department of Defense (DOD) defense electronics procurement reform objectives, Mercury created a Next Generation Business Model.[14] Defense procurement reform objectives are captured by the Department’s Better Buying Power 3.0 (BBP3.0)[15] under the overarching theme of “Achieving Dominant Capabilities through Technical Excellence and Innovation.”
BBP3.0 highlights the need to leverage commercial technology through open system architectures thereby meeting agility, performance, interoperability and affordability objectives. Augmenting the requirements of BBP3.0 is the need to build security in to all defense processing systems to counter emerging threats, cyberattacks and reverse engineering.[16] Mercury’s next-generation defense electronics business model meets BBP3.0 and counter contemporary security objectives by:[14]
• Quickly adopting the best commercial technology in support of defense programs and missions
• Investing in R&D to complement the Pentagon’s, prime-contractors’, defense and non-profit labs’ own initiatives
• Creating secure processing subsystem building-blocks for pre-integrating into defense programs
Open System Architecture (OSA) for Digital and RF/Microwave Processing[edit]
Mercury has a systematic approach to the creation of defense processing subsystems using a sensor processing chain methodology to define reusable building blocks.[17] This business approach leverages best commercial technology making Mercury processing building blocks interoperable and standardized, so defense processing subsystems are quickly developed.



Open system architectures (OSA) are fundamental to meeting the DOD’s BBP 3.0 objectives and are aligned with Mercury’s business posture.[18] The company pioneered many of today’s embedded protocols and processing standards including RapidIO and OpenVPX (ANSI/VITA 65 standard) which is the de facto embedded digital processing standard.
Currently, the company is investing in OpenRFM for Radio Frequency (RF) and microwave processing that will bring interoperability to the RF/microwave domain, as OpenVPX did in the digital realm. OpenRFM standardizes the profiles, interfaces and protocols for RF and microwave processing enabling sensor chain applications to be fully open systems compliant.[19] Mercury applies open systems architectures to software as well as hardware. This approach, applied to middleware preserves the software and application investments while adding new capabilities through tech-refreshes.
Built-in Security for Sensor Processing[edit]
Mercury's third generation security framework is built into all their processing building blocks for system-wide security that is personalized and private for each application. This agnostic built-in security foundation spans 3U and 6U OpenVPX, secure-AdvancedTCA and rackmount ATX architectures enabling processing solutions to span platforms and form-factors.
Built-in Safety for Mission Computing[edit]
Mercury’s acquisition of CES brought Design Assurance Level (DAL) capabilities to the company’s portfolio, for both DO-254 (software) and DO-178 (hardware). These capabilities are required for safety-critical mission computing used in commercial and military, manned and unmanned platforms.
The integration of CES’s flight safety capabilities and Mercury’s secure sensor processing capabilities is enabling the connection of the effects grid to the sensor grid through affordable open systems architectures.[20]
Major innovations[edit]

OpenVPX — Open architecture framework that drives VPX system-level interoperability and lowers costs
RapidIO — Open standard, high-performance, embedded switch fabric architecture
POET — Provides low-latency, high-bandwidth communications between PCIe, RapidIO and other fabrics
RACE++

Facilities[edit]
Corporate Headquarters[edit]
Mercury is headquartered in Andover, Massachusetts within a secure and Defense Microelectronics Activity (DMEA) certified state-of-the-art facility.[21] The facility incorporates a world-class design and engineering capability and an Innovation Center. Mercury Innovation Centers showcase the company’s sensor and mission processing solutions.[22]
Manufacturing Centers[edit]
Mercury has redundant, scalable Advanced Microelectronic Centers (AMCs). AMCs are dedicated to the production of defense industry subsystems within a world-class, domestic manufacturing environment. AMCs are operated in New England, New York Metro-area, Southern California and a trusted DMEA facility in the Southwest, which also has Missile Defense Agency approval and AS9100 certification.[21]
Company structure[edit]
Mercury has three major product lines:
• Advanced Microelectronic Solutions / RF & Digital Solutions
• Sensor and Mission Processing - Mercury Mission Systems; Safety-critical avionics, mission processing, networking, and communication; Secure high-performance sensor processing, storage, and networking
• Mercury Defense Systems – Electronic Warfare; Secure Processing Solutions; Test & Simulation
Mercury’s businesses are supported by several dedicated international operations including: Silchester, United Kingdom, Tokyo, Japan and Geneva, Switzerland. [23]
