CHENGDU, Feb.16 (NBD) -- Shaohua (Michael) Yin, a 44-year-old Chinese, was charged by U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for reaping massive profits from insider trading on Comcast-DreamWorks Acquisition.
The SEC alleges that in the weeks leading up to the news of the acquisition, Shaohua (Michael) Yin amassed more than 56 million US dollars of DreamWorks stock via five Chinese accounts, including his elderly parents. The five accounts altogether reaped 29 million US dollars from DreaWork trade.
Summitview Capital Management Ltd., former employer of Yin, is a Hong Kong-based private equity firm. NBD was told that Yin had resigned on February 8 for personal reasons. And the company denied any involvement in his fraud.

武岳峰资本_专业成就产业











首页团队投资方向联系方式递交商业计划书重大事项与活动











郑重声明

					  关于【美证监会指控中国交易员涉梦工厂内幕交易】相关不实报道的澄清声明
近日，武岳峰资本发现在“新浪美股” 、“每日经济新闻网”、“银行信息港”等网站上出现的关于【美证监会指控中国交易员涉梦工厂内幕交易】的相关内容中错误的把香港Summitview Capital Management Ltd.的中文名称翻译成“武岳峰资本”。经我方委托专业人士调查，该公司对外正式公布的中文名称为“远山资本”，并非如网站信息刊登的“武岳峰资本”。
武岳峰资本在此严正申明：武岳峰资本为武岳峰旗下所有专业投资基金及管理公司的总称，是我单位的专有名称，且系经过合法商标注册。上述网站内容中的香港Summitview Capital Management Ltd. 及尹某个人均与“武岳峰资本”没有任何关联。发文单位未经核实，而将该英文名称翻译成“武岳峰资本”是极其不负责任和不严谨的行为，给我单位造成了很大的负面影响。我们已经向相关单位提出严正交涉并保留进一步依法维护本单位权益及追究相关单位与个人法律责任的权利。
