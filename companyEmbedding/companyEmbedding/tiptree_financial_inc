	Consolidated Results




	For the


	year ended December 31, 2016


	, the Company reported revenues of


	$567.2 million


	, an increase of


	$128.7 million


	 or


	29.4%


	 from the


	year ended December 31, 2015


	. The primary drivers of the increase in revenues were improvements in earned premiums, service and administrative fees and investment income in our specialty insurance segment, increases in management incentive fees and returns on associated investments in our asset management segment, improvement in rental income attributable to acquisitions of senior housing properties and increased mortgage volume.









	For the


	year ended December 31, 2016


	, income from continuing operations was


	$32.3 million


	 compared to a loss of


	$13.8 million


	 in 2015. The key drivers of the


	$46.2 million


	 increase were improved profitability in our specialty insurance segment driven by higher revenues and investment income, increased profits from our asset management segment as a result of incentive fees and CLO subordinated note returns, increased rental income in our senior living operations, and increases in mortgage volume and margins due to improving market conditions. This increased income was partially offset by higher corporate expenses from increased performance related incentive compensation and costs associated with our effort to improve our controls and financial reporting infrastructure. Additionally, a tax benefit of $4.0 million was recognized in the first quarter 2016, which was driven by the tax reorganization effective January 1, 2016. A discussion of the changes in revenues, expenses and net income is presented below and in more detail in our segment analysis.









	For the


	year ended December 31, 2016


	 net income available to Class A common shareholders was


	$25.3 million


	, an increase of


	$19.5 million


	, or


	338.1%


	 from the prior year period. The key drivers of net income available to Class A common shareholders were the same factors which impacted the positive year-over-year change in income from continuing operations, and which were partially offset by the loss of the


	$22.6 million


	 of earnings from discontinued operations recorded in the


	year ended December 31, 2015


	, which included the one-time net gain on the sale of PFG of $15.6 million.









	Adjusted EBITDA - Non-GAAP









	Management uses Adjusted EBITDA and book value per share, as exchanged as measurements of operating performance which are non-GAAP measures. Management believes that use of Adjusted EBITDA provides supplemental information useful to investors as it is frequently used by the financial community to analyze financial performance, and to analyze a company’s ability to service its debt and to facilitate comparison among companies. Adjusted EBITDA is also used in determining incentive compensation for the Company’s executive officers. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement of financial performance or liquidity under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative or substitute for GAAP net income. Book value per share, as exchanged assumes full exchange of the limited partners units of TFP for Tiptree Class A common stock. Management believes that use of this financial measure provides supplemental information useful to investors as it is frequently used by the financial community to analyze company growth on a relative per share basis.








	Page 2




















	Total Adjusted EBITDA for the


	year ended December 31, 2016


	 was


	$78.9 million


	 compared to


	$58.4 million


	 for 2015, an increase of $20.5 million or 35.1%. The key drivers of the change in Adjusted EBITDA were the same as those which impacted our income from continuing operations, and which were partially offset by the loss of


	$32.5 million


	 of Adjusted EBITDA in the


	year ended December 31, 2015


	 related to discontinued operations. See “Non-GAAP Reconciliations” below for a reconciliation to GAAP net income.

	The consolidated non-corporate and non-acquisition related interest expense is subtracted from EBITDA to arrive at Adjusted EBITDA. This includes interest expense associated with asset-specific debt at subsidiaries in the specialty insurance, asset management, senior living and specialty finance segments.








	(2)






	Following the purchase accounting adjustments, current period expenses associated with deferred costs were more favorably stated and current period income associated with deferred revenues were less favorably stated. Thus, the purchase accounting effect related to Fortegra increased EBITDA above what the historical basis of accounting would have generated. The impact of this purchase accounting adjustments have been reversed to reflect an adjusted EBITDA without such purchase accounting effect.








	(3)






	For our senior living segment, Adjusted EBITDA excludes the impact of the change of fair value of interest rate swaps hedging the debt at the property level. For Reliance, Adjusted EBITDA excludes the impact of changes in contingent earn-outs.








	(4)






	Acquisition costs include legal, taxes, banker fees and other costs associated with senior living acquisitions in 2016 and 2015 and the Fortegra acquisition in 2014.

	Non-GAAP Financial Measures - Specialty Insurance Investment Portfolio









	In managing our investment portfolio we analyze net investments and net portfolio income, which are non-GAAP measures. Our presentation of net investments equals total investments plus cash and cash equivalents minus asset based financing of investments. Our presentation of net portfolio income equals net investment income plus realized and unrealized gains and losses and minus interest expense associated with asset based financing of investments. Net investments and net portfolio income are used to calculate average annualized yield, which management uses to analyze the profitability of our investment portfolio. Management believes this information is useful since it allows investors to evaluate the performance of our investment portfolio based on the capital at risk and on a non-consolidated basis. Our calculation of net investments and net portfolio income may differ from similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Net investments and net portfolio income are not measures of financial performance or liquidity under GAAP and should not be considered a substitute for total investments or net investment income.




	The following table provides a reconciliation between segment total investments and net investments for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2016, and 2015.

 Adjusted EBITDA(1)
 The key drivers for improvement in performance include: 
+ Specialty Insurance: revenue growth driven by increases in net written
 premiums with improved investment income supporting growth in
 earnings
 + Asset Management: increases driven by recovery of fair market valuations
 and higher distributions on CLO sub-notes, combined with increases in
 management incentive fees
 + Senior Living: improved margins at existing properties and addition of
 rental and related income from acquisitions increased overall revenues
 + Specialty Finance: growth in mortgage origination volumes and gain on
 sale margins as a result of strong market conditions and increased
 production headcount
 - Corporate: higher compensation, audit and consulting expenses driven by
 efforts to improve financial infrastructure and increased incentive
 compensation due to substantially improved performance
 þ All material weaknesses remediated and our Corporate
 infrastructure is substantially in place

 Management uses EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, which are non-GAAP financial measures. The Company believes that use of these financial measures on a consolidated basis and for each segment
 provide supplemental information useful to investors as it is frequently used by the financial community to analyze performance period to period, to analyze a company’s ability to service its debt and
 to facilitate comparison among companies. The Company believes segment EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provides additional supplemental information to compare results among our segments. Adjusted
 EBITDA is also used in determining incentive compensation for the Company’s executive officers. These measures are not a measurement of financial performance or liquidity under GAAP and should
 not be considered as an alternative or substitute for net income. The Company’s presentation of these measures may differ from similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.
 The Company defines EBITDA as GAAP net income of the Company adjusted to add consolidated interest expense, consolidated income taxes and consolidated depreciation and amortization expense
 as presented in its financial statements and Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA adjusted to (i) subtract interest expense on asset-specific debt incurred in the ordinary course of its subsidiaries’ business
 operations, (ii) adjust for the effect of purchase accounting, (iii) add back significant acquisition related costs, (iv) adjust for significant relocation costs and (v) any significant one-time expenses.

 (1) The consolidated non-corporate and non-acquisition related interest expense is subtracted from EBITDA to arrive at Adjusted EBITDA. This includes interest expense associated with asset-specific debt at subsidiaries in the specialty insurance, asset
 management, senior living and specialty finance segments.
 (2) Following the purchase accounting adjustments, current period expenses associated with deferred costs were more favorably stated and current period income associated with deferred revenues were less favorably stated. Thus, the purchase
 accounting effect related to Fortegra increased EBITDA above what the historical basis of accounting would have generated. The impact of this purchase accounting adjustments have been reversed to reflect an adjusted EBITDA without such purchase
 accounting effect.
 (3) For our senior living segment, Adjusted EBITDA excludes the impact of the change of fair value of interest rate swaps hedging the debt at the property level. For Reliance, Adjusted EBITDA excludes the impact of changes in contingent earn-outs.
 (4) Acquisition costs include legal, taxes, banker fees and other costs associated with senior living acquisitions in 2016 and 2015 and the Fortegra acquisition in 2014.
 (5) Consists of payments pursuant to a separation agreement, dated as of November 10, 2015.
 (6) Significant relocation costs for discontinued operations included expenses incurred in connection with the move of PFAS’s physical location from New Jersey to Philadelphia for the year ended December 31, 2014.

 Management uses EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, which are non-GAAP financial measures. The Company believes that consolidated EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA on a consolidated basis and for each
 segment provide supplemental information useful to investors as it is frequently used by the financial community to analyze performance period to period, to analyze a company’s ability to service
 its debt and to facilitate comparison among companies. The Company believes segment EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provides additional supplemental information to compare results among our
 segments. Beginning in 2016 the Company Adjusted EBITDA will also be used in determining incentive compensation for the Company’s executive officers. These measures are not a measurement
 of financial performance or liquidity under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative or substitute for net income. The Company’s presentation of these measures may differ from similarly
 titled non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. The Company defines EBITDA as GAAP net income of the Company adjusted to add consolidated interest expense, consolidated income
 taxes and consolidated depreciation and amortization expense as presented in its financial statements and Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA adjusted to (i) subtract interest expense on asset-specific debt
 incurred in the ordinary course of its subsidiaries’ business operations, (ii) adjust for the effect of purchase accounting, (iii) add back significant acquisition related costs, (iv) adjust for significant
 relocation costs and (v) any significant one-time expenses.

 NON-GAAP RECONCILIATIONS - BOOK VALUE PER SHARE, AS EXCHANGED
 Management uses Book value per share, as exchanged, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. As exchanged assumes full exchange of the limited partners units of TFP for Tiptree Class A common
 stock. Management believes the use of this financial measure provides supplemental information useful to investors as it is frequently used by the financial community to analyze company growth on
 a relative per share basis. 
Tiptree’s book value per share, as exchanged, was $10.14 as of December 31, 2016 compared with $8.90 as of December 31, 2015. Total stockholders’ equity, net of other non-controlling interests for
 the Company was $369.5 million as of December 31, 2016, which comprised total stockholders’ equity of $390.1 million adjusted for $20.6 million attributable to non-controlling interest at certain
 operating subsidiaries that are not wholly owned by the Company, such as Siena, Luxury and Care. Total stockholders’ equity, net of other non-controlling interests for the Company was $382.1 million
 as of December 31, 2015, which comprised total stockholders’ equity of $397.7 million adjusted for $15.6 million attributable to non-controlling interest at subsidiaries that are not wholly owned by
 the Company. Additionally, the Company’s book value per share is based upon Class A common shares outstanding, plus Class A common stock issuable upon exchange of partnership units of TFP
 which is equal to the number of Class B outstanding shares. The total shares as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 were 36.4 million and 42.9 million, respectively. 
(1) As of December 31, 2016, excludes 6,596,000 shares of Class A common stock held by subsidiaries of the Company. See Note 24—Earnings per Share, in the Form 10-K for December 31, 2016, for further discussion of potential dilution from warrants.

 NON-GAAP RECONCILIATIONS - SPECIALTY INSURANCE
 The following table provides a reconciliation between as adjusted underwriting margin and pre-tax income for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. We generally limit the underwriting
 risk we assume through the use of both reinsurance (e.g., quota share and excess of loss) and retrospective commission agreements with our partners (e.g., commissions paid adjust based on the
 actual underlying losses incurred), which manage and mitigate our risk. Period-over-period comparisons of revenues are often impacted by the PORCs and clients’ choice as to whether to retain risk,
 specifically with respect to the relationship between service and administration expenses and ceding commissions, both components of revenue, and the offsetting policy and contract benefits and
 commissions paid to our partners and reinsurers. Generally, when losses are incurred, the risk which is retained by our partners and reinsurers is reflected in a reduction in commissions paid. In order
 to better explain to investors the net financial impact of the risk retained by the Company of the insurance contracts written and the impact on profitability, we use the Non-GAAP metric - As Adjusted
 Underwriting Margin. For the same reasons that we adjust our combined ratio for the effects of purchase accounting, VOBA impacts can also mask the actual relationship between revenues earned
 and the offsetting reductions in commissions paid, and thus the period over period net financial impact of the risk retained by the Company. Expressed as a percentage, the combined ratio represents
 the relationship of policy and contract benefits, commission expense (net of ceding commissions), employee compensation and benefits, and other expenses to net earned premiums, service and
 administrative fees, and other income. Investors use this ratio to evaluate our ability to profitably underwrite the risks we assume over time and manage our operating costs. As such, we believe that
 presenting underwriting margin and the combined ratio provides useful information to investors and aligns more closely to how management measures the underwriting performance of the business.

 The investment portfolio consists of assets contributed by Tiptree, cash generated from operations, and from insurance premiums written. The investment portfolio of our regulated insurance
 companies, captive reinsurance company and warranty business are subject to different regulatory considerations, including with respect to types of assets, concentration limits, affiliate transactions
 and the use of leverage. Our investment strategy is designed to achieve attractive risk-adjusted returns across select asset classes, sectors and geographies while maintaining adequate liquidity to
 meet our claims payment obligations. 
In managing our investment portfolio we analyze net investments and net portfolio income, which are non-GAAP measures. Our presentation of net investments equals total investments plus cash
 and cash equivalents minus asset based financing of investments. Our presentation of net portfolio income equals net investment income plus realized and unrealized gains and losses and minus
 interest expense associated with asset based financing of investments. Net investments and net portfolio income are used to calculate average annualized yield, which management uses to analyze
 the profitability of our investment portfolio. Management believes this information is useful since it allows investors to evaluate the performance of our investment portfolio based on the capital at
 risk and on a non-consolidated basis. Our calculation of net investments and net portfolio income may differ from similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Net investments
 and net portfolio income are not measures of financial performance or liquidity under GAAP and should not be considered a substitute for total investments or net investment income.

 NON-GAAP RECONCILIATIONS - ASSET MANAGEMENT
 The Company earns revenues from CLOs under management, whether consolidated or deconsolidated, which include fees earned for managing the CLOs, distributions received from the Company’s
 holdings of subordinated notes issued by the CLOs and realized and unrealized gains and losses from the Company’s holdings of subordinated notes. The revenue associated with the management
 fees and distributions earned and gains and losses on the subordinated notes attributable to the consolidated CLOs are reported as “net income (loss) attributable to the consolidated CLOs” in the
 Company’s financial statements. The table below shows the Company’s share of the results attributable to the CLOs, which were consolidated, on a deconsolidated basis. This presentation is a non-
 GAAP measure. Management believes this information is helpful for period-over-period comparative purposes as certain of our CLOs were consolidated for only some of the periods presented below.
 In addition, the Non-GAAP presentation allows investors the ability to calculate management fees as a percent of AUM, a common measure used by investors to evaluate asset managers, and which
 is one of the performance measures upon which management is compensated. While consolidation versus deconsolidation impacts the presentation of revenues, it does not impact expenses or pre-
 tax income.

 NON-GAAP RECONCILIATIONS - SENIOR LIVING
 In addition to Adjusted EBITDA, we also evaluate performance of our senior living segment based on net operating income (“NOI”), which is a non-GAAP measure. NOI is a common non-GAAP measure
 in the real estate industry used to evaluate property level operations. We consider NOI an important supplemental measure to evaluate the operating performance of our senior living segment because
 it allows investors, analysts and our management to assess our unlevered property-level operating results and to compare our operating results between periods and to the operating results of other
 senior living companies on a consistent basis. It is also the basis upon which the management fees paid to the operators of our Managed Properties are calculated, and is a significant component of
 the compensation paid to Care’s management team. We define NOI as rental and related revenue less property operating expense. Property operating expenses and resident fees and services are
 not relevant to Triple Net Lease Properties since we do not manage the underlying operations and substantially all expenses are passed through to the tenant. Our calculation of NOI may differ from
 similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. NOI is not a measure of financial performance or liquidity under GAAP and should not be considered a substitute for pre-tax
 income.
 (1) NOI Margin % is the relationship between Segment NOI and rental and related revenue.

NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Tiptree Financial Inc. (NASDAQ:TIPT) (“Tiptree Financial”), a 
      diversified holding company which operates in the insurance and 
      insurance services, specialty finance, asset management and real estate 
      industries, today announced its financial results for the quarter ended 
      March 31, 2016. This release reports both the results of Tiptree 
      Operating Company, LLC (“Tiptree” or the “Company”) and the results 
      available to Tiptree Financial’s Class A stockholders.
    


First Quarter 2016 Highlights



        Fortegra Financial Corporation (“Fortegra”) contributed $9.0 million 
        in pre-tax earnings to consolidated results for the three months ended

        Raised $22 million in proceeds through the sale of our tax exempt 
        portfolio in the quarter and Star Asia investment in early April, 
        available to redeploy into our core businesses.
      


First Quarter 2016 Financial Overview


Consolidated Results


      The Company had net income before taxes from continuing operations of 
      $5.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016, which was an 
      increase of $10.8 million from the three months ended March 31, 2015. 
      The key drivers of pretax results from continuing operations were 
      improved revenues and investment income from our insurance and insurance 
      services segment, increased rental income in our senior housing real 
      estate operations, and unrealized gains on principal investments 
      partially offset by increased expenses in specialty finance and higher 
      corporate expenses associated with our effort to improve our controls 
      and financial reporting infrastructure.
    

      For the three months ended March 31, 2016, the Company reported revenues 
      of $131.8 million, an increase of $42.7 million from the three months 
      ended March 31, 2015. The primary drivers of the increase in revenues 
      were period-over-period improvements in earned premiums, service and 
      administrative fees and investment income in our insurance and insurance 
      services segment, the acquisition of Reliance in specialty finance and 
      of senior housing properties at Care, and improvement in the performance 
      of our principal investments.
    

      For the three months ended March 31, 2016, the Company had expenses of 
      $127.9 million, an increase of $33.3 million from the three months ended 
      March 31, 2015. The primary drivers of the increase in expenses were 
      commission expenses in insurance and insurance services as a result of 
      the growth in written premiums, higher payroll and commission expense 
      primarily related to the addition of Reliance volume and an increase in 
      headcount in specialty finance, increased operating expenses and 
      depreciation and amortization associated with our increased investments 
      in our real estate segment and increases in corporate payroll and 
      professional expenses to improve our reporting and controls 
      infrastructure.
    

      For the three months ended March 31, 2016, the Company reported Adjusted 
      EBITDA from continuing operations of $15.3 million, an increase of $10.6 
      million from the three months ended March 31, 2015. The key drivers of 
      the change in Adjusted EBITDA were the same as those which impacted our 
      pretax income from continuing operations.
    

      The Company reported total Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended 
      March 31, 2016 of $15.3 million, an increase of $2.4 million from the 
      three months ended March 31, 2015. The primary drivers of the increase 
      were the same factors that impacted Adjusted EBITDA from continuing 
      operations, partially offset by the loss of income from discontinued 
      operations from 2015.
    

      Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides a supplementary metric 
      to enhance investors’ understanding of the on-going earnings potential 
      of the Company’s businesses and an indication of the Company’s ability 
      to generate additional funds for re-investment in the combined 
      businesses. Because it is a Non-GAAP measure, it should be reviewed in 
      conjunction with the Company’s GAAP results. See “Non-GAAP Financial 
      Measures - EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA” below for further information 
      relating to the Company’s Adjusted EBITDA measure, including a 
      reconciliation to GAAP net income.
    

Segment Results


Insurance and Insurance Services segment


      The Company’s insurance and insurance services segment is comprised of 
      its wholly-owned Fortegra subsidiary, which was acquired in December 
      2014. The acquisition of Fortegra resulted in purchase price accounting 
      adjustments in our insurance and insurance services segment giving 
      effect to the push-down accounting treatment of the acquisition. These 
      adjustments include setting deferred cost assets to a fair value of 
      zero, modifying deferred revenue liabilities to their respective fair 
      values, and recording a substantial intangible asset representing the 
      value of the business acquired (“VOBA”). The application of push-down 
      accounting creates a modest impact to net income, but significantly 
      impacts individual assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. Due to 
      acquisition accounting, the line items through which revenue and 
      expenses relate to acquired contracts are recognized in a single line 
      item, depreciation and amortization, and are different than newly 
      originated contracts. To allow for better period-over-period comparison 
      of operations, we eliminated the effects of purchase accounting ("As 
      Adjusted"). The Company believes that As Adjusted information provides 
      useful supplemental information to investors, but should be reviewed in 
      conjunction with their nearest GAAP equivalent. See “Non-GAAP Financial 
      Measures - Fortegra” below for further information, including a 
      reconciliation from GAAP results to As Adjusted results.
    

      Insurance and insurance services segment pre-tax income was $9.0 million 
      in the three months ended March 31, 2016, an increase of $5.0 million or 
      123.5% over the prior year period operating results. The primary drivers 
      of the improvement in period-over-period results was a reduction in 
      total operating expenses of $8.2 million, primarily in depreciation and 
      amortization expenses associated with the VOBA, partially offset by a 
      reductions in net revenues of $3.2 million driven by competition in the 
      warranty segment.
    

      As Adjusted pre-tax income was $8.5 million for the three months ended 
      March 31, 2016, an increase of $5.0 million or 141.8%. The primary 
      drivers of the period-over-period improvement include an increase in net 
      revenues of $4.0 million driven by improvements in credit protection 
      investment income, earned premiums and service fees. As Adjusted 
      operating expenses were down $1.0 million as a result of cost actions 
      taken throughout 2015 to reduce headcount and professional fees.
    

      For insurance and insurance services, the main components of revenue are 
      service and administrative fees, ceding commissions and earned premiums, 
      net. Total revenues were $89.3 million for the three months ended March 
      31, 2016, up $16.9 million, or 23.4% over the prior year period. The 
      increase was primarily driven by an increase in earned premiums of $7.3 
      million, or 19.4%, and increase of $8.4 million, or 38.2%, in service 
      and administrative fees, and an increase of $2.2 million in investment 
      income, all of which were slightly offset by a decrease of $5.4 million 
      in period-over-period impacts of purchase accounting.
    

      As Adjusted net revenues were $30.7 million for the three months ended 
      March 31, 2016, up $4.0 million or 14.9% from the comparable 2015 
      period. The increase was primarily driven by improvements in the credit 
      protection and specialty products, as reduced claim activity and 
      investment income on float drove the year-over-year favorability. Those 
      improvements were dampened slightly by a reduction in period-over-period 
      As Adjusted net revenues for cell phone warranty contracts as 
      competitive pressures remain.
    

      Operating expenses in the insurance and insurance services segment are 
      composed of payroll and employee commissions, interest expense, 
      professional fees, depreciation and amortization expenses and other 
      expenses. Segment operating expenses in the three months ended March 31, 
      2016 were $23.6 million, a decrease of $8.2 million or 25.8% as compared 
      to the previous year period costs. The primary driver of the 
      period-over-period decrease was attributable to lower depreciation and 
      amortization expense as a result of the decline in purchase accounting 
      impact from the amortization of the fair value attributed to the 
      insurance policies and contracts acquired, which was $1.5 million for 
      the three months ended March 31, 2016 versus $9.4 million in the 
      comparable 2015 period. As Adjusted operating expenses of $22.2 million 
      were down period-over-period as a result of continued cost reduction 
      efforts.
    

      Insurance and insurance services segment adjusted EBITDA was $12.0 
      million for the three months ended March 31, 2016 an increase of $3.8 
      million for the same period year-over-year. The key drivers of Adjusted 
      EBITDA growth was higher credit insurance and specialty products 
      revenues and flat operating expenses, adjusted for the impact of 
      purchase accounting effects, partially offset by lower warranty revenues 
      driven by competition in the cell phone warranty business. See “Non-GAAP 
      Financial Measures - EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA” below for a 
      reconciliation to GAAP net income.
    

Specialty Finance segment


      Specialty finance segment pre-tax loss was $1.0 million for three months 
      ended March 31, 2016, compared with pre-tax income of $0.4 million for 
      the same period in 2015. The key driver of the decrease was higher 
      expense growth relative to volume growth, caused by investment in 
      marketing expenses and costs of additional sales personnel. Growth in 
      volume tends to lag the hiring of new loan officers as the full ramp up 
      of productivity takes four to six months.
    

      Segment revenues were $16.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 
      2016, compared with $6.3 million for the comparable 2015 period, an 
      increase of $10.3 million or 164.8%. Segment expenses were $17.5 million 
      in the three months ended March 31, 2016, compared with $5.8 million in 
      the comparable 2015 period, an increase of $11.7 million or 201.5%. 
      Higher expenses more than offset higher revenues, resulting in declining 
      profitability year-over-year. Primarily drivers include unfavorable 
      market conditions which dampened organic origination growth excluding 
      the impact of the Reliance acquisition, increasing payroll expenses as 
      the businesses expand headcount to produce future originations, and 
      increased professional expenses for audit and internal control over 
      financial reporting.
    

      Specialty finance segment Adjusted EBITDA was a loss of $0.7 million for 
      the three months ended March 31, 2016 compared to income of $0.6 million 
      in the prior year period. The decline in Adjusted EBITDA was driven by 
      the increased expenses, which more than offset increases in volume and 
      revenue from the Reliance acquisition. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
      - EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA” below for further information relating to 
      the Company’s adjusted EBITDA measure, including a reconciliation to 
      GAAP net income.
    

Real Estate segment


      Care had a pre-tax loss of $3.9 million for three months ended March 31, 
      2016, compared with pre-tax loss of $4.2 million for the same period in 
      2015. In February and March of 2015, Care made significant investments 
      in 11 senior housing properties. The increase in the number of 
      properties in the first quarter of 2016 and 2015 generated higher rental 
      and other income in the 2016 period compared with the comparable 2015 
      period, however the Company also incurred additional depreciation, 
      amortization and interest expenses as a consequence of the growth in 
      Care’s property portfolio.
    

      Care’s segment NOI was $4.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 
      2016, compared with $3.1 million in the prior year period, an increase 
      of $1.8 million or 56.7%, primarily as a result of an increase in rental 
      revenue partially offset by increased property operating expenses.
    

      Care had Adjusted EBITDA of $2.1 million for the three months ended 
      March 31, 2016, compared to $0.6 million in the three months ended March 
      31, 2015 with the drivers being the same as mentioned above for pre-tax 
      income. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures - EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA” 
      below for a reconciliation to GAAP net income.
    

Asset Management


      Pre-tax net income for the asset management segment was $1.7 million for 
      three months ended March 31, 2016, compared with pre-tax net income of 
      $1.9 million for the prior year period, a decrease of $0.2 million. The 
      key drivers of decline were a reduction in management fees by $0.2 
      million, offset by an increase an increase in other income of $0.3 
      million, and further reduced by an increase of payroll and employee 
      commissions of $0.4 million. The reduction in management fees was driven 
      by a combination of AUM declines in our older CLOs which are past their 
      reinvestment periods and lower fees as described below. The other income 
      was a gain on extinguishment of an obligation to share future management 
      fees for an amount that was significantly below its carrying value.
    

      Asset management segment adjusted EBITDA was $1.7 million for 2016 
      compared to $1.9 million in the prior year. The decline was driven by 
      the same factors discussed above. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures - 
      EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA” below for a reconciliation to GAAP net 
      income.
    

Net Income attributable to CLOs managed by the Company


      Including the net income from our deconsolidated CLOs, pre-tax income 
      from the Company’s CLO business was $2.8 million for the three months 
      ended March 31, 2016, compared with pre-tax income of $0.7 million in 
      2015. The primary driver of the year-over-year increase of $2.1 million 
      was lower realized and unrealized losses incurred on the Company’s 
      holdings of subordinated notes which was only partially offset by 
      reduced distributions from the subordinated notes. The lower management 
      fees were due to the runoff of Telos 1 and Telos 2, which are past their 
      reinvestment period, plus the impact of lower fees on later CLOs. The 
      lower distributions from the subordinated notes in 2016 compared to the 
      prior year is primarily due to our sales of CLO subordinated notes 
      during the second quarter of 2015. The realized and unrealized losses in 
      the three months ended March 31, 2016 and March 31, 2015 were due to the 
      mark-to-market write-down in our retained CLO subordinated note holdings.
    

      See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures - CLO Net Income” below for a 
      reconciliation to GAAP net income.
    

Corporate and Other


      The Company’s corporate and other segment incorporates revenues from the 
      Company’s investments in CLOs and tax exempt securities, income from the 
      Company’s credit investment portfolio and net gains or losses from the 
      Company’s corporate finance activity, including the interest rate and 
      credit derivative risk mitigation transactions. Segment expenses include 
      interest expense on the Fortress credit facility and head office payroll 
      and other expenses.
    

      Pre-tax loss from the corporate and other segment for the three months 
      ended March 31, 2016 was $0.8 million compared to $8.0 million in the 
      prior year period. The primary drivers of this difference is the result 
      of a pre-tax gain of $2.8 million in our credit investments, consisting 
      primarily of interest income from our Telos 7 warehouse and our credit 
      opportunities fund, which were not formed in the prior year period, as 
      well as a $5.8 million unrealized gains on investments compared with net 
      unrealized losses of $0.7 million in the prior year period, offset by 
      increased corporate payroll and other expenses as the Company expanded 
      its staff and other professional support as a result of its efforts to 
      improve reporting and controls infrastructure.

      This release contains “forward-looking statements” which involve risks, 
      uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond the Company’s 
      control, which may cause actual results, performance, or achievements to 
      differ materially from anticipated results, performance, or 
      achievements. All statements contained in this release that are not 
      clearly historical in nature are forward-looking, and the words 
      “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “may,” “might,” 
      “plan,” “project,” “should,” “target,” “will,” or similar expressions 
      are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Such 
      forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements 
      about the Company’s plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. The 
      forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and 
      are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors, many of which are 
      beyond our control, are difficult to predict and could cause actual 
      results to differ materially from those expressed or forecast in the 
      forward-looking statements. Our actual results could differ materially 
      from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result 
      of various factors, including, but not limited to those described in the

      uncertainties, you should not place undue reliance on these 
      forward-looking statements. Except as required by the federal securities

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Non-GAAP Financial Measures - EBITDA and 
      Adjusted EBITDA


      Management uses EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, which are non-GAAP financial 
      measures. The Company believes that use of these financial measures on a 
      consolidated basis and for each segment provide supplemental information 
      useful to investors as it is frequently used by the financial community 
      to analyze performance period to period, to analyze a company’s ability 
      to service its debt and to facilitate comparison among companies. The 
      Company believes segment EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provides additional 
      supplemental information to compare results among our segments. Adjusted 
      EBITDA is also used in determining incentive compensation for the 
      Company’s executive officers. These measures are not a measurement of 
      financial performance or liquidity under GAAP and should not be 
      considered as an alternative or substitute for net income. The Company’s 
      presentation of these measures may differ from similarly titled non-GAAP 
      financial measures used by other companies. The Company defines EBITDA 
      as GAAP net income of the Company adjusted to add consolidated interest 
      expense, consolidated income taxes and consolidated depreciation and 
      amortization expense as presented in its financial statements and 
      Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA adjusted to (i) subtract interest expense on 
      asset-specific debt incurred in the ordinary course of its subsidiaries’ 
      business operations, (ii) adjust for the effect of purchase accounting, 
      (iii) add back significant acquisition related costs, (iv) adjust for 
      significant relocation costs and (v) any significant one-time expenses.

Notes





          (1)
        

           
        

          The consolidated non-corporate and non-acquisition related interest 
          expense is subtracted from EBITDA to arrive at Adjusted EBITDA. This 
          includes interest expense associated with asset-specific debt at 
          subsidiaries in the insurance and insurance services, specialty 
          finance, real estate and corporate and other segments.
        







           
        



          (2)
        



          Following the purchase accounting adjustments, current period 
          expenses associated with deferred costs were more favorably stated 
          by $4.4 million and current period income associated with deferred 
          revenues were less favorably stated by $2.4 million. Thus, the 
          purchase accounting effect related to Fortegra, increased EBITDA in 
          the first quarter of 2016 by $2.0 million above what the historical 
          basis of accounting would have generated. The impact of this 
          purchase accounting adjustments have been reversed to reflect an 
          adjusted EBITDA without such purchase accounting effect.
        







           
        



          (3)
        



          For Care, Adjusted EBITDA excludes the impact of the change of fair 
          value of interest rate swaps hedging the debt at the property level 
          to conform to our updated interest rate hedging policy.
        







           
        



          (4)
        



          For the first quarter of 2016, $0.4 million of acquisition related 
          costs represents costs in connection with Care’s acquisition of two 
          properties which included taxes, legal costs and other expenses.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures - Fortegra


      The following table presents our insurance and insurance services 
      segment results on a GAAP basis and an As Adjusted basis (a non GAAP 
      measure which excludes the effects of purchase price accounting which 
      management believes provides for better period-over-period comparison of 
      the underlying operating performance of the business and aligns more 
      closely with the basis upon which management performance is 
      measured). Due to acquisition accounting, the line items through which 
      revenue and expenses relate to acquired contracts are recognized in a 
      single line item, depreciation and amortization, and are different than 
      newly originated contracts. To allow for better period-over-period 
      comparison of operations, we eliminated the effects of purchase 
      accounting. The Company believes that As Adjusted information provides

Non-GAAP Financial Measures - Net revenues


      For insurance and insurance services, Net revenues, which is a non-GAAP 
      financial measure, is shown as total revenue less commissions paid to 
      brokers, member benefit claims and net loss and loss adjustment 
      expenses. Year over year comparisons of total revenues are often 
      impacted by clients’ choice as to whether to retain risk. We use net 
      revenues as another means of understanding product contributions to our 
      results and provides a comparison of period-over-period risk retained by 
      the Company. Net revenues also adds supplemental information for 
      investors to understand profitability of various products after 
      reinsurance payments, claims and losses.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures - NOI


      We evaluate performance of our real estate segment based on net 
      operating income (“NOI”). We consider NOI as an important supplemental 
      measure used to evaluate the operating performance of our real estate 
      segment because it allows investors, analysts and our management to 
      assess our unleveraged property-level operating results and to compare 
      our operating results between periods and to the operating results of 
      other real estate companies on a consistent basis. In addition, NOI is 
      the basis upon which our partners in the Managed Properties are 
      compensated. We define NOI as total revenue less property operating 
      expense. Property operating expenses and resident fees and services are 
      not relevant to Care’s Triple Net Lease Properties since Care does not 
      manage the underlying operations and substantially all expenses are 
      passed through to the tenant. Our calculation of NOI may differ from 
      similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. 
      NOI is not a measure of financial performance or liquidity under GAAP 
      and should not be considered a substitute for pre-tax income. The 
      following tables present revenues and expenses, which include amounts 
      attributable to non-controlling interests, by property type in our real 
      estate segment for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, 
      respectively.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures - CLO Net Income


      The Company deconsolidated the results of Telos 1, Telos 2, Telos 3 and 
      Telos 4 for the period that we did not own the subordinated notes for 
      the three months ended March 31, 2016 but not for the prior year period. 
      The table below shows the results attributable to the CLOs both on a 
      consolidated basis and an unconsolidated basis, which is a non-GAAP 
      measure, for the three months ended March 31, 2016. Management believes 
      is helpful to investors for year-over-year comparative purposes, given 
      that Telos 2 and Telos 4 were not deconsolidated until Q2 2015 when we 
      sold our retained interests in each CLO.

Bar Supplies
All of the tools and supplies that professional bartenders need



        Bar supplies are an important part of our product offering at foodservicedirect. Finding quality products in this segment can be tricky, as many manufacturers of bar supplies are smaller and do not produce other food service items.

Dining Room Supplies
Make your dining room perfect with our huge selection of tabletop and buffet items



        Dining room supplies have been part of the foodservicedirect product offering for over 15 years. We have cultivated great relationships with premier manufacturers such as Oneida and Libbey glassware. Our goal is to give the independent operator the largest possible selection of name brand items at amazingly competitive prices. Many food service suppliers offered dining room supplies only as an add-on, however, at foodservicedirect, we stock many thousands of these items and they have always been at the core of our offering.

All statements contained in this release that are not clearly historical in nature are forward-looking, and the words "anticipate," "believe," "estimate," "expect," "intend," "may," "might," "plan," "project," "should," "target," "will," or similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements about the Company's plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. The forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, are difficult to predict and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or forecast in the forward-looking statements. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including, but not limited to those described in the section entitled "Risk Factors" in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K, and as described in the Company's other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures      (Unaudited, in thousands)             Non-GAAP Financial Measures - EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA   Management uses EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, which are non-GAAP financial measures. The Company believes that use of these financial measures on a consolidated basis and for each segment provide supplemental information useful to investors as it is frequently used by the financial community to analyze performance period to period, to analyze a company's ability to service its debt and to facilitate comparison among companies. The Company believes segment EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provides additional supplemental information to compare results among our segments. Adjusted EBITDA is also used in determining incentive compensation for the Company's executive officers. These measures are not a measurement of financial performance or liquidity under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative or substitute for net income. The Company's presentation of these measures may differ from similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. The Company defines EBITDA as GAAP net income of the Company adjusted to add consolidated interest expense, consolidated income taxes and consolidated depreciation and amortization expense as presented in its financial statements and Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA adjusted to (i) subtract interest expense on asset-specific debt incurred in the ordinary course of its subsidiaries' business operations, (ii) adjust for the effect of purchase accounting, (iii) add back significant acquisition related costs, (iv) adjust for significant relocation costs and (v) any significant one-time expenses.            Reconciliation from the Company's GAAP net income to Non-GAAP financial measures - EBITDA and Adjusted  EBITDA (Unaudited)     ($ in thousands)                Three months ended  March 31,             2016           2015     Net income available to Class A common stockholders         $   5,555         $   (979   )     Add: net income attributable to non-controlling interests         1,859         (1,040   )     Less: net income from discontinued operations               —               2,345         (Loss) income from Continuing Operations of the Company         $   7,414         $   (4,364   )     Consolidated interest expense         6,480         5,129       Consolidated income taxes         (2,439   )       (1,496   )     Consolidated depreciation and amortization expense               8,377               15,464         EBITDA from Continuing Operations         $   19,832         $   14,733       Consolidated non-corporate and non-acquisition related interest expense (1)         (4,278   )       (1,841   )     Effects of purchase accounting (2)         (2,030   )       (9,483   )     Non-cash fair value adjustments (3)         1,416         —       Significant acquisition expenses (4)               383               1,349         Subtotal Adjusted EBITDA from Continuing Operations of the Company               $   15,323               $   4,758                             Income from Discontinued Operations of the Company         $   —         $   2,345       Consolidated interest expense         —         2,654       Consolidated income taxes         —         2,742       Consolidated depreciation and amortization expense               —               457         EBITDA from Discontinued Operations               $   —               $   8,198         Subtotal Adjusted EBITDA from Discontinued Operations of the Company               $   —               $   8,198                                           Total Adjusted EBITDA of the Company               $   15,323               $   12,956                                           Notes      (1)       The consolidated non-corporate and non-acquisition related interest expense is subtracted from EBITDA to arrive at Adjusted EBITDA. This includes interest expense associated with asset-specific debt at subsidiaries in the insurance and insurance services, specialty finance, real estate and corporate and other segments.               (2)     Following the purchase accounting adjustments, current period expenses associated with deferred costs were more favorably stated by $4.4 million and current period income associated with deferred revenues were less favorably stated by $2.4 million. Thus, the purchase accounting effect related to Fortegra, increased EBITDA in the first quarter of 2016 by $2.0 million above what the historical basis of accounting would have generated. The impact of this purchase accounting adjustments have been reversed to reflect an adjusted EBITDA without such purchase accounting effect.               (3)     For Care, Adjusted EBITDA excludes the impact of the change of fair value of interest rate swaps hedging the debt at the property level to conform to our updated interest rate hedging policy.               (4)     For the first quarter of 2016, $0.4 million of acquisition related costs represents costs in connection with Care's acquisition of two properties which included taxes, legal costs and other expenses.                Segment EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations - Three Months Ended March 31, 2016 and March 31, 2015     ($ in thousands)       Segment EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA - Three Months Ended March 31, 2016 and March 31, 2015          Insurance and insurance services       Specialty finance       Real estate       Asset management        Corporate and other       Totals          Three Months Ended March 31,      Three Months Ended March 31,      Three Months Ended March 31,      Three Months Ended March 31,      Three Months Ended March 31,      Three Months Ended March 31,         2016       2015     2016       2015     2016       2015     2016       2015     2016       2015     2016       2015     Pre-tax income/(loss)     $   8,997         $   4,026       $   (983   )       $   435       $   (3,859   )       $   (4,181   )     $   1,660         $   1,874       $   (840   )       $   (8,014   )     $   4,975         $   (5,860   )      Add back:                                                     Interest expense     1,155       1,739       1,185       511       1,854       1,330       —       —       2,286       1,549       6,480       5,129       Depreciation and amortization expenses     3,983           11,954         202           122         4,130           3,388         —           —         62           —         8,377           15,464         Segment EBITDA     $   14,135       $   17,719       $   404       $   1,068       $   2,125       $   537       $   1,660       $   1,874       $   1,508       $   (6,465   )     $   19,832       $   14,733                                                              EBITDA adjustments:                                                     Asset-specific debt interest     (99   )     —       (1,134   )     (511   )     (1,854   )     (1,330   )     —       —       (1,191   )     —       (4,278   )     (1,841   )     Effects of purchase accounting     (2,030   )     (9,483   )     —       —       —       —       —       —       —       —       (2,030   )     (9,483   )     Non-cash fair value adjustments     —       —       —       —       1,416       —       —       —       —       —       1,416       —       Significant acquisition expenses     —           —         —           —         383           1,349         —           —         —           —         383           1,349         Segment Adjusted EBITDA     $   12,006           $   8,236         $   (730   )       $   557         $   2,070           $   556         $   1,660           $   1,874         $   317           $   (6,465   )     $   15,323           $   4,758                                                                                                                 Non-GAAP Financial Measures - Fortegra   The following table presents our insurance and insurance services segment results on a GAAP basis and an As Adjusted basis (a non GAAP measure which excludes the effects of purchase price accounting which management believes provides for better period-over-period comparison of the underlying operating performance of the business and aligns more closely with the basis upon which management performance is measured). Due to acquisition accounting, the line items through which revenue and expenses relate to acquired contracts are recognized in a single line item, depreciation and amortization, and are different than newly originated contracts. To allow for better period-over-period comparison of operations, we eliminated the effects of purchase accounting. The Company believes that As Adjusted information provides useful supplemental information to investors, but should be reviewed in conjunction with their nearest GAAP equivalent. Investors should not consider these Non-GAAP financial measures as a substitute for the financial information that Fortegra reports in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These Non-GAAP financial measures reflect subjective determinations by Fortegra management, and may differ from similarly titled Non-GAAP financial measures presented by other companies.

Year over year comparisons of total revenues are often impacted by clients' choice as to whether to retain risk. We use net revenues as another means of understanding product contributions to our results and provides a comparison of period-over-period risk retained by the Company. Net revenues also adds supplemental information for investors to understand profitability of various products after reinsurance payments, claims and losses.            Reconciliation from GAAP Total revenue to Non-GAAP financial measure - Net revenues (Unaudited)           ($ in thousands)       Credit Protection       Warranty       Specialty Products       Services and Other  (1)        Insurance Total          Three Months Ended March 31,      Three Months Ended March 31,      Three Months Ended March 31,      Three Months Ended March 31,      Three Months Ended March 31,         2016       2015     2016       2015     2016       2015     2016       2015     2016       2015      Income:                                                       Earned premiums     $   29,294       $   27,700       $   9,149       $   6,939       $   6,172       $   2,714       $   —       $   —       $   44,615       $   37,353     Service and administrative fees     11,438       5,480       15,678       19,011       3,147       896       2,243       2,690       32,506       28,077     Ceding commissions     10,893       11,529       1       10       —       —       —       —       10,894       11,539     Interest income  (2)     2,955       707       —       —       —       —       465       518       3,420       1,225     Other income     147           134         93           1,777         30           26         (6   )       —         264           1,937     Total revenue     54,727       45,550       24,921       27,737       9,349       3,636       2,702       3,208       91,699       80,131                                                    Income Adjustments:                                             Net losses and member benefit claims     $   7,228       $   6,950       $   10,510       $   11,114       $   5,953       $   1,909       $   7       $   56       $   23,698       $   20,029     Commissions     28,559           24,162         7,628           8,825         1,026           439         88           (44   )     37,301           33,382     Total income adjustments     35,787       31,112       18,138       19,939       6,979       2,348       95       12       60,999       53,411                                                                               As Adjusted net revenues     $   18,940           $   14,438         $   6,783           $   7,798         $   2,370           $   1,288         $   2,607           $   3,196         $   30,700           $   26,720                                                   (1) Services and Other include Consecta, Financial Services, Insurance Services, ImageWorks, VOBA and Other     (2) Includes net realized and unrealized gains (losses) on investments             Non-GAAP Financial Measures - NOI   We evaluate performance of our real estate segment based on net operating income ("NOI"). We consider NOI as an important supplemental measure used to evaluate the operating performance of our real estate segment because it allows investors, analysts and our management to assess our unleveraged property-level operating results and to compare our operating results between periods and to the operating results of other real estate companies on a consistent basis. In addition, NOI is the basis upon which our partners in the Managed Properties are compensated. We define NOI as total revenue less property operating expense. Property operating expenses and resident fees and services are not relevant to Care's Triple Net Lease Properties since Care does not manage the underlying operations and substantially all expenses are passed through to the tenant. Our calculation of NOI may differ from similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. NOI is not a measure of financial performance or liquidity under GAAP and should not be considered a substitute for pre-tax income. The following tables present revenues and expenses, which include amounts attributable to non-controlling interests, by property type in our real estate segment for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.            Reconciliation of NOI to Pre-tax Income                 Three months ended March 31, 2016       Three months ended March 31, 2015     ($ in thousands)      Triple Net Lease Operations        Managed Properties       Consolidated      Triple Net Lease Operations        Managed Properties       Consolidated     Revenues                             Resident fees and services     $   —       $   882       $   882       $   —       $   436       $   436       Rental revenue     $   1,844       10,880       12,724       $   1,058       8,294       9,352       Less: Property operating expenses     —         8,705         8,705         —         6,661         6,661         Segment NOI     $   1,844         $   3,057         $   4,901         $   1,058         $   2,069         $   3,127                                       Other income             $   284               $   (365   )                                   Less: Expenses                             Interest expense             1,854               1,330       Payroll and employee commissions             658               593       Depreciation and amortization             4,130               3,388       Other expenses             2,402                 1,632         Pre-tax income (loss)             $   (3,859   )             $   (4,181   )                                             Non-GAAP Financial Measures - CLO Net Income   The Company deconsolidated the results of Telos 1, Telos 2, Telos 3 and Telos 4 for the period that we did not own the subordinated notes for the three months ended March 31, 2016 but not for the prior year period. The table below shows the results attributable to the CLOs both on a consolidated basis and an unconsolidated basis, which is a non-GAAP measure, for the three months ended March 31, 2016. Management believes is helpful to investors for year-over-year comparative purposes, given that Telos 2 and Telos 4 were not deconsolidated until Q2 2015 when we sold our retained interests in each CLO.               ($ in thousands)     Net Income attributable to CLOs managed by the Company         Three months ended March 31,          2016       2015         Consolidated        Not  consolidated  (1)         Non-GAAP total     Consolidated  (2)         Not  consolidated  (1)         Non-GAAP total     Management fees paid by the CLOs to the Company (3)     $   669       $   1,951       $   2,620       $   1,837       $   984       $   2,821        Distributions from the subordinated notesheld by the Company     2,749       72       2,821       5,657       69       5,726        Realized and unrealized (losses) gains onsubordinated notes held by the Company     (2,313   )     (292   )     (2,605   )     (7,805   )     —         (7,805   )     Net (loss) income attributable to the CLOs     $   1,105         $   1,731         $   2,836         $   (311   )     $   1,053         $   742                                                                           Notes:      (1)       Represents amounts from Telos 1, Telos 2, Telos 3 and Telos 4, which have been deconsolidated for the period that we did not own the subordinated notes.

Total stockholders' equity for the Company was $388.2 million as of March 31, 2016, which comprised total stockholders' equity of $409.7 million adjusted for $18.6 million attributable to non-controlling interest at subsidiaries that are not wholly owned by the Company and net assets of $2.9 million wholly owned by Tiptree Financial Inc.
