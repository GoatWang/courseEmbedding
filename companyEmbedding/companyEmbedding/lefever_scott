"Excellence service "
- Joanne




I bought a pre-owned Lincoln through Northtowne Mazda and Todd Wood at Northtowne Lincoln offered to show me all the gadgets. He spent over an hour, first checking the car, then sitting with me and going over each and every function of the car. His patience will allow me to enjoy my new car so much more.

Northtowne Lincoln responded
Number #1. Thank you so much for your business and Welcome to the Northtowne Family!
Number #2. Thank you so much for spending the time with Todd Wood to let him show you how to enjoy your new vehicle and all it has to offer you. A lot of people are in such a hurry to get out of a Dealership after a purchase and don't spend the time to get to know the vehicle they purchased. This can cause problems when they don't know how to work something and it makes them unhappy with their purchase. The employees at Northtowne are always willing to help. We even help people that did not buy their vehicles from us. Thank you for the review!

Mike was kind, courteous, professional and attentive to the wishes of the customer. Tim was respectful and patient, explaining any question very well. I was never made to feel ignorant or dumb. Respect and kindness is the norm here and I felt really good about decisions I made.

"Phenomenal Service"
- duvall50




I unfortunately had a wheel stolen the day before a holiday weekend. Nick and the rest of the Northtowne team went above and beyond to find me a new wheel and tire in a short amount of time. They also did so for much less than I was quoted at two other Ford dealers in the KC metro.

This is the only dealership we will be taking our cars in for service and I look forward to purchasing a car from them in the future.

Thanks again!

"Amazing Service"
- Houp




Todd is AWESOME!!  This car buying purchase was our greatest experience ever and that is due to the excellent, I mean excellent service that Todd provided.  The whole dealership is friendly, you don't get 50 people asking if they can help you they all know what is going on, where your vehicle is and who's bringing it to you.
From the moment we pulled up, through test drives, decision making, finance dept even the service department it is top notch all the way around.
Todd also has great customer follow up and follow through, he called the next day to make sure we didn't have any questions and we were using all the features that came on the vehicle and then today we received a post card in the mail from Todd.  
If your looking to buy a car, go see Todd you will not be disappointed.

"Joe Black"
- Joe Black







 I discovered Northtown Lincoln via the Internet. The lease on my fFod Fusion was expiring and I was curious as to the Lincoln version. I connected with Paul Reeves and he was very helpful coaching me on the features of the car and in navigating through the ordering and purchase process. I wanted very specific options and color combination and Paul was very accommodating. He was also patient as I weighed the numerous options choices.  I'm very pleased with this entire experience.

I found a vehicle on the internet that caught my attention.  Joseph Acevedo Jr is the salesman that I dealt with.  He was wonderful.  He was very nice and returned my calls and he did everything  to make everything go smoothly and I recommend him to everyone!  I love my car!  Everyone needs to contact Joseph and see what good deal that he can give you!   I even drove over 4 hours away -one way to do business with Joseph .

"An AWESOME experience"
- Drag Racer




.Mike is TOPNOTCH!!  He was friendly, kind, resourceful, respectful and very patient with me.  He found the exact MKZ I wanted - low mileage (5,700 miles) and a 2016!  It was the best deal I've ever had.  I felt no pressure during the negotiations and he spent extra time with me on the car's computer.  I will feel free to call him with any questions I might have in the future.  He did what he said he would do and produced exactly what I wanted.  I LOVE my new MKZ and Mike Williams!!!  You need to keep him!  THANK YOU.

I had a 2011 MKZ and because of the excellent service I received from your dealership I decided to buy a new car from this dealer!

I am also the Director of E-Commerce and oversee all operations related to internet sales. My first task was to streamline our Farfetch operation, and since my arrival in February '16 our year-over-year sales are up over 180% and we continue to outpace our goals for speed of sending and canceled orders. Next, I oversaw the design and development of a new Traffic Los Angeles website that would be the store's first foray into a proprietary e-commerce site. The new shoptrafficla.com launched in October '16 and continues to show steady growth in both sales and unique users. Associate Web DirectorH. LorenzoNovember 2012  –  Februar 2016 (3 Jahre 4 Monate)As Associate Web Director I was responsible for uploading and maintaining the content of shop.hlorenzo.com. My responsibilities included processing product to be photographed, writing product descriptions, curating previews, maintaining web-inventory accuracy and running daily sales reports. I was able to establish a clear and concise tone for the site and ensure a fluid customer experience. I was also the sole operator of our Farfetch outfit. I was responsible for curating the inventory and maintaining its accuracy, processing daily sales, customer service, and quality control.  My tenure saw the drastic decline in unfulfilled orders and a steady growth in sales.

This has been in large part due to Scott's deep understanding of the luxury e-commerce industry & omnichannel retail, openness to suggestion & collaboration, attention to detail, and hard work.

The fact that he runs Farfetch for Traffic seamlessly while also reinvigorating Traffic's social media and e-commerce site shows his efficiency and ability to handle multiple projects at once.

On top of all of this, Scott's genuine appreciation for design and kind demeanor make him a pleasure to work with! I look forward to working with Scott in the future and seeing what he will create.Mehr anzeigenWeniger anzeigenScott's been a pleasure to work with, always helpful and supporting.
