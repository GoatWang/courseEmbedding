What We Sell













Liquidmetal® Technologies has developed highly specialized alloys and a manufacturing process that allow cosmetic (down to 2 Ra, μin), high-strength (231 ksi), precision parts to be injection molded in a single manufacturing step. Liquidmetal alloys provide an economic advantage for parts with cosmetic surfaces, complex shapes with close tolerances, or forged titanium-grade strength.
Millions of Liquidmetal parts have been made for consumer electronics, providing nearly indestructible cases, close fitting chassis, and hinges and clamps that perform reliably even after thousands of cycles. The simplicity of our one-step molding process lends itself to high rate production with remarkable consistency from part to part.
Our business focus is on small precision parts, typically weighing up to 80g. While parts must be designed to eject from a mold, advanced tooling methods such as slides are available to accommodate critical features. A well-designed part can replace an assembly of machined parts and can be made substantially thinner than other conventional metal parts.
Liquidmetal alloys are truly exceptional for a variety of specialized applications. Utilizing this revolutionary process, product development managers and engineers have been able to overcome many manufacturing obstacles. The molding process and a highly unique combination of properties allow “outside the box” thinking relative to traditional metal forming processes when designing parts. 
With the simple objective to overcome rigid manufacturing roadblocks, and improve economic advantage in our customers’ parts, contact us now, to see that now you can.

Quality Assurance













Liquidmetal Technologies is committed to providing the highest quality parts to customers, which means careful attention and regulation of the end-to-end materials and fabrication processes.
As a recent breakthrough in engineered materials technology, bulk metallic glass alloys require extremely high quality standards to ensure reliability and repeatability in part performance. Many of the analysis tools that are used in traditional metallurgy can be used to assess the quality of Liquidmetal processes, but often in ways as unique as the alloy itself.
Liquidmetal Technologies uses a wide variety of tools to track the quality of its products, from initial alloy production to final part performance.




Examples of amorphous and crystalline materials under a high power microscope.
Chemistry: Since the material properties of Liquidmetal alloys are inseparably linked to its glassy structure, the alloy composition, which dictates its glass forming ability, is of crucial importance. Liquidmetal alloys have incredibly precise compositions and extremely low levels of contaminants such as oxygen.
Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC): A technique for studying the heat release associated with material phase transitions, which can be used to extract information about volumetric amorphous content of as-cast parts.
Optical Microscopy: High quality bulk metallic glass parts can be identified by their uniquely featureless surfaces when an ultra-high polished is applied to a specimen.
Mechanical Strength: As-cast mechanical properties can also be used to determine the consistency and reliability of the alloy and processing method.

Finishing













There are multiple finishing options that are available to Liquidmetal® parts.
De-gating
Upon ejection from the mold, Liquidmetal parts are attached to a tree that must be removed. The tree includes the sprue, runner, and gate as excess features. The simplest means of removing this material is to use a water-jet system where the tree is clamped into a fixture and quickly cut, leaving only the parts with a non-cosmetic quality surface where the gate was removed. In some cases, this surface quality may be sufficient for the application; however, if not, the surface will need to be processed further.
CNC Machining
At the Manufacturing Center of Excellence in Rancho Santa Margarita, Liquidmetal Technologies operates a CNC machining center. Liquidmetal alloys are a very hard and strong material; draft angles are required on all surfaces to ensure that the mold can eject the part without causing damage to either the part or the mold. Holes with tolerances in the ±0.008mm (±0.0003”) range can be machined along with grinding operations performed on surfaces and outer diameters that can hold the same tolerance. In some cases, parts will be molded as close to tolerance as possible and cleaned up with minimal stock removal from the part in a secondary operation.
Surface Treatment 




Near optical surface finish featured on two as-molded Liquidmetal parts.
Most customers chose to utilize the as-molded finish of Liquidmetal parts. This allows us to do a minimal amount of post processing on the surface, and leaves the customer with a finish that matches the surface roughness of the mold. If a polished mold is specified, it is typical to see Liquidmetal parts come out of the tool with a surface roughness of 0.025-0.050µm (1-2µin). The best corrosion resistance also occurs with an as-molded product. In some cases, customers may determine that a blasted finish is optimal for aesthetic reasons. A variety of blasting media can be used for this, including Zirconia, Alumina, Silica, etc. This can be discussed further with Liquidmetal engineers.
Other options for part finishes include painting and even PVD (physical vapor deposition).
