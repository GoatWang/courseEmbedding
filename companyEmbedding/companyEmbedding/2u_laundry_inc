What Your MamaTaught You

Having three active teenage boys in the house can really stink things up. When they come home from sports practice, I put a cup of Pine-Sol in laundry with their stinky clothes. It gets rid of all the dirt, sweat and smells. They actually notice how clean their clothes look and smell! If a kid notices, you know it's wonderful!!!

Value Tip #1
                                Don't Pay for Watered Down Cleaner                            

Pine-Sol® Cleaners are concentrated formulas that you can dilute for most jobs. For general cleaning, a 24 oz. bottle gives you 12 gallons of cleaning power! Add water to the formula yourself and save.





Value Tip #2
                                One Cleaner, Many Uses

You can mix Pine-Sol® with water at different strengths for different household needs, unlike a premixed spray. You can tackle any challenge, adjusting your cleaning power each time.





Value Tip #5

This service is absolutely fantastic! They have options for hang dry, dry cleaning or standard wash/dry/fold. Colors are separated , you have detergent & other options for laundry care through an easy online profile, and pricing is very affordable!

Recommend a subscription for sure- averages out for me to less than $5 a load. They pick up and drop off in a quick turnaround and are so responsive for questions.

Re: possible shrinking- I've had a tshirt that shrank slightly but I anticipated/knew this would have happened if I washed and dried it at home! They use lower heat than I normally do at home so my clothes are handled more gently through the wash process. You can see the temps and products online in advance.

We've also used them for blankets that were taken to a bonfire and smoky, and towels from when we gave our dog a bath when he was muddy. They come back spotless & smelling great every time.







Got to try this service out for free through EatWorkPlay Charlotte and I love it! Customer service is very prompt when answering questions (shoutout to Charlie for being so patient with me because I had a lot of questions day one!) 

They let you know what's going on every in every step of the process through text notifications so you always know where your laundry is.

Most general questions you have can be answered through the FAQ section on their website: pickup/drop off times, cleaning preferences, etc. 

They provide the bags for your laundry to go in & return everything nicely washed & folded in the same bag, they couldn't make it any easier! 

Definitely plan to be a regular customer!







This service is awesome!   I can't tell you how happy I am when I come home to folded, clean clothes.  They take great care, and I love the fact that they have hang dry service and dry cleaning.







I absolutely LOVE 2U laundry. They are the best dry cleaning and laundry service in the city. They make it super easy so you never have to worry about taking stuff to the dry cleaner or turning on your washer and dryer. Their customer support is on point too. A huge time saver and I definitely recommend - www.2ulaundry.com







2U Laundry is awesome - I use 2U for dry cleaning and have been very pleased with the results. The sign up process is convenient, and I quickly received a welcome email and welcome package. 

The clothing is picked up and dropped off at the expected times, and I feel comfortable using the service for my nicer/fancier clothing. It's worth the premium pricing for the high-quality service and the time saved.

Highly, highly recommend 2U if you're looking for professional company that can take a task off your list by managing your laundry and/or dry cleaning!







This service shrunk two of my dresses. When I contacted them to help, I received dismissive and contradictory responses. Eventually, I was told that they will be unable to reimburse me or pay for the "cleaning" I received. I was only offered a credit for a future cleaning. Originally, I had been told that they would reimburse me for the dresses since they had been ruined. I would not recommend using this service.







Amazing experience! I used 2U Laundry for dry cleaning that I had piling up over the past few weeks and didn't have time to take in to my local dry cleaning store. Signing up was a breeze, I selected the day I would like to have my clothes picked up and entered pick up information and a credit card number. After I signed up, 2U Laundry sent me a "Welcome Package" within 24 hours that included my laundry and dry cleaning drop off bag and a pastry from Local Loaf. The welcome package also included a note card welcoming me to the 2U Laundry family and explaining the process to me. 

The next morning, as I left for work, I left my bag of dry cleaning on my front stoop. There is also an option to include special pick up and delivery options to better accommodate my schedule. They came between 8-10AM to pick up my clothes. My pick up day was Tuesday and when I came home from work on Thursday night, my clothes were hanging in their bag on my front porch. 

To top it off, the quality of the work was fantastic! The clothes smelled lemon-y fresh (I didn't know this was even an option for dry cleaning), the shirts were pressed perfectly, and (best of all) it required no effort on my part. 

It was a great experience that I can't say enough great things about. Best of all, it's a young company, so they are able to adapt and pivot with feedback to continue to deliver a great product.







I have nothing but great things to say about my experience with 2U Laundry. I've been using them for my dry cleaning for several months and really enjoy the service. The quality is great and the free delivery and 1-day turnaround is an absolute game changer. Not to mention the customer service is top-notch, which is definitely not something you think of when it comes to traditional dry cleaners...

Highly recommend to anybody looking for a dry cleaning / laundry services in CLT. Keep it up guys!







Amazing service!!! I needed a last minute dress cleaned for a weekend trip. They picked it up on Thursday at my door and dropped it off on Friday! They provided fantastic comminication and care towards my last minute and unplanned request. I HIGHLY reccomend using them for your daily and emergency cleaning!!! BEST in CHARLOTTE!!! Thank you! : )







I've been a customer at 2U Laundry for a few months now and have been very pleased with the quality of service. The prices are very fair (comparable with typical mid-tier to high-end cleaner) BUT that price includes pick-up and delivery. I highly recommend 2U Laundry! Keep up the good work guys.

This service shrunk two of my dresses. When I contacted them to help, I received dismissive and contradictory responses. Eventually, I was told that they will be unable to reimburse me or pay for the "cleaning" I received. I was only offered a credit for a future cleaning. Originally, I had been told that they would reimburse me for the dresses since they had been ruined. I would not recommend using this service.

Hi Darden,I am extremely sorry to hear about your experience with our service. We strive to partner with the highest quality facilities and put every vendor we work with through a stringent vetting process to ensure our quality standards are being met. We also have an extremely transparent and straight forward refund / return policy. Any issues brought to our attention within 21 days will be reimbursed for 10 times the original cleaning cost. In your instance, we were informed exactly 58 days after the potential issue could have occurred. We, like many companies, have return / refund policies we need to adhere to. This delay makes it difficult for us to provide our vendors with proof of any damage or inconsistencies. Given the pride we take in our customer's experience we went against the company's policies and offered you $50 in future services for the inconvenience.Again, we are extremely sorry for the trouble you had and wish we would have been informed of the issue sooner so we could have provided a satisfactory solution like we usually do. Thank you for your feedback and we will work diligently to continue to refine and improve on our businesses.Best,Alex

Amazing experience! I used 2U Laundry for dry cleaning that I had piling up over the past few weeks and didn't have time to take in to my local dry cleaning store. Signing up was a breeze, I selected the day I would like to have my clothes picked up and entered pick up information and a credit card number. After I signed up, 2U Laundry sent me a "Welcome Package" within 24 hours that included my laundry and dry cleaning drop off bag and a pastry from Local Loaf. The welcome package also included a note card welcoming me to the 2U Laundry family and explaining the process to me. The next morning, as I left for work, I left my bag of dry cleaning on my front stoop. There is also an option to include special pick up and delivery options to better accommodate my schedule. They came between 8-10AM to pick up my clothes. My pick up day was Tuesday and when I came home from work on Thursday night, my clothes were hanging in their bag on my front porch. To top it off, the quality of the work was fantastic! The clothes smelled lemon-y fresh (I didn't know this was even an option for dry cleaning), the shirts were pressed perfectly, and (best of all) it required no effort on my part. It was a great experience that I can't say enough great things about. Best of all, it's a young company, so they are able to adapt and pivot with feedback to continue to deliver a great product.

I have nothing but great things to say about my experience with 2U Laundry. I've been using them for my dry cleaning for several months and really enjoy the service. The quality is great and the free delivery and 1-day turnaround is an absolute game changer. Not to mention the customer service is top-notch, which is definitely not something you think of when it comes to traditional dry cleaners...Highly recommend to anybody looking for a dry cleaning / laundry services in CLT. Keep it up guys!

I've been a customer at 2U Laundry for a few months now and have been very pleased with the quality of service. The prices are very fair (comparable with typical mid-tier to high-end cleaner) BUT that price includes pick-up and delivery. I highly recommend 2U Laundry! Keep up the good work guys.

This service is absolutely fantastic! They have options for hang dry, dry cleaning or standard wash/dry/fold. Colors are separated , you have detergent & other options for laundry care through an easy online profile, and pricing is very affordable!

Recommend a subscription for sure- averages out for me to less than $5 a load. They pick up and drop off in a quick turnaround and are so responsive for questions.

Re: possible shrinking- I've had a tshirt that shrank slightly but I anticipated/knew this would have happened if I washed and dried it at home! They use lower heat than I normally do at home so my clothes are handled more gently through the wash process. You can see the temps and products online in advance.

We've also used them for blankets that were taken to a bonfire and smoky, and towels from when we gave our dog a bath when he was muddy. They come back spotless & smelling great every time.







Got to try this service out for free through EatWorkPlay Charlotte and I love it! Customer service is very prompt when answering questions (shoutout to Charlie for being so patient with me because I had a lot of questions day one!) 

They let you know what's going on every in every step of the process through text notifications so you always know where your laundry is.

Most general questions you have can be answered through the FAQ section on their website: pickup/drop off times, cleaning preferences, etc. 

They provide the bags for your laundry to go in & return everything nicely washed & folded in the same bag, they couldn't make it any easier! 

Definitely plan to be a regular customer!







This service is awesome!   I can't tell you how happy I am when I come home to folded, clean clothes.  They take great care, and I love the fact that they have hang dry service and dry cleaning.







I absolutely LOVE 2U laundry. They are the best dry cleaning and laundry service in the city. They make it super easy so you never have to worry about taking stuff to the dry cleaner or turning on your washer and dryer. Their customer support is on point too. A huge time saver and I definitely recommend - www.2ulaundry.com







2U Laundry is awesome - I use 2U for dry cleaning and have been very pleased with the results. The sign up process is convenient, and I quickly received a welcome email and welcome package. 

The clothing is picked up and dropped off at the expected times, and I feel comfortable using the service for my nicer/fancier clothing. It's worth the premium pricing for the high-quality service and the time saved.

Highly, highly recommend 2U if you're looking for professional company that can take a task off your list by managing your laundry and/or dry cleaning!







This service shrunk two of my dresses. When I contacted them to help, I received dismissive and contradictory responses. Eventually, I was told that they will be unable to reimburse me or pay for the "cleaning" I received. I was only offered a credit for a future cleaning. Originally, I had been told that they would reimburse me for the dresses since they had been ruined. I would not recommend using this service.







Amazing experience! I used 2U Laundry for dry cleaning that I had piling up over the past few weeks and didn't have time to take in to my local dry cleaning store. Signing up was a breeze, I selected the day I would like to have my clothes picked up and entered pick up information and a credit card number. After I signed up, 2U Laundry sent me a "Welcome Package" within 24 hours that included my laundry and dry cleaning drop off bag and a pastry from Local Loaf. The welcome package also included a note card welcoming me to the 2U Laundry family and explaining the process to me. 

The next morning, as I left for work, I left my bag of dry cleaning on my front stoop. There is also an option to include special pick up and delivery options to better accommodate my schedule. They came between 8-10AM to pick up my clothes. My pick up day was Tuesday and when I came home from work on Thursday night, my clothes were hanging in their bag on my front porch. 

To top it off, the quality of the work was fantastic! The clothes smelled lemon-y fresh (I didn't know this was even an option for dry cleaning), the shirts were pressed perfectly, and (best of all) it required no effort on my part. 

It was a great experience that I can't say enough great things about. Best of all, it's a young company, so they are able to adapt and pivot with feedback to continue to deliver a great product.







I have nothing but great things to say about my experience with 2U Laundry. I've been using them for my dry cleaning for several months and really enjoy the service. The quality is great and the free delivery and 1-day turnaround is an absolute game changer. Not to mention the customer service is top-notch, which is definitely not something you think of when it comes to traditional dry cleaners...

Highly recommend to anybody looking for a dry cleaning / laundry services in CLT. Keep it up guys!







Amazing service!!! I needed a last minute dress cleaned for a weekend trip. They picked it up on Thursday at my door and dropped it off on Friday! They provided fantastic comminication and care towards my last minute and unplanned request. I HIGHLY reccomend using them for your daily and emergency cleaning!!! BEST in CHARLOTTE!!! Thank you! : )







I've been a customer at 2U Laundry for a few months now and have been very pleased with the quality of service. The prices are very fair (comparable with typical mid-tier to high-end cleaner) BUT that price includes pick-up and delivery. I highly recommend 2U Laundry! Keep up the good work guys.

Hi Darden,I am extremely sorry to hear about your experience with our service. We strive to partner with the highest quality facilities and put every vendor we work with through a stringent vetting process to ensure our quality standards are being met. We also have an extremely transparent and straight forward refund / return policy. Any issues brought to our attention within 21 days will be reimbursed for 10 times the original cleaning cost. In your instance, we were informed exactly 58 days after the potential issue could have occurred. We, like many companies, have return / refund policies we need to adhere to. This delay makes it difficult for us to provide our vendors with proof of any damage or inconsistencies. Given the pride we take in our customer's experience we went against the company's policies and offered you $50 in future services for the inconvenience.Again, we are extremely sorry for the trouble you had and wish we would have been informed of the issue sooner so we could have provided a satisfactory solution like we usually do. Thank you for your feedback and we will work diligently to continue to refine and improve on our businesses.Best,Alex

Amazing experience! I used 2U Laundry for dry cleaning that I had piling up over the past few weeks and didn't have time to take in to my local dry cleaning store. Signing up was a breeze, I selected the day I would like to have my clothes picked up and entered pick up information and a credit card number. After I signed up, 2U Laundry sent me a "Welcome Package" within 24 hours that included my laundry and dry cleaning drop off bag and a pastry from Local Loaf. The welcome package also included a note card welcoming me to the 2U Laundry family and explaining the process to me. The next morning, as I left for work, I left my bag of dry cleaning on my front stoop. There is also an option to include special pick up and delivery options to better accommodate my schedule. They came between 8-10AM to pick up my clothes. My pick up day was Tuesday and when I came home from work on Thursday night, my clothes were hanging in their bag on my front porch. To top it off, the quality of the work was fantastic! The clothes smelled lemon-y fresh (I didn't know this was even an option for dry cleaning), the shirts were pressed perfectly, and (best of all) it required no effort on my part. It was a great experience that I can't say enough great things about. Best of all, it's a young company, so they are able to adapt and pivot with feedback to continue to deliver a great product.

I have nothing but great things to say about my experience with 2U Laundry. I've been using them for my dry cleaning for several months and really enjoy the service. The quality is great and the free delivery and 1-day turnaround is an absolute game changer. Not to mention the customer service is top-notch, which is definitely not something you think of when it comes to traditional dry cleaners...Highly recommend to anybody looking for a dry cleaning / laundry services in CLT. Keep it up guys!

I've been a customer at 2U Laundry for a few months now and have been very pleased with the quality of service. The prices are very fair (comparable with typical mid-tier to high-end cleaner) BUT that price includes pick-up and delivery. I highly recommend 2U Laundry! Keep up the good work guys.

What Your MamaTaught You

Having three active teenage boys in the house can really stink things up. When they come home from sports practice, I put a cup of Pine-Sol in laundry with their stinky clothes. It gets rid of all the dirt, sweat and smells. They actually notice how clean their clothes look and smell! If a kid notices, you know it's wonderful!!!

How To Clean Hair Brush
By About a Mom                            Does your hair brush get those little fuzzies at the bottom of the bristles? You don’t have to ever brush your clean hair with a dirty hair brush again. Here’s how to use Pine-Sol to clean your old, dirty, nasty hair brush.

step3



Place the hair brush into the bowl, and allow to soak 2-3 minutes. Use a toothbrush to scrub through the bristles. Continue brushing until clean.





step4



Remove the brush from the bowl and rinse in clean water. Place on a towel to dry.

The Value ofPine-Sol® Cleaners
You already know about the unmatched cleaning power of Pine-Sol® Multi-Surface Cleaners, but you might be surprised to learn that our cleaners are also great for your budget.

Value Tip #1
                                Don't Pay for Watered Down Cleaner                            

Pine-Sol® Cleaners are concentrated formulas that you can dilute for most jobs. For general cleaning, a 24 oz. bottle gives you 12 gallons of cleaning power! Add water to the formula yourself and save.





Value Tip #2
                                One Cleaner, Many Uses                            

You could spend big bucks on different cleaners for your furniture, toilet, floors, counters and appliances. With Pine-Sol® Multi-Surface Cleaner, you only need one cleaner to fight dirt, grime and grease, and deodorize all of these surfaces throughout your home. Easy for you, and easy on your wallet.





Value Tip #3
                                Cleans and Deodorizes                            

No need for air fresheners, scented candles or deodorizing sprays: Pine-Sol® gives you both a great clean and a great smell. It gets your home spotless while leaving a refreshing scent that tells visitors you've been busy.





Value Tip #4
                                Pick the Right Strength for You                            

You can mix Pine-Sol® with water at different strengths for different household needs, unlike a premixed spray. You can tackle any challenge, adjusting your cleaning power each time.





Value Tip #5
                                No Special Tools                            

Pine-Sol® Multi-Surface Cleaner works with everything from rags, mops and brushes to microfiber cloths and paper towels. You don’t need to buy fancy new cleaning utensils or gadgets: you can use what you already have in your home.






Value Tip #6
                                One Time Around                            

With the power of Pine-Sol® Multi-Surface Cleaner on your side, you only have to clean once to get the job done right. No need to go back over your hard work, saving you time and energy.

Wash and Fold Laundry Service
Your Laundry Experts
We call it “wash & fold” (some say “fluff & fold”), but it’s so much more. We take individual care of each of your machine washable laundry items – clothing, delicates, linens, blankets, comforters – you name it!  Whites, colors, and delicates are separately washed and returned to you fresh, clean and neatly folded and hung on hangers.
 
 
Laundry Your Way
When you schedule your first pickup, we’ll ask for your laundry preferences so that your laundry is done the way you like it.  We use premium scented or unscented soaps (your choice), fabric softener (or not!), and handle your clothing and washables gently to keep them looking their best.




Two Steps to Get Started
There’s no need to sort your wash & fold laundry items in advance – we’ll do that for you*.  For your first pickup:

Click here or call to schedule a pickup.
Place your laundry in plastic trash bags or pillow cases and put them on your door step (or in another place that you tell us).

There’s no need to be at home for pickups or deliveries.  We’ll return your wash & fold laundry in our heavy-weight Laundry Care Express bags that you can use for your future pickups.
 
One Pickup – Three Services
In addition to wash & fold laundry, we offer expert dry cleaning and dress shirt laundry -- speed, convenience, and quality.


Gone Today, Back Tomorrow!
Speedy service is standard – pickups scheduled by 9 am, Monday through Friday (except major holidays), will be picked  up the same day and delivered the next service day.**

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
