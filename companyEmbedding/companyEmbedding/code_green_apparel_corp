Recycling Technology

Imagine countless 50-foot high mounds of textile waste waiting to be picked up from busy clothing factories... Endless years of garbage trucks picking up and then dumping all this trash over and over. Not a pretty picture, nor a healthy solution for the landfills that it will end up rotting in.

Now imagine that all these garbage trucks suddenly cease to make their routine visits to these factories - instead, a different kind of truck pulls in and collects all that seemingly worthless waste, hauls it over to a place where that same textile waste is cleaned, scoured, stripped of color and eventually returned to its original form.








It's true, it’s finally happening -- Imagination inspires Transformation.

As the pioneer behind this new process of rethinking textile waste, Code Green Apparel is proudly driving our industry away from landfills, and transforming the apparel industry for good.




Saving Water

Cotton is one of the world's thirstiest crops and most desirable textiles, but it takes hundreds and sometimes thousands of gallons of water to grow enough cotton to manufacture a single shirt or even one pair of jeans.

Our technology of recycling pre-consumer textile waste, significantly reduces the amount of water that is traditionally wasted during the intensive process of growing cotton in the fields. And Code Green Apparel doesn’t just recycle cotton out of those 50-foot high mounds of textile waste... we also breathe new life into polyester and other blends of fabric as well. 




Better Apparel

Once the textile waste has been returned to its original form, it is then handled no differently than any other textile would be treated at an ordinary garment manufacturer. Our recycled apparel looks, feels and performs identically to any non-recycled piece of clothing. The yarns we weave and the fabric we sew are subjected to the same industry standards and the employees of your company won't notice any difference with their fresh green apparel. But there is a difference in that new company uniform of theirs, a big difference...

Because what you wear, matters.

It matters now more than ever, since responsible companies across the globe all share in company-wide sustainability initiatives that hold us all to that same rising standard. These environmental views can now be both supported and worn in the form of better apparel with a conscience -- Code Green Apparel.




The Right Shade of Green

Sustainability: companies are proving that it makes sense to their operations and our environment. Change of this sort within companies is both noble in effort and rewarding for our communities. But executives know all too well that implementing sustainability initiatives may ultimately doom the financial sustainability of their very own business model. In the face of this challenge, going green continues to be a major priority for many companies, but it needs to be, it has to be, the right shade of green.

We not only support the sustainability initiatives of
companies worldwide, we empower your company with
more green, for less of your financial green.

Our Factory Direct Business Model allows our recycled apparel to beat the current cost of your employee uniforms. It's a win-win both financially and environmentally. So let us share with you how we can expand your company's sustainability initiatives, while helping your employees both wear and then share your environmental views.

Paving A Way To Change

There I was parked in the driveway of my home along with my 5-year-old son in the backseat still fastened with his seatbelt on. As I was just about to step out from behind the wheel, my son, Luke, asked me a question that I didn’t have an answer for… A question posed to me some six years ago, that today, now finds me sharing this very letter with you. He simply asked me, "Why not?!?".

Luke and I had just returned from our area's recycling center which featured a shared lesson from Dad as to why we needed to make the effort to deposit our cans, bottles and papers. He got the lesson, so much that as we sat there parked in our driveway, he said that we should be recycling EVERYTHING. I quickly dispelled his notion and said, "Well maybe not everything."... And then this kid so boldly asked, "Why not?!?".

You're absolutely right Luke! At the very least, we sure can... try to.

Having been in the apparel industry for over 30 years, I couldn't help recalling the mind-boggling amounts of waste and filth that my industry had created, and that maybe, just maybe, I could help find a way to bridge the disconnect between our environment and the clothing industry. Now, with the help of a handful of brave visionaries, we have taken a bold first step with Code Green Apparel.



“Here's to the kid in all of us that will
always dare to ask, "Why not?!?"


In witnessing the profound sustainability initiatives launched by countless Fortune 500 companies, I respect how the leadership of these organizations has placed a high value on inspiring their employees to remain engaged in their environmental principles. With the challenge of integrating sustainability programs, measuring their effectiveness and delivering continued value to stakeholders, these global companies are the pioneers that light the trail of responsibility for respecting our planet's future. In the wake of their ceaseless efforts, I am left both awed and inspired.

As your partner, Code Green Apparel's mission is to be a meaningful complement to the impressive suite of sustainability practices already employed at your company. Let us help you both wear and share what you believe in.

George Powell - CEO & President

They are not selling. They are quiet and want to keep it quiet     NEWS    APRIL 25 2017 			Code Green Apparel Explores Development of Hemp-Based Textiles to Broaden Its Sustainable Apparel Product Line 			LAGUNA BEACH, CA / ACCESSWIRE / April 25, 2017 / Code Green Apparel Corp. (OTC PINK: CGAC) announces the completion of the initial phases of the exploration of its newest product line, hemp-based textiles. After months of exploration, research and corporate customer dialogue, Code Green will begin development of a hemp-based product line immediately in an effort to broaden the assortment of sustainable fabrics it has to offer customers.  			Code Green is strategically positioning itself to build on its already impressive portfolio of sustainable apparel products. The company will incorporate the new Hemp Code line into the portfolio, both horizontally and vertically. Management views the growth of the newest hemp-based lineup is twofold: 1) by tactically developing "product" in house while 2) strategically evaluating business relationships such as partnerships and Joint Ventures with other established companies in targeted, vertical markets.  			Code Green has had many discussions with hemp suppliers, companies and experts and will combine each potential partner's respective expertise into a single venture. The current development stage will commence immediately and include fabric, design and product development in order to meet specific requests from customers.  			"Code Green is excited about this new hemp-based opportunity, and we believe Hemp Code will provide continued growth into selected markets. The addition of the Hemp Code product line is a natural complement to our existing eco-friendly product lineup," stated George Powell, CEO of Code Green Apparel. "It is not sufficient to offer our customers only recycled products. We strive to create products from many sources of recycled and sustainable textile products. We will move quickly and efficiently, yet responsibly, to make our vision a reality. While we expect the hemp-based product line to provide new customers, the addition Hemp Code will not take any effort or capital away from our existing products nor order fulfillment. We will keep you informed of developments and opportunities as they develop." This is very exciting because they have a new product line and therefore a new product vertical and revnue potential!    APRIL 20 2017  			  			Code Green Apparel Partners with Cicero Consulting Group LAGUNA BEACH, CA / ACCESSWIRE / April 20, 2017 / Code Green Apparel Corp. announces partnership with Cicero Consulting Group to increase exposure, marketing and advertising of Code Green's sustainable branded products and to generate top level sales leads. The partnership agreement includes an associated partnership with Recruiter.com and an initial equity position, taken by Cicero, in Code Green Apparel Corp. Code Green recently announced the shipment of product to the professional golf circuit and also the need for a ramp up in sales and marketing staff. The partnership with Cicero is both strategic and tactical, allowing Code Green access to Cicero's expertise (www.cicerogroupllc.com/our-team) and databases and utilization of Recruiter.com vast exposure platforms. The management teams, of both Cicero and Code Green, are already implementing the launch strategy contemplated by the partnership. More information is available about the Cicero Targeted Exposure Platform at: www.cicerogroupllc.com. "Our partnership with Cicero is our biggest milestone to date. Our brand and products are sustainable and in-demand, this marketing partnership will expose our products to the end consumer at an exponential pace. The sales leads will be targeted and effective, and the quality of the leads easily replaces the efforts of numerous dedicated sales staff," stated George Powell, CEO of Code Green Apparel. "We plan for this partnership to be the first of many upcoming partnerships and acquisitions to scale up our business. We believed the time was right to increase the capital structure of company to accommodate the pending growth. This partnership, and future possible partnerships and acquisitions, streamlines the time to profitable growth and immediately delivers value to our shareholders."  This is a big news because it is not a fluff partnership. This is with Cicero and they are truly working together.

(OTC PINK: CGAC) updates its shareholders on the progress of the company. Over the past year, the company's vision, careful planning, patient execution have laid and secured a solid foundation for the vertical launch of the Code Green sustainable business model. Code Green believes its sustainable philosophy and strategy is what separates it from the competition while focusing on the underserved corporate apparel market. Code Green Apparel products by nature, are "good for business" and "good for the environment". The company's products support public sustainability platforms of many of its customers and countless other large corporations, all potential customers. Code Green and its in-demand products deliver an eco-friendly alternative by substantially reducing the environmental impact plaguing the traditional textile industry. To efficiently and responsibly achieve the goals of the Company, Code Green needed a strong foundation from which to launch the business. Management highlights certain benchmarks and milestones that the company has recently achieved: - Rebranding of the corporation including the name change to Code Green Apparel            - Completion of an S-1 Registration process with the SEC       - Revenue generation beginning in the second half of 2016  - Hired key staff members and sales representatives expanding infrastructural reach - Completed Acquisition of 10Star Apparel With this solid foundation in place, management has shifted its primary focus to driving value and profitable growth for the company and its shareholders. Over the coming weeks and months, Code Green will be working with its suppliers, customers, bankers and market strategists to execute the next phase of the business plan. The plan is both strategic and expansive in scope focusing on renegotiating with our creditors, expanding our customer base, expanding our product portfolio and delivering value to shareholders. "We are proud of what we have accomplished to date, but it is the next phase for Code Green Apparel that has us all so excited," said George Powell, the CEO of Code Green Apparel. "We know we are leaders in the emerging sustainable textile market," he continued. "With our foundation now in place we are positioned to get aggressive and to drive revenue growth."  OMG. S1 registration is big. that indicates an UPLIST  			Acquisition of 10Star Apparel. Sounds great  			A company that will generate revnues.       Company Mission Statement     Code Green Apparel Corp is dedicated to becoming an industry leader in Sustainable Textiles by providing corporations with Corporate Logo Wear, Uniforms and other Sustainable Textile products.

Code Green Apparel’s story is a true story - a powerful story that your company will be able to share with its customers, employees and investors. 			   			Your customers will be glad to see that your company remains committed to expanding its sustainability platform in new and innovative ways, while your employees will be further inspired to share your company’s message of social responsibility both internally and with your customers. Your investors can be reassured that although your new sustainable apparel will save huge amounts of water and reduce major contributions to landfills, it will better your financial bottom-line as well with less costly apparel.

Code Green Apparel Corp., a company dedicated to become an industry leader in sustainability textiles, will begin development of a hemp-based product line in order to broaden its assortment of sustainable fabrics. The company based in the United States will incorporate the new Hemp Code line into the portfolio, both horizontally and vertically.
After completing the initial phases of the exploration of its newest product line, hemp-based textiles, Code Green will soon begin work on developing hemp-based products. The company has had discussions with hemp suppliers, companies and experts and will combine each potential partners respective expertise into a single venture. The current development stage will commence immediately and include fabric, design and product development in order to meet specific requests from customers.
"Code Green is excited about this new hemp-based opportunity, and we believe Hemp Code will provide continued growth into selected markets. The addition of the Hemp Code product line is a natural complement to our existing eco-friendly product lineup," stated George Powell, CEO of Code Green Apparel. "It is not sufficient to offer our customers only recycled products. We strive to create products from many sources of recycled and sustainable textile products. We will move quickly and efficiently, yet responsibly, to make our vision a reality. While we expect the hemp-based product line to provide new customers, the addition Hemp Code will not take any effort or capital away from our existing products nor order fulfillment. We will keep you informed of developments and opportunities as they develop."
Code Green is strategically positioning itself to build on its already impressive portfolio of sustainable apparel products.(c)  2017 The Saudi Gazette. All Rights Reserved.

Unique Sweatshirts and Hoodies
When warm days turn to cool nights, slip on one of our comfy sweatshirts or hoodies. We have a wide selection of available styles -- from hooded sweatshirts to cool zip hoodies. You'll find womens & mens hoodies and sweatshirts, not to mention ones for children. Our soft, custom garments feature cool designs ideal for expressing your interests to friends. And the great thing is you can personalize your summertime hoody with funny designs, or choose anything from summer themes like baseball and the beach and pet to political statements (like Obama 2012). And it's always great fun to get into the holiday spirit with custom gear, like 4th of July hoodies and sweatshirts or ones for Father's Day. Plus when you have a special message of your own, it's also easy to make your own custom hoodies.
