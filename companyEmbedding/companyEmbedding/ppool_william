Origin of Pettypool

            From what I have read, it appears all the American Pettypools trace back to a William Pettypool who was the only son of William Pettypool in Essex, England during Medieval times. The immigrant William Pettypool arrived in the Virgina colonies in the 1650's. He also had a son named William.Apparently, for unknown reasons, some of the children changed their surname to P'Pool in the early 1800's. (This is my line.)Source: Pettypool One-Name sourcePettypool DNA ProjectA fantastic site for Pettypool research is Colonial Pettypool-Poole-P'Pool Familiesand recently I found:Descendants of William PettypoolNOTE: When listing a query or lineage info, please do so in the "Discussion Forum" section below as only the post in that section will be picked up by the RSS reader and distributed to those of us who have chosen to use it. Thanks!

I would like to add a resource to those included in your group description.  The website The Pettypool Family in America is a collection of well researched material on the family.  The site also has an associated blog.
(In the interests of full disclosure, I am the site administrator as well as a contributor.  There are a number of other contributors to the site, and if you have any similar Pettypool material from your own research that you would consider contributing to the site, please contact me.)
