Raising the Bar for Giving: Geoffrey Stack Named Chairman of the ULI Foundation; Michael Hayde Named New Chairman of Foundation Annual Fund

Posted on June 30, 2014  by  Robert Krueger 





 
Geoffrey L. Stack, managing director of SARES-REGIS Group



ULI Foundation Supports Institute’s Global Program of Work to Create Thriving, Sustainable Communities
For more information, contact Trish Riggs at 202-624-7086
WASHINGTON (June 30, 2014) — Urban Land Institute (ULI) leader Geoffrey L. Stack, managing director of SARES-REGIS Group, one of the largest, most diversified commercial and residential real estate firms in the western U.S.,  has been named chairman of the ULI Foundation. He begins his term in the voluntary position July 1, replacing James Curtis III, who served as the Foundation chairman for the past two years.
The mission of the ULI Foundation is to serve as the philanthropic source for ULI, a global research and education institute with more than 32,000 members dedicated to responsible land use and building thriving, sustainable communities. The Foundation secures endowment funds, major gifts and annual fund contributions to support the Institute’s key programs, activities and services, including the Terwilliger Housing Center, Rose Center for Public Leadership, Greenprint Center for Building Performance, Sustainability Center, Center for Capital Markets and Real Estate, urban resilience program, advisory services panel program, ULI awards programs, Urban Plan, Hines Student Urban Design Competition, Building Healthy Places initiative, infrastructure initiative, urban innovation grant program, and numerous other offerings related to successful community building.
Stack, a ULI trustee and a member of ULI since 1986, has long served on ULI’s Multi-family Council. He was elected chairman of the ULI Foundation by the ULI trustees at the institute’s Spring Meeting this past April, and is stepping into the post after serving as chairman of the ULI Foundation Annual Fund since 2009. Under his leadership of the Annual Fund, contributions reached a record total of nearly $1.6 million in calendar year, up 77 percent from when he became Fund chairman. So far this year, more than $400,000 has been contributed to the Fund, positioning it to set a new record by the end of 2014.
As the ULI Foundation chairman, Stack’s top priority will be to strengthen the connection between donor giving and ULI’s content. “It’s exciting to be moving into this role at a time when ULI’s efforts to build better communities have never been more necessary or relevant around the globe. To encourage members to become donors, they need to be vested in ULI’s program of work, and they need to understand that their support plays a significant role in making ULI’s work possible,” Stack said. “If we can deepen that connection, we can increase philanthropic support.”
According to Stack, the Foundation can best link donor giving to ULI’s content by enhancing the performance of the three vehicles through which donors engage with the Foundation: annual giving, program giving and mission giving. For the Annual Fund, the Foundation’s objective will be to expand support by focusing on participation from ULI’s council network, including increasing the number of gifts as well as the average gift amount from council members; and expanding the donor base to include non-council members. For program giving, the objective is to deliver more support for specific programs and initiatives; and for mission giving, the objective is to attract legacy and major gifts that expand ULI’s capacity to deliver on its mission.
Replacing Stack as the ULI Foundation Annual Fund chairman is Michael K. Hayde, chief executive officer of the Western National Group. A member of ULI since 1987, a ULI Multi-family Council member, and a newly elected ULI trustee, Hayde will work closely with Stack and the Foundation’s board of directors to carry out the objectives for the giving programs, with a particular emphasis on the Annual Fund.
“The Annual Fund is a key source of funding for many of ULI’s ongoing activities that make the Institute’s impact so profound and far-reaching,” Hayde said. “I look forward to working with Jeff and the board members to stretch and strengthen our support of ULI, and keep the momentum going.”
“Jeff and Mike exemplify ULI’s strong tradition of volunteerism, and they will provide excellent leadership for the ULI Foundation,” said ULI Global Chief Executive Officer and ULI Foundation President Patrick L. Phillips. “They are thoughtful and passionate about advancing ULI’s mission through philanthropy, and will raise the bar for giving back to ULI.”
Four ULI Foundation governors have been selected to serve on the Foundation’s board for terms that start July 1: John S. Hagestad, managing director, SARES-REGIS Group; James A. Ratner, chairman and chief executive officer,  Forest City Enterprises; Melinda Masson, chief executive officer, Masson Strategic Advisors, LLC; and Michael Spies, senior managing director for Europe and India, Tishman Speyer.
