This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 
Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.
What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.

Job Details
               Empire Resorts is a publicly traded gaming and entertainment company whose common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol "NYNY. Our subsidiary, Monticello Raceway Management, Inc., owns and operates the Monticello Casino & Raceway in Monticello, NY. The facility includes over 1,000 slot machines and electronic table games, as well as dining and live entertainment. Monticello Casino & Raceway has been conducting harness racing since 1958 and the facility opened its doors to slot machine gaming in July 2004 and has already hosted over 5.5 million visitors. We offer our patrons a convenient and comfortable gaming and entertainment experience and make available a number of different options including slot machine gaming, live harness horse racing, dining and simulcasting of thoroughbred and harness races from across the United States. Under current management, the casino property has maximized efficiencies, launched a new marketing and television advertising campaign and is only one of two New York State casinos that has been approved by the New York State Lottery to participate in a tax-free "free play" pilot program. The pilot program expands the company's use of "free play" credits for players at Monticello Casino & Raceway and has substantially bolstered the company's marketing program and competitive position in response to the expansion of new casinos and aggressive marketing programs in Pennsylvania. The "free play" credits can be used by customers at any of the slot machines. Approximately 50% of Empire Resorts is owned by Kien Huat, an investment company beneficially owned by a Lim family trust of which Mr. Lim Kok Thay of Malaysia and members of his family are beneficiaries. Kien Huat affiliates maintain substantial interests in a multinational group of companies actively involved in gaming, leisure, hospitality, power generation, plantations, property development, biotechnology, and oil and gas collectively known as the Genting companies. Kien Huat affiliates separately own a substantial interest in Star Cruises Ltd., the largest cruise operator in Asia, and financed the startup of the Foxwoods Resort & Casino in Connecticut and the Seneca Niagara Casino in New York. More recently, Genting New York, LLC has received permission from the state of New York to build and operate 4,500 slot machines at the Aqueduct thoroughbred track in Queens, NY.
