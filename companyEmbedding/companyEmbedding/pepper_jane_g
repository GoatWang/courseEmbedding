				  Longwood Gardens Announces Appointment of Jane Pepper as President of Board of Trustees				








November 23, 2015KENNETT SQUARE, PA . . . Longwood Gardens announces the appointment of Jane G. Pepper as President of the Longwood Gardens Board of Trustees.  Pepper assumes the role after the retirement of Nathan Hayward, III who served on the Board since 2001 and as President since 2003. Pepper has served as a Trustee on the Board since 2005 and as First Vice President since 2014.
“This transition is a testament to our succession planning to ensure that the Longwood Board of Trustees continues to have the highest-caliber leadership guiding our organization,” said Executive Director Paul B. Redman. “Jane’s professional background, her varied experience, and vast knowledge of Longwood will make her an outstanding President of the Board of Trustees,” Redman said.
Pepper retired in 2010 as the President of The Pennsylvania Horticultural Society (PHS) where she led the organization for nearly 30 years. Her involvement with corporate and cultural institutions is extensive, including serving as a Director of The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.; Trustee of the Natural Lands Trust; Chair of the Selections Committee for the Eisenhower Exchange Fellowships Philadelphia International Leadership Initiative; and a Vice President of the Royal Horticultural Society, London. She holds a Master’s Degree in Public Horticulture Administration from the Longwood Graduate Program and a Bachelor’s Degree in Plant Science both from the University of Delaware. She earned an Associate of Science Degree in Landscape Design from Temple University.
About Longwood GardensIn 1906, industrialist Pierre du Pont (1870-1954) purchased a small farm near Kennett Square, PA, to save a collection of historic trees from being sold for lumber. Throughout his life, Mr. du Pont indulged his passion for gardening, turning his farm into a magnificent horticultural showplace. Today, Longwood Gardens is one of the world’s great gardens, encompassing 1,077 acres of gardens, woodlands, meadows, fountains, and a 4-acre conservatory. Longwood continues the mission set forth by Mr. du Pont to inspire people through excellence in garden design, horticulture, education and the arts, through programming that includes exhibitions, performing arts, renowned horticulture education programs, horticulture research, environmental stewardship and cultural and community engagement. Longwood Gardens is on US Route 1 near Kennett Square, PA, 30 miles west of Philadelphia. Details at www.longwoodgardens.org.
