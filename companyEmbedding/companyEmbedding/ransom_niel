FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

CryptoWall Ransomware Removal Report










































				CryptoWall Ransomware			

CryptoWall Ransomware Description
The CryptoWall Ransomware is a ransomware Trojan that carries the same strategy as a number of other encryption ransomware infections such as Cryptorbit Ransomware or CryptoLocker Ransomware. The CryptoWall Ransomware is designed to infect all versions of Windows, including Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7 and Windows 8. As soon as the CryptoWall Ransomware infects a computer, the CryptoWall Ransomware uses the RSA2048 encryption to encrypt crucial files. Effectively, the CryptoWall Ransomware prevents computer users from accessing their data, which will be encrypted and out of reach. The CryptoWall Ransomware claims that it is necessary to pay $500 USD to recover the encrypted data. The payment is demanded using TOR and Bitcoins in order to maintain the recipients' anonymity. Malware researchers strongly advise against paying the CryptoWall Ransomware ransom. This only encourages ill-minded persons to continue carrying these types of attacks and does not guarantee that you will recover your data.
Fake Updates and Spam Emails may Bring the CryptoWall Ransomware to Your Computer
The CryptoWall Ransomware is distributed as a fake update for applications such as Adobe Reader, Flash Player or the Java Runtime Environment. These types of updates may be offered in pop-up windows when you visit unsafe websites or when a Potentially Unwanted Program is installed on your computer. The CryptoWall Ransomware also may be distributed using spam email attachments and other typical threat delivery methods. Apart from encrypting your software, the CryptoWall Ransomware will also drop the files DECRYPT_INSTRUCTION.txt, DECRYPT_INSTRUCTION.html and DECRYPT_INSTRUCTION.url into directories where the CryptoWall Ransomware has encrypted data. The CryptoWall Ransomware uses the following ransom message to demand payment:
Decrypt service
Your files are encrypted.
To get the key to decrypt files you have to pay 500 USD/EUR. If payments is not made before [date] the cost of decrypting files will increase 2 times and will be 1000 USD/EUR Prior to increasing the amount left: [count down timer]
We are present a special software - CryptoWall Decrypter - which is allow to decrypt and return control to all your encrypted files. How to buy CryptoWall decrypter?
1.You should register Bitcoin waller
2. Purchasing Bitcoins - Although it's not yet easy to buy bit coins, it's getting simpler every day.
3. Send 1.22 BTC to Bitcoin address: 1BhLzCZGY6dwQYgX4B6NR5sjDebBPNapvv
4. Enter the Transaction ID and select amount.
5. Please check the payment information and click 'PAY'.
Avoid paying this ransom. Instead remove the CryptoWall Ransomware using a reliable, fully updated security program and then recover your files from an external back-up.

					Threat Scorecard
					?
						
							The ESG Threat Scorecard is an assessment report that is given to every malware threat that has been collected and analyzed through our Malware Research Center. The ESG Threat Scorecard evaluates and ranks each threat by using several metrics such as trends, incidents and severity over time.
							
							In addition to the effective scoring for each threat, we are able to interpret anonymous geographic data to list the top three countries infected with a particular threat. The data used for the ESG Threat Scorecard is updated daily and displayed based on trends for a 30-day period. The ESG Threat Scorecard is a useful tool for a wide array of computer users from end users seeking a solution to remove a particular threat or security experts pursuing analysis and research data on emerging threats.
							
							Each of the fields listed on the ESG Threat Scorecard, containing a specific value, are as follows:
							
Ranking: The current ranking of a particular threat among all the other threats found on our malware research database.
							
Threat Level: The level of threat a particular PC threat could have on an infected computer. The threat level is based on a particular threat's behavior and other risk factors. We rate the threat level as low, medium or high. The different threat levels are discussed in the SpyHunter Risk Assessment Model.
							
Infected PCs: The number of confirmed and suspected cases of a particular threat detected on infected PCs retrieved from diagnostic and scan log reports generated by SpyHunter's Spyware Scanner.
							
% Change: The daily percent change in the frequency of infected PCs of a specific threat. The formula for percent changes results from current trends of a specific threat. An increase in the rankings of a specific threat yields a recalculation of the percentage of its recent gain. When a specific threat's ranking decreases, the percentage rate reflects its recent decline. For a specific threat remaining unchanged, the percent change remains in its current state. The % Change data is calculated and displayed in three different date ranges, in the last 24 hours, 7 days and 30 days. Next to the percentage change is the trend movement a specific malware threat does, either upward or downward, in the rankings. Each level of movement is color coded: a green up-arrow (∧) indicates a rise, a red down-arrow (∨) indicates a decline, and a brown equal symbol (=) indicates no change or plateaued.
							
Top 3 Countries Infected: Lists the top three countries a particular threat has targeted the most over the past month. This data allows PC users to track the geographic distribution of a particular threat throughout the world.

My computer was infected with the CryptoWall Ransomware virus
I tried different free tools to decrypt my files, but nothing helped.

I think that the big Ransomware risk if the hackers will succeed to infect the most of company’s servers. In that case the company will not be able to work at all, and may be there will not be recovery option without pay the ransom. What is your recommendation for such case

I have both my computer hard drives cloned with true image. I also have all my important date, files, movies, pictures, bills, everything, on two different external hard drives. 
If these guys ever come to me, I would tell them to go F*** themselves!
I was told in 1998, but a guy that built me my first desktop computer. If you want to keep it, don’t put it on a computer. And never use your real name when filing out anything online! 
I had maybe four viruses. They were my fault, as I was downloading movies. No, not porn. I had that virus gone in less than an hour!

My computer was infected with the CryptoWall Ransomware virus.  SpyHunter was able to remove the infection in full after a remote session with one of their technicians.  Unfortunately I was unable to recover my files as the virus deleted all shadow files or previous restore points.  Sadly I didn’t do a recent backup, and lost several files.  Thanks to SpyHunter I’m back up and running though.  Very satisfied with their software and technical support.  Top notch!! 
If anyone has any other information on how I might be able to recovery encrypted files please advise.  Referred to all the links provided by SpyHunter support but no luck.  Aside from paying the ransom, I’m open to suggestions.
Thanks.

I was afraid my entire network would be affected but as soon as I discovered something funny on my wife’s computer I cut the sharing options and put her IP in my firewall list.
If anybody knows where these arseholes live or work, I would like to know. Please, someone let me know and I’ll fix them the old fashioned way.

The virus hit one PC and of course encrypted as much as it had access too but nobody let us know (we’re  an outsourced IT support company) so it had all yesterday afternoon to worm its way around and this morning. I just wanted to get something clear; is the program local to one machine’s available places to access or once its gotten to as far as it can on the server through that first user’s machine, can it jump across to other users’ machines, start the executable from there and then get more access, or is it only local to the machine the virus hit?

Found that some files can be recovered by right clicking and choosing previous versions. Only do this after running a full antivirus scan otherwise..anything that this computer touches will get infected. DO NOT ATTACH USB DRIVES WHILE INFECTED!!!

My laptop, primary computer was infected December 2014. I had an IT person take a look…new security software/hardware was installed and MY FILES AND PHOTOS are all gone. The Consumer Product Safety Commission or somebody needs to prevent this!

You must have really needed those files to pay the ransom.

The latest version of Cryptowall wipes out all your files wholesale. The only way to have your files back is by using data recovery softwares or better yet, from an external source..

To Richard Carry: You say you were able to decrypt the files? exactly how? My mother’s computer was hit – Oct 24, 2014.
For those whose are ‘adamant’ about not paying to having them decrypted obviously haven’t lost years of files that include financial, family history, personal files!!!! We would be more than willing to pay, but a service tech wipe the computer clean (of the virus) before we realized the only way to get them decrypted was to pay them! Now we have over 4000 encrypted, useless files! We had the files back-up on an external hard drive that was connected to the computer. The virus hit that too!

Paying these thieves is like negotiating with terrorists, if you pay you’re only making things worse and you’re voluntarily inviting them into your computer to make things worse down the road.  Plus you’re wearing a target since they know you’ve paid before… you’ll keep paying again.
These people will eventually get caught. Don’t be a part of the problem.

Should I go ahead paying the Cryptowall? If I pay what are the chance of decrypt my file?





Richard Carey:

I have seen this Trojan first hand once. The original file is not deleted, so you cannot recover deleted files to get yourself out of trouble.
I can’t believe that some of you have talked to a number of IT specialists and they have told you to pay the ransom!
I have recovered the files twice that were encrypted by cryptowall. Once locally, the second time, across the globe.

I got the virus last night.  I have an image backup from an external drive but it does not include all files as I save some files directly to a 2nd drive.  Unfortunately this drive was connected last night when I got the virus and it also got the virus.  My virus software IT dept says that it seems to just be Malware that encrypts the files and deletes the original.  My dilemma is that I need to try to recover the files on the external drive – is this possible?

have there been any positive results in retrieving the data left on the hard drive. i have been infected on a windows 7 machine

Windows 7 has previous file options which you may be able to go back to… otherwise, if you don’t have backups you’re SOL unless you want to pay $500 extortion to get the decrypt ability.
In response to the article, the exe file created seems to be random.  The one I saw had a different random string of charactors for a name.  I’ve seen cryptolocker before, and cryptolocker appeared to act faster or more efficiently.
I’m working on clean up now and there’s directories that have some files encrypted whereas others are not.  So I’m confused as to whether I just got to it in time or what.
For any average user, sorry if you’ve gotten infected.  $500 is a bit much for most people but if you don’t have back ups that’s the only current way to get your files back.  In the future keep backups on a device that’s not left connected to your computer.

Here is how to recover your files:
The ransomware function this way :
When a user launch it (usually by email) it will encrypt all their files and add in each directory a document explaining that they will have to pay in Bitcoin 500$ to recover their files. 
FYI, if you pay, you will actually recover your files, but is there another solution than paying 500 or 1000$ to some kind of mafia ? Yes.
1.
Power-Off the machine : the faster the better
CryptoWall operate this way :
First it will do a copy of your original file, and encrypt it with what they claim to be a RSA2048 key. Then it will delete the original files. It goes on until it encrypted all files on all disks and network shares the user can access.
In a second time it will try to delete any windows shadowcopies of your files to prevent you to recover a previous &quot;unencrypted&quot; version of your files.
The reason you should power off the machine quickly is that it might prevent the suppression of shadowcopies. Then all you have to do is power on the machine, press F8, launch it in Safe mode, and use antimalware programs to clean the virus. then use the &quot;precedent version&quot; tab on properties of your user folders to recover unencrypted files.
2.
 What if you have no shadow copies and no backup of your files ? There is still a way.
As I said, Cryptowall doesn’t encrypt your original files. It will do a copy of it, encrypt it, and delete the original file.
As you probably know, a deleted file can be recover if nothing as been written over it on your disk. Good think you quickly power off the machine soon after the infection !
Now all you have to do is take your hard drive out, put it in another machine as external drive, or second drive if you don’t have a sata dock, an run a file recovery program.
I use Ontrack EasyRecovery or R-Studio, or even DataRescue for Mac.
The pro version of Ontrack EasyRecovery might also be able to recover files from a RAID array if one of your network share as been encrypted and you don’t have backups.
All these programs will be able to recover the original files deleted by Cryptowall.
Just make sure when you run those to NOT do it directly on the original machine as by writing on your infected disk, the program could Overwrite your deleted files.
You should be able to recover 99% of your files using this method.
After you recover your files, always do a clean format / install of your machine.
Of course the best way to protect you from this kind of virus is always the same :
Have a backup. Always. And a good up to date AV.
