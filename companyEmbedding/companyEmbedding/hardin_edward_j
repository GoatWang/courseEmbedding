The 2008 edition of Chambers USA included ten partners from Rogers & Hardin who are listed within the areas of Antitrust, Corporate/M&A, Labor & Employment and General Commercial Litigation. Thirteen Rogers & Hardin partners are listed as top lawyers within eleven different fields in the 2009 edition of The Best Lawyers in America. Two partners and three associates were selected as Rising Stars in the 2009 edition of Georgia Super Lawyers. Rogers & Hardin has three partners who are members of the American College of Trial Lawyers. Membership is extended "only by invitation, after careful investigation, to those experienced trial lawyers who have mastered the art of advocacy and whose professional careers have been marked by the highest standards of ethical conduct, professionalism, civility and collegiality" and "membership can never be more than 1% of the total lawyer population of any state or province." Rogers & Hardin successfully represented Attorney General Thurbert Baker before the Georgia Supreme Court in the landmark case brought by Governor George E. "Sonny" Perdue III. Attorney General Baker stated that he was "extremely proud to have had them represent my office in this case." In addition to published recognitions, the Firm's strong reputation is further evidenced by the fact that our lawyers are frequently asked to speak to business and lawyer groups at regional and national conferences, seminars, and law school courses. Perhaps more important than the intellectual and academic stature of R&H lawyers is their valuable practical experience. A number of our partners serve as directors of major corporations, including NYSE and other public companies, as well as private domestic and foreign companies. The Firm has also represented many major law firms in various matters, gaining a reputation as "lawyers' lawyers".
