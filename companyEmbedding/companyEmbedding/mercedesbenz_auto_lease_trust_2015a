How It Works for Buyers


How it Works Video | How it Works for Sellers | Lease Glossary

STEP 1.

									The first step is to search through the vehicles available on Swapalease.com via the Vehicle Search.  You can search by Year, Make, Model, 
									Payment, Location, and/or Months Remaining.  
									Click here to use the Vehicle Search 


									The search process highlights the
									important terms of each lease, such as monthly payment, miles allowed, and months
									remaining.  You can click on each vehicle listing for more detailed information.
									

									You can ask questions about the vehicle
									by anonymously emailing the seller via the "More Info" option.  More specific
									questions can be asked upon registering as a buyer (see below).
									

									If you do not find a vehicle that meets
									your needs, use the "Notify Me" feature and we will notify you by email when a vehicle
									matching your preferences becomes available.
								

STEP 2.

									Once you find a vehicle of interest, the next step is to register as a Buyer with Swapalease. You can register directly from the 
									vehicle listing page, or from the homepage.  You will be asked to provide some basic information that will later be used for 
									credit approval and lease transfer.
									

Click here to Register as a Buyer with Swapalease


									After registering, you will gain access to the contact information for sellers on the site.
									

									The cost for Buyer Registration are minimal, and includes access to seller contact information, 
									unlimited customer support from Swapalease.com, a buyer "mailbox," and all internal processing through the transfer process. Your 
									registration can be used for an unlimited number of vehicles. 
								

STEP 3.

									Once you find a vehicle of interest and you have contacted the Seller, the next step is to initiate the transfer. The transfer 
									initiation process includes a credit check, which will determine whether you are eligible to assume the lease. 
									


									If you want to learn more about your credit history, click here
									
									

									During this time, you and the Seller should also discuss the transfer details. It is important to consider the details, such as 
									whether shipping and/or vehicle inspections will be required and if any buyer incentives will be necessary. 
									

To find out more about Shipping, Inspections and other Services, click here


									Seller contact information is stored in your Buyer "mailbox". 
								

STEP 4.

									Once your credit has been approved and you have agreed to make a transfer, Swapalease will guide you through the process with 
									the Seller and the leasing company. 
									Swapalease guides you through the entire lease transfer process. You simply provide the necessary information, sign the 
									documents, and take possession of the vehicle. 
									

									Upon signing off on the paperwork and taking possession of the keys to your new vehicle, the process is complete! 
									

									Any Questions?
									

									Feel free to call us now at (866) 792 7669 or e-mail us at support@Swapalease.com

How It Works for Sellers


How it Works Video | How it Works for Buyers | Lease Glossary

STEP 1.

									The first step is to list your vehicle on Swapalease.com via the "Exit Your Lease!" section of the homepage.
									
Click here to post your vehicle to Swapalease.com

									Once you have entered your vehicle and contact information, you will be asked to select a listing package and make payment. Please note 
									that various listing packages are available at different price points, so please contact us toll free at (866) 792 7669 
									for more information.
									

									Your listing is valid for as long as necessary!

									Thereafter, your vehicle listing is "active" and available to millions of Buyers who visit Swapalease every year.
								

STEP 2.

									You can monitor the activity on your Swapalease ad at any time in the Account Management area by logging in as a Registered User from the 
									homepage.
									

									The Account Management section allows you to monitor the number of "hits" on your ad, extend or edit the vehicle listing, and contact 
									serious buyers.
									
									You will also have access to both SwapGarage, which will assist in enhancing your vehicle listing and optimizing your vehicle's exposure 
									to Buyers, and SwapAdvisor, which will answer any specific questions that you have about selling your vehicle.
									
									In addition, you will be provided with a "mailbox" to which buyer inquiries about your vehicle will be forwarded.
								

STEP 3.

									When a serious buyer registers with Swapalease, you will be notified by email. Included in the email is the buyer's name, phone and 
									email address. It is important to check your Swapalease mailbox on a regular basis. You may also hear from interested buyers via 
									telephone. Once you find an interested Buyer, the next step is to initiate the transfer using your Account Management area. The transfer 
									initiation process includes a credit check for the potential Buyer, which will determine whether the Buyer is eligible to assume your lease.
									

									During this time, you and the Buyer should also discuss the transfer details. It is important to consider the details, such as whether 
									shipping and/or vehicle inspections will be required and if any buyer incentives will be necessary.
								

STEP 4.

									Once the Buyer's credit has been approved and you have agreed to make a transfer, Swapalease will guide you through the process with 
									your leasing company. Swapalease guides you through the entire lease transfer process. You simply provide the information, sign the 
									documents and pay applicable leasing company fees**, and turn over the vehicle.
									

									Upon signing off on the paperwork and handing over the keys to your vehicle, the process is complete!
									

									Any Questions?
									

									Feel free to call us now at (866) 792 7669 or e-mail us at support@Swapalease.com

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

The Stable Outlook reflects Fitch's expectation that the notes will remain sufficiently enhanced to cover stressed loss levels consistent with the current ratings.RATING SENSITIVITIESUnanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults or deterioration in vehicle values could produce loss levels higher than the current expectations and impact available loss coverage. Lower loss coverage could impact ratings and Rating Outlooks, depending on the extent of the decline in coverage.Despite the transaction's growth in credit enhancement to date, the residual portion of the transaction continues to become a larger percentage of the securitization value. As a result, the transaction continues to be sensitive to fluctuations in residual values. A material deterioration in vehicle values could potentially have a negative impact on the outstanding ratings.USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10Form ABS Due Diligence-15E was not provided to, or reviewed by, Fitch in relation to this rating action.Fitch has affirmed the following ratings:MBALT 2015-B:--Class A-2A notes at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable--Class A-2B notes at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable--Class A-3 notes at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable--Class A-4 notes at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable.Additional information is available at www.fitchratings.com.Applicable CriteriaCounterparty Criteria for Structured Finance and Covered Bonds (pub. 01 Sep 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/886006Criteria for Interest Rate Stresses in Structured Finance Transactions and Covered Bonds (pub. 17 May 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/879815Criteria for Rating U.S. Auto Lease ABS (pub. 24 Mar 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/879019Global Structured Finance Rating Criteria (pub. 27 Jun 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/883130Rating Criteria for U.S. Auto Loan ABS (pub. 21 Mar 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/878723Related ResearchMercedes-Benz Auto Lease Trust 2015-B - Appendixhttps://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/872665Additional DisclosuresDodd-Frank Rating Information Disclosure Formhttps://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/press_releases/content/ridf_frame.cfm?pr_id=1012586Solicitation Statushttps://www.fitchratings.com/gws/en/disclosure/solicitation?pr_id=1012586Endorsement Policyhttps://www.fitchratings.com/jsp/creditdesk/PolicyRegulation.faces?context=2&detail=31ALL FITCH CREDIT RATINGS ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN LIMITATIONS AND DISCLAIMERS.

In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed.Read MoreThe information in this report is provided "as is" without any representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or sale of any security.

Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction.

      Fitch Rates Mercedes-Benz Auto Lease Trust 2015-B; Outlook Stable
    





October 28, 2015 01:29 PM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has assigned the following ratings and Rating Outlooks to 
      the notes issued by Mercedes-Benz Auto Lease Trust (MBALT) 2015-B listed 
      below:
    

      --$272,000,000 class A-1 'F1+sf';
    

      --$272,500,000 class A-2A 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$272,500,000 class A-2B 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$295,000,000 class A-3 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$150,360,000 class A-4 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Strong Collateral Quality: The 2015-B pool has a weighted-average (WA) 
      FICO score of 783, the strongest to date for any MBALT pool, strong WA 
      seasoning of 11 months and increased vehicle model diversity in the 
      pool. In addition, the pool has a smaller concentration of leases with 
      terms greater than 36 months, typically a higher driver of residual 
      value (RV) losses.
    

      Adequate Credit Enhancement (CE) Structure: Initial CE totals 16.65%, 
      consistent with 2015-A (NR), growing to a target of 17.75%, then 
      decreasing to 16.75% of the initial securitization value once the A-2b 
      floating rate notes are paid in full. Initial excess spread is 4.78%, 
      decreased from the three most recent transactions due to higher pricing. 
      Loss coverage is adequate to support Fitch's 'AAAsf' stressed 
      assumptions.
    

      Weakening RV Losses: Despite continued low credit losses, MBFS' residual 
      losses have trended higher recently, particularly for the C and E 
      classes. MB vehicle values continue to be affected by the large amount 
      of off-lease vehicle supply and introduction of refreshed classes over 
      the past year or so.
    

      Evolving Wholesale Vehicle Market: The U.S. wholesale vehicle market 
      (WVM) has been normalizing following strong performance in recent years. 
      Fitch expects that pressure from increased off-lease vehicle supply and 
      high production levels will lead to decreased residual realizations 
      during the life of the transaction.
    

      Stable Corporate Health: Fitch rates Daimler AG, the parent of MBFS, 
      'A-/F2' with a Stable Rating Outlook. Fitch believes MBFS to be an 
      adequate originator, underwriter and servicer, as evidenced by 
      historical performance of its managed portfolio and prior 
      securitizations.
    

      Legal Structure Integrity: The legal structure of the transaction should 
      provide that a bankruptcy of MBFS would not impair the timeliness of 
      payments on the securities.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Unanticipated decreases in the value of returned vehicles and/or 
      increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity on defaulted 
      receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base case and 
      would likely result in declines of CE and loss coverage levels available 
      to the notes.
    

      Under a moderate stress scenario of 1.5x the base case credit loss, the 
      targeted loss coverage would decrease enough to warrant a potential 
      downgrade of possibly one notch to the class A notes. The resilience is 
      partially due to the strength of the non-declining structure of the CE, 
      as well as the tradeoff that occurs when credit defaults are increased. 
      As credit defaults are increased, less of the collateral is subject to 
      residual stresses upon lease end. Under the more severe credit loss 
      stress of 2.5x the base case credit loss, changes in target coverage 
      would likely result in a downgrade of one to two rating categories for 
      the class A notes.
    

      Comparatively speaking, the class A ratings are more sensitive to 
      fluctuations in RV losses than credit losses, as is the case for most 
      auto lease ABS transactions. A moderate stress to the RV loss estimate 
      (an increase in the base case to 25%) would likely result in a negative 
      rating action of approximately three rating categories for the class A 
      notes with notes retaining their investment grade value. Under the 
      severe RV loss stress (an increase in the base case to 30%), the class A 
      notes could be downgraded below investment grade to the 'BBsf' range. 
      However, Fitch considers the severe RV loss scenario, along with the 
      other sensitivities described herein, to be highly unlikely given the 
      current state of the market and historical MBALT transaction performance.
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      Fitch was provided with third-party due diligence information from KPMG 
      LLP. The third-party due diligence information was provided on Form ABS 
      Due Diligence-15E and focused on a comparison and re-computation of 
      certain characteristics with respect to 100 sample leases. Fitch 
      considered this information in its analysis, and the findings did not 
      affect its analysis. A copy of the ABS Due Diligence Form-15E received 
      by Fitch in connection with this transaction may be obtained through the 
      link contained on the bottom of the related rating action commentary.
    

      Fitch's analysis of the Representations and Warranties (R&W) of this 
      transaction can be found in 'Mercedes-Benz Auto Lease Trust 2015-B - 
      Appendix'. These R&Ws are compared to those of typical R&W for the asset 
      class as detailed in the special report 'Representations, Warranties, 
      and Enforcement Mechanisms in Global Structured Finance Transactions' 
      dated June 2015.

How It Works for Buyers


How it Works Video | How it Works for Sellers | Lease Glossary

STEP 1.

									The first step is to search through the vehicles available on Swapalease.com via the Vehicle Search.  You can search by Year, Make, Model, 
									Payment, Location, and/or Months Remaining.  
									Click here to use the Vehicle Search 


									The search process highlights the
									important terms of each lease, such as monthly payment, miles allowed, and months
									remaining.  You can click on each vehicle listing for more detailed information.
									

									You can ask questions about the vehicle
									by anonymously emailing the seller via the "More Info" option.  More specific
									questions can be asked upon registering as a buyer (see below).
									

									If you do not find a vehicle that meets
									your needs, use the "Notify Me" feature and we will notify you by email when a vehicle
									matching your preferences becomes available.
								

STEP 2.

									Once you find a vehicle of interest, the next step is to register as a Buyer with Swapalease. You can register directly from the 
									vehicle listing page, or from the homepage.  You will be asked to provide some basic information that will later be used for 
									credit approval and lease transfer.
									

Click here to Register as a Buyer with Swapalease


									After registering, you will gain access to the contact information for sellers on the site.
									

									The cost for Buyer Registration are minimal, and includes access to seller contact information, 
									unlimited customer support from Swapalease.com, a buyer "mailbox," and all internal processing through the transfer process. Your 
									registration can be used for an unlimited number of vehicles. 
								

STEP 3.

									Once you find a vehicle of interest and you have contacted the Seller, the next step is to initiate the transfer. The transfer 
									initiation process includes a credit check, which will determine whether you are eligible to assume the lease. 
									


									If you want to learn more about your credit history, click here
									
									

									During this time, you and the Seller should also discuss the transfer details. It is important to consider the details, such as 
									whether shipping and/or vehicle inspections will be required and if any buyer incentives will be necessary. 
									

To find out more about Shipping, Inspections and other Services, click here


									Seller contact information is stored in your Buyer "mailbox". 
								

STEP 4.

									Once your credit has been approved and you have agreed to make a transfer, Swapalease will guide you through the process with 
									the Seller and the leasing company. 
									Swapalease guides you through the entire lease transfer process. You simply provide the necessary information, sign the 
									documents, and take possession of the vehicle. 
									

									Upon signing off on the paperwork and taking possession of the keys to your new vehicle, the process is complete! 
									

									Any Questions?
									

									Feel free to call us now at (866) 792 7669 or e-mail us at support@Swapalease.com

How It Works for Sellers


How it Works Video | How it Works for Buyers | Lease Glossary

STEP 1.

									The first step is to list your vehicle on Swapalease.com via the "Exit Your Lease!" section of the homepage.
									
Click here to post your vehicle to Swapalease.com

									Once you have entered your vehicle and contact information, you will be asked to select a listing package and make payment. Please note 
									that various listing packages are available at different price points, so please contact us toll free at (866) 792 7669 
									for more information.
									

									Your listing is valid for as long as necessary!

									Thereafter, your vehicle listing is "active" and available to millions of Buyers who visit Swapalease every year.
								

STEP 2.

									You can monitor the activity on your Swapalease ad at any time in the Account Management area by logging in as a Registered User from the 
									homepage.
									

									The Account Management section allows you to monitor the number of "hits" on your ad, extend or edit the vehicle listing, and contact 
									serious buyers.
									
									You will also have access to both SwapGarage, which will assist in enhancing your vehicle listing and optimizing your vehicle's exposure 
									to Buyers, and SwapAdvisor, which will answer any specific questions that you have about selling your vehicle.
									
									In addition, you will be provided with a "mailbox" to which buyer inquiries about your vehicle will be forwarded.
								

STEP 3.

									When a serious buyer registers with Swapalease, you will be notified by email. Included in the email is the buyer's name, phone and 
									email address. It is important to check your Swapalease mailbox on a regular basis. You may also hear from interested buyers via 
									telephone. Once you find an interested Buyer, the next step is to initiate the transfer using your Account Management area. The transfer 
									initiation process includes a credit check for the potential Buyer, which will determine whether the Buyer is eligible to assume your lease.
									

									During this time, you and the Buyer should also discuss the transfer details. It is important to consider the details, such as whether 
									shipping and/or vehicle inspections will be required and if any buyer incentives will be necessary.
								

STEP 4.

									Once the Buyer's credit has been approved and you have agreed to make a transfer, Swapalease will guide you through the process with 
									your leasing company. Swapalease guides you through the entire lease transfer process. You simply provide the information, sign the 
									documents and pay applicable leasing company fees**, and turn over the vehicle.
									

									Upon signing off on the paperwork and handing over the keys to your vehicle, the process is complete!
									

									Any Questions?
									

									Feel free to call us now at (866) 792 7669 or e-mail us at support@Swapalease.com

"Oh Lord, won't you buy me a Mercedes-Benz?" That's the opening line of "Mercedes-Benz," a song most famously recorded by singer Janis Joplin in the early 1970s. The tune gently poked fun at materialism and our desire for the finer things in life. It's fitting that the renowned German marque figures prominently in the lyric. Mercedes-Benz has long been known for crafting vehicles that emphasize luxury and refinement. For many, its vehicles are sleek symbols of status, success and good taste.
In January of 1886, Karl Benz unveiled the world's first automobile, a three-wheeled vehicle dubbed the Benz Patent Motor Car. A few months later, Gottlieb Daimler and his chief engineer Wilhelm Maybach rolled out a four-wheeled vehicle powered by his Daimler engine. The first Mercedes was crafted in 1901, shortly after Daimler's death. Built by Maybach, the car was commissioned by Emil Jellinek, one of Daimler's primary distributors, and was ultimately named after Jellinek's daughter, Mercedes.
In 1926, the companies founded by Daimler and Benz merged to form Daimler-Benz AG, and the Mercedes-Benz brand was born. The company's insignia was a three-pointed star wreathed in a laurel; the star was dreamed up by Daimler years earlier, and its three points signified the fact that his engines were used in vehicles that traveled land, air and sea.
Right from the start, the Mercedes-Benz name was synonymous with automotive excellence. One of the automaker's earliest vehicles, the 1931 Mercedes-Benz 170, distinguished itself as the world's first production car to offer a technology that was nothing short of extraordinary for the day: four-wheel independent suspension. The '30s and '40s saw Mercedes establishing itself as the brand of choice for car buyers seeking the ultimate in luxury, thanks to coveted cruisers like the 380 and 540K.
The 1950s witnessed the introduction of the Mercedes-Benz 300 SL "Gullwing," a sports car that has been described as being the world's first supercar. With its dramatic styling and race-bred technology, the 300 SL reigns today as a classic coveted by collectors worldwide. The decade also saw Daimler-Benz making strides in the area of safety technology. The company's Mercedes-Benz 220 sedans were the first vehicles to incorporate its patented "crumple zone" body design, created to absorb impact in the event of a crash.
In 1963, the company cemented its reputation as the home of automotive luxury with the launch of the Mercedes-Benz 600. The elegant, luxurious sedan was also available as a limousine and featured an ahead-of-its-time air suspension system and a V8 engine that boasted 300 horsepower. The decade also saw the launch of the Mercedes-Benz 300 SEL 6.3. This full-size sedan went from zero to 60 in under seven seconds, distinguishing itself as the quickest luxury car is its day.
The 1970s saw the birth of the brand's storied S-Class line of vehicles, opulent sedans and coupes that coddled passengers with powerful engines and a long list of luxury features. The decade also saw Mercedes continuing on the cutting edge of safety technology, by being the first to offer antilock brakes in its vehicles.
Daimler-Benz's safety advancements continued in the 1980s. Its cars were the first to offer airbags and traction control. The manufacturer also raised the bar in terms of ride comfort and handling when it introduced multilink rear suspension. The technology debuted on the compact Mercedes-Benz 190 E, and it remains a vital component of the company's chassis engineering to this day.
Mercedes-Benz vehicles got an extra dose of power and performance in the 1990s, thanks to the manufacturer's partnership with AMG, a performance and tuning shop that was eventually purchased by the company to help produce ultra-high-performance versions of some of its vehicles. The first AMG model offered in the U.S. was the sporty C36 AMG in 1995; since then, Mercedes has gone on to offer an AMG-tuned version of almost all of its vehicles.
The company's current lineup is the most comprehensive in its history. With a variety of sedans, coupes, SUVs and roadsters filling Mercedes showrooms, it seems like the only thing missing is a pickup truck. Surely, the fact that Janis Joplin's song holds as much relevance today as it did four decades ago is a strong indicator that the brand's premier status is still very much intact.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
