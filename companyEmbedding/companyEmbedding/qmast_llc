Welcome to Qmast 

Water and Hydrocarbon Recovery with the use of Microwaves
Click on the picture to view a video demonstration.
   
Qmast LLC has developed a revolutionary technology for the removal of hydrocarbons from oil shale, tar sands, tight shales, and conventional oil and gas reservoirs using a High Power Microwave (HPM) system. A prototype system of 500 kilowatts (equivalent to 500 microwave ovens) has been built and tested (the system pictured above was designed to remediate contaminated soils). Building on the success of the prototype system, the HPM system extends the technology to oil and gas applications by using a conventional well with a phased-array antenna to emit a focused high energy microwave beam that selectively heats water and hydrocarbons, fractures the rock, and efficiently removes hydrocarbons.The HPM system can replace conventional hydrofracturing and eliminate the need for large quantities of water and chemicals that are injected into the ground and the associated disposal costs. The system is an environmentally sound method for hydrocarbon extraction and provides significant benefits for carbon sequestering. 
Our web site provides information on this exciting technology. Please enjoy reading about the HPM system and contact us with any questions.

Energy company focusing on shale
Firm patented new technique, will move to GJ

By Charles Ashby

Thursday, July 21, 2016

The Grand Valley has landed yet another new company that hopes to change the way oil is extracted from the ground that its owners say could bring the industry back to western Colorado.
Thanks to a new tax credit program approved by the Colorado Legislature last year, the company qualified as the seventh under the Rural Jump-Start Tax Credit Program.
Called General Synfuels International, the company has patented a way to remove oil and natural gas from shale that it says not only is environmentally safe, but economically feasible.
Using a technique called in-situ processing, the company uses a heat conduit to free oil and gas from the shale, all of which happens below ground, meaning nothing is released into the atmosphere, said Dave Kanuch, vice president and chief engineer for the company.
Kanuch said the technology has the potential to be “a real game-changer” when it comes to oil and gas development for the West.
“We’re not extracting the oil shale like a lot of people have tried,” he said. “Our process is different in that we are extracting synthetic hydrocarbons from the oil shale. It’s kind of an upside-down refinery.”
While in-situ isn’t new, the company’s way of doing it is. It involves pumping heated gases into the bottom of a production well, which raises the temperature of the surrounding rock and oil-shale layers.
The company says the continuous heating of that rock and shale creates a hydrocarbon mix of hot gases, which then flow into a second conduit that is anchored to the opening of the well.
The process produces medium and light crude oil and associated gases, such as hydrogen, methane, propane and butane, Kanuch said, adding that the company plans to have a prototype completed by 2018.
If that works, the company will test the process in a deeper well, with the hope that if all works as planned, they’ll be in full production not long after that.
“The component of oil shale, which is kerogen, is what we’re really after,” he said. “It’s a highly complex molecule, and we believe our process breaks that down to a manageable state where we can synthesize it on the surface. We don’t use any water. We’re actually a net water producer.”
Kanach said the company expects to hire 15 people this year, and another 15 next year, with the possibility of 65 to 100 after that.
If the technology proves to be viable, he said it could generate hundreds of secondary drilling and construction jobs as the company starts to pull oil from the shale.
The addition of GSI makes three oil and gas-related companies to be included in the Jump-Start program, which provides tax breaks for employers and their workers.
Last month, the Colorado Office of Economic Development and International Trade, which oversees the program, approved Qmast LLC into the program. That company also works on the oil shale side of things. It has a revolutionary and environmentally sound way of removing hydrocarbons from shale, tar sands and conventional oil and gas reservoirs through a high-powered microwave system.
That company hopes to hire 50 employees almost immediately, and up to 350 new workers over the next five years.
The third oil and gas company was one of the first to be approved for the program last year. ProStar Geocorp provides geospacial software that allows oil and gas companies, pipelines and utilities to better track all elements of their businesses.
The three companies have the potential of helping kick-start the extraction industry in the state, which could make Mesa County a focal point when it comes to high-tech businesses for energy development.
Creating economical ways to extract oil and gas from shale could lead to a resurgence in the industry for the entire Western Slope, said Kristi Pollard, executive director of the Grand Junction Economic Partnership, which is actively recruiting companies for the program.
“It’s fantastic to see the energy industry growing again in Mesa County,” Pollard said. “The county has a long history in energy, but we did lose many businesses in the past recession when energy prices dropped and jobs moved overseas. The Jump-Start tax credit program is not only bringing the energy business back to Mesa County, but creating a hub here for innovation and green technology in the energy space.”
The Jump-Start program has been hailed in the Grand Valley and elsewhere in the state — there are only two other qualified regions in the state, in Montrose and Las Animas counties — as doing more to bring new jobs to regions of the state that haven’t had the kind of economic recovery as seen on the Front Range.
Under it, companies are exempt from paying state income taxes for four years — with an option for four more — and receive sales and use tax refunds of purchases of all tangible personal property, but only if it is used exclusively in the Jump-Start zone, which in this case is all of Mesa County.
The program also allows up to 300 employees in all of the companies approved in a zone to receive income tax credits on all their wages for four years, with an option on another four.
To qualify, businesses must offer a product or service unlike any other company in the zone, and must partner with a college or university. In the case of all seven of the new companies, that school is Colorado Mesa University. That last part is intended to help keep graduates from leaving the region by helping them get good, high-paying jobs.
The other four companies approved for the program include Colorado Clean, a manufacturer of biodegradable plastic; KAART Group, which has developed a worldwide mapping program; TSW Analytical, a forensics lab that hopes to break into the marijuana-tracking industry; and REBCO Enterprises, which produces a soilless growing system that recycles water.
Together, the seven companies are expected to bring in more than 550 jobs by 2020, Pollard said.

Phase Boundary 

The phase boundary describes the narrow band of material that is being heated by the microwave radiation at a time.  A common misconception with microwave energy is a limited depth of penetration.  At the frequency of a common microwave oven, 2.45 GHz, microwaves will penetrate into rock containing hydrocarbons and water only a few inches or centimeters.  The power is coupled into this area because of the high permittivity values for water and hydrocarbons.  Once the water and hydrocarbons are removed, then the permittivity for most types of rocks is very low, so microwave energy couples into the adjacent rock beyond deplete rock region, heats this region, liquefies or vaporizes the hydrocarbons, and then continues to migrate outward into the rock–hence the term migrating phase boundary.
Based on careful measurements of the background permittivity of rock, it is possible for the migrating phase boundary to reach distance of 25 meters or greater.
