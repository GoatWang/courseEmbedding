                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

time to time, on the Subsequent Closing Dates thereafter pursuant
to the Trust Sale and Servicing Agreement and any other Further
Transfer and Servicing Agreements, to make payments to the
Noteholders and the Certificateholders, to make deposits into and
withdrawals from the Reserve Account and to pay the organizational,
start-up and transactional expenses of the Trust;

(d) to assign, grant, transfer,
pledge, mortgage and convey the Owner Trust Estate pursuant to the
terms of the Indenture and to hold, manage and distribute to the

Trust Sale and Servicing Agreement any portion of the Trust Estate
released from the lien of, and remitted to the Trust pursuant to,
the Indenture;

(e) to enter into and perform its
obligations and exercise its rights under the Basic Documents to
which it is to be a party;

(f) to engage in those activities,
including entering into agreements, that are necessary, suitable or
convenient to accomplish the foregoing or are incidental thereto or
connected therewith; and

(g) subject to compliance with the
Basic Documents, to engage in such other activities as may be
required in connection with conservation of the Owner Trust Estate
and the making of distributions to the Securityholders.

The Trust shall not engage in any
activity other than in connection with the foregoing or other than
as required or authorized by the terms of this Agreement or the
other Basic Documents.

Section 2.4 Appointment of
Owner Trustee . The Depositor hereby appoints the Owner Trustee
as trustee of the Trust to have all the rights, powers and duties
set forth herein.

Section 2.5 Initial Capital

July 10, 2014, of the foregoing contribution which constituted
the initial Owner Trust Estate. The Depositor shall pay
organizational expenses of the Trust as they may arise or shall,
upon the request of the Owner Trustee, promptly reimburse the Owner
Trustee for any such expenses paid by the Owner Trustee.

Section 2.6 Declaration of
Trust . The Owner Trustee hereby declares that it shall hold
the Owner Trust Estate (in the name of the Trust and not in the
Owner Trustee’s name for the Trust, except as required by,
and in accordance with, Section 2.8) in trust upon and subject
to the conditions set forth herein for the use and benefit of the
Certificateholders, subject to the obligations of the Trust under
the Basic Documents. It is the intention of the parties hereto that
the Trust constitute a statutory trust under the Statutory Trust
Act, that this Agreement constitute the governing instrument of

the Statutory Trust Act with respect to accomplishing the purposes
of the Trust.

Section 2.7 Liability of the
Certificateholders . Certificateholders and holders of
beneficial interests therein shall be entitled to the same
limitation of personal liability extended to stockholders of
private corporations for profit organized under the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.

Section 2.8 Title to Trust
Property . Legal title to all the Owner Trust Estate shall be
vested at all times in the Trust as a separate legal entity except

of the Owner Trust Estate to be vested in a trustee or trustees, in
which case title shall be deemed to be transferred to and vested in
the Owner Trustee, a co-trustee and/or a separate trustee, as the
case may be. Any such trustee shall take such part of the Owner
Trust Estate subject to the security interest of the Indenture
Trustee therein established under the Indenture. Such
trustee’s acceptance of its appointment shall constitute
acknowledgment of such security interest and shall constitute a
Grant to the Indenture Trustee of a security interest in all
property held by such trustee. Any such trustee shall prepare and
file all such financing statements naming such trustee as debtor
that are necessary or advisable to perfect, make effective or
continue the lien and security interest of the Indenture
Trustee.

Section 2.9 Situs of
Trust . The Trust shall be located and administered in the
States of Delaware or New York. All bank accounts maintained by the
Owner Trustee on behalf of the Trust shall be located in the State
of Delaware or the State of New York. The Trust shall not have any
employees in any State other than the State of Delaware; provided,
however, that nothing herein shall restrict or prohibit the Owner
Trustee from having employees within or without the State of
Delaware. Payments shall be received by the Trust only in the State
of Delaware or the State of New York, and payments shall be made by
the Trust only from the State of Delaware or the State of New York.
The only office of the Trust shall be the Corporate Trust Office of
the Owner Trustee in the State of Delaware.

Section 2.10 Representations
and Warranties of the Depositor . The Depositor hereby
represents and warrants to the Owner Trustee that:

(a) The Depositor has been duly
formed and is validly existing as an entity in good standing under
the laws of the State of Delaware, with power and authority to own
its properties and to conduct its business as such properties are

instrument (other than pursuant to the Basic Documents), or violate
any law or, to the best of the Depositor’s knowledge, any
order, rule or regulation applicable to the Depositor of any court
or of any federal or State regulatory body, administrative agency
or other governmental instrumentality having jurisdiction over the
Depositor or any of its properties.

purposes and will be treated as a division of the Depositor (or, if
the Depositor is disregarded as a separate entity for federal
income tax purposes, the Depositor’s first direct or indirect
parent entity that is not disregarded as a separate entity for
federal income tax purposes). If the Depositor is not the sole

an entity which is not disregarded as a separate entity for federal
income tax purposes, or (B) a partnership for federal income
tax purposes if the Certificates are owned by more than one Person
(as long as (1) such Persons are not disregarded as separate
entities for federal income tax purposes and (2) if such
Persons are disregarded as separate entities for federal income tax
purposes, such Persons are not treated as a division of the same
Person) and (ii) unless otherwise required by the appropriate
taxing authorities, agree to treat the Certificates as equity
interests in an entity as described in clause (i) of this
Section 2.11 for the purposes of federal income taxes, State
and local income and franchise taxes, and any other taxes imposed
upon, measured by, or based upon gross receipts or gross or net
income. The parties agree that, unless otherwise required by
appropriate tax authorities, the Trust shall file or cause to be
filed annual or other necessary returns, reports and other forms
consistent with such characterization of the Trust for such tax
purposes.

upon the written order of the Depositor, signed by its chairman of
the board, its president or any vice president, without further
limited liability company action by the Depositor. Such Certificate
shall be issued to and held by the Depositor, as the initial
Certificateholder. No Certificate shall entitle its holder to any
benefit under this Agreement, or shall be valid for any purpose,
unless there shall appear on such Certificate a certificate of
authentication substantially in the form set forth in Exhibit A,

transferee or assignee agrees to take positions for tax purposes
consistent with the tax positions agreed to be taken by the

Section 3.4(g) , (h)  and (i)
 have been satisfied and (v) in connection with any
transfer of less than all of the interests in the Certificates, the
transferor and transferee shall specify the respective interests in
the Certificates to be held by the transferor and transferee, which
interests may be determined by a formula or on any other basis
agreed by the transferor and transferee. No Certificate (other than
the Certificates issued to and held by the Depositor) may be
subdivided upon transfer or exchange in a manner such that the
resulting Certificate represents less than a 2.00% fractional
undivided interest in the Trust (or such other amount as the
Depositor may determine in order to prevent the Trust from being
treated as a “publicly traded partnership” under
Section 7704 of the Code, but in no event less than a 1.00%
fractional undivided interest in the Trust). In addition, no
transfer of a Certificate shall be registered unless the transferee
shall have provided to the Owner Trustee and the Certificate
Registrar an opinion of counsel that in connection with such
transfer no registration of the Certificates is required under the
Securities Act or applicable State securities law or that such
transfer is otherwise being made in accordance with all applicable
federal and State securities laws. If agreed by the transferor and
transferee, different interests may be used for distributions of
proceeds and for purposes of voting the Certificates. The
transferor shall notify the Owner Trustee of any such agreement in
connection with such transfer.

(c) In the event that the Depositor
is no longer the sole Certificateholder, the Administrator will
promptly prepare amendments (subject to the provisions regarding
amendments in the applicable Basic Documents) to the Basic
Documents to the extent necessary to reflect the establishment of
the Certificate Distribution Account and the making of
distributions to the Certificateholders and such other matters as
shall be agreed between the Depositor and the Owner Trustee. The
expense of the foregoing amendments shall be paid by the
Administrator.

(d) Upon surrender for registration
of transfer of any Certificate at the office or agency maintained
pursuant to Section 3.8 , the Owner Trustee shall
execute on behalf of the Trust, authenticate and deliver (or shall
cause its authenticating agent to authenticate and deliver), in the
name of the designated transferee or transferees, one or more new
Certificates of a like aggregate percentage interest in the Trust
dated the date of authentication by the Owner Trustee or any
authenticating agent.
 
6



(e) At the option of a Holder,
Certificates may be exchanged for other Certificates of a like
percentage interest in the Trust, as shown on the applicable
Certificates, upon surrender of the Certificates to be exchanged at
the office or agency maintained pursuant to Section 3.8
. Whenever any Certificates are so surrendered for exchange, the
Owner Trustee shall execute on behalf of the Trust, authenticate
and deliver (or shall cause its authenticating agent to
authenticate and deliver) one or more Certificates dated the date
of authentication by the Owner Trustee or any authenticating agent.
Such Certificates shall be delivered to the Holder making the
exchange.

(f) Every Certificate presented or
surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange shall be
accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form
satisfactory to the Owner Trustee and the Certificate Registrar
duly executed by the Holder or his attorney duly authorized in
writing and such other documents and instruments as may be required
by Section 3.4(b) . Each Certificate surrendered for
registration of transfer or exchange shall be canceled and
subsequently destroyed or otherwise disposed of by the Owner
Trustee or Certificate Registrar in accordance with its customary
practice.

(g) The Owner Trustee or the
Certificate Registrar may require payment of a sum sufficient to
cover any tax or governmental charge that may be imposed and any
other expenses of the Owner Trustee in connection with any transfer
or exchange of Certificates.

(h) The Certificates may not be
acquired by or for the account of a Benefit Plan other than an
“insurance company general account,” as defined in
Prohibited Transaction Class Exemption (“ PTCE
”) 95-60, whose underlying assets include less than 25%
“plan assets” and for which the purchase and holding of
Certificates is eligible and satisfies all conditions for relief
under PTCE 95-60. The Certificates also may not be acquired by or
for the account of an employee benefit plan or plan that is not
subject to the provisions of Title I of ERISA or Section 4975
of the Code (including non-U.S. or governmental plans) if such
acquisition would result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction
under, or a violation of, any applicable law that is substantially
similar to Title I of ERISA or Section 4975 of the
Code.

(i) The Certificates may
(A) only be acquired by or for the account of a Person who is
a United States Person (within the meaning of
Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) and (B) not be acquired
by or for the account of a Special Pass-Through Entity. For the
purposes of this Section 3.5(i), “ Special
Pass-Through Entity ” means a grantor trust, S
corporation, or partnership (or a disregarded entity, the single
owner of which is any of the foregoing) where more than 50% of the
value of a beneficial owner’s interest in such pass through
entity is attributable to the pass-through entity’s interest
in the Certificates.

(j) Each Certificateholder and/or
beneficial owner of a Certificate that would be subject to U.S.
federal withholding tax imposed by FATCA if such person were to
fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA
(including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of
the Code, as applicable), shall deliver to the Owner Trustee,
Paying Agent, Administrator or any person designated by any of the
foregoing (individually or collectively as the context may require,
the “ FATCA Administrator ”) at the time or
times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably
requested by the FATCA Administrator such documentation prescribed
by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section
 
7


1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such
additional documentation reasonably requested by the FATCA
Administrator to comply with FATCA and to determine that such
Certificateholder and/or beneficial owner of a Certificate has
complied with such person’s obligations under FATCA or to
determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment to
such person.

(k) No transfer shall be permitted
if such transfer is effected through an established securities
market or secondary market (or the substantial equivalent thereof)
within the meaning of Section 7704 of the Code and any
regulation thereunder.

(l) In connection with the transfer
of a Certificate, the Trust shall determine in its sole discretion
that the transfer complies with the requirements of
Section 3.4(i) and 3.4(k) of this
Agreement.

Section 3.5 Mutilated,
Destroyed, Lost or Stolen Certificates.

(a) If (i) any mutilated
Certificate is surrendered to the Certificate Registrar, or the
Certificate Registrar receives evidence to its satisfaction of the
destruction, loss or theft of any Certificate, and (ii) there
is delivered to the Certificate Registrar, the Owner Trustee and
the Trust such security or indemnity as may be required by them to
hold each of them harmless, then, in the absence of notice to the
Certificate Registrar or the Owner Trustee that such Certificate
has been acquired by a protected purchaser, the Owner Trustee shall
execute on behalf of the Trust and the Owner Trustee shall
authenticate and deliver (or shall cause its authenticating agent
to authenticate and deliver), in exchange for or in lieu of any
such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Certificate, a
replacement Certificate of a like percentage interest in the Trust,
as shown on the Certificate; provided , however ,
that if any such destroyed, lost or stolen Certificate, but not a
mutilated Certificate, shall have become or within seven
(7) days shall be payable, then instead of issuing a
replacement Certificate the Owner Trustee may make distributions to
such destroyed, lost or stolen Certificate when so
payable.

(b) If, after the delivery of a
replacement Certificate or payment in respect of a destroyed, lost
or stolen Certificate pursuant to Section 3.5(a) , a
protected purchaser of the original Certificate in lieu of which
such replacement Certificate was issued presents for payment or
distribution such original Certificate, the Owner Trustee shall be
entitled to recover such replacement Certificate (and any
distributions or payments made with respect thereto) or such
payment or distribution from the Person to whom it was delivered or
any Person taking such replacement Certificate from such Person to
whom such replacement Certificate was delivered or any assignee of
such Person, except a protected purchaser, and shall be entitled to
recover upon the security or indemnity provided therefor to the
extent of any loss, damage, cost or expense incurred by the Owner
Trustee in connection therewith.

(c) In connection with the issuance
of any replacement Certificate under this Section 3.5 ,
the Owner Trustee may require the payment by the Holder of such
Certificate of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other
governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any
other reasonable expenses (including the fees and expenses of the
Owner Trustee and the Certificate Registrar) connected
therewith.
 
8



(d) Any duplicate Certificate issued
pursuant to this Section 3.5 in replacement of any
mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Certificate shall constitute
an original additional beneficial interest in the Trust, whether or
not the mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Certificate shall be
found at any time or be enforced by anyone, and shall be entitled
to all the benefits of this Agreement equally and proportionately
with any and all other Certificates duly issued
hereunder.

(e) The provisions of this
Section 3.5 are exclusive and shall preclude (to the
extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the
replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen
Certificates.

Section 3.6 Persons Deemed
Certificateholders . Prior to due presentation of a Certificate
for registration of transfer, the Owner Trustee or the Certificate
Registrar may treat the Person in whose name any Certificate shall
be registered in the Certificate Register as the Certificateholder
of such Certificate for the purpose of receiving distributions
pursuant to Article V and for all other purposes whatsoever, and
neither the Owner Trustee nor the Certificate Registrar shall be
affected by any notice to the contrary.

Section 3.7 Access to List
of Certificateholders’ Names and Addresses . The
Certificate Registrar shall furnish or cause to be furnished to the
Servicer and the Depositor, within fifteen (15) days after
receipt by the Certificate Registrar of a request therefor from the
Servicer or the Depositor in writing, a list of the names and
addresses of the Certificateholders as of the most recent Record
Date. Each Holder, by receiving and holding a Certificate, shall be
deemed to have agreed not to hold any of the Servicer, the
Depositor, the Certificate Registrar or the Owner Trustee
accountable by reason of the disclosure of its name and address,
regardless of the source from which such information was
derived.

Section 3.8 Maintenance of
Corporate Trust Office . The Owner Trustee shall maintain an
office or offices or agency or agencies where Certificates may be
surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange and where
notices and demands to or upon the Owner Trustee in respect of the
Certificates and the Basic Documents may be served. The Owner
Trustee initially designates its office located at 301 Bellevue
Parkway, 3rd Floor, Wilmington, Delaware 19809, as its principal
office for such purposes. The Owner Trustee shall give prompt
written notice to the Depositor, to the Servicer and to the
Certificateholders of any change in the location of the Certificate
Register or any such office or agency.

Section 3.9 Appointment of
Paying Agent . Except as otherwise provided in
Section 5.2, the Paying Agent shall make distributions to
Certificateholders from the Certificate Distribution Account
pursuant to Section 5.2 and shall report the amounts of such
distributions to the Owner Trustee and the Servicer; provided,
however, that no such reports shall be required so long as the
Depositor is the sole Certificateholder. Any Paying Agent shall
have the revocable power to withdraw funds from the Certificate
Distribution Account for the purpose of making the distributions
referred to above. The Owner Trustee may revoke such power and
remove the Paying Agent if the Owner Trustee determines in its sole
discretion that the Paying Agent shall have failed to perform its
obligations under this Agreement in any material respect. The
Paying Agent shall initially be BNY Mellon Trust of Delaware, and
any co-paying agent chosen by BNY Mellon Trust of Delaware. BNY
Mellon Trust of Delaware shall be permitted to resign as
 
9


Paying Agent upon thirty (30) days’
written notice to the Owner Trustee. If BNY Mellon Trust of
Delaware shall no longer be the Paying Agent, the Owner Trustee
shall appoint a successor to act as Paying Agent (which shall be a
bank or trust company). The Owner Trustee shall cause such
successor Paying Agent or any additional Paying Agent appointed by
the Owner Trustee to execute and deliver to the Owner Trustee an
instrument in which such successor Paying Agent or additional
Paying Agent shall agree with the Owner Trustee that as Paying
Agent, such successor Paying Agent or additional Paying Agent shall
hold all sums, if any, held by it for payment to the
Certificateholders in trust for the benefit of the
Certificateholders entitled thereto until such sums shall be paid
to such Certificateholders. The Paying Agent shall return all
unclaimed funds to the Owner Trustee and upon removal of a Paying
Agent such Paying Agent shall also return all funds in its
possession to the Owner Trustee. The provisions of Sections 6.3,
6.6, 6.7 and 6.9 shall apply to the Owner Trustee also in its role
as Paying Agent or Certificate Registrar for so long as the Owner
Trustee shall act as Paying Agent or Certificate Registrar and, to
the extent applicable, to any other paying agent, certificate
registrar or authenticating agent appointed hereunder. Any
reference in this Agreement to the Paying Agent shall include any
co-paying agent unless the context requires otherwise.

Section 3.10 Depositor as
Certificateholder . The Depositor in its individual or any
other capacity may become the owner or pledgee of Certificates and
may otherwise deal with the Owner Trustee or its Affiliates as if
it were not the Depositor.

Certificateholders with Respect to Bankruptcy . Notwithstanding
any prior termination of this Agreement, the Owner Trustee shall

and the delivery to the Owner Trustee by each such Majority
Certificateholder of a certificate certifying that such Majority
Certificateholder reasonably believes that the Trust is insolvent;
provided, however, that under no circumstances shall the Owner
Trustee commence or join in commencing any such case prior to the
date that is one year and one day after the termination of the
Trust.

Section 4.4 Restrictions on
Certificateholders’ Power . No Certificateholder shall
direct the Owner Trustee to take or refrain from taking any action

ARTICLE V

APPLICATION OF TRUST FUNDS;
CERTAIN DUTIES

Section 5.1 Establishment of
Certificate Distribution Account.

(a) Except as otherwise provided in
Section 5.2 , the Servicer, for the benefit of the
Certificateholders, shall establish and maintain in the name of the
Trust an Eligible Deposit Account known as the Capital Auto
Receivables Asset Trust 2014-3 Certificate Distribution Account
(the “ Certificate Distribution Account ”),
bearing an additional designation clearly indicating that the funds
deposited therein are held for the benefit of the
Certificateholders.

(b) The Trust shall possess all
right, title and interest in and to all funds on deposit from time
to time in the Certificate Distribution Account and in all proceeds
thereof. Except as otherwise provided herein, in the Indenture or
in the Trust Sale and Servicing Agreement, the Certificate
Distribution Account shall be under the sole dominion and control
of the Owner Trustee or the Paying Agent for the benefit of the
Certificateholders. If, at any time, the Certificate Distribution
Account ceases to be an Eligible Deposit Account, the Owner Trustee
(or the Servicer on behalf of the Owner Trustee, if the Certificate
Distribution Account is not then held by the Owner Trustee or an
Affiliate thereof) shall within ten (10) Business Days (or
such longer period, not to exceed thirty (30) calendar days,
as to which each Rating Agency may consent) establish a new
Certificate Distribution Account as an Eligible Deposit Account and
shall transfer any cash and/or any investments to such new
Certificate Distribution Account.

Section 5.2 Application of
Trust Funds.

(a) On each Distribution Date, the
Owner Trustee or the Paying Agent shall distribute to the
Certificateholders, on a pro rata basis, amounts equal to the
amounts deposited in the Certificate Distribution Account pursuant
to Sections 4.06 and 4.07 of the Trust Sale and Servicing Agreement
on or prior to such Distribution Date. Notwithstanding the
foregoing or anything else to the contrary in this Agreement or the
other Basic Documents, if and for so long as Certificates
representing in the aggregate a 100% beneficial interest in the
Trust are held by the Depositor, (i) no Certificate
Distribution Account shall be required to be established or
maintained and (ii) all distributions and payments on the
Certificates (including the final distribution as contemplated by
Section 7.1(c) hereof) required hereunder or under the
Trust Sale and Servicing Agreement shall be made directly to the
Depositor by the Indenture Trustee (whether or not the Trust Sale
and Servicing Agreement otherwise contemplates deposit into the
Certificate Distribution Account) and the Owner Trustee shall have
no duty or liability to see to such distribution.

(b) On each Distribution Date, the
Owner Trustee shall send to each Certificateholder the statement
provided to the Owner Trustee by the Servicer pursuant to
Section 4.09(a) of the Trust Sale and Servicing Agreement on
such Distribution Date; provided that no such statement shall be
required to be sent by the Owner Trustee if and for so long as the
Depositor is the sole Certificateholder.
 
12



(c) If any withholding tax is
imposed on the Trust’s payment (or allocations of income) to
a Certificateholder, such tax shall reduce the amount otherwise
distributable to the Certificateholder in accordance with this
Section 5.2 ; provided that the Owner Trustee or the
Paying Agent shall not have an obligation to withhold any such
amount if and for so long as the Depositor is the sole
Certificateholder. The Owner Trustee or the Paying Agent is hereby
authorized and directed to retain from amounts otherwise
distributable to the Certificateholders sufficient funds for the
payment of any tax that is legally owed by the Trust (but such
authorization shall not prevent the Owner Trustee or the Paying
Agent from contesting any such tax in appropriate proceedings and
withholding payment of such tax, if permitted by law, pending the
outcome of such proceedings). The amount of any withholding tax
imposed with respect to a Certificateholder shall be treated as
cash distributed to such Certificateholder at the time it is
withheld by the Trust and remitted to the appropriate taxing
authority. If there is a possibility that withholding tax is
payable with respect to a distribution (such as a distribution to a
non-U.S. Certificateholder), the Owner Trustee or the Paying Agent
may in its sole discretion withhold such amounts in accordance with
this Section 5.2(c) . If a Certificateholder wishes to
apply for a refund of any such withholding tax, the Owner Trustee
or the Paying Agent shall reasonably cooperate with such
Certificateholder in making such claim so long as such
Certificateholder agrees to reimburse the Owner Trustee or the
Paying Agent for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred.

(d) If the Indenture Trustee holds
escheated funds for payment to the Trust pursuant to
Section 3.3(e) of the Indenture, the Owner Trustee shall, upon
notice from the Indenture Trustee that such funds exist, submit on
behalf of the Trust an Issuing Entity Order to the Indenture
Trustee pursuant to Section 3.3(e) of the Indenture
instructing the Indenture Trustee to pay such funds to or at the
order of the Depositor.

Section 5.3 Method of
Payment . Subject to Section 7.1(c), distributions
required to be made to Certificateholders on any Distribution Date
shall be made to each Certificateholder of record on the related
Record Date by wire transfer, in immediately available funds, to
the account of such Holder at a bank or other entity having
appropriate facilities therefore, if such Certificateholder shall
have provided to the Certificate Registrar appropriate written
instructions at least five (5) Business Days prior to such
Record Date or if not, by check mailed to such Certificateholder at
the address of such Certificateholder appearing in the Certificate
Register.

Section 5.4 Accounting and
Reports to the Certificateholders, the Internal Revenue Service and
Others . The Owner Trustee shall maintain (or cause to be
maintained) the books of the Trust on a calendar year basis on the
accrual method of accounting, deliver to each Certificateholder, as
may be required by the Code and applicable Treasury Regulations or
otherwise, such information as may be required to enable each
Certificateholder to prepare its federal income tax return, file
such tax returns relating to the Trust and make such elections as
may from time to time be required or appropriate under any
applicable State or federal statute or rule or regulation
thereunder so as to maintain the Trust’s characterization as
an entity described in Section 2.11(i) for federal income tax
purposes, cause such tax returns to be signed in the manner
required by law and collect or cause to be collected any
withholding tax as described in and in accordance with
Section 5.2(c) with respect to income or distributions to
Certificateholders. If the Trust were to become a partnership in
accordance with Section 2.11 or the Internal Revenue Service
were to contend successfully that the Trust is not a
disregarded
 
13


entity but is rather a partnership for federal
income tax purposes, the Trust shall allocate items of income,
gain, deduction and loss to the partners of the Trust in accordance
with their economic interests in the Trust. With respect to
interest expense of the Trust, the Trust shall allocate to the
Certificateholders their share of the entire amount of such
interest expense.

Section 5.5 Signature on
Returns; Other Tax Matters . The Owner Trustee shall sign on
behalf of the Trust any and all tax returns of the Trust, unless
applicable law requires a Certificateholder to sign such documents,
in which case such documents shall be signed by the Depositor. To
the extent one may be required, the Depositor shall be the
“tax matters partner” of the Trust pursuant to the
Code.

ARTICLE VI

THE OWNER TRUSTEE

Section 6.1 Duties of Owner
Trustee.

(a) The Owner Trustee undertakes to

Certificateholders, subject to the Basic Documents and in
accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. No implied
covenants or obligations shall be read into this
Agreement.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Owner Trustee shall be deemed to have discharged its duties and
responsibilities hereunder and under the other Basic Documents to
the extent the Administrator has agreed in the Administration
Agreement to perform any act or to discharge any duty of the Trust
or the Owner Trustee hereunder or under any other Basic Document,
and the Owner Trustee shall not be liable for the default or
failure of the Administrator to carry out its obligations under the
Administration Agreement.

(c) In the absence of bad faith on
its part, the Owner Trustee may conclusively rely upon certificates
or opinions furnished to the Owner Trustee and conforming to the
requirements of this Agreement in determining the truth of the
statements and the correctness of the opinions contained therein;
provided , however , that the Owner Trustee shall
have examined such certificates or opinions so as to determine
compliance of the same with the requirements of this
Agreement.

(d) The Owner Trustee may not be
relieved from liability for its own negligent action, its own
negligent failure to act or its own willful misconduct, except
that:

shall not limit the effect of Section 6.1(a) or
6.1(b) ;

liable for any error of judgment made in good faith by a
Responsible Officer unless it is proved that the Owner Trustee was

law, and the Owner Trustee shall not be liable for any interest
thereon.

(f) The Owner Trustee shall not take
any action that (i) is inconsistent with the purposes of the
Trust set forth in Section 2.3 or (ii) would, to
the actual knowledge of a Responsible Officer of the Owner Trustee,
result in the Trust’s becoming taxable as a corporation for
United States federal income tax purposes. The Certificateholders
shall not direct the Owner Trustee to take action that would
violate the provisions of this Section 6.1 .

Section 6.2 Rights of Owner
Trustee . The Owner Trustee is authorized and directed to
execute and deliver the Basic Documents and each certificate or
other document attached as an exhibit to or contemplated by the
Basic Documents to which the Trust is to be a party, in such form
as the Depositor shall approve as evidenced conclusively by the
Owner Trustee’s execution thereof. In addition to the
foregoing, the Owner Trustee is authorized, but shall not be
obligated, to take all actions required of the Trust pursuant to
the Basic Documents. The Owner Trustee is further authorized from
time to time to take such action as the Administrator recommends
and directs in writing with respect to the Basic
Documents.

Section 6.3 Acceptance of
Trusts and Duties . Except as otherwise provided in this
Article VI, in accepting the trusts hereby created, BNY Mellon
Trust of Delaware acts solely as Owner Trustee hereunder and not in
its individual capacity and all Persons having any claim against
the Owner Trustee by reason of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or any other Basic Document shall look only to the
Owner Trust Estate for payment or satisfaction thereof. The Owner

duties hereunder with respect to such trusts but only upon the
terms of this Agreement. The Owner Trustee also agrees to disburse
all monies actually received by it constituting part of the Owner
Trust Estate upon the terms of the Basic Documents. The Owner
Trustee shall not be liable or accountable hereunder or under any
other Basic Document under any circumstances, except for its own
negligent action, its own negligent failure to act or its own
willful misconduct or in the case of the inaccuracy of any
representation or warranty contained in Section 6.6 and
expressly made by the Owner Trustee. In particular, but not by way
of limitation (and subject to the exceptions set forth in the
preceding sentence):

(a) the Owner Trustee shall at no

      Fitch to Rate Capital Auto Receivables Asset Trust 2014-3; Issues Presale
    





August 22, 2014 11:01 AM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Link to Fitch Ratings' Report: Capital Auto Receivables Asset Trust 
      2014-3 (US ABS)
    

http://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/reports/report_frame.cfm?rpt_id=757527


      Fitch Ratings expects to assign the following ratings and Rating 
      Outlooks to the notes issued by Capital Auto Receivables Asset Trust 
      (CARAT) 2014-3:
    

      --$255,000,000 class A-1 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$166,000,000 class A-2 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$166,000,000 class A-3 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$56,400,000 class A-4 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$38,200,000 class B notes 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$36,190,000 class C notes 'Asf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$32,170,000 class D notes 'BBBsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$28,150,000 class E notes 'NR'.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Stable Collateral Characteristics: The 2014-3 pool is representative of 
      nonprime collateral, with a 632 weighted average (WA) Fair Isaac Corp. 
      (FICO) score, 7.87% WA APR and 100% WA LTV. 63% of the pool consists of 
      new vehicle contracts, while extended-term contracts total 73%, all 
      relatively consistent with recent securitized pools.
    

      One-year Revolving Period Risk: The revolving structure introduces risk 
      of collateral migrating to a weaker pool before the start of the 
      amortization period, although eligibility criteria pertaining to the 
      additional receivables mitigate this risk to an extent. Fitch accounts 
      for this risk in its derivation of the 5.50% base case loss proxy for 
      2014-3.
    

      Adequate Credit Enhancement: Initial hard credit enhancement (CE) is 
      consistent with all prior transactions. The reserve is 0.50% 
      non-declining, and initial overcollateralization (OC) is 3.25% (both of 
      the initial pool balance) growing to a target of 4.75% post revolving 
      period. Excess spread totals 4.61% per annum, down from 2014-2 (NR).
    

      Stable Portfolio Performance: AFIN's non-prime U.S. auto loan portfolio 
      exhibited improved performance in 2009-2013 relative to the weak 
      2006-2008 period, supported by gradual improvement in the U.S. economy 
      and healthy used vehicle values.
    

      Stable Corporate Health: Fitch currently rates AFIN 'BB+/B Stable Rating 
      Outlook. AFIN demonstrates solid capabilities as an originator, 
      underwriter, and servicer, as evidenced by its historical prime and 
      non-prime portfolios and securitization performance.
    

      Legal Structure Integrity: The legal structure of the transaction should 
      provide that a bankruptcy of AFIN would not impair the timeliness of 
      payments on the securities.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity 
      on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base 
      case. This in turn could result in potential rating actions on the 
      notes. Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to each 
      class of CARAT 2014-3 to increased losses over the life of the 
      transaction. Fitch's analysis found that each class of notes displays 
      some sensitivity to increased defaults and losses, with some classes 
      showing potential downgrades of up to two rating categories under 
      Fitch's moderate (1.5x base case loss) scenario. Some classes of notes 
      could experience downgrades of more than three rating categories under 
      Fitch's severe (2.0x base case loss) scenario.
    

      Key rating drivers and rating sensitivities are further detailed in the 
      accompanying presale report at 'www.fitchratings.com' 
      or by clicking on the above link.
    

      Fitch's analysis of the Representation and Warranties (R&W) of this 
      transaction can be found in 'Capital Auto Receivables Asset Trust 
      2014-3--Appendix'. These R&W are compared to those of typical R&W for 
      the asset class as detailed in Fitch's April 17, 2012 special report, 
      'Representations, Warranties, and Enforcement Mechanisms in the Global 
      Structured Finance Transactions'.

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      The rating actions are based on available credit enhancement (CE) and 
      loss performance to date. The collateral pool continues to perform 
      within Fitch's expectations. Under the current structure and CE, the 
      securities are able to withstand stress scenarios consistent with the 
      assigned ratings and make full payments to investors in accordance with 
      the terms of the documents.
    

      The initial recommended loss proxy of 5.50% for 2014-3 incorporated an 
      additional stress considering the potential post-revolving worst-case 
      collateral pool. This approach took into consideration a negative 
      migration of the pool characteristics assuming the collateral migrates 
      to the maximum collateral concentration limits during the revolving 
      period.
    

      To date, the additional collateral added to the pool in the revolving 
      period has been consistent when compared to the initial pool and there 
      have been minimal negative migrations with only one month left before 
      the revolving period ends. After which, the transaction will begin to 
      amortize. As a result of the consistent collateral, increased seasoning, 
      and low loss performance, Fitch revised its loss proxy down to 4.75%. 
      The revised proxy excludes the aforementioned additional stress given 
      that there is only one month left during the revolving period and Fitch 
      expects the collateral to be very similar to the original pool mix at 
      the end of this period.
    

      The ratings reflect the quality of Ally Financial Inc.'s (AFIN) retail 
      auto loan originations, the sound financial and legal structure of the 
      transaction, and the strength of the servicing provided by Ally.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity 
      could produce loss levels higher than the current projected base case 
      loss proxies and impact available loss coverage and multiples levels for 
      the transactions. Lower loss coverage could affect the ratings and 
      Rating Outlooks depending on the extent of the decline in coverage.
    

      In Fitch's initial review of the transactions, the notes were found to 
      have limited sensitivity to a 1.5x and 2.5x increase of Fitch's base 
      case loss expectations. To date, the transactions have exhibited strong 
      performance with losses well within Fitch's initial expectations, with 
      rising loss coverage and multiple levels. As such, a material 
      deterioration in performance would have to occur within the asset pools 
      to have potential negative impact on the outstanding ratings.
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      No third-party due diligence was provided or reviewed in relation to 
      this rating action.

ARTICLE III

ADMINISTRATION AND SERVICING OF
RECEIVABLES

SECTION 3.01 Duties of the
Servicer.

(a) The Servicer is hereby appointed
and authorized to act as agent for the Owner of the Receivables and
in such capacity shall manage, service, administer and process
collections on the Receivables with reasonable care, using that
degree of skill and attention that the Servicer exercises with
respect to comparable motor vehicle related receivables that it
services for itself or others. The Servicer hereby accepts such
appointment and authorization and agrees to perform the duties of
Servicer with respect to the Receivables set forth herein and in
the Further Transfer and Servicing Agreements.

(b) The Servicer’s duties
shall include collection and posting of all payments, responding to
inquiries of Obligors, investigating delinquencies, sending billing
statements to Obligors, policing the collateral, including
remarketing repossessed and returned Financed Vehicles, accounting
for collections and furnishing monthly and annual statements to the
Owner of any Receivables with respect to distributions, generating
federal income tax information and performing the other duties
specified herein. Subject to the provisions of
Section 3.02 , the Servicer shall follow its customary
standards, policies and procedures and shall have full power and
authority, acting alone, to do any and all things in connection
with such managing, servicing, administration and collection that
it may deem necessary or desirable.

(c) Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, the Servicer is hereby authorized and empowered
by the Owner of the Receivables, pursuant to this
Section 3.01 , to execute and deliver, on behalf of all
Interested Parties, or any of them, any and all instruments of
satisfaction or cancellation, or of partial or full release or
discharge, and all other comparable instruments, with respect to
the Receivables and the Financed Vehicles (including proceeds). The
Servicer is hereby authorized to (i) commence, in its own name
or in the name of the Owner of such Receivable a legal proceeding,
whether through judicial process or (with respect to repossession
of a Financed Vehicle) non-judicial process, (ii) participate
in a voluntary or involuntary liquidation proceeding to enforce a
Liquidating Receivable or Receivable as contemplated by
Section 3.03 , (iii) enforce all obligations of
the Seller, the Servicer, CARI or the Issuing Entity under this
Agreement and under the Further Transfer and Servicing Agreements
or (iv) commence or participate in a legal proceeding
(including a bankruptcy case) relating to or involving a Receivable
or a Liquidating Receivable. If the Servicer commences or
participates in such a legal proceeding in its own name, the
Servicer is hereby authorized and empowered by the Owner of the
Receivables pursuant to this Section 3.01 to obtain
possession of the related Financed Vehicle and immediately and
without further action on the part of the Owner or the Servicer,
the Owner of such Receivable shall thereupon automatically assign
in trust such Receivable and the security interest in the related
Financed Vehicle to the Servicer for the benefit of the Interested
Parties immediately prior to such legal or liquidation proceeding
for purposes of commencing or participating in any such proceeding
as a party or claimant. Upon such automatic assignment, the
Servicer will be, and will have all the rights and duties of, a
secured party under the UCC and other applicable law with respect
to such Receivable and the related Financed Vehicle. At the
Servicer’s request from time to time, the Owner of a
Receivable assigned under this Section 3.01 shall
provide the Servicer with evidence of the assignment in trust for
the benefit of the Interested Parties as may be reasonably
necessary for the Servicer to take any of the actions set forth in
the following sentence.
 
6



(d) The Servicer is hereby
authorized and empowered by the Owner of a Receivable to execute
and deliver in the Servicer’s name any notices, demands,
claims, complaints, responses, affidavits or other documents or
instruments in connection with any such proceeding. Any Owner of
Receivables shall furnish the Servicer with any powers of attorney
and other documents and take any other steps which the Servicer may
deem necessary or appropriate to enable the Servicer to carry out
its servicing and administrative duties under this Agreement and
the Further Transfer and Servicing Agreements. Except to the extent
required by the preceding two sentences, the authority and rights
granted to the Servicer in this Section 3.01 shall be
nonexclusive and shall not be construed to be in derogation of the
retention by the Owner of a Receivable of equivalent authority and
rights.

SECTION 3.02 Collection of
Receivable Payments . The Servicer shall make reasonable
efforts to collect all payments called for under the terms and
provisions of the Receivables as and when the same shall become
due, and shall follow such collection practices, policies and
procedures as it follows with respect to comparable motor vehicle
related receivables that it services for itself or others in
connection therewith. Except as provided in
Section 3.06(a)(iii) , the Servicer is hereby
authorized to grant extensions, rebates or adjustments on a
Receivable without the prior consent of the Owner of such
Receivable. The Servicer is authorized in its discretion to waive
any prepayment charge, late payment charge or any other fees that
may be collected in the ordinary course of servicing such
Receivable.

SECTION 3.03 Realization Upon
Liquidating Receivables . The Servicer shall use reasonable
efforts, consistent with its customary practices, policies and
procedures, to repossess or otherwise comparably convert the
ownership or gain control of any Financed Vehicle that it has
reasonably determined should be repossessed or otherwise converted
following a default under the Receivable secured by the Financed
Vehicle. The Servicer is authorized to follow such customary
practices, policies and procedures as it follows with respect to
comparable motor vehicle related receivables that it services for
itself or others, which customary practices, policies and
procedures may include reasonable efforts to realize upon any
recourse to Dealers, selling the related Financed Vehicle at public
or private sale and other actions by the Servicer in order to
realize upon such a Receivable. The Servicer is hereby authorized
to exercise its discretion consistent with its customary practices,
policies and procedures and the terms of the Basic Documents, in
servicing Liquidating Receivables so as to maximize the net
collection of those Liquidating Receivables, including the
discretion to choose to sell or not to sell any of the Liquidating
Receivables itself on behalf of the Depositor or any other Owner.
The Servicer shall not be liable for any such exercise of its
discretion made in good faith and in accordance with such servicing
procedures. The foregoing is subject to the provision that, in any
case in which the Financed Vehicle shall have suffered damage, the
Servicer shall not expend funds in connection with any repair or
towards the repossession of such Financed Vehicle unless it shall
determine in its discretion that such repair and/or repossession
shall increase the proceeds of liquidation of the related
Receivable by an amount greater than the amount of such expenses.
The Servicer shall be entitled to receive Liquidation Expenses with
respect to each Liquidating Receivable at such time as the
Receivable becomes a Liquidating Receivable (or as may otherwise be
provided in the Further Transfer and Servicing
Agreements).

SECTION 3.04 Maintenance of
Insurance Policies . The Servicer shall, in accordance with its
customary practices, policies and procedures, require that each
Obligor shall have obtained physical damage insurance covering the
Financed Vehicle as of the execution of the related Receivable. The
Servicer shall, in accordance with its customary practices,
policies and procedures, track such physical damage insurance with
respect to each Receivable.

SECTION 3.05 Maintenance of
Security Interests in Vehicles . The Servicer shall, in
accordance with its customary practices, policies and procedures
and at its own expense, take such steps as are necessary to
maintain perfection of the security interest created by each
Receivable in the related Financed Vehicle. The Owner of each
Receivable hereby authorizes the Servicer to re-perfect such
security interest on behalf of such Owner, as necessary because of
the relocation of a Financed Vehicle, or for any other
reason.

SECTION 3.06 Covenants,
Representations and Warranties of the Servicer . As of the

      Link to Fitch Ratings' Report: Capital Auto Receivables Asset Trust 
      2014-3 (US ABS)
    

http://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/reports/report_frame.cfm?rpt_id=757527


      Fitch Ratings expects to assign the following ratings and Rating 
      Outlooks to the notes issued by Capital Auto Receivables Asset Trust 
      (CARAT) 2014-3:
    

      --$255,000,000 class A-1 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$166,000,000 class A-2 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$166,000,000 class A-3 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$56,400,000 class A-4 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$38,200,000 class B notes 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$36,190,000 class C notes 'Asf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$32,170,000 class D notes 'BBBsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$28,150,000 class E notes 'NR'.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Stable Collateral Characteristics: The 2014-3 pool is representative of 
      nonprime collateral, with a 632 weighted average (WA) Fair Isaac Corp. 
      (FICO) score, 7.87% WA APR and 100% WA LTV. 63% of the pool consists of 
      new vehicle contracts, while extended-term contracts total 73%, all 
      relatively consistent with recent securitized pools.
    

      One-year Revolving Period Risk: The revolving structure introduces risk 
      of collateral migrating to a weaker pool before the start of the 
      amortization period, although eligibility criteria pertaining to the 
      additional receivables mitigate this risk to an extent. Fitch accounts 
      for this risk in its derivation of the 5.50% base case loss proxy for 
      2014-3.
    

      Adequate Credit Enhancement: Initial hard credit enhancement (CE) is 
      consistent with all prior transactions. The reserve is 0.50% 
      non-declining, and initial overcollateralization (OC) is 3.25% (both of 
      the initial pool balance) growing to a target of 4.75% post revolving 
      period. Excess spread totals 4.61% per annum, down from 2014-2 (NR).
    

      Stable Portfolio Performance: AFIN's non-prime U.S. auto loan portfolio 
      exhibited improved performance in 2009-2013 relative to the weak 
      2006-2008 period, supported by gradual improvement in the U.S. economy 
      and healthy used vehicle values.
    

      Stable Corporate Health: Fitch currently rates AFIN 'BB+/B Stable Rating 
      Outlook. AFIN demonstrates solid capabilities as an originator, 
      underwriter, and servicer, as evidenced by its historical prime and 
      non-prime portfolios and securitization performance.
    

      Legal Structure Integrity: The legal structure of the transaction should 
      provide that a bankruptcy of AFIN would not impair the timeliness of 
      payments on the securities.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity 
      on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base 
      case. This in turn could result in potential rating actions on the 
      notes. Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to each 
      class of CARAT 2014-3 to increased losses over the life of the 
      transaction. Fitch's analysis found that each class of notes displays 
      some sensitivity to increased defaults and losses, with some classes 
      showing potential downgrades of up to two rating categories under 
      Fitch's moderate (1.5x base case loss) scenario. Some classes of notes 
      could experience downgrades of more than three rating categories under 
      Fitch's severe (2.0x base case loss) scenario.
    

      Key rating drivers and rating sensitivities are further detailed in the 
      accompanying presale report at 'www.fitchratings.com' 
      or by clicking on the above link.
    

      Fitch's analysis of the Representation and Warranties (R&W) of this 
      transaction can be found in 'Capital Auto Receivables Asset Trust 
      2014-3--Appendix'. These R&W are compared to those of typical R&W for 
      the asset class as detailed in Fitch's April 17, 2012 special report, 
      'Representations, Warranties, and Enforcement Mechanisms in the Global 
      Structured Finance Transactions'.
