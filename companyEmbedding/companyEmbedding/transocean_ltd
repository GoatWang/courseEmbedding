Current operations[edit]
The company owns 61 rigs including 28 ultra-deepwater floaters, 5 deepwater floaters, 7 Harsh-Environment Floaters, 11 Midwater Floaters, and 10 High-Specification jackup rigs.[4] The company provides quarterly updates on the status of its fleet on its website.[5]
In 2015, Chevron accounted for 14% of the company's revenues and Royal Dutch Shell accounted for 10% of the company's revenues.[1]
History[edit]
Transocean was formed as a result of the merger of Southern Natural Gas Company, later Sonat, with many smaller drilling companies.
In 1953, the Birmingham, Alabama-based Southern Natural Gas Company created The Offshore Company after acquiring the joint drilling operation DeLong-McDermott from DeLong Engineering and J. Ray McDermott. In 1954, the company launched Rig 51, the first mobile jackup rig, in the Gulf of Mexico. In 1967, the Offshore Company went public. In 1978, SNG turned it into a wholly owned subsidiary. In 1982, it was changed to Sonat Offshore Drilling Inc., reflecting a change in its parent's name. In 1993, Sonat spun it off.[6]
In 1996, the company acquired Norwegian group Transocean ASA for US$1.5 billion. Transocean started in the 1970s as a whaling company and expanded through a series of mergers. The new company was called Transocean Offshore. The new company began building massive drilling operations with drills capable of going to 10,000 feet (as opposed to 3,000 feet at the time) and operating two drill operations on the same ship. Its first ship, Discoverer Enterprise, cost nearly US$430 million and was 834 ft (254 m).[7] The Enterprise class drillship is the largest of the drilling ships.[8]
In 1999, Transocean merged with Sedco Forex, the offshore drilling subsidiary of Schlumberger in a $3.2 billion stock transaction in which Schlumberger shareholders received shares of Transocean.[9]
Sedco Forex had been formed from a merger of two drilling companies, the Southeastern Drilling Company (Sedco), founded in 1947 by Bill Clements and acquired by Schlumberger in 1985 for $1 billion [10] and French drilling company Forages et Exploitations Pétrolières (Forex) founded in 1942 in German occupied France for drilling in North Africa.[6] Schlumberger first got a foothold in the company in 1959 and then assumed total control in 1964, and renamed it Forex Neptune Drilling Company. [11]
In 2000, Transocean acquired R&B Falcon Corporation, owner of 115 drilling rigs, in a deal valued at $17.7 billion. With the acquisition, Transocean gained control of what at the time was the world's largest offshore operation. Among R&B Falcon's assets was the Deepwater Horizon. [12] R&B Falcon had acquired Cliffs Drilling Company in 1998. [13]
In 2005, the company's Discoverer Spirit rig set a world record for the deepest offshore oil and gas well of 34,189 ft (10,421 m).[14]
In 2007, the US Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a case against Transocean, alleging violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The case alleged that Transocean paid bribes through its freight forwarding agents to Nigerian customs officials. Transocean later admitted to approving the bribes and agreed to pay USD $13,440,000 to settle the matter.[15]
In 2007, the company merged with GlobalSantaFe Corporation in a transaction that created a company with an enterprise value of $53 billion. Shareholders of GlobalSantaFe Corporation received $15 billion of cash as well as stock in the new company for their shares. Robert E. Rose, who was non-executive chairman of GlobalSantaFe, was made Transocean's chairman. Rose had been chairman of Global Marine prior to its 2001 merger with Santa Fe International Corporation. [16]
In 2008, the company moved its headquarters to Switzerland, resulting in a significantly lower tax rate.[17]
In September 2009, its Deepwater Horizon rig established a 35,050 ft (10,680 m) well, the deepest well in history – more than 5,000 feet deeper than its stated design specification.[14]
In 2010, Transocean was implicated in the Deepwater Horizon oil spill resulting from the explosion of one of its oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico that was leased to BP.[18]
In 2011, the company acquired Aker Drilling, which owned 4 harsh environment rigs used for drilling near Norway.[19]
In 2012, the company sold 38 shallow water rigs and narrowed its focus on high-specification deepwater rigs.[20]
In 2013, the company was added to the S&P 500 index.[21]
In February 2015, CEO Steven Newman quit following a $2.2 billion quarterly loss.[22]
Controversies[edit]
Accidents and incidents[edit]
Transocean was rated as a leader in its industry for many years. However, since the company's merger with GlobalSantaFe in 2007, Transocean's reputation has suffered considerably, according to EnergyPoint Research, an independent oil service industry rating firm. From 2004 to 2007, Transocean was the leader or near the top among deep-water drillers in "job quality" and "overall satisfaction." In 2008 and 2009, surveys ranked Transocean as last among deep-water drillers for "job quality" and as next to last in "overall satisfaction." In 2008 and 2009, Transocean ranked first for in-house safety and environmental policies, and in the middle of the pack for perceived environmental and safety record.[23] The Deepwater Horizon explosion and massive oil spill, starting in April 2010, further hurt its reputation. "Transocean is dominant, but the accident has definitely tarnished its reputation for worker safety and for being able to manage and deliver on extraordinarily complex deepwater projects," said Christopher Ruppel, an energy expert and managing director of capital markets at Execution Noble, an investment bank.[24]
Transocean Leader accident (2002)[edit]
On March 2, 2002, a Scottish man was killed in an accident aboard the Transocean Leader drilling rig operated for BP, located about 138 kilometers (86 miles) west of Shetland, Scotland.[25]
Galveston Bay explosion (2003)[edit]
On June 17, 2003, one worker was killed, four others were hospitalised and 21 were evacuated after an explosion on a Transocean gas drilling rig in Galveston Bay, Texas.[26]
Maintenance citation on Transocean Rather (2005)[edit]
On August 24, 2005, the UK Health and Safety Executive issued a notice to Transocean saying that, it had failed to maintain its "remote blowout preventor control panel … in an efficient state, efficient working order and in good repair."[27] On November 21, 2005, Transocean was found to be in compliance for this matter.[27]
Sinking of Bourbon Dolphin supply boat /Transocean Rather accident (2007)[edit]
On April 12, 2007, the Bourbon Dolphin supply boat sank off the coast of Scotland while servicing the Transocean Rather drilling rig, killing eight people. The Norwegian Ministry of Justice established a Commission of Inquiry to investigate the incident, and the commission’s report found a series of "unfortunate circumstances" led to the accident "with many of them linked to Bourbon Offshore and Transocean."[28][29]
2008 fatalities[edit]
In 2008, two Transocean workers were reportedly killed on the company's vessels.[30]
Deepwater Horizon drilling rig explosion (2010)[edit]
Main article: Deepwater Horizon drilling rig explosion
On April 20, 2010, a fire was reported on a Transocean-owned semisubmersible drilling rig, Deepwater Horizon. Deepwater Horizon was a RBS8D design of Reading & Bates Falcon, a firm that was acquired by Transocean in 2001. The fire broke out at 10:00 p.m. CDT UTC−5 in US waters of Mississippi Canyon 252 in the Gulf of Mexico. The rig was 41 mi (66 km) off the Louisiana coast. The US Coast Guard launched a rescue operation after the explosion which killed 11 workers and critically injured seven of the 126-member crew.[31][32]
Deepwater Horizon was completely destroyed and subsequently sank.
As the Deepwater Horizon sank, the riser pipe that connected the well-head to the rig was severed. As a result, oil began to spill into the Gulf of Mexico. Estimates of the leak were about 80,000 barrels per day – for 87 days.
Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal declared a state of emergency on April 29, as the oil slick grew and headed toward the most important and most sensitive wetlands in North America, threatening to destroy wildlife and the livelihood of thousands of fishermen. The head of BP Group told CNN's Brian Todd on April 28 that the accident could have been prevented and focused blame on Transocean, which owned and partly manned the rig.[33]
Transocean came under fire from lawyers, representing the fishing and tourism businesses that were hit by the oil spill, and the United States Department of Justice for seeking to use a Limitation of Liability Act of 1851 to restrict its liability for economic damages to $26.7 million.[34]
During Congressional testimony, Transocean and BP blamed each other for the disaster. It emerged that a "heated argument" broke out on the platform 11 hours before the accident, in which Transocean and BP personnel disagreed on an engineering decision related to the closing of the well.[35] On May 14, 2010, US President Barack Obama commented, "I did not appreciate what I considered to be a ridiculous spectacle… executives of BP and Transocean and Halliburton [the firm responsible for cementing the well] falling over each other to point the finger of blame at somebody else. The American people could not have been impressed with that display, and I certainly wasn't."[36]
Transocean later claimed that 2010, the year in which the disaster occurred, was "the best year in safety performance in our company’s history". In a regulatory filing, Transocean said, "Notwithstanding the tragic loss of life in the Gulf of Mexico, we achieved an exemplary statistical safety record as measured by our total recordable incident rate and total potential severity rate." They used this justification to award employees about two-thirds of the maximum possible safety bonuses.[37][38] In response to broad criticism, including from Interior Secretary Ken Salazar, the company announced that its executives would donate the safety portion of the bonuses to a fund supporting the victims' families.[39]
Offshore drilling leak off the Brazilian coast (2011)[edit]
The offshore drilling facility "Sedco 706", operated by Transocean under contract from Chevron, began to leak in November 2011 while working on the "Frade" oil field.[40] Oil began leaking from the seabed at a depth of approximately 1100 to 1200m. Damage included an oil slick (oil floating on the ocean surface) covering an area of approximately 80 km2 and growing. This put the oil at a distance of about 370 km from Rio de Janeiro, but other beautiful beaches are much closer (estimated 140 km). The Brazilian government sued Transocean and attempted to force the company to cease operations in Brazil, but a settlement was reached without a finding of fault or liability.[41]
Transocean Winner grounding on the Isle of Lewis, Scotland (2016)[edit]
In the early hours of Monday 8 August 2016, the semi-submersible drilling rig Transocean Winner ran aground near Dalmore in the Carloway district of the Isle of Lewis in the Outer Hebrides, Scotland.[42] The rig had been under tow by the tug Alp Forward in winds of galeforce, when the tow line broke. The rig subsequently drifted ashore at Dalmore and became stuck fast on rocks at 07.30 BST. Continuing poor weather meant that a damage inspection by salvors has been practically impossible, as personnel require to be airlifted on to the rig, in spite of it being close to the shore.[43] The rig was carrying approximately 280 tons of diesel, to power its generators, of which 53 tons is thought to have leaked into the sea, and dispersed or evaporated in rough conditions.[44] Environmental monitoring of plant and animal life is on-going, particularly in view of the economically important fish farming operations in nearby Loch Roag.
Environmental record[edit]
In early April 2015, six activists with the environmental group Greenpeace boarded the ship Blue Marlin while at sea, which was carrying one of Transocean's rigs, the 120 meter (400 ft.) tall Polar Pioneer, and camped out in superstructure of the rig. The activists promised to continuing their protests as the rig undergoes final outfitting while it is anchored in the Port Angeles harbor in Washington State and then later in Puget Sound.[45]

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Transocean Ltd. is one of the world's largest offshore drilling contractors and is based in Vernier, Switzerland. The company has offices in 20 countries, including Switzerland, Canada, United States, Norway, Scotland, India, Brazil, Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia.[2]
In 2010, Transocean was implicated in the Deepwater Horizon oil spill resulting from the explosion of one of its oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico.
On 23 November 2015 Transocean announced that it intent to delist its shares from the SIX Swiss Exchange due to financial reasons. The delisting will be effective on March 30, 2016. After the delisting the shares will be removed from the Swiss blue-chip index Swiss Market Index.[3]

Current operations[edit]
The company owns 61 rigs including 28 ultra-deepwater floaters, 5 deepwater floaters, 7 Harsh-Environment Floaters, 11 Midwater Floaters, and 10 High-Specification jackup rigs.[4] The company provides quarterly updates on the status of its fleet on its website.[5]
In 2015, Chevron accounted for 14% of the company's revenues and Royal Dutch Shell accounted for 10% of the company's revenues.[1]
History[edit]
Transocean was formed as a result of the merger of Southern Natural Gas Company, later Sonat, with many smaller drilling companies.
In 1953, the Birmingham, Alabama-based Southern Natural Gas Company created The Offshore Company after acquiring the joint drilling operation DeLong-McDermott from DeLong Engineering and J. Ray McDermott. In 1954, the company launched Rig 51, the first mobile jackup rig, in the Gulf of Mexico. In 1967, the Offshore Company went public. In 1978, SNG turned it into a wholly owned subsidiary. In 1982, it was changed to Sonat Offshore Drilling Inc., reflecting a change in its parent's name. In 1993, Sonat spun it off.[6]
In 1996, the company acquired Norwegian group Transocean ASA for US$1.5 billion. Transocean started in the 1970s as a whaling company and expanded through a series of mergers. The new company was called Transocean Offshore. The new company began building massive drilling operations with drills capable of going to 10,000 feet (as opposed to 3,000 feet at the time) and operating two drill operations on the same ship. Its first ship, Discoverer Enterprise, cost nearly US$430 million and was 834 ft (254 m).[7] The Enterprise class drillship is the largest of the drilling ships.[8]
In 1999, Transocean merged with Sedco Forex, the offshore drilling subsidiary of Schlumberger in a $3.2 billion stock transaction in which Schlumberger shareholders received shares of Transocean.[9]
Sedco Forex had been formed from a merger of two drilling companies, the Southeastern Drilling Company (Sedco), founded in 1947 by Bill Clements and acquired by Schlumberger in 1985 for $1 billion [10] and French drilling company Forages et Exploitations Pétrolières (Forex) founded in 1942 in German occupied France for drilling in North Africa.[6] Schlumberger first got a foothold in the company in 1959 and then assumed total control in 1964, and renamed it Forex Neptune Drilling Company. [11]
In 2000, Transocean acquired R&B Falcon Corporation, owner of 115 drilling rigs, in a deal valued at $17.7 billion. With the acquisition, Transocean gained control of what at the time was the world's largest offshore operation. Among R&B Falcon's assets was the Deepwater Horizon. [12] R&B Falcon had acquired Cliffs Drilling Company in 1998. [13]
In 2005, the company's Discoverer Spirit rig set a world record for the deepest offshore oil and gas well of 34,189 ft (10,421 m).[14]
In 2007, the US Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a case against Transocean, alleging violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The case alleged that Transocean paid bribes through its freight forwarding agents to Nigerian customs officials. Transocean later admitted to approving the bribes and agreed to pay USD $13,440,000 to settle the matter.[15]
In 2007, the company merged with GlobalSantaFe Corporation in a transaction that created a company with an enterprise value of $53 billion. Shareholders of GlobalSantaFe Corporation received $15 billion of cash as well as stock in the new company for their shares. Robert E. Rose, who was non-executive chairman of GlobalSantaFe, was made Transocean's chairman. Rose had been chairman of Global Marine prior to its 2001 merger with Santa Fe International Corporation. [16]
In 2008, the company moved its headquarters to Switzerland, resulting in a significantly lower tax rate.[17]
In September 2009, its Deepwater Horizon rig established a 35,050 ft (10,680 m) well, the deepest well in history – more than 5,000 feet deeper than its stated design specification.[14]
In 2010, Transocean was implicated in the Deepwater Horizon oil spill resulting from the explosion of one of its oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico that was leased to BP.[18]
In 2011, the company acquired Aker Drilling, which owned 4 harsh environment rigs used for drilling near Norway.[19]
In 2012, the company sold 38 shallow water rigs and narrowed its focus on high-specification deepwater rigs.[20]
In 2013, the company was added to the S&P 500 index.[21]
In February 2015, CEO Steven Newman quit following a $2.2 billion quarterly loss.[22]
Controversies[edit]
Accidents and incidents[edit]
Transocean was rated as a leader in its industry for many years. However, since the company's merger with GlobalSantaFe in 2007, Transocean's reputation has suffered considerably, according to EnergyPoint Research, an independent oil service industry rating firm. From 2004 to 2007, Transocean was the leader or near the top among deep-water drillers in "job quality" and "overall satisfaction." In 2008 and 2009, surveys ranked Transocean as last among deep-water drillers for "job quality" and as next to last in "overall satisfaction." In 2008 and 2009, Transocean ranked first for in-house safety and environmental policies, and in the middle of the pack for perceived environmental and safety record.[23] The Deepwater Horizon explosion and massive oil spill, starting in April 2010, further hurt its reputation. "Transocean is dominant, but the accident has definitely tarnished its reputation for worker safety and for being able to manage and deliver on extraordinarily complex deepwater projects," said Christopher Ruppel, an energy expert and managing director of capital markets at Execution Noble, an investment bank.[24]
Transocean Leader accident (2002)[edit]
On March 2, 2002, a Scottish man was killed in an accident aboard the Transocean Leader drilling rig operated for BP, located about 138 kilometers (86 miles) west of Shetland, Scotland.[25]
Galveston Bay explosion (2003)[edit]
On June 17, 2003, one worker was killed, four others were hospitalised and 21 were evacuated after an explosion on a Transocean gas drilling rig in Galveston Bay, Texas.[26]
Maintenance citation on Transocean Rather (2005)[edit]
On August 24, 2005, the UK Health and Safety Executive issued a notice to Transocean saying that, it had failed to maintain its "remote blowout preventor control panel … in an efficient state, efficient working order and in good repair."[27] On November 21, 2005, Transocean was found to be in compliance for this matter.[27]
Sinking of Bourbon Dolphin supply boat /Transocean Rather accident (2007)[edit]
On April 12, 2007, the Bourbon Dolphin supply boat sank off the coast of Scotland while servicing the Transocean Rather drilling rig, killing eight people. The Norwegian Ministry of Justice established a Commission of Inquiry to investigate the incident, and the commission’s report found a series of "unfortunate circumstances" led to the accident "with many of them linked to Bourbon Offshore and Transocean."[28][29]
2008 fatalities[edit]
In 2008, two Transocean workers were reportedly killed on the company's vessels.[30]
Deepwater Horizon drilling rig explosion (2010)[edit]
Main article: Deepwater Horizon drilling rig explosion
On April 20, 2010, a fire was reported on a Transocean-owned semisubmersible drilling rig, Deepwater Horizon. Deepwater Horizon was a RBS8D design of Reading & Bates Falcon, a firm that was acquired by Transocean in 2001. The fire broke out at 10:00 p.m. CDT UTC−5 in US waters of Mississippi Canyon 252 in the Gulf of Mexico. The rig was 41 mi (66 km) off the Louisiana coast. The US Coast Guard launched a rescue operation after the explosion which killed 11 workers and critically injured seven of the 126-member crew.[31][32]
Deepwater Horizon was completely destroyed and subsequently sank.
As the Deepwater Horizon sank, the riser pipe that connected the well-head to the rig was severed. As a result, oil began to spill into the Gulf of Mexico. Estimates of the leak were about 80,000 barrels per day – for 87 days.
Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal declared a state of emergency on April 29, as the oil slick grew and headed toward the most important and most sensitive wetlands in North America, threatening to destroy wildlife and the livelihood of thousands of fishermen. The head of BP Group told CNN's Brian Todd on April 28 that the accident could have been prevented and focused blame on Transocean, which owned and partly manned the rig.[33]
Transocean came under fire from lawyers, representing the fishing and tourism businesses that were hit by the oil spill, and the United States Department of Justice for seeking to use a Limitation of Liability Act of 1851 to restrict its liability for economic damages to $26.7 million.[34]
During Congressional testimony, Transocean and BP blamed each other for the disaster. It emerged that a "heated argument" broke out on the platform 11 hours before the accident, in which Transocean and BP personnel disagreed on an engineering decision related to the closing of the well.[35] On May 14, 2010, US President Barack Obama commented, "I did not appreciate what I considered to be a ridiculous spectacle… executives of BP and Transocean and Halliburton [the firm responsible for cementing the well] falling over each other to point the finger of blame at somebody else. The American people could not have been impressed with that display, and I certainly wasn't."[36]
Transocean later claimed that 2010, the year in which the disaster occurred, was "the best year in safety performance in our company’s history". In a regulatory filing, Transocean said, "Notwithstanding the tragic loss of life in the Gulf of Mexico, we achieved an exemplary statistical safety record as measured by our total recordable incident rate and total potential severity rate." They used this justification to award employees about two-thirds of the maximum possible safety bonuses.[37][38] In response to broad criticism, including from Interior Secretary Ken Salazar, the company announced that its executives would donate the safety portion of the bonuses to a fund supporting the victims' families.[39]
Offshore drilling leak off the Brazilian coast (2011)[edit]
The offshore drilling facility "Sedco 706", operated by Transocean under contract from Chevron, began to leak in November 2011 while working on the "Frade" oil field.[40] Oil began leaking from the seabed at a depth of approximately 1100 to 1200m. Damage included an oil slick (oil floating on the ocean surface) covering an area of approximately 80 km2 and growing. This put the oil at a distance of about 370 km from Rio de Janeiro, but other beautiful beaches are much closer (estimated 140 km). The Brazilian government sued Transocean and attempted to force the company to cease operations in Brazil, but a settlement was reached without a finding of fault or liability.[41]
Transocean Winner grounding on the Isle of Lewis, Scotland (2016)[edit]
In the early hours of Monday 8 August 2016, the semi-submersible drilling rig Transocean Winner ran aground near Dalmore in the Carloway district of the Isle of Lewis in the Outer Hebrides, Scotland.[42] The rig had been under tow by the tug Alp Forward in winds of galeforce, when the tow line broke. The rig subsequently drifted ashore at Dalmore and became stuck fast on rocks at 07.30 BST. Continuing poor weather meant that a damage inspection by salvors has been practically impossible, as personnel require to be airlifted on to the rig, in spite of it being close to the shore.[43] The rig was carrying approximately 280 tons of diesel, to power its generators, of which 53 tons is thought to have leaked into the sea, and dispersed or evaporated in rough conditions.[44] Environmental monitoring of plant and animal life is on-going, particularly in view of the economically important fish farming operations in nearby Loch Roag.
Environmental record[edit]
In early April 2015, six activists with the environmental group Greenpeace boarded the ship Blue Marlin while at sea, which was carrying one of Transocean's rigs, the 120 meter (400 ft.) tall Polar Pioneer, and camped out in superstructure of the rig. The activists promised to continuing their protests as the rig undergoes final outfitting while it is anchored in the Port Angeles harbor in Washington State and then later in Puget Sound.[45]

Transocean Ltd. is one of the world's largest offshore drilling contractors and is based in Vernier, Switzerland. The company has offices in 20 countries, including Switzerland, Canada, United States, Norway, Scotland, India, Brazil, Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia.[2]
In 2010, Transocean was implicated in the Deepwater Horizon oil spill resulting from the explosion of one of its oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico.
On 23 November 2015 Transocean announced that it intent to delist its shares from the SIX Swiss Exchange due to financial reasons. The delisting will be effective on March 30, 2016. After the delisting the shares will be removed from the Swiss blue-chip index Swiss Market Index.[3]

Current operations[edit]
The company owns 61 rigs including 28 ultra-deepwater floaters, 5 deepwater floaters, 7 Harsh-Environment Floaters, 11 Midwater Floaters, and 10 High-Specification jackup rigs.[4] The company provides quarterly updates on the status of its fleet on its website.[5]
In 2015, Chevron accounted for 14% of the company's revenues and Royal Dutch Shell accounted for 10% of the company's revenues.[1]
History[edit]
Transocean was formed as a result of the merger of Southern Natural Gas Company, later Sonat, with many smaller drilling companies.
In 1953, the Birmingham, Alabama-based Southern Natural Gas Company created The Offshore Company after acquiring the joint drilling operation DeLong-McDermott from DeLong Engineering and J. Ray McDermott. In 1954, the company launched Rig 51, the first mobile jackup rig, in the Gulf of Mexico. In 1967, the Offshore Company went public. In 1978, SNG turned it into a wholly owned subsidiary. In 1982, it was changed to Sonat Offshore Drilling Inc., reflecting a change in its parent's name. In 1993, Sonat spun it off.[6]
In 1996, the company acquired Norwegian group Transocean ASA for US$1.5 billion. Transocean started in the 1970s as a whaling company and expanded through a series of mergers. The new company was called Transocean Offshore. The new company began building massive drilling operations with drills capable of going to 10,000 feet (as opposed to 3,000 feet at the time) and operating two drill operations on the same ship. Its first ship, Discoverer Enterprise, cost nearly US$430 million and was 834 ft (254 m).[7] The Enterprise class drillship is the largest of the drilling ships.[8]
In 1999, Transocean merged with Sedco Forex, the offshore drilling subsidiary of Schlumberger in a $3.2 billion stock transaction in which Schlumberger shareholders received shares of Transocean.[9]
Sedco Forex had been formed from a merger of two drilling companies, the Southeastern Drilling Company (Sedco), founded in 1947 by Bill Clements and acquired by Schlumberger in 1985 for $1 billion [10] and French drilling company Forages et Exploitations Pétrolières (Forex) founded in 1942 in German occupied France for drilling in North Africa.[6] Schlumberger first got a foothold in the company in 1959 and then assumed total control in 1964, and renamed it Forex Neptune Drilling Company. [11]
In 2000, Transocean acquired R&B Falcon Corporation, owner of 115 drilling rigs, in a deal valued at $17.7 billion. With the acquisition, Transocean gained control of what at the time was the world's largest offshore operation. Among R&B Falcon's assets was the Deepwater Horizon. [12] R&B Falcon had acquired Cliffs Drilling Company in 1998. [13]
In 2005, the company's Discoverer Spirit rig set a world record for the deepest offshore oil and gas well of 34,189 ft (10,421 m).[14]
In 2007, the US Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a case against Transocean, alleging violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The case alleged that Transocean paid bribes through its freight forwarding agents to Nigerian customs officials. Transocean later admitted to approving the bribes and agreed to pay USD $13,440,000 to settle the matter.[15]
In 2007, the company merged with GlobalSantaFe Corporation in a transaction that created a company with an enterprise value of $53 billion. Shareholders of GlobalSantaFe Corporation received $15 billion of cash as well as stock in the new company for their shares. Robert E. Rose, who was non-executive chairman of GlobalSantaFe, was made Transocean's chairman. Rose had been chairman of Global Marine prior to its 2001 merger with Santa Fe International Corporation. [16]
In 2008, the company moved its headquarters to Switzerland, resulting in a significantly lower tax rate.[17]
In September 2009, its Deepwater Horizon rig established a 35,050 ft (10,680 m) well, the deepest well in history – more than 5,000 feet deeper than its stated design specification.[14]
In 2010, Transocean was implicated in the Deepwater Horizon oil spill resulting from the explosion of one of its oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico that was leased to BP.[18]
In 2011, the company acquired Aker Drilling, which owned 4 harsh environment rigs used for drilling near Norway.[19]
In 2012, the company sold 38 shallow water rigs and narrowed its focus on high-specification deepwater rigs.[20]
In 2013, the company was added to the S&P 500 index.[21]
In February 2015, CEO Steven Newman quit following a $2.2 billion quarterly loss.[22]
Controversies[edit]
Accidents and incidents[edit]
Transocean was rated as a leader in its industry for many years. However, since the company's merger with GlobalSantaFe in 2007, Transocean's reputation has suffered considerably, according to EnergyPoint Research, an independent oil service industry rating firm. From 2004 to 2007, Transocean was the leader or near the top among deep-water drillers in "job quality" and "overall satisfaction." In 2008 and 2009, surveys ranked Transocean as last among deep-water drillers for "job quality" and as next to last in "overall satisfaction." In 2008 and 2009, Transocean ranked first for in-house safety and environmental policies, and in the middle of the pack for perceived environmental and safety record.[23] The Deepwater Horizon explosion and massive oil spill, starting in April 2010, further hurt its reputation. "Transocean is dominant, but the accident has definitely tarnished its reputation for worker safety and for being able to manage and deliver on extraordinarily complex deepwater projects," said Christopher Ruppel, an energy expert and managing director of capital markets at Execution Noble, an investment bank.[24]
Transocean Leader accident (2002)[edit]
On March 2, 2002, a Scottish man was killed in an accident aboard the Transocean Leader drilling rig operated for BP, located about 138 kilometers (86 miles) west of Shetland, Scotland.[25]
Galveston Bay explosion (2003)[edit]
On June 17, 2003, one worker was killed, four others were hospitalised and 21 were evacuated after an explosion on a Transocean gas drilling rig in Galveston Bay, Texas.[26]
Maintenance citation on Transocean Rather (2005)[edit]
On August 24, 2005, the UK Health and Safety Executive issued a notice to Transocean saying that, it had failed to maintain its "remote blowout preventor control panel … in an efficient state, efficient working order and in good repair."[27] On November 21, 2005, Transocean was found to be in compliance for this matter.[27]
Sinking of Bourbon Dolphin supply boat /Transocean Rather accident (2007)[edit]
On April 12, 2007, the Bourbon Dolphin supply boat sank off the coast of Scotland while servicing the Transocean Rather drilling rig, killing eight people. The Norwegian Ministry of Justice established a Commission of Inquiry to investigate the incident, and the commission’s report found a series of "unfortunate circumstances" led to the accident "with many of them linked to Bourbon Offshore and Transocean."[28][29]
2008 fatalities[edit]
In 2008, two Transocean workers were reportedly killed on the company's vessels.[30]
Deepwater Horizon drilling rig explosion (2010)[edit]
Main article: Deepwater Horizon drilling rig explosion
On April 20, 2010, a fire was reported on a Transocean-owned semisubmersible drilling rig, Deepwater Horizon. Deepwater Horizon was a RBS8D design of Reading & Bates Falcon, a firm that was acquired by Transocean in 2001. The fire broke out at 10:00 p.m. CDT UTC−5 in US waters of Mississippi Canyon 252 in the Gulf of Mexico. The rig was 41 mi (66 km) off the Louisiana coast. The US Coast Guard launched a rescue operation after the explosion which killed 11 workers and critically injured seven of the 126-member crew.[31][32]
Deepwater Horizon was completely destroyed and subsequently sank.
As the Deepwater Horizon sank, the riser pipe that connected the well-head to the rig was severed. As a result, oil began to spill into the Gulf of Mexico. Estimates of the leak were about 80,000 barrels per day – for 87 days.
Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal declared a state of emergency on April 29, as the oil slick grew and headed toward the most important and most sensitive wetlands in North America, threatening to destroy wildlife and the livelihood of thousands of fishermen. The head of BP Group told CNN's Brian Todd on April 28 that the accident could have been prevented and focused blame on Transocean, which owned and partly manned the rig.[33]
Transocean came under fire from lawyers, representing the fishing and tourism businesses that were hit by the oil spill, and the United States Department of Justice for seeking to use a Limitation of Liability Act of 1851 to restrict its liability for economic damages to $26.7 million.[34]
During Congressional testimony, Transocean and BP blamed each other for the disaster. It emerged that a "heated argument" broke out on the platform 11 hours before the accident, in which Transocean and BP personnel disagreed on an engineering decision related to the closing of the well.[35] On May 14, 2010, US President Barack Obama commented, "I did not appreciate what I considered to be a ridiculous spectacle… executives of BP and Transocean and Halliburton [the firm responsible for cementing the well] falling over each other to point the finger of blame at somebody else. The American people could not have been impressed with that display, and I certainly wasn't."[36]
Transocean later claimed that 2010, the year in which the disaster occurred, was "the best year in safety performance in our company’s history". In a regulatory filing, Transocean said, "Notwithstanding the tragic loss of life in the Gulf of Mexico, we achieved an exemplary statistical safety record as measured by our total recordable incident rate and total potential severity rate." They used this justification to award employees about two-thirds of the maximum possible safety bonuses.[37][38] In response to broad criticism, including from Interior Secretary Ken Salazar, the company announced that its executives would donate the safety portion of the bonuses to a fund supporting the victims' families.[39]
Offshore drilling leak off the Brazilian coast (2011)[edit]
The offshore drilling facility "Sedco 706", operated by Transocean under contract from Chevron, began to leak in November 2011 while working on the "Frade" oil field.[40] Oil began leaking from the seabed at a depth of approximately 1100 to 1200m. Damage included an oil slick (oil floating on the ocean surface) covering an area of approximately 80 km2 and growing. This put the oil at a distance of about 370 km from Rio de Janeiro, but other beautiful beaches are much closer (estimated 140 km). The Brazilian government sued Transocean and attempted to force the company to cease operations in Brazil, but a settlement was reached without a finding of fault or liability.[41]
Transocean Winner grounding on the Isle of Lewis, Scotland (2016)[edit]
In the early hours of Monday 8 August 2016, the semi-submersible drilling rig Transocean Winner ran aground near Dalmore in the Carloway district of the Isle of Lewis in the Outer Hebrides, Scotland.[42] The rig had been under tow by the tug Alp Forward in winds of galeforce, when the tow line broke. The rig subsequently drifted ashore at Dalmore and became stuck fast on rocks at 07.30 BST. Continuing poor weather meant that a damage inspection by salvors has been practically impossible, as personnel require to be airlifted on to the rig, in spite of it being close to the shore.[43] The rig was carrying approximately 280 tons of diesel, to power its generators, of which 53 tons is thought to have leaked into the sea, and dispersed or evaporated in rough conditions.[44] Environmental monitoring of plant and animal life is on-going, particularly in view of the economically important fish farming operations in nearby Loch Roag.
Environmental record[edit]
In early April 2015, six activists with the environmental group Greenpeace boarded the ship Blue Marlin while at sea, which was carrying one of Transocean's rigs, the 120 meter (400 ft.) tall Polar Pioneer, and camped out in superstructure of the rig. The activists promised to continuing their protests as the rig undergoes final outfitting while it is anchored in the Port Angeles harbor in Washington State and then later in Puget Sound.[45]

July breakout broadens, small- and mid-cap benchmarks tag all-time highs
The U.S benchmarks’ rotational July rally continues to broaden. Consider that the small- and mid-cap benchmarks have registered their first July technical breakouts — reaching all-time highs — while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite concurrently extend previous breaks to record territory.

Breaking            
Energy ETF set for best one-day gain in 3 weeks as crude climbs
A prominent fund used to bet on the energy sector on Monday was on pace to post its best daily climb since early June, according to FactSet data. The energy-focused Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF was up 2.2%, setting the ETF up for its sharpest one-day rise since a 2.4% gain on June 9. Gains in the ETF were being led by a 6% rally in shares of Transocean Ltd.  and a more than 5% climb in Baker Hughes Inc. . The climb in shares of Baker Hughes also comes as General Electric Co.  announced the completion of its deal to combine its energy business with Baker Hughes. On the day, the energy sector was the best performer among the S&P 500's  11 sectors, with financials   also helping to buoy U.S. equity benchmarks. August West Texas Intermediate crude  rose sharply above $46 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, jolted energy stocks higher in a holiday-shortened trading session. The S&P 500 was up 0.3%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average  was up 0.8%, after briefly touching an intraday record of 21,562.75. The Nasdaq Composite Index   lagged behind the benchmarks, down 0.5%, as the technology sector  extended a bout of weakness amid concerns about tech-share valuations.

Breaking            
Energy ETF on track for its worst one-day drop in 3 months
A popular exchange-traded fund used to bet on the energy sector on Tuesday was looking at its worst daily decline in more than three months, according to FactSet data. The Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF  was down 2.2% in recent trade, putting it on pace to log its steepest drop since March 8, when it plunged 2.6%. The slump in the energy-focused ETF was led by sharp drops in Transocean Ltd.  , Hess Corp.   and Marathon Oil Corp. , which were down at least 4%. All of the index's components were trading in the red, in early trade. The decline for the sector comes as crude-oil prices  sink to a seven-month low and are flirting with a close in bear-market territory, defined as a fall of at least 20% from a recent peak. Crude's slump was putting pressure on the S&P 500 index , with the energy sector the worst performer among the benchmark's 11 sectors, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average  was lower, weighed by a 1.6% decline in shares of Chevron Corp.  and a 1.3% fall in shares of Exxon Mobil Corp. .

Breaking            
Energy sector faces worst daily drop in 3 months as oil prices tumble
A popular fund tracking the energy sector on Wednesday was on pace for its steepest one-day slide in more than three months after crude-oil futures sank on the heels of a report showing a smaller-than-expected drop in U.S. inventories. The Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF  was down 2.3%, which would mark the worst daily drop for the exchange-traded fund, if it holds, since March 8 when it fell 2.6%, according to FactSet data. All of the ETF's components were trading in the red, led by a 6.2% decline in shares of Transocean Ltd.  and a 5.1% fall in Murphy Oil Corp. . The moves come as the inventory report, released Wednesday at 10:30 a.m. Eastern, drove crude-oil futures for July delivery  sharply lower. Data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration showed that domestic-crude supplies fell by 1.7 million barrels for the week ended June 9. Analysts at Citi Futures expected a decline of between 2 million and 3 million barrels. The broader market also was under pressure, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average  was off 0.1%, the S&P 500 index  was trading down 0.2%, while the Nasdaq Composite Index  was off 0.1%. Crude futures have been dogged by persistent concerns about a glut of oil, despite recent efforts led by members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to curb output by extending a six-month output limit that would have ended this month until March 2018. U.S. shale producers, who are not party to the production limits, have been often cited as the biggest headwind to these global output agreements.

Energy stocks sink as crude oil prices tumble below $50 a barrel
Shares of oil companies were broadly and sharply lower Thursday, after OPEC's decision to extend its production plan, rather than cut it, sent crude oil prices tumbling below $50 a barrel. The SPDR Energy Select Sector ETF  dropped 1.4%, bucking the rally in the broader stock market, with 32 of its 34 equity components trading lower. Among the biggest losers and most-active shares, Transocean Ltd.  sank 6.2%, Chesapeake Energy Corp.  slid 5.3% and Marathon Oil Corp.  shed 5.2%. Among the ETF's most-heavily weighted, shares of Exxon Mobil Corp.  dropped 0.7%, Chevron Corp.  shed 1% and Schlumberger Ltd.  gave up 2.2%. The two XLE gainers were shares of Kinder Morgan Inc. , up 0.3% and Tesoro Corp. , up 2.3%. July crude oil futures  plunged 4.8% to $48.91 a barrel. While the XLE tumbled, the S&P 500 rallied 0.4% toward a record close.

Oil stocks surge after Saudis, Russians endorse extension of production cuts
Energy stocks were broadly and sharply higher Monday, as a big rally in crude oil prices helped light a fire under the sector. The SPDR Energy Select Sector ETF  ran up 1.4% in morning trade, making it by far the biggest gainer among trackers of the S&P 500's 11 key sectors. Crude oil futures shot up 3.3%, after the energy ministers of Saudi Arabia and Russia said they endorsed a nine-month extension to production cuts agreed upon by OPEC. Oil and gas explorer Marathon Oil Corp.'s stock  surged 5.2% to pace the S&P 500's  advancers. Among shares of other top S&P 500 gainers, Chesapeake Energy Corp.  ran up 3.6%, Transocean Ltd.  climbed 3.5%, Helmerich & Payne Inc.  rallied 3.3%, Murphy Oil Corp.  rose 3.3% and Hess Corp.  gained 3.1%. The energy ETF closed at a nine-month low of $66.26 as recently as May 4, down 15% from an 18-month high of $77.83 on Dec. 13.

Energy stocks rally to lead S&P 500 gainers as oil erases some of Thursday's loss
Energy stocks rallied to lead S&P 500 gainers Friday, rebounding from a rout Thursday driven by a steep decline in oil prices. Crude futures were back in the black Friday after a nearly 5% decline in the prior session, although prices were on track for a hefty loss for the week. Oil has suffered "heavy losses this week as investors are no longer pleased with current output cuts by OPEC," said Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets, as reported by MarketWatch. Futures were up 77 cents, or 1.7%, at $46.29 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Against that backdrop, Transocean Ltd  led the advancers with a 7.4% gain. Chesapeake Energy Corp.  was up 5.4%, NRG Energy Inc.  was up 3% and Murphy Oil Corp.  rose 2.5%. National Oilwell Varco Inc.  added 2.3%, TechnipFMC Plc  rose 2.2% and Hess Corp.  tacked on 2.1%. The Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund was up 0.8%. The S&P 500  was slightly higher.

Energy ETF drops toward 9-month low as oil prices slide
The energy sector was the biggest loser Thursday, as the sharp selloff in oil prices sent the SPDR Energy Select Sector ETF  tumbling 2.1% toward a nine-month closing low. Of the sector tracker's (XLE) 34 equity components, only one edged higher, with Noble Energy Inc.'s stock  up 0.7%. Among the sector tracker's most-active components, shares of Chesapeake Energy Corp.  plunged 8.5%, Transocean Ltd.  dropped 4.7%, Marathon Oil Corp.  shed 4.8%, Kinder Morgan Inc.  gave up 2.5% and Exxon Mobil Corp.  slid 1.3%. The XLE had rallied as much as 12% in the month after the election to a 1 1/2-year closing high of $77.83 on Dec. 13, amid optimism over President Donald Trump's promise to reinvigorate the fossil fuel industry, but has since tumbled 15% as optimism faded given the White House's inability to implement policy promises. On Thursday, crude oil futures  tumbled 5% toward the lowest close since Nov. 30, after data showing U.S. production increased while inventories declined less than expected. The XLE has dropped 13% year to date, while the S&P 500  has gained 6.7%.

Current operations[edit]
The company owns 61 rigs including 28 ultra-deepwater floaters, 5 deepwater floaters, 7 Harsh-Environment Floaters, 11 Midwater Floaters, and 10 High-Specification jackup rigs.[4] The company provides quarterly updates on the status of its fleet on its website.[5]
In 2015, Chevron accounted for 14% of the company's revenues and Royal Dutch Shell accounted for 10% of the company's revenues.[1]
History[edit]
Transocean was formed as a result of the merger of Southern Natural Gas Company, later Sonat, with many smaller drilling companies.
In 1953, the Birmingham, Alabama-based Southern Natural Gas Company created The Offshore Company after acquiring the joint drilling operation DeLong-McDermott from DeLong Engineering and J. Ray McDermott. In 1954, the company launched Rig 51, the first mobile jackup rig, in the Gulf of Mexico. In 1967, the Offshore Company went public. In 1978, SNG turned it into a wholly owned subsidiary. In 1982, it was changed to Sonat Offshore Drilling Inc., reflecting a change in its parent's name. In 1993, Sonat spun it off.[6]
In 1996, the company acquired Norwegian group Transocean ASA for US$1.5 billion. Transocean started in the 1970s as a whaling company and expanded through a series of mergers. The new company was called Transocean Offshore. The new company began building massive drilling operations with drills capable of going to 10,000 feet (as opposed to 3,000 feet at the time) and operating two drill operations on the same ship. Its first ship, Discoverer Enterprise, cost nearly US$430 million and was 834 ft (254 m).[7] The Enterprise class drillship is the largest of the drilling ships.[8]
In 1999, Transocean merged with Sedco Forex, the offshore drilling subsidiary of Schlumberger in a $3.2 billion stock transaction in which Schlumberger shareholders received shares of Transocean.[9]
Sedco Forex had been formed from a merger of two drilling companies, the Southeastern Drilling Company (Sedco), founded in 1947 by Bill Clements and acquired by Schlumberger in 1985 for $1 billion [10] and French drilling company Forages et Exploitations Pétrolières (Forex) founded in 1942 in German occupied France for drilling in North Africa.[6] Schlumberger first got a foothold in the company in 1959 and then assumed total control in 1964, and renamed it Forex Neptune Drilling Company. [11]
In 2000, Transocean acquired R&B Falcon Corporation, owner of 115 drilling rigs, in a deal valued at $17.7 billion. With the acquisition, Transocean gained control of what at the time was the world's largest offshore operation. Among R&B Falcon's assets was the Deepwater Horizon. [12] R&B Falcon had acquired Cliffs Drilling Company in 1998. [13]
In 2005, the company's Discoverer Spirit rig set a world record for the deepest offshore oil and gas well of 34,189 ft (10,421 m).[14]
In 2007, the US Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a case against Transocean, alleging violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The case alleged that Transocean paid bribes through its freight forwarding agents to Nigerian customs officials. Transocean later admitted to approving the bribes and agreed to pay USD $13,440,000 to settle the matter.[15]
In 2007, the company merged with GlobalSantaFe Corporation in a transaction that created a company with an enterprise value of $53 billion. Shareholders of GlobalSantaFe Corporation received $15 billion of cash as well as stock in the new company for their shares. Robert E. Rose, who was non-executive chairman of GlobalSantaFe, was made Transocean's chairman. Rose had been chairman of Global Marine prior to its 2001 merger with Santa Fe International Corporation. [16]
In 2008, the company moved its headquarters to Switzerland, resulting in a significantly lower tax rate.[17]
In September 2009, its Deepwater Horizon rig established a 35,050 ft (10,680 m) well, the deepest well in history – more than 5,000 feet deeper than its stated design specification.[14]
In 2010, Transocean was implicated in the Deepwater Horizon oil spill resulting from the explosion of one of its oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico that was leased to BP.[18]
In 2011, the company acquired Aker Drilling, which owned 4 harsh environment rigs used for drilling near Norway.[19]
In 2012, the company sold 38 shallow water rigs and narrowed its focus on high-specification deepwater rigs.[20]
In 2013, the company was added to the S&P 500 index.[21]
In February 2015, CEO Steven Newman quit following a $2.2 billion quarterly loss.[22]
Controversies[edit]
Accidents and incidents[edit]
Transocean was rated as a leader in its industry for many years. However, since the company's merger with GlobalSantaFe in 2007, Transocean's reputation has suffered considerably, according to EnergyPoint Research, an independent oil service industry rating firm. From 2004 to 2007, Transocean was the leader or near the top among deep-water drillers in "job quality" and "overall satisfaction." In 2008 and 2009, surveys ranked Transocean as last among deep-water drillers for "job quality" and as next to last in "overall satisfaction." In 2008 and 2009, Transocean ranked first for in-house safety and environmental policies, and in the middle of the pack for perceived environmental and safety record.[23] The Deepwater Horizon explosion and massive oil spill, starting in April 2010, further hurt its reputation. "Transocean is dominant, but the accident has definitely tarnished its reputation for worker safety and for being able to manage and deliver on extraordinarily complex deepwater projects," said Christopher Ruppel, an energy expert and managing director of capital markets at Execution Noble, an investment bank.[24]
Transocean Leader accident (2002)[edit]
On March 2, 2002, a Scottish man was killed in an accident aboard the Transocean Leader drilling rig operated for BP, located about 138 kilometers (86 miles) west of Shetland, Scotland.[25]
Galveston Bay explosion (2003)[edit]
On June 17, 2003, one worker was killed, four others were hospitalised and 21 were evacuated after an explosion on a Transocean gas drilling rig in Galveston Bay, Texas.[26]
Maintenance citation on Transocean Rather (2005)[edit]
On August 24, 2005, the UK Health and Safety Executive issued a notice to Transocean saying that, it had failed to maintain its "remote blowout preventor control panel … in an efficient state, efficient working order and in good repair."[27] On November 21, 2005, Transocean was found to be in compliance for this matter.[27]
Sinking of Bourbon Dolphin supply boat /Transocean Rather accident (2007)[edit]
On April 12, 2007, the Bourbon Dolphin supply boat sank off the coast of Scotland while servicing the Transocean Rather drilling rig, killing eight people. The Norwegian Ministry of Justice established a Commission of Inquiry to investigate the incident, and the commission’s report found a series of "unfortunate circumstances" led to the accident "with many of them linked to Bourbon Offshore and Transocean."[28][29]
2008 fatalities[edit]
In 2008, two Transocean workers were reportedly killed on the company's vessels.[30]
Deepwater Horizon drilling rig explosion (2010)[edit]
Main article: Deepwater Horizon drilling rig explosion
On April 20, 2010, a fire was reported on a Transocean-owned semisubmersible drilling rig, Deepwater Horizon. Deepwater Horizon was a RBS8D design of Reading & Bates Falcon, a firm that was acquired by Transocean in 2001. The fire broke out at 10:00 p.m. CDT UTC−5 in US waters of Mississippi Canyon 252 in the Gulf of Mexico. The rig was 41 mi (66 km) off the Louisiana coast. The US Coast Guard launched a rescue operation after the explosion which killed 11 workers and critically injured seven of the 126-member crew.[31][32]
Deepwater Horizon was completely destroyed and subsequently sank.
As the Deepwater Horizon sank, the riser pipe that connected the well-head to the rig was severed. As a result, oil began to spill into the Gulf of Mexico. Estimates of the leak were about 80,000 barrels per day – for 87 days.
Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal declared a state of emergency on April 29, as the oil slick grew and headed toward the most important and most sensitive wetlands in North America, threatening to destroy wildlife and the livelihood of thousands of fishermen. The head of BP Group told CNN's Brian Todd on April 28 that the accident could have been prevented and focused blame on Transocean, which owned and partly manned the rig.[33]
Transocean came under fire from lawyers, representing the fishing and tourism businesses that were hit by the oil spill, and the United States Department of Justice for seeking to use a Limitation of Liability Act of 1851 to restrict its liability for economic damages to $26.7 million.[34]
During Congressional testimony, Transocean and BP blamed each other for the disaster. It emerged that a "heated argument" broke out on the platform 11 hours before the accident, in which Transocean and BP personnel disagreed on an engineering decision related to the closing of the well.[35] On May 14, 2010, US President Barack Obama commented, "I did not appreciate what I considered to be a ridiculous spectacle… executives of BP and Transocean and Halliburton [the firm responsible for cementing the well] falling over each other to point the finger of blame at somebody else. The American people could not have been impressed with that display, and I certainly wasn't."[36]
Transocean later claimed that 2010, the year in which the disaster occurred, was "the best year in safety performance in our company’s history". In a regulatory filing, Transocean said, "Notwithstanding the tragic loss of life in the Gulf of Mexico, we achieved an exemplary statistical safety record as measured by our total recordable incident rate and total potential severity rate." They used this justification to award employees about two-thirds of the maximum possible safety bonuses.[37][38] In response to broad criticism, including from Interior Secretary Ken Salazar, the company announced that its executives would donate the safety portion of the bonuses to a fund supporting the victims' families.[39]
Offshore drilling leak off the Brazilian coast (2011)[edit]
The offshore drilling facility "Sedco 706", operated by Transocean under contract from Chevron, began to leak in November 2011 while working on the "Frade" oil field.[40] Oil began leaking from the seabed at a depth of approximately 1100 to 1200m. Damage included an oil slick (oil floating on the ocean surface) covering an area of approximately 80 km2 and growing. This put the oil at a distance of about 370 km from Rio de Janeiro, but other beautiful beaches are much closer (estimated 140 km). The Brazilian government sued Transocean and attempted to force the company to cease operations in Brazil, but a settlement was reached without a finding of fault or liability.[41]
Transocean Winner grounding on the Isle of Lewis, Scotland (2016)[edit]
In the early hours of Monday 8 August 2016, the semi-submersible drilling rig Transocean Winner ran aground near Dalmore in the Carloway district of the Isle of Lewis in the Outer Hebrides, Scotland.[42] The rig had been under tow by the tug Alp Forward in winds of galeforce, when the tow line broke. The rig subsequently drifted ashore at Dalmore and became stuck fast on rocks at 07.30 BST. Continuing poor weather meant that a damage inspection by salvors has been practically impossible, as personnel require to be airlifted on to the rig, in spite of it being close to the shore.[43] The rig was carrying approximately 280 tons of diesel, to power its generators, of which 53 tons is thought to have leaked into the sea, and dispersed or evaporated in rough conditions.[44] Environmental monitoring of plant and animal life is on-going, particularly in view of the economically important fish farming operations in nearby Loch Roag.
Environmental record[edit]
In early April 2015, six activists with the environmental group Greenpeace boarded the ship Blue Marlin while at sea, which was carrying one of Transocean's rigs, the 120 meter (400 ft.) tall Polar Pioneer, and camped out in superstructure of the rig. The activists promised to continuing their protests as the rig undergoes final outfitting while it is anchored in the Port Angeles harbor in Washington State and then later in Puget Sound.[45]

July breakout broadens, small- and mid-cap benchmarks tag all-time highs
The U.S benchmarks’ rotational July rally continues to broaden. Consider that the small- and mid-cap benchmarks have registered their first July technical breakouts — reaching all-time highs — while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite concurrently extend previous breaks to record territory.

Breaking            
Energy ETF set for best one-day gain in 3 weeks as crude climbs
A prominent fund used to bet on the energy sector on Monday was on pace to post its best daily climb since early June, according to FactSet data. The energy-focused Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF was up 2.2%, setting the ETF up for its sharpest one-day rise since a 2.4% gain on June 9. Gains in the ETF were being led by a 6% rally in shares of Transocean Ltd.  and a more than 5% climb in Baker Hughes Inc. . The climb in shares of Baker Hughes also comes as General Electric Co.  announced the completion of its deal to combine its energy business with Baker Hughes. On the day, the energy sector was the best performer among the S&P 500's  11 sectors, with financials   also helping to buoy U.S. equity benchmarks. August West Texas Intermediate crude  rose sharply above $46 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, jolted energy stocks higher in a holiday-shortened trading session. The S&P 500 was up 0.3%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average  was up 0.8%, after briefly touching an intraday record of 21,562.75. The Nasdaq Composite Index   lagged behind the benchmarks, down 0.5%, as the technology sector  extended a bout of weakness amid concerns about tech-share valuations.

Breaking            
Energy ETF on track for its worst one-day drop in 3 months
A popular exchange-traded fund used to bet on the energy sector on Tuesday was looking at its worst daily decline in more than three months, according to FactSet data. The Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF  was down 2.2% in recent trade, putting it on pace to log its steepest drop since March 8, when it plunged 2.6%. The slump in the energy-focused ETF was led by sharp drops in Transocean Ltd.  , Hess Corp.   and Marathon Oil Corp. , which were down at least 4%. All of the index's components were trading in the red, in early trade. The decline for the sector comes as crude-oil prices  sink to a seven-month low and are flirting with a close in bear-market territory, defined as a fall of at least 20% from a recent peak. Crude's slump was putting pressure on the S&P 500 index , with the energy sector the worst performer among the benchmark's 11 sectors, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average  was lower, weighed by a 1.6% decline in shares of Chevron Corp.  and a 1.3% fall in shares of Exxon Mobil Corp. .

Breaking            
Energy sector faces worst daily drop in 3 months as oil prices tumble
A popular fund tracking the energy sector on Wednesday was on pace for its steepest one-day slide in more than three months after crude-oil futures sank on the heels of a report showing a smaller-than-expected drop in U.S. inventories. The Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF  was down 2.3%, which would mark the worst daily drop for the exchange-traded fund, if it holds, since March 8 when it fell 2.6%, according to FactSet data. All of the ETF's components were trading in the red, led by a 6.2% decline in shares of Transocean Ltd.  and a 5.1% fall in Murphy Oil Corp. . The moves come as the inventory report, released Wednesday at 10:30 a.m. Eastern, drove crude-oil futures for July delivery  sharply lower. Data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration showed that domestic-crude supplies fell by 1.7 million barrels for the week ended June 9. Analysts at Citi Futures expected a decline of between 2 million and 3 million barrels. The broader market also was under pressure, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average  was off 0.1%, the S&P 500 index  was trading down 0.2%, while the Nasdaq Composite Index  was off 0.1%. Crude futures have been dogged by persistent concerns about a glut of oil, despite recent efforts led by members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to curb output by extending a six-month output limit that would have ended this month until March 2018. U.S. shale producers, who are not party to the production limits, have been often cited as the biggest headwind to these global output agreements.

Energy stocks sink as crude oil prices tumble below $50 a barrel
Shares of oil companies were broadly and sharply lower Thursday, after OPEC's decision to extend its production plan, rather than cut it, sent crude oil prices tumbling below $50 a barrel. The SPDR Energy Select Sector ETF  dropped 1.4%, bucking the rally in the broader stock market, with 32 of its 34 equity components trading lower. Among the biggest losers and most-active shares, Transocean Ltd.  sank 6.2%, Chesapeake Energy Corp.  slid 5.3% and Marathon Oil Corp.  shed 5.2%. Among the ETF's most-heavily weighted, shares of Exxon Mobil Corp.  dropped 0.7%, Chevron Corp.  shed 1% and Schlumberger Ltd.  gave up 2.2%. The two XLE gainers were shares of Kinder Morgan Inc. , up 0.3% and Tesoro Corp. , up 2.3%. July crude oil futures  plunged 4.8% to $48.91 a barrel. While the XLE tumbled, the S&P 500 rallied 0.4% toward a record close.

Oil stocks surge after Saudis, Russians endorse extension of production cuts
Energy stocks were broadly and sharply higher Monday, as a big rally in crude oil prices helped light a fire under the sector. The SPDR Energy Select Sector ETF  ran up 1.4% in morning trade, making it by far the biggest gainer among trackers of the S&P 500's 11 key sectors. Crude oil futures shot up 3.3%, after the energy ministers of Saudi Arabia and Russia said they endorsed a nine-month extension to production cuts agreed upon by OPEC. Oil and gas explorer Marathon Oil Corp.'s stock  surged 5.2% to pace the S&P 500's  advancers. Among shares of other top S&P 500 gainers, Chesapeake Energy Corp.  ran up 3.6%, Transocean Ltd.  climbed 3.5%, Helmerich & Payne Inc.  rallied 3.3%, Murphy Oil Corp.  rose 3.3% and Hess Corp.  gained 3.1%. The energy ETF closed at a nine-month low of $66.26 as recently as May 4, down 15% from an 18-month high of $77.83 on Dec. 13.

Energy stocks rally to lead S&P 500 gainers as oil erases some of Thursday's loss
Energy stocks rallied to lead S&P 500 gainers Friday, rebounding from a rout Thursday driven by a steep decline in oil prices. Crude futures were back in the black Friday after a nearly 5% decline in the prior session, although prices were on track for a hefty loss for the week. Oil has suffered "heavy losses this week as investors are no longer pleased with current output cuts by OPEC," said Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets, as reported by MarketWatch. Futures were up 77 cents, or 1.7%, at $46.29 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Against that backdrop, Transocean Ltd  led the advancers with a 7.4% gain. Chesapeake Energy Corp.  was up 5.4%, NRG Energy Inc.  was up 3% and Murphy Oil Corp.  rose 2.5%. National Oilwell Varco Inc.  added 2.3%, TechnipFMC Plc  rose 2.2% and Hess Corp.  tacked on 2.1%. The Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund was up 0.8%. The S&P 500  was slightly higher.

Energy ETF drops toward 9-month low as oil prices slide
The energy sector was the biggest loser Thursday, as the sharp selloff in oil prices sent the SPDR Energy Select Sector ETF  tumbling 2.1% toward a nine-month closing low. Of the sector tracker's (XLE) 34 equity components, only one edged higher, with Noble Energy Inc.'s stock  up 0.7%. Among the sector tracker's most-active components, shares of Chesapeake Energy Corp.  plunged 8.5%, Transocean Ltd.  dropped 4.7%, Marathon Oil Corp.  shed 4.8%, Kinder Morgan Inc.  gave up 2.5% and Exxon Mobil Corp.  slid 1.3%. The XLE had rallied as much as 12% in the month after the election to a 1 1/2-year closing high of $77.83 on Dec. 13, amid optimism over President Donald Trump's promise to reinvigorate the fossil fuel industry, but has since tumbled 15% as optimism faded given the White House's inability to implement policy promises. On Thursday, crude oil futures  tumbled 5% toward the lowest close since Nov. 30, after data showing U.S. production increased while inventories declined less than expected. The XLE has dropped 13% year to date, while the S&P 500  has gained 6.7%.

Current operations[edit]
The company owns 61 rigs including 28 ultra-deepwater floaters, 5 deepwater floaters, 7 Harsh-Environment Floaters, 11 Midwater Floaters, and 10 High-Specification jackup rigs.[4] The company provides quarterly updates on the status of its fleet on its website.[5]
In 2015, Chevron accounted for 14% of the company's revenues and Royal Dutch Shell accounted for 10% of the company's revenues.[1]
History[edit]
Transocean was formed as a result of the merger of Southern Natural Gas Company, later Sonat, with many smaller drilling companies.
In 1953, the Birmingham, Alabama-based Southern Natural Gas Company created The Offshore Company after acquiring the joint drilling operation DeLong-McDermott from DeLong Engineering and J. Ray McDermott. In 1954, the company launched Rig 51, the first mobile jackup rig, in the Gulf of Mexico. In 1967, the Offshore Company went public. In 1978, SNG turned it into a wholly owned subsidiary. In 1982, it was changed to Sonat Offshore Drilling Inc., reflecting a change in its parent's name. In 1993, Sonat spun it off.[6]
In 1996, the company acquired Norwegian group Transocean ASA for US$1.5 billion. Transocean started in the 1970s as a whaling company and expanded through a series of mergers. The new company was called Transocean Offshore. The new company began building massive drilling operations with drills capable of going to 10,000 feet (as opposed to 3,000 feet at the time) and operating two drill operations on the same ship. Its first ship, Discoverer Enterprise, cost nearly US$430 million and was 834 ft (254 m).[7] The Enterprise class drillship is the largest of the drilling ships.[8]
In 1999, Transocean merged with Sedco Forex, the offshore drilling subsidiary of Schlumberger in a $3.2 billion stock transaction in which Schlumberger shareholders received shares of Transocean.[9]
Sedco Forex had been formed from a merger of two drilling companies, the Southeastern Drilling Company (Sedco), founded in 1947 by Bill Clements and acquired by Schlumberger in 1985 for $1 billion [10] and French drilling company Forages et Exploitations Pétrolières (Forex) founded in 1942 in German occupied France for drilling in North Africa.[6] Schlumberger first got a foothold in the company in 1959 and then assumed total control in 1964, and renamed it Forex Neptune Drilling Company. [11]
In 2000, Transocean acquired R&B Falcon Corporation, owner of 115 drilling rigs, in a deal valued at $17.7 billion. With the acquisition, Transocean gained control of what at the time was the world's largest offshore operation. Among R&B Falcon's assets was the Deepwater Horizon. [12] R&B Falcon had acquired Cliffs Drilling Company in 1998. [13]
In 2005, the company's Discoverer Spirit rig set a world record for the deepest offshore oil and gas well of 34,189 ft (10,421 m).[14]
In 2007, the US Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a case against Transocean, alleging violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The case alleged that Transocean paid bribes through its freight forwarding agents to Nigerian customs officials. Transocean later admitted to approving the bribes and agreed to pay USD $13,440,000 to settle the matter.[15]
In 2007, the company merged with GlobalSantaFe Corporation in a transaction that created a company with an enterprise value of $53 billion. Shareholders of GlobalSantaFe Corporation received $15 billion of cash as well as stock in the new company for their shares. Robert E. Rose, who was non-executive chairman of GlobalSantaFe, was made Transocean's chairman. Rose had been chairman of Global Marine prior to its 2001 merger with Santa Fe International Corporation. [16]
In 2008, the company moved its headquarters to Switzerland, resulting in a significantly lower tax rate.[17]
In September 2009, its Deepwater Horizon rig established a 35,050 ft (10,680 m) well, the deepest well in history – more than 5,000 feet deeper than its stated design specification.[14]
In 2010, Transocean was implicated in the Deepwater Horizon oil spill resulting from the explosion of one of its oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico that was leased to BP.[18]
In 2011, the company acquired Aker Drilling, which owned 4 harsh environment rigs used for drilling near Norway.[19]
In 2012, the company sold 38 shallow water rigs and narrowed its focus on high-specification deepwater rigs.[20]
In 2013, the company was added to the S&P 500 index.[21]
In February 2015, CEO Steven Newman quit following a $2.2 billion quarterly loss.[22]
Controversies[edit]
Accidents and incidents[edit]
Transocean was rated as a leader in its industry for many years. However, since the company's merger with GlobalSantaFe in 2007, Transocean's reputation has suffered considerably, according to EnergyPoint Research, an independent oil service industry rating firm. From 2004 to 2007, Transocean was the leader or near the top among deep-water drillers in "job quality" and "overall satisfaction." In 2008 and 2009, surveys ranked Transocean as last among deep-water drillers for "job quality" and as next to last in "overall satisfaction." In 2008 and 2009, Transocean ranked first for in-house safety and environmental policies, and in the middle of the pack for perceived environmental and safety record.[23] The Deepwater Horizon explosion and massive oil spill, starting in April 2010, further hurt its reputation. "Transocean is dominant, but the accident has definitely tarnished its reputation for worker safety and for being able to manage and deliver on extraordinarily complex deepwater projects," said Christopher Ruppel, an energy expert and managing director of capital markets at Execution Noble, an investment bank.[24]
Transocean Leader accident (2002)[edit]
On March 2, 2002, a Scottish man was killed in an accident aboard the Transocean Leader drilling rig operated for BP, located about 138 kilometers (86 miles) west of Shetland, Scotland.[25]
Galveston Bay explosion (2003)[edit]
On June 17, 2003, one worker was killed, four others were hospitalised and 21 were evacuated after an explosion on a Transocean gas drilling rig in Galveston Bay, Texas.[26]
Maintenance citation on Transocean Rather (2005)[edit]
On August 24, 2005, the UK Health and Safety Executive issued a notice to Transocean saying that, it had failed to maintain its "remote blowout preventor control panel … in an efficient state, efficient working order and in good repair."[27] On November 21, 2005, Transocean was found to be in compliance for this matter.[27]
Sinking of Bourbon Dolphin supply boat /Transocean Rather accident (2007)[edit]
On April 12, 2007, the Bourbon Dolphin supply boat sank off the coast of Scotland while servicing the Transocean Rather drilling rig, killing eight people. The Norwegian Ministry of Justice established a Commission of Inquiry to investigate the incident, and the commission’s report found a series of "unfortunate circumstances" led to the accident "with many of them linked to Bourbon Offshore and Transocean."[28][29]
2008 fatalities[edit]
In 2008, two Transocean workers were reportedly killed on the company's vessels.[30]
Deepwater Horizon drilling rig explosion (2010)[edit]
Main article: Deepwater Horizon drilling rig explosion
On April 20, 2010, a fire was reported on a Transocean-owned semisubmersible drilling rig, Deepwater Horizon. Deepwater Horizon was a RBS8D design of Reading & Bates Falcon, a firm that was acquired by Transocean in 2001. The fire broke out at 10:00 p.m. CDT UTC−5 in US waters of Mississippi Canyon 252 in the Gulf of Mexico. The rig was 41 mi (66 km) off the Louisiana coast. The US Coast Guard launched a rescue operation after the explosion which killed 11 workers and critically injured seven of the 126-member crew.[31][32]
Deepwater Horizon was completely destroyed and subsequently sank.
As the Deepwater Horizon sank, the riser pipe that connected the well-head to the rig was severed. As a result, oil began to spill into the Gulf of Mexico. Estimates of the leak were about 80,000 barrels per day – for 87 days.
Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal declared a state of emergency on April 29, as the oil slick grew and headed toward the most important and most sensitive wetlands in North America, threatening to destroy wildlife and the livelihood of thousands of fishermen. The head of BP Group told CNN's Brian Todd on April 28 that the accident could have been prevented and focused blame on Transocean, which owned and partly manned the rig.[33]
Transocean came under fire from lawyers, representing the fishing and tourism businesses that were hit by the oil spill, and the United States Department of Justice for seeking to use a Limitation of Liability Act of 1851 to restrict its liability for economic damages to $26.7 million.[34]
During Congressional testimony, Transocean and BP blamed each other for the disaster. It emerged that a "heated argument" broke out on the platform 11 hours before the accident, in which Transocean and BP personnel disagreed on an engineering decision related to the closing of the well.[35] On May 14, 2010, US President Barack Obama commented, "I did not appreciate what I considered to be a ridiculous spectacle… executives of BP and Transocean and Halliburton [the firm responsible for cementing the well] falling over each other to point the finger of blame at somebody else. The American people could not have been impressed with that display, and I certainly wasn't."[36]
Transocean later claimed that 2010, the year in which the disaster occurred, was "the best year in safety performance in our company’s history". In a regulatory filing, Transocean said, "Notwithstanding the tragic loss of life in the Gulf of Mexico, we achieved an exemplary statistical safety record as measured by our total recordable incident rate and total potential severity rate." They used this justification to award employees about two-thirds of the maximum possible safety bonuses.[37][38] In response to broad criticism, including from Interior Secretary Ken Salazar, the company announced that its executives would donate the safety portion of the bonuses to a fund supporting the victims' families.[39]
Offshore drilling leak off the Brazilian coast (2011)[edit]
The offshore drilling facility "Sedco 706", operated by Transocean under contract from Chevron, began to leak in November 2011 while working on the "Frade" oil field.[40] Oil began leaking from the seabed at a depth of approximately 1100 to 1200m. Damage included an oil slick (oil floating on the ocean surface) covering an area of approximately 80 km2 and growing. This put the oil at a distance of about 370 km from Rio de Janeiro, but other beautiful beaches are much closer (estimated 140 km). The Brazilian government sued Transocean and attempted to force the company to cease operations in Brazil, but a settlement was reached without a finding of fault or liability.[41]
Transocean Winner grounding on the Isle of Lewis, Scotland (2016)[edit]
In the early hours of Monday 8 August 2016, the semi-submersible drilling rig Transocean Winner ran aground near Dalmore in the Carloway district of the Isle of Lewis in the Outer Hebrides, Scotland.[42] The rig had been under tow by the tug Alp Forward in winds of galeforce, when the tow line broke. The rig subsequently drifted ashore at Dalmore and became stuck fast on rocks at 07.30 BST. Continuing poor weather meant that a damage inspection by salvors has been practically impossible, as personnel require to be airlifted on to the rig, in spite of it being close to the shore.[43] The rig was carrying approximately 280 tons of diesel, to power its generators, of which 53 tons is thought to have leaked into the sea, and dispersed or evaporated in rough conditions.[44] Environmental monitoring of plant and animal life is on-going, particularly in view of the economically important fish farming operations in nearby Loch Roag.
Environmental record[edit]
In early April 2015, six activists with the environmental group Greenpeace boarded the ship Blue Marlin while at sea, which was carrying one of Transocean's rigs, the 120 meter (400 ft.) tall Polar Pioneer, and camped out in superstructure of the rig. The activists promised to continuing their protests as the rig undergoes final outfitting while it is anchored in the Port Angeles harbor in Washington State and then later in Puget Sound.[45]

Current operations[edit]
The company owns 61 rigs including 28 ultra-deepwater floaters, 5 deepwater floaters, 7 Harsh-Environment Floaters, 11 Midwater Floaters, and 10 High-Specification jackup rigs.[4] The company provides quarterly updates on the status of its fleet on its website.[5]
In 2015, Chevron accounted for 14% of the company's revenues and Royal Dutch Shell accounted for 10% of the company's revenues.[1]
History[edit]
Transocean was formed as a result of the merger of Southern Natural Gas Company, later Sonat, with many smaller drilling companies.
In 1953, the Birmingham, Alabama-based Southern Natural Gas Company created The Offshore Company after acquiring the joint drilling operation DeLong-McDermott from DeLong Engineering and J. Ray McDermott. In 1954, the company launched Rig 51, the first mobile jackup rig, in the Gulf of Mexico. In 1967, the Offshore Company went public. In 1978, SNG turned it into a wholly owned subsidiary. In 1982, it was changed to Sonat Offshore Drilling Inc., reflecting a change in its parent's name. In 1993, Sonat spun it off.[6]
In 1996, the company acquired Norwegian group Transocean ASA for US$1.5 billion. Transocean started in the 1970s as a whaling company and expanded through a series of mergers. The new company was called Transocean Offshore. The new company began building massive drilling operations with drills capable of going to 10,000 feet (as opposed to 3,000 feet at the time) and operating two drill operations on the same ship. Its first ship, Discoverer Enterprise, cost nearly US$430 million and was 834 ft (254 m).[7] The Enterprise class drillship is the largest of the drilling ships.[8]
In 1999, Transocean merged with Sedco Forex, the offshore drilling subsidiary of Schlumberger in a $3.2 billion stock transaction in which Schlumberger shareholders received shares of Transocean.[9]
Sedco Forex had been formed from a merger of two drilling companies, the Southeastern Drilling Company (Sedco), founded in 1947 by Bill Clements and acquired by Schlumberger in 1985 for $1 billion [10] and French drilling company Forages et Exploitations Pétrolières (Forex) founded in 1942 in German occupied France for drilling in North Africa.[6] Schlumberger first got a foothold in the company in 1959 and then assumed total control in 1964, and renamed it Forex Neptune Drilling Company. [11]
In 2000, Transocean acquired R&B Falcon Corporation, owner of 115 drilling rigs, in a deal valued at $17.7 billion. With the acquisition, Transocean gained control of what at the time was the world's largest offshore operation. Among R&B Falcon's assets was the Deepwater Horizon. [12] R&B Falcon had acquired Cliffs Drilling Company in 1998. [13]
In 2005, the company's Discoverer Spirit rig set a world record for the deepest offshore oil and gas well of 34,189 ft (10,421 m).[14]
In 2007, the US Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a case against Transocean, alleging violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The case alleged that Transocean paid bribes through its freight forwarding agents to Nigerian customs officials. Transocean later admitted to approving the bribes and agreed to pay USD $13,440,000 to settle the matter.[15]
In 2007, the company merged with GlobalSantaFe Corporation in a transaction that created a company with an enterprise value of $53 billion. Shareholders of GlobalSantaFe Corporation received $15 billion of cash as well as stock in the new company for their shares. Robert E. Rose, who was non-executive chairman of GlobalSantaFe, was made Transocean's chairman. Rose had been chairman of Global Marine prior to its 2001 merger with Santa Fe International Corporation. [16]
In 2008, the company moved its headquarters to Switzerland, resulting in a significantly lower tax rate.[17]
In September 2009, its Deepwater Horizon rig established a 35,050 ft (10,680 m) well, the deepest well in history – more than 5,000 feet deeper than its stated design specification.[14]
In 2010, Transocean was implicated in the Deepwater Horizon oil spill resulting from the explosion of one of its oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico that was leased to BP.[18]
In 2011, the company acquired Aker Drilling, which owned 4 harsh environment rigs used for drilling near Norway.[19]
In 2012, the company sold 38 shallow water rigs and narrowed its focus on high-specification deepwater rigs.[20]
In 2013, the company was added to the S&P 500 index.[21]
In February 2015, CEO Steven Newman quit following a $2.2 billion quarterly loss.[22]
Controversies[edit]
Accidents and incidents[edit]
Transocean was rated as a leader in its industry for many years. However, since the company's merger with GlobalSantaFe in 2007, Transocean's reputation has suffered considerably, according to EnergyPoint Research, an independent oil service industry rating firm. From 2004 to 2007, Transocean was the leader or near the top among deep-water drillers in "job quality" and "overall satisfaction." In 2008 and 2009, surveys ranked Transocean as last among deep-water drillers for "job quality" and as next to last in "overall satisfaction." In 2008 and 2009, Transocean ranked first for in-house safety and environmental policies, and in the middle of the pack for perceived environmental and safety record.[23] The Deepwater Horizon explosion and massive oil spill, starting in April 2010, further hurt its reputation. "Transocean is dominant, but the accident has definitely tarnished its reputation for worker safety and for being able to manage and deliver on extraordinarily complex deepwater projects," said Christopher Ruppel, an energy expert and managing director of capital markets at Execution Noble, an investment bank.[24]
Transocean Leader accident (2002)[edit]
On March 2, 2002, a Scottish man was killed in an accident aboard the Transocean Leader drilling rig operated for BP, located about 138 kilometers (86 miles) west of Shetland, Scotland.[25]
Galveston Bay explosion (2003)[edit]
On June 17, 2003, one worker was killed, four others were hospitalised and 21 were evacuated after an explosion on a Transocean gas drilling rig in Galveston Bay, Texas.[26]
Maintenance citation on Transocean Rather (2005)[edit]
On August 24, 2005, the UK Health and Safety Executive issued a notice to Transocean saying that, it had failed to maintain its "remote blowout preventor control panel … in an efficient state, efficient working order and in good repair."[27] On November 21, 2005, Transocean was found to be in compliance for this matter.[27]
Sinking of Bourbon Dolphin supply boat /Transocean Rather accident (2007)[edit]
On April 12, 2007, the Bourbon Dolphin supply boat sank off the coast of Scotland while servicing the Transocean Rather drilling rig, killing eight people. The Norwegian Ministry of Justice established a Commission of Inquiry to investigate the incident, and the commission’s report found a series of "unfortunate circumstances" led to the accident "with many of them linked to Bourbon Offshore and Transocean."[28][29]
2008 fatalities[edit]
In 2008, two Transocean workers were reportedly killed on the company's vessels.[30]
Deepwater Horizon drilling rig explosion (2010)[edit]
Main article: Deepwater Horizon drilling rig explosion
On April 20, 2010, a fire was reported on a Transocean-owned semisubmersible drilling rig, Deepwater Horizon. Deepwater Horizon was a RBS8D design of Reading & Bates Falcon, a firm that was acquired by Transocean in 2001. The fire broke out at 10:00 p.m. CDT UTC−5 in US waters of Mississippi Canyon 252 in the Gulf of Mexico. The rig was 41 mi (66 km) off the Louisiana coast. The US Coast Guard launched a rescue operation after the explosion which killed 11 workers and critically injured seven of the 126-member crew.[31][32]
Deepwater Horizon was completely destroyed and subsequently sank.
As the Deepwater Horizon sank, the riser pipe that connected the well-head to the rig was severed. As a result, oil began to spill into the Gulf of Mexico. Estimates of the leak were about 80,000 barrels per day – for 87 days.
Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal declared a state of emergency on April 29, as the oil slick grew and headed toward the most important and most sensitive wetlands in North America, threatening to destroy wildlife and the livelihood of thousands of fishermen. The head of BP Group told CNN's Brian Todd on April 28 that the accident could have been prevented and focused blame on Transocean, which owned and partly manned the rig.[33]
Transocean came under fire from lawyers, representing the fishing and tourism businesses that were hit by the oil spill, and the United States Department of Justice for seeking to use a Limitation of Liability Act of 1851 to restrict its liability for economic damages to $26.7 million.[34]
During Congressional testimony, Transocean and BP blamed each other for the disaster. It emerged that a "heated argument" broke out on the platform 11 hours before the accident, in which Transocean and BP personnel disagreed on an engineering decision related to the closing of the well.[35] On May 14, 2010, US President Barack Obama commented, "I did not appreciate what I considered to be a ridiculous spectacle… executives of BP and Transocean and Halliburton [the firm responsible for cementing the well] falling over each other to point the finger of blame at somebody else. The American people could not have been impressed with that display, and I certainly wasn't."[36]
Transocean later claimed that 2010, the year in which the disaster occurred, was "the best year in safety performance in our company’s history". In a regulatory filing, Transocean said, "Notwithstanding the tragic loss of life in the Gulf of Mexico, we achieved an exemplary statistical safety record as measured by our total recordable incident rate and total potential severity rate." They used this justification to award employees about two-thirds of the maximum possible safety bonuses.[37][38] In response to broad criticism, including from Interior Secretary Ken Salazar, the company announced that its executives would donate the safety portion of the bonuses to a fund supporting the victims' families.[39]
Offshore drilling leak off the Brazilian coast (2011)[edit]
The offshore drilling facility "Sedco 706", operated by Transocean under contract from Chevron, began to leak in November 2011 while working on the "Frade" oil field.[40] Oil began leaking from the seabed at a depth of approximately 1100 to 1200m. Damage included an oil slick (oil floating on the ocean surface) covering an area of approximately 80 km2 and growing. This put the oil at a distance of about 370 km from Rio de Janeiro, but other beautiful beaches are much closer (estimated 140 km). The Brazilian government sued Transocean and attempted to force the company to cease operations in Brazil, but a settlement was reached without a finding of fault or liability.[41]
Transocean Winner grounding on the Isle of Lewis, Scotland (2016)[edit]
In the early hours of Monday 8 August 2016, the semi-submersible drilling rig Transocean Winner ran aground near Dalmore in the Carloway district of the Isle of Lewis in the Outer Hebrides, Scotland.[42] The rig had been under tow by the tug Alp Forward in winds of galeforce, when the tow line broke. The rig subsequently drifted ashore at Dalmore and became stuck fast on rocks at 07.30 BST. Continuing poor weather meant that a damage inspection by salvors has been practically impossible, as personnel require to be airlifted on to the rig, in spite of it being close to the shore.[43] The rig was carrying approximately 280 tons of diesel, to power its generators, of which 53 tons is thought to have leaked into the sea, and dispersed or evaporated in rough conditions.[44] Environmental monitoring of plant and animal life is on-going, particularly in view of the economically important fish farming operations in nearby Loch Roag.
Environmental record[edit]
In early April 2015, six activists with the environmental group Greenpeace boarded the ship Blue Marlin while at sea, which was carrying one of Transocean's rigs, the 120 meter (400 ft.) tall Polar Pioneer, and camped out in superstructure of the rig. The activists promised to continuing their protests as the rig undergoes final outfitting while it is anchored in the Port Angeles harbor in Washington State and then later in Puget Sound.[45]

Current operations[edit]
The company owns 61 rigs including 28 ultra-deepwater floaters, 5 deepwater floaters, 7 Harsh-Environment Floaters, 11 Midwater Floaters, and 10 High-Specification jackup rigs.[4] The company provides quarterly updates on the status of its fleet on its website.[5]
In 2015, Chevron accounted for 14% of the company's revenues and Royal Dutch Shell accounted for 10% of the company's revenues.[1]
History[edit]
Transocean was formed as a result of the merger of Southern Natural Gas Company, later Sonat, with many smaller drilling companies.
In 1953, the Birmingham, Alabama-based Southern Natural Gas Company created The Offshore Company after acquiring the joint drilling operation DeLong-McDermott from DeLong Engineering and J. Ray McDermott. In 1954, the company launched Rig 51, the first mobile jackup rig, in the Gulf of Mexico. In 1967, the Offshore Company went public. In 1978, SNG turned it into a wholly owned subsidiary. In 1982, it was changed to Sonat Offshore Drilling Inc., reflecting a change in its parent's name. In 1993, Sonat spun it off.[6]
In 1996, the company acquired Norwegian group Transocean ASA for US$1.5 billion. Transocean started in the 1970s as a whaling company and expanded through a series of mergers. The new company was called Transocean Offshore. The new company began building massive drilling operations with drills capable of going to 10,000 feet (as opposed to 3,000 feet at the time) and operating two drill operations on the same ship. Its first ship, Discoverer Enterprise, cost nearly US$430 million and was 834 ft (254 m).[7] The Enterprise class drillship is the largest of the drilling ships.[8]
In 1999, Transocean merged with Sedco Forex, the offshore drilling subsidiary of Schlumberger in a $3.2 billion stock transaction in which Schlumberger shareholders received shares of Transocean.[9]
Sedco Forex had been formed from a merger of two drilling companies, the Southeastern Drilling Company (Sedco), founded in 1947 by Bill Clements and acquired by Schlumberger in 1985 for $1 billion [10] and French drilling company Forages et Exploitations Pétrolières (Forex) founded in 1942 in German occupied France for drilling in North Africa.[6] Schlumberger first got a foothold in the company in 1959 and then assumed total control in 1964, and renamed it Forex Neptune Drilling Company. [11]
In 2000, Transocean acquired R&B Falcon Corporation, owner of 115 drilling rigs, in a deal valued at $17.7 billion. With the acquisition, Transocean gained control of what at the time was the world's largest offshore operation. Among R&B Falcon's assets was the Deepwater Horizon. [12] R&B Falcon had acquired Cliffs Drilling Company in 1998. [13]
In 2005, the company's Discoverer Spirit rig set a world record for the deepest offshore oil and gas well of 34,189 ft (10,421 m).[14]
In 2007, the US Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a case against Transocean, alleging violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The case alleged that Transocean paid bribes through its freight forwarding agents to Nigerian customs officials. Transocean later admitted to approving the bribes and agreed to pay USD $13,440,000 to settle the matter.[15]
In 2007, the company merged with GlobalSantaFe Corporation in a transaction that created a company with an enterprise value of $53 billion. Shareholders of GlobalSantaFe Corporation received $15 billion of cash as well as stock in the new company for their shares. Robert E. Rose, who was non-executive chairman of GlobalSantaFe, was made Transocean's chairman. Rose had been chairman of Global Marine prior to its 2001 merger with Santa Fe International Corporation. [16]
In 2008, the company moved its headquarters to Switzerland, resulting in a significantly lower tax rate.[17]
In September 2009, its Deepwater Horizon rig established a 35,050 ft (10,680 m) well, the deepest well in history – more than 5,000 feet deeper than its stated design specification.[14]
In 2010, Transocean was implicated in the Deepwater Horizon oil spill resulting from the explosion of one of its oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico that was leased to BP.[18]
In 2011, the company acquired Aker Drilling, which owned 4 harsh environment rigs used for drilling near Norway.[19]
In 2012, the company sold 38 shallow water rigs and narrowed its focus on high-specification deepwater rigs.[20]
In 2013, the company was added to the S&P 500 index.[21]
In February 2015, CEO Steven Newman quit following a $2.2 billion quarterly loss.[22]
Controversies[edit]
Accidents and incidents[edit]
Transocean was rated as a leader in its industry for many years. However, since the company's merger with GlobalSantaFe in 2007, Transocean's reputation has suffered considerably, according to EnergyPoint Research, an independent oil service industry rating firm. From 2004 to 2007, Transocean was the leader or near the top among deep-water drillers in "job quality" and "overall satisfaction." In 2008 and 2009, surveys ranked Transocean as last among deep-water drillers for "job quality" and as next to last in "overall satisfaction." In 2008 and 2009, Transocean ranked first for in-house safety and environmental policies, and in the middle of the pack for perceived environmental and safety record.[23] The Deepwater Horizon explosion and massive oil spill, starting in April 2010, further hurt its reputation. "Transocean is dominant, but the accident has definitely tarnished its reputation for worker safety and for being able to manage and deliver on extraordinarily complex deepwater projects," said Christopher Ruppel, an energy expert and managing director of capital markets at Execution Noble, an investment bank.[24]
Transocean Leader accident (2002)[edit]
On March 2, 2002, a Scottish man was killed in an accident aboard the Transocean Leader drilling rig operated for BP, located about 138 kilometers (86 miles) west of Shetland, Scotland.[25]
Galveston Bay explosion (2003)[edit]
On June 17, 2003, one worker was killed, four others were hospitalised and 21 were evacuated after an explosion on a Transocean gas drilling rig in Galveston Bay, Texas.[26]
Maintenance citation on Transocean Rather (2005)[edit]
On August 24, 2005, the UK Health and Safety Executive issued a notice to Transocean saying that, it had failed to maintain its "remote blowout preventor control panel … in an efficient state, efficient working order and in good repair."[27] On November 21, 2005, Transocean was found to be in compliance for this matter.[27]
Sinking of Bourbon Dolphin supply boat /Transocean Rather accident (2007)[edit]
On April 12, 2007, the Bourbon Dolphin supply boat sank off the coast of Scotland while servicing the Transocean Rather drilling rig, killing eight people. The Norwegian Ministry of Justice established a Commission of Inquiry to investigate the incident, and the commission’s report found a series of "unfortunate circumstances" led to the accident "with many of them linked to Bourbon Offshore and Transocean."[28][29]
2008 fatalities[edit]
In 2008, two Transocean workers were reportedly killed on the company's vessels.[30]
Deepwater Horizon drilling rig explosion (2010)[edit]
Main article: Deepwater Horizon drilling rig explosion
On April 20, 2010, a fire was reported on a Transocean-owned semisubmersible drilling rig, Deepwater Horizon. Deepwater Horizon was a RBS8D design of Reading & Bates Falcon, a firm that was acquired by Transocean in 2001. The fire broke out at 10:00 p.m. CDT UTC−5 in US waters of Mississippi Canyon 252 in the Gulf of Mexico. The rig was 41 mi (66 km) off the Louisiana coast. The US Coast Guard launched a rescue operation after the explosion which killed 11 workers and critically injured seven of the 126-member crew.[31][32]
Deepwater Horizon was completely destroyed and subsequently sank.
As the Deepwater Horizon sank, the riser pipe that connected the well-head to the rig was severed. As a result, oil began to spill into the Gulf of Mexico. Estimates of the leak were about 80,000 barrels per day – for 87 days.
Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal declared a state of emergency on April 29, as the oil slick grew and headed toward the most important and most sensitive wetlands in North America, threatening to destroy wildlife and the livelihood of thousands of fishermen. The head of BP Group told CNN's Brian Todd on April 28 that the accident could have been prevented and focused blame on Transocean, which owned and partly manned the rig.[33]
Transocean came under fire from lawyers, representing the fishing and tourism businesses that were hit by the oil spill, and the United States Department of Justice for seeking to use a Limitation of Liability Act of 1851 to restrict its liability for economic damages to $26.7 million.[34]
During Congressional testimony, Transocean and BP blamed each other for the disaster. It emerged that a "heated argument" broke out on the platform 11 hours before the accident, in which Transocean and BP personnel disagreed on an engineering decision related to the closing of the well.[35] On May 14, 2010, US President Barack Obama commented, "I did not appreciate what I considered to be a ridiculous spectacle… executives of BP and Transocean and Halliburton [the firm responsible for cementing the well] falling over each other to point the finger of blame at somebody else. The American people could not have been impressed with that display, and I certainly wasn't."[36]
Transocean later claimed that 2010, the year in which the disaster occurred, was "the best year in safety performance in our company’s history". In a regulatory filing, Transocean said, "Notwithstanding the tragic loss of life in the Gulf of Mexico, we achieved an exemplary statistical safety record as measured by our total recordable incident rate and total potential severity rate." They used this justification to award employees about two-thirds of the maximum possible safety bonuses.[37][38] In response to broad criticism, including from Interior Secretary Ken Salazar, the company announced that its executives would donate the safety portion of the bonuses to a fund supporting the victims' families.[39]
Offshore drilling leak off the Brazilian coast (2011)[edit]
The offshore drilling facility "Sedco 706", operated by Transocean under contract from Chevron, began to leak in November 2011 while working on the "Frade" oil field.[40] Oil began leaking from the seabed at a depth of approximately 1100 to 1200m. Damage included an oil slick (oil floating on the ocean surface) covering an area of approximately 80 km2 and growing. This put the oil at a distance of about 370 km from Rio de Janeiro, but other beautiful beaches are much closer (estimated 140 km). The Brazilian government sued Transocean and attempted to force the company to cease operations in Brazil, but a settlement was reached without a finding of fault or liability.[41]
Transocean Winner grounding on the Isle of Lewis, Scotland (2016)[edit]
In the early hours of Monday 8 August 2016, the semi-submersible drilling rig Transocean Winner ran aground near Dalmore in the Carloway district of the Isle of Lewis in the Outer Hebrides, Scotland.[42] The rig had been under tow by the tug Alp Forward in winds of galeforce, when the tow line broke. The rig subsequently drifted ashore at Dalmore and became stuck fast on rocks at 07.30 BST. Continuing poor weather meant that a damage inspection by salvors has been practically impossible, as personnel require to be airlifted on to the rig, in spite of it being close to the shore.[43] The rig was carrying approximately 280 tons of diesel, to power its generators, of which 53 tons is thought to have leaked into the sea, and dispersed or evaporated in rough conditions.[44] Environmental monitoring of plant and animal life is on-going, particularly in view of the economically important fish farming operations in nearby Loch Roag.
Environmental record[edit]
In early April 2015, six activists with the environmental group Greenpeace boarded the ship Blue Marlin while at sea, which was carrying one of Transocean's rigs, the 120 meter (400 ft.) tall Polar Pioneer, and camped out in superstructure of the rig. The activists promised to continuing their protests as the rig undergoes final outfitting while it is anchored in the Port Angeles harbor in Washington State and then later in Puget Sound.[45]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
