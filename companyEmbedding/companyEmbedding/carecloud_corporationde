Company – About

We Help Healthcare Run Better.
CareCloud is transforming the healthcare experience with the industry’s most modern, flexible and powerful cloud-based platform.







 







Our Mission




CareCloud believes that healthcare deserves tools that are as modern, well-designed, and easy-to-use as the ones encountered elsewhere in our daily lives. The status quo of in-house servers, annual software upgrades, clunky screens and forced purchases of unwanted solutions is a relic. It impedes physicians and patients alike.
Our mission, therefore, is to re-platform healthcare with modern, cloud-based solutions. Our open platform is intended to help providers maximize the efficiency and effectiveness of their practices, while connecting and collaborating directly with patients in support of better care. The platform also supports the choice and flexibility to adopt exactly the tools providers and staff need, rather than what someone else wants to sell them. Ultimately, in partnership with our customers, we seek to make healthcare run better.







 




Core Values
CareCloud employees are committed to our mission and the following four values guide everything we do:

 









Aim to Amaze
We do everything in our power to delight our clients, fellow employees, and other stakeholders, judging the success of our day by whether we helped make others’ lives easier, more productive and more enjoyable.













Uphold Integrity Above All
Working at CareCloud begins with integrity and honesty in everything we do, inside and outside of our company. Always seek to identify and champion the truth, even when it may be difficult or unpopular.














Empower People
CareCloud is a company with entrepreneurial spirit and a roll-up-our-sleeves mentality at its core. We are collaborative by default, actively engaging one another to achieve the best results as team. “Not my job” is not in our nature.













Innovate Relentlessly
To revolutionize the healthcare industry, we must innovate constantly. We are students of the game, constantly scanning the horizon for the ideas, best practices, and emerging trends that can drive CareCloud forward in the marketplace.
