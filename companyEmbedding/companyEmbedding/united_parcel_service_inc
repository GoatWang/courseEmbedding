Common Questions

                        													expand
                        												


                              														expand
                              														How do I track using a UPS Tracking number? 
                     

Using the tracking number automatically assigned to your shipment, visit the ups.com homepage and enter the number in the track window. You can enter multiple tracking numbers if needed. You'll be able to see the shipping date, the current location of the package, the estimated arrival date, and verify the arrival of your shipment. If you're using Quantum View Manage®, Worldship®, UPS CampusShip® or UPS MyChoice®, you can set preferences to receive email or text notifications.




                              														expand
                              														How do I track using a reference number?
                     

When you create a shipment, you can assign it a reference name or number that aligns with your customers' or your business systems. This reference can contain letters and/or numbers, and can be a Purchase Order (PO) number, a customer’s job number, a Bill of Lading number, or even a group of words that identifies the shipment. To use this reference to track your shipment, go to the main Tracking page and select Track by Reference. Input your reference in the Shipment Reference field, indicate whether your shipment is package or freight, and select your shipping dates. Then select the Track button.Track My Package



                              														expand
                              														Do I always have to type in the Tracking Number every time I want to track my shipment? 
                     

No. If you log into ups.com, you can view up to 75 of your most recently tracked shipments and store up to 50 tracking numbers in Tracking History for easy access. This is also the place to add or change a shipment description for a quick, at-a-glance reference.




                              														expand
                              														Can I track more than one shipment at a time? 
                     

Yes. There are two convenient ways to track up to 25 small package shipments at a time. You can copy and paste a list of up to 25 tracking numbers into the “Tracking or InfoNotice Numbers” field on the main ups.com tracking page. Alternatively, you can copy and paste up to 25 small package shipments at once by sending your tracking numbers in an e-mail message to totaltrack@ups.com.




                              														expand
                              														Can I receive proactive updates on the status of my package? 
                     

Yes. Through ups.com Tracking, you can request both email and/or SMS notifications regarding the status of your package, when it has been delivered, or if there was an exception that altered your original delivery date. You can set this notification for each individual package, or receive proactive notifications by logging into ups.com.




                              														expand
                              														Is the tracking status on ups.com the most up-to-date information about my package? 
                     

Yes, the tracking section of ups.com provides the most up-to-date information about the status of your shipment. Shipment movement information is captured each time a tracking label is scanned in the UPS delivery system. Track periodically for shipment progress updates.




Tracking Status Classifications and Messages
                        													expand
                        												


                              														expand
                              														What does "Order Processed: Ready for UPS" mean?
                     

UPS has received the electronic transmission of the shipment details and billing information for this shipment from the sender. Once the shipment is moving within the UPS network, the tracking status will be updated.




                              														expand
                              														In Tracking, what does "Next Expected Tracking Event" mean?
                     

If your shipment is expected to be in transit for more than a day between tracking scans, we will display the day and date of the Next Expected Tracking Event in the Shipment Progress area. This message does not mean that your shipment is behind schedule or stopped moving; it simply means that the tracking label might not be scanned for a while. We display the Next Expected Tracking Event so you can rest assured that your shipment is still moving even though no new tracking scans may appear for a while.




                              														expand
                              														My shipment tracking status is "On Vehicle for Delivery". What time will I receive my shipment?
                     

The shipment has been dispatched to a UPS driver for delivery today. Other than time-definite air deliveries, shipments are generally delivered anytime between the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m. (and sometimes later) to residences, and by close of business for commercial addresses. UPS cannot schedule a specific delivery time within that window. Your driver may make a second attempt on the next business day, and a third attempt on the following business day, if necessary. Where available, your shipment may be taken to a UPS Access Point® location for pickup. Refer to the information on the UPS InfoNotice® left by your driver.
In the U.S. and Canada, shipments that don't require a signature can be left in a safe place at the driver's discretion. Safe places could include the front porch, side door, back porch, or garage area. For residential deliveries that require a signature, you can leave instructions for the driver if no one will be home. For example, you can ask that the shipment is delivered to a neighbor who plans to be home. If an adult signature is required, and the sender has instructed us not to leave the shipment with a neighbor, we will make another delivery attempt on the next business day.




                              														expand
                              														What is an exception?
                     

If you receive a message that your shipment has experienced an exception, then check the Shipment or Package Progress section for details about changes in delivery schedule. An exception occurs when a package or shipment encounters an unforeseen event, which could result in a change to the expected delivery day. Examples of exceptions include address unknown, damage to shipment, or signature not received.




                              														expand
                              														I've been tracking my package, but it doesn't seem to be moving. Why?
                     

Your package is still within the UPS network and, unless otherwise noted, should be delivered on the scheduled delivery date. Shipment movement information is captured each time a tracking label is scanned in the UPS delivery system. There may be several days between scans if the shipment is going cross-country or moving between countries.
If your shipment is expected to be in transit for more than a day between tracking scans, we will display the day and date of the Next Expected Tracking Event in the Shipment Progress area. This message does not mean that your shipment is behind schedule or stopped moving; it simply means that the tracking label might not be scanned for a while. We display the Next Expected Tracking Event so you can rest assured that your shipment is still moving even though no new tracking scans may appear for a while.Learn More

History[edit]
Foundation[edit]




Merchants Parcel Delivery delivery vehicles in 1916


On August 28, 1907, James Casey founded the American Messenger Company with Claude Ryan[7] in Seattle, Washington,[8] capitalized with $100 in debt.[9] Most deliveries at this time were made on foot and bicycles were used for longer trips.
The American Messenger Company focused primarily on package delivery to retail stores with special delivery mail delivered for its largest client the United States Postal Service. In 1913 the company acquired a Model T Ford as its first delivery vehicle. Casey and Ryan merged with a competitor, Evert McCabe, and formed Merchants Parcel Delivery. Consolidated delivery was also introduced, combining packages addressed to a certain neighborhood onto one delivery vehicle.[9] In 1916 Charlie Soderstrom joined Merchants Parcel Delivery bringing in more vehicles for the growing delivery business. In 1919 the company expanded for the first time outside of Seattle to Oakland, California and changed its name to United Parcel Service. The name change to United Parcel Service was to remind the company expansion that operations were still United under the same organisation and Parcel identified the type of business offered as part of its Service. Common carrier service was acquired in 1922 from a company in Los Angeles, California. UPS became one of the only companies in the United States to offer common carrier service. At first common carrier was only limited to a small area around Los Angeles but by 1927 expanded to areas up to 125 miles outside the city. In 1924 a conveyor belt system was debuted for the handling of packages for UPS operations.[10]
In 1930, a consolidated service began in New York City, and soon after in other major cities in the East and the Midwest.[11] The use of common carrier for delivery between all customers placed UPS in direct competition with the United States Postal Service and the Interstate Commerce Commission. The common carrier service was applied in cities where UPS could use the service without the authority of the ICC and state commerce commissions. The first city for UPS to use common carrier status outside of California was Chicago, Illinois in 1953.[12]

Air service through UPS was first used in 1929 through private airlines. However, The Great Depression and a lack of volume ended the air service. In 1953 UPS resumed air service called UPS Blue Label Air with two-day service to major cities along the East Coast and West Coast.[13]
Expansion and diversification[edit]
In 1975, UPS moved its headquarters to Greenwich, Connecticut and began servicing all of the 48 contiguous states of the United States. The expanded operations to all 48 states made UPS the first package delivery company to serve every address in the Continental United States. UPS went international in 1975 establishing operations in Canada and in 1976 operations were established in Germany. On February 28, UPS Ltd. (later changed to UPS Canada Ltd.) began operations in Toronto, Ontario. UPS Canada's head office is located in Burlington, Ontario. In 1976, UPS established a domestic operation in West Germany.[14]
UPS Next Day Air Service was launched in 1985 for all 48 states plus Puerto Rico. In 1988, UPS Airlines was launched with authorization from the Federal Aviation Administration. UPS Airlines became the fastest-growing airline in FAA history and today is the 10th largest airlines in the United States.[15] Domestic air service was added to Germany in 1989.[16] In 1991, UPS moved its headquarters to Sandy Springs, Georgia, a suburb of Atlanta. In 1992, UPS acquired both Haulfast and Carryfast and rebranded them UPS Supply Chain Solutions. Haulfast provided the pallet haulage and trucking network for the CarryFast group of companies. By 1993 UPS was delivering up to 11.5 million packages and documents per day.
The large volume of UPS customers in the 1990s made UPS develop new technology for better efficiency. A handheld device called Delivery Information Acquisition Device (DIAD) was created to record and upload delivery information to the UPS network immediately upon pickup by every UPS driver. In 1992, UPS began tracking all ground shipments electronically. In 1994, UPS.com debuted, and provided the perfect interface to make what was primarily internal operational information available for customer access. In 1995, UPS acquired SonicAir to offer service parts logistics and compete with Choice Logistics. In the same year UPS launched UPS Logistics Group to facilitate global supply chain management solutions and consulting for customer needs. In 1997, a walkout by the 185,000 members of the Teamsters shut down UPS for 16 days.[17] In 1998, UPS Capital was established to enable companies to grow their business through a comprehensive menu of integrated financial services through UPS.[18] UPS acquired Challenge Air in 1999 to expand its operations in Latin America.[19]




Mail Boxes Etc., Inc. was re-branded as The UPS Store in 2001.


On November 10, 1999, UPS became a public company.[20]
21st century[edit]
In 2001, UPS acquired. Mail Boxes Etc., Inc.[21] In 2003 approximately 3,000 Mail Boxes Etc., Inc. were rebranded as The UPS Store.
In 2004, UPS entered the heavy freight business with purchase of Menlo Worldwide Forwarding, a former subsidiary of Menlo Worldwide. UPS rebranded it as UPS Supply Chain Solutions. The purchase price was US$150 million and the assumption of US$110 million in long-term debt. On August 5, 2005, UPS announced that it has completed its acquisition of less-than-truckload (LTL) trucking company Overnite Transportation for US$1.25 billion.[22] This was approved by the FTC and Overnite shareholders on August 4, 2005. In 2005 UPS offered non-stop delivery service between Guangzhou and the United States.[23] On April 28, 2006, Overnite officially became UPS Freight. On October 3, 2005, UPS completed the purchase of LYNX Express Ltd, one of the largest independent parcel carriers in the United Kingdom, for £55.5 million (US$97.1 million) after receiving approval for the transaction from the European Commission. The first joint package car center operation, in Dartford, Kent, is opened in 2006.
On August 28, 2007, United Parcel Service celebrated its 100th anniversary.[24] All Nippon Airways, a Star Alliance member, and UPS formed a cargo alliance and code-share to transport member cargo in 2008, similarly to an airline alliance.[25] On March 19, 2012, UPS announced that it intended to acquire TNT Express for $6.8 billion, in a move to help expand its presence in European and Asian markets.[26] However, the deal fell through in January 2013 after it was announced that UPS had failed to obtain permission from the European Commission and as such had been blocked on competition grounds.[27] In February 2012 UPS acquired Brussels-based company Kiala that provides e-commerce retailers the option to have goods delivered to a convention retail location.[28]
Operations[edit]
UPS's primary business is the time-definite delivery of packages and documents worldwide. In recent years, UPS has extended its service portfolio to include less than truckload (LTL) transportation (primarily in the U.S.) and supply chain services. UPS reports its operations in three segments: U.S. Domestic Package operations, International Package operations, and Supply Chain & Freight operations.
U.S. Domestic Package[edit]
U.S. Domestic Package operations include the time-definite delivery of letters, documents, and packages throughout the United States.

International Package[edit]




UPS has service worldwide, including at Israel's Ben Gurion International Airport (pictured above).


International Package operations include delivery to more than 220 countries and territories worldwide,[6] including shipments wholly outside the United States, as well as shipments with either origin or distribution outside the United States.
Supply Chain & Freight[edit]
Supply Chain & Freight (UPS-SCS for UPS Supply Chain Solutions) includes UPS' forwarding and contract logistics operations, UPS Freight, and other related business units. UPS' forwarding and logistics business provides services in more than 175 countries and territories worldwide, and includes worldwide supply chain design, execution and management, freight forwarding and distribution, customs brokerage, mail and consulting services. UPS Freight offers a variety of less than truckload ("LTL") and truckload ("TL") services to customers in North America.
Other business units within this segment include The UPS Store and UPS Capital.[29]

Personnel structure[edit]
UPS employs approximately 444,000 staff: 362,000 in the U.S. and 82,000 internationally.[31] Approximately 240,000 UPS drivers, package handlers and clerks are represented by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. During the 1997 United Parcel Service strike, the company's only nationwide strike in its history, which lasted 16 days, Teamster President Ron Carey negotiated a new contract for workers.[32]

Competitors[edit]
Major competitors in the United States include United States Postal Service (USPS) and FedEx, as well as regional US carriers such as OnTrac, Eastern Connection, and LSO, formerly known as Lonestar Overnight. In addition to these domestic carriers, UPS competes with a variety of international operators, including Canada Post (and its subsidiary Purolator), TransForce, Deutsche Post (and its subsidiary DHL), Royal Mail, Japan Post, India Post and many other regional carriers, national postal services and air cargo handlers (see Package delivery and Mail pages).
Historically, the bulk of UPS' competition came from inexpensive ground-based delivery services, such as Parcel Post (USPS) or Choice Logistics. But in 1998 FedEx expanded into the ground parcel delivery market by acquiring RPS (originally Roadway Package System) and rebranding it as FedEx Ground in 2000. In 2003 DHL expanded its US operations by acquiring Airborne Express, significantly increasing its presence in the United States, and adding more competition in the ground delivery market. In response to this, UPS partnered with the US Postal Service to offer UPS Mail Innovations,[34] a program that allows UPS to pick up mail & packages separately from the main Ground network and transfer them to a USPS center, or destination delivery unit (DDU),[35] for final distribution. This process is also known as zone skipping,[36] long used by Parcel Consolidators.[37] UPS also has a separate product called "SurePost" which uses the UPS Ground network to deliver packages to the nearest UPS Package Center, which transfers them to the USPS DDU for "final mile" delivery.[38]
More recently, the continued growth of online shopping, combined with increasing awareness of the role transportation (including package delivery) has on the environment, has contributed to the rise of emerging competition from niche carriers or rebranded incumbents. For instance, the US Postal Service claims "greener delivery" of parcels on the assumption that USPS letter carriers deliver to each US address, six days a week anyway, and therefore offer the industry's lowest fuel consumption per delivery. Other carriers, like ParcelPool.com,[39] which specializes in residential package delivery to APO/FPO addresses, Hawaii, Alaska, Puerto Rico, and other US Territories, arose in response to increased demand from catalog retailers and online e-tailers for low-cost residential delivery services closely matching service standards normally associated with more expensive expedited parcel delivery.
Transportation[edit]
Delivery vans[edit]

UPS refers to its delivery van as a "package car". The company utilizes several designs and sizes of package cars, dependent on routes and package volume. The rounded-nose design of fiberglass hood of the UPS package car was patented by the company in 1965.[40] Morgan Olson (Grumman Olson), Union City Body, and Utilimaster manufacture the bodies for UPS delivery vans; older vehicles are based on Ford or General Motors P-chassis, while package cars introduced since the 1990s are based on Freightliner, Navistar, or Workhorse chassis. Originally, UPS delivery vehicles were equipped with manual transmissions and steering, although many newer vehicles are updated with automatic transmissions. In a 2010s redesign of the hood, the rounded-nose design has been phased out; its sealed-beam headlights have been replaced with automotive-sourced composite headlight units faired into the hood.
Along with its large delivery vans, for smaller routes, the company utilizes brown-painted delivery vehicles based on off-the-shelf production vehicles, including minivans (including the Ford Transit Connect and Dodge Grand Caravan) and Mercedes-Benz (Dodge/Freightliner) Sprinter box vans. UPS has ordered Modec electric vans for its UK and German fleets. Energy costs play a huge part in the potential profitability of package delivery companies like DHL and FedEx.[41]
When UPS ground vehicles reach the end of their useful service life and are no longer roadworthy (typically 20–25 years or more, but generally when the body's structural integrity is compromised), they are almost always stripped of reusable parts, repainted in household paint to cover up the trademark, and then sent to the scrapyard to be crushed and broken up. The only exception to this policy is when a package car is repainted white for internal use, usually at a large hub. Prior to scrapping, UPS trucks and trailers are assigned an ADA (Automotive Destruction Authorization) number and must be crushed under supervision of UPS Automotive personnel, which records the vehicle's destruction, as UPS does not re-sell any of its ground vehicles.

The UPS package car (delivery van) is a major symbol of the U.S. business world, with its iconic status referenced in an early 2000s ad campaign following UPS' sponsorship of Dale Jarrett in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series: the ads were about how the company would prefer to race the truck over a stock car despite the futility of doing so, as "people love the truck".
Tractor-trailers[edit]

UPS commonly refers to its ground package tractor-trailers as "feeders"; these vehicles are separate from the UPS Freight fleet. In line with its delivery vehicles, nearly all UPS tractor units are painted in a Pullman brown livery. As part of a company policy to avoid manufacturer advertising, all UPS semitractors have all manufacturer emblems and badging removed wherever possible.
Prior to the 1990s, many tractors were of cabover configuration; as trailer-length laws were revised in the United States, the company transitioned towards the use of conventional-style semitractor. As of 2017, nearly the entire tractor fleet consists of conventionals.
In North America, vehicles of the UPS semitractor fleet are manufactured by Mack Trucks (the Pinnacle and Vision) and Navistar (International ProStar+ and 9900i) along with PACCAR vehicles (Kenworth T800, T660 and T680). Older vehicles in the fleet include Ford/Sterling tractors (Aeromax/A-Line), Freightliner (Argosy, the final caboveritruck used by UPS); Mack CH and International 8100 tractors are in the process of being phased out.
Previous trucks used by UPS include the Ford L9000, Ford Aeromax, International 8100/8200, International 9670, GMC Astro, Peterbilt 362, Ford L9000, Ford Aeromax, WhiteGMC High Cabover/Road Commander II, Mack CH, Mack MH UltraLiner, Mack F, and Diamond T/Diamond Reo cabovers. At one time[when?], UPS used electric-powered trucks (made by White Motors) for deliveries in Manhattan, NYC. There were only a few hundred of them, but they were notable for their "spooky silence" when running[citation needed].
Painted a light gray, company-owned semitrailers are distinguished by a large UPS emblem on the forward portion of the trailer sides; newer trailers are distinguished by the fitment of trailer skirts. Designed in several configurations, UPS uses several lengths of trailers (28, 45, 48, and 53 feet). Along with standard flat-bottom van trailers, there are drop-frame trailers (largely being phased out of the fleet) and trailer-on-flatcar trailers (TOFC); the latter are trailers designed for transport on railroad cars.
Based on state and provincial regulations, many UPS short trailers are towed in tandem.

Bicycles[edit]
In 2008, UPS started hiring bicycle delivery personnel in Vancouver, Washington, and in several cities in Oregon (Portland, Salem, Corvallis, Eugene, and Medford).[42]
Trains[edit]
UPS contracts with several railroad companies in the United States to provide intermodal transport for its cargo.
Cargo airlines[edit]
Main article: UPS Airlines
UPS Airlines consists of 236 aircraft that serves over 200 countries and territories worldwide.[43][44] Based out of Louisville, Kentucky (home to Worldport), UPS Airlines operates several major hubs throughout the United States; the largest are in Philadelphia and in Rockford, Illinois (Chicago).
Outside of North America, a hub in Cologne, Germany services Europe, while in Asia, UPS Airlines operates a facility in Hong Kong and two hubs in mainland China.
Company brand[edit]
Brown[edit]
The brown color that UPS uses on its vehicles and uniforms is called Pullman Brown. Company founder James E. Casey originally wanted company vehicles to use a yellow paint scheme, but one of his partners, Charlie Soderstrom, stated that a yellow vehicle would be hard to keep clean and that Pullman railroad cars were brown for just that reason.[7]
During the 2000s, the company used the familiarity of its color scheme in an advertising slogan: "What can Brown do for you?"[45]
Font[edit]
UPS commissioned brand consultancy FutureBrand to develop its own font, UPS Sans, for use in marketing and communication material. UPS Sans was created by slightly altering certain parts of FSI FontShop International's font FF Dax without permission. This has resulted in an agreement between FSI FontShop International and FutureBrand to avoid litigation.[46]
Environmental record[edit]
As of 2013, UPS has over 104,900 vehicles in operation worldwide including nearly 7,000 alternative-fuel vehicles.[1] In May 2008 UPS placed an order for 200 hybrid electric vehicles (adding to the 50 it had at that point) and 300 compressed natural gas (which are 20% more fuel efficient, and add to the 800 it already has) vehicles from Daimler Trucks North America.[47][48][49]
UPS received a "striding" rating of 80 points out of 100 totals on the environmental scorecard by the Climate Counts Group for its efforts to lessen the company's impact on the environment.[50] UPS has also been awarded the Clean Air Excellence Award by the United States Environmental Protection Agency because of the alternative fuel program it has developed.[51]
In October 2009, UPS became the first small-package carrier to offer customers the chance to buy carbon offsets to neutralize the greenhouse gas emissions generated by the transport of their packages. Although initially only available on ups.com and to high-volume shippers, they are now widely available through UPS shipping systems and UPS Ready third-party shipping systems.[52][53]
Controversy[edit]
On May 26, 2017, A federal judge ordered United Parcel Service to pay nearly $247 million in damages and penalties for illegally shipping large amounts of untaxed cigarettes in New York.[54]

History[edit]
Foundation[edit]




Merchants Parcel Delivery delivery vehicles in 1916


On August 28, 1907, James Casey founded the American Messenger Company with Claude Ryan[7] in Seattle, Washington,[8] capitalized with $100 in debt.[9] Most deliveries at this time were made on foot and bicycles were used for longer trips.
The American Messenger Company focused primarily on package delivery to retail stores with special delivery mail delivered for its largest client the United States Postal Service. In 1913 the company acquired a Model T Ford as its first delivery vehicle. Casey and Ryan merged with a competitor, Evert McCabe, and formed Merchants Parcel Delivery. Consolidated delivery was also introduced, combining packages addressed to a certain neighborhood onto one delivery vehicle.[9] In 1916 Charlie Soderstrom joined Merchants Parcel Delivery bringing in more vehicles for the growing delivery business. In 1919 the company expanded for the first time outside of Seattle to Oakland, California and changed its name to United Parcel Service. The name change to United Parcel Service was to remind the company expansion that operations were still United under the same organisation and Parcel identified the type of business offered as part of its Service. Common carrier service was acquired in 1922 from a company in Los Angeles, California. UPS became one of the only companies in the United States to offer common carrier service. At first common carrier was only limited to a small area around Los Angeles but by 1927 expanded to areas up to 125 miles outside the city. In 1924 a conveyor belt system was debuted for the handling of packages for UPS operations.[10]
In 1930, a consolidated service began in New York City, and soon after in other major cities in the East and the Midwest.[11] The use of common carrier for delivery between all customers placed UPS in direct competition with the United States Postal Service and the Interstate Commerce Commission. The common carrier service was applied in cities where UPS could use the service without the authority of the ICC and state commerce commissions. The first city for UPS to use common carrier status outside of California was Chicago, Illinois in 1953.[12]




Ford Model T UPS delivery vehicle in 1921


Air service through UPS was first used in 1929 through private airlines. However, The Great Depression and a lack of volume ended the air service. In 1953 UPS resumed air service called UPS Blue Label Air with two-day service to major cities along the East Coast and West Coast.[13]
Expansion and diversification[edit]
In 1975, UPS moved its headquarters to Greenwich, Connecticut and began servicing all of the 48 contiguous states of the United States. The expanded operations to all 48 states made UPS the first package delivery company to serve every address in the Continental United States. UPS went international in 1975 establishing operations in Canada and in 1976 operations were established in Germany. On February 28, UPS Ltd. (later changed to UPS Canada Ltd.) began operations in Toronto, Ontario. UPS Canada's head office is located in Burlington, Ontario. In 1976, UPS established a domestic operation in West Germany.[14]
UPS Next Day Air Service was launched in 1985 for all 48 states plus Puerto Rico. In 1988, UPS Airlines was launched with authorization from the Federal Aviation Administration. UPS Airlines became the fastest-growing airline in FAA history and today is the 10th largest airlines in the United States.[15] Domestic air service was added to Germany in 1989.[16] In 1991, UPS moved its headquarters to Sandy Springs, Georgia, a suburb of Atlanta. In 1992, UPS acquired both Haulfast and Carryfast and rebranded them UPS Supply Chain Solutions. Haulfast provided the pallet haulage and trucking network for the CarryFast group of companies. By 1993 UPS was delivering up to 11.5 million packages and documents per day.
The large volume of UPS customers in the 1990s made UPS develop new technology for better efficiency. A handheld device called Delivery Information Acquisition Device (DIAD) was created to record and upload delivery information to the UPS network immediately upon pickup by every UPS driver. In 1992, UPS began tracking all ground shipments electronically. In 1994, UPS.com debuted, and provided the perfect interface to make what was primarily internal operational information available for customer access. In 1995, UPS acquired SonicAir to offer service parts logistics and compete with Choice Logistics. In the same year UPS launched UPS Logistics Group to facilitate global supply chain management solutions and consulting for customer needs. In 1997, a walkout by the 185,000 members of the Teamsters shut down UPS for 16 days.[17] In 1998, UPS Capital was established to enable companies to grow their business through a comprehensive menu of integrated financial services through UPS.[18] UPS acquired Challenge Air in 1999 to expand its operations in Latin America.[19]




Mail Boxes Etc., Inc. was re-branded as The UPS Store in 2001.


On November 10, 1999, UPS became a public company.[20]
21st century[edit]
In 2001, UPS acquired. Mail Boxes Etc., Inc.[21] In 2003 approximately 3,000 Mail Boxes Etc., Inc. were rebranded as The UPS Store.
In 2004, UPS entered the heavy freight business with purchase of Menlo Worldwide Forwarding, a former subsidiary of Menlo Worldwide. UPS rebranded it as UPS Supply Chain Solutions. The purchase price was US$150 million and the assumption of US$110 million in long-term debt. On August 5, 2005, UPS announced that it has completed its acquisition of less-than-truckload (LTL) trucking company Overnite Transportation for US$1.25 billion.[22] This was approved by the FTC and Overnite shareholders on August 4, 2005. In 2005 UPS offered non-stop delivery service between Guangzhou and the United States.[23] On April 28, 2006, Overnite officially became UPS Freight. On October 3, 2005, UPS completed the purchase of LYNX Express Ltd, one of the largest independent parcel carriers in the United Kingdom, for £55.5 million (US$97.1 million) after receiving approval for the transaction from the European Commission. The first joint package car center operation, in Dartford, Kent, is opened in 2006.
On August 28, 2007, United Parcel Service celebrated its 100th anniversary.[24] All Nippon Airways, a Star Alliance member, and UPS formed a cargo alliance and code-share to transport member cargo in 2008, similarly to an airline alliance.[25] On March 19, 2012, UPS announced that it intended to acquire TNT Express for $6.8 billion, in a move to help expand its presence in European and Asian markets.[26] However, the deal fell through in January 2013 after it was announced that UPS had failed to obtain permission from the European Commission and as such had been blocked on competition grounds.[27] In February 2012 UPS acquired Brussels-based company Kiala that provides e-commerce retailers the option to have goods delivered to a convention retail location.[28]
Operations[edit]
UPS's primary business is the time-definite delivery of packages and documents worldwide. In recent years, UPS has extended its service portfolio to include less than truckload (LTL) transportation (primarily in the U.S.) and supply chain services. UPS reports its operations in three segments: U.S. Domestic Package operations, International Package operations, and Supply Chain & Freight operations.
U.S. Domestic Package[edit]
U.S. Domestic Package operations include the time-definite delivery of letters, documents, and packages throughout the United States.

International Package[edit]




UPS has service worldwide, including at Israel's Ben Gurion International Airport (pictured above).


International Package operations include delivery to more than 220 countries and territories worldwide,[6] including shipments wholly outside the United States, as well as shipments with either origin or distribution outside the United States.
Supply Chain & Freight[edit]
Supply Chain & Freight (UPS-SCS for UPS Supply Chain Solutions) includes UPS' forwarding and contract logistics operations, UPS Freight, and other related business units. UPS' forwarding and logistics business provides services in more than 175 countries and territories worldwide, and includes worldwide supply chain design, execution and management, freight forwarding and distribution, customs brokerage, mail and consulting services. UPS Freight offers a variety of less than truckload ("LTL") and truckload ("TL") services to customers in North America.
Other business units within this segment include The UPS Store and UPS Capital.[29]

Personnel structure[edit]
UPS employs approximately 444,000 staff: 362,000 in the U.S. and 82,000 internationally.[31] Approximately 240,000 UPS drivers, package handlers and clerks are represented by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. During the 1997 United Parcel Service strike, the company's only nationwide strike in its history, which lasted 16 days, Teamster President Ron Carey negotiated a new contract for workers.[32]

Competitors[edit]
Major competitors in the United States include United States Postal Service (USPS) and FedEx, as well as regional US carriers such as OnTrac, Eastern Connection, and LSO, formerly known as Lonestar Overnight. In addition to these domestic carriers, UPS competes with a variety of international operators, including Canada Post (and its subsidiary Purolator), TransForce, Deutsche Post (and its subsidiary DHL), Royal Mail, Japan Post, India Post and many other regional carriers, national postal services and air cargo handlers (see Package delivery and Mail pages).
Historically, the bulk of UPS' competition came from inexpensive ground-based delivery services, such as Parcel Post (USPS) or Choice Logistics. But in 1998 FedEx expanded into the ground parcel delivery market by acquiring RPS (originally Roadway Package System) and rebranding it as FedEx Ground in 2000. In 2003 DHL expanded its US operations by acquiring Airborne Express, significantly increasing its presence in the United States, and adding more competition in the ground delivery market. In response to this, UPS partnered with the US Postal Service to offer UPS Mail Innovations,[34] a program that allows UPS to pick up mail & packages separately from the main Ground network and transfer them to a USPS center, or destination delivery unit (DDU),[35] for final distribution. This process is also known as zone skipping,[36] long used by Parcel Consolidators.[37] UPS also has a separate product called "SurePost" which uses the UPS Ground network to deliver packages to the nearest UPS Package Center, which transfers them to the USPS DDU for "final mile" delivery.[38]
More recently, the continued growth of online shopping, combined with increasing awareness of the role transportation (including package delivery) has on the environment, has contributed to the rise of emerging competition from niche carriers or rebranded incumbents. For instance, the US Postal Service claims "greener delivery" of parcels on the assumption that USPS letter carriers deliver to each US address, six days a week anyway, and therefore offer the industry's lowest fuel consumption per delivery. Other carriers, like ParcelPool.com,[39] which specializes in residential package delivery to APO/FPO addresses, Hawaii, Alaska, Puerto Rico, and other US Territories, arose in response to increased demand from catalog retailers and online e-tailers for low-cost residential delivery services closely matching service standards normally associated with more expensive expedited parcel delivery.
Transportation[edit]
Delivery vans[edit]

UPS refers to its delivery van as a "package car". The company utilizes several designs and sizes of package cars, dependent on routes and package volume. The rounded-nose design of fiberglass hood of the UPS package car was patented by the company in 1965.[40] Morgan Olson (Grumman Olson), Union City Body, and Utilimaster manufacture the bodies for UPS delivery vans; older vehicles are based on Ford or General Motors P-chassis, while package cars introduced since the 1990s are based on Freightliner, Navistar, or Workhorse chassis. Originally, UPS delivery vehicles were equipped with manual transmissions and steering, although many newer vehicles are updated with automatic transmissions. In a 2010s redesign of the hood, the rounded-nose design has been phased out; its sealed-beam headlights have been replaced with automotive-sourced composite headlight units faired into the hood.
Along with its large delivery vans, for smaller routes, the company utilizes brown-painted delivery vehicles based on off-the-shelf production vehicles, including minivans (including the Ford Transit Connect and Dodge Grand Caravan) and Mercedes-Benz (Dodge/Freightliner) Sprinter box vans. UPS has ordered Modec electric vans for its UK and German fleets. Energy costs play a huge part in the potential profitability of package delivery companies like DHL and FedEx.[41]
When UPS ground vehicles reach the end of their useful service life and are no longer roadworthy (typically 20–25 years or more, but generally when the body's structural integrity is compromised), they are almost always stripped of reusable parts, repainted in household paint to cover up the trademark, and then sent to the scrapyard to be crushed and broken up. The only exception to this policy is when a package car is repainted white for internal use, usually at a large hub. Prior to scrapping, UPS trucks and trailers are assigned an ADA (Automotive Destruction Authorization) number and must be crushed under supervision of UPS Automotive personnel, which records the vehicle's destruction, as UPS does not re-sell any of its ground vehicles.

The UPS package car (delivery van) is a major symbol of the U.S. business world, with its iconic status referenced in an early 2000s ad campaign following UPS' sponsorship of Dale Jarrett in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series: the ads were about how the company would prefer to race the truck over a stock car despite the futility of doing so, as "people love the truck".
Tractor-trailers[edit]




UPS DAF LF cabover straight truck in Plymouth, United Kingdom


UPS commonly refers to its ground package tractor-trailers as "feeders"; these vehicles are separate from the UPS Freight fleet. In line with its delivery vehicles, nearly all UPS tractor units are painted in a Pullman brown livery. As part of a company policy to avoid manufacturer advertising, all UPS semitractors have all manufacturer emblems and badging removed wherever possible.
Prior to the 1990s, many tractors were of cabover configuration; as trailer-length laws were revised in the United States, the company transitioned towards the use of conventional-style semitractor. As of 2017, nearly the entire tractor fleet consists of conventionals.
In North America, vehicles of the UPS semitractor fleet are manufactured by Mack Trucks (the Pinnacle and Vision) and Navistar (International ProStar+ and 9900i) along with PACCAR vehicles (Kenworth T800, T660 and T680). Older vehicles in the fleet include Ford/Sterling tractors (Aeromax/A-Line), Freightliner (Argosy, the final caboveritruck used by UPS); Mack CH and International 8100 tractors are in the process of being phased out.
Previous trucks used by UPS include the Ford L9000, Ford Aeromax, International 8100/8200, International 9670, GMC Astro, Peterbilt 362, Ford L9000, Ford Aeromax, WhiteGMC High Cabover/Road Commander II, Mack CH, Mack MH UltraLiner, Mack F, and Diamond T/Diamond Reo cabovers. At one time[when?], UPS used electric-powered trucks (made by White Motors) for deliveries in Manhattan, NYC. There were only a few hundred of them, but they were notable for their "spooky silence" when running[citation needed].
Painted a light gray, company-owned semitrailers are distinguished by a large UPS emblem on the forward portion of the trailer sides; newer trailers are distinguished by the fitment of trailer skirts. Designed in several configurations, UPS uses several lengths of trailers (28, 45, 48, and 53 feet). Along with standard flat-bottom van trailers, there are drop-frame trailers (largely being phased out of the fleet) and trailer-on-flatcar trailers (TOFC); the latter are trailers designed for transport on railroad cars.
Based on state and provincial regulations, many UPS short trailers are towed in tandem.

Bicycles[edit]
In 2008, UPS started hiring bicycle delivery personnel in Vancouver, Washington, and in several cities in Oregon (Portland, Salem, Corvallis, Eugene, and Medford).[42]
Trains[edit]
UPS contracts with several railroad companies in the United States to provide intermodal transport for its cargo.
Cargo airlines[edit]
Main article: UPS Airlines
UPS Airlines consists of 236 aircraft that serves over 200 countries and territories worldwide.[43][44] Based out of Louisville, Kentucky (home to Worldport), UPS Airlines operates several major hubs throughout the United States; the largest are in Philadelphia and in Rockford, Illinois (Chicago).
Outside of North America, a hub in Cologne, Germany services Europe, while in Asia, UPS Airlines operates a facility in Hong Kong and two hubs in mainland China.
Company brand[edit]
Brown[edit]
The brown color that UPS uses on its vehicles and uniforms is called Pullman Brown. Company founder James E. Casey originally wanted company vehicles to use a yellow paint scheme, but one of his partners, Charlie Soderstrom, stated that a yellow vehicle would be hard to keep clean and that Pullman railroad cars were brown for just that reason.[7]
During the 2000s, the company used the familiarity of its color scheme in an advertising slogan: "What can Brown do for you?"[45]
Font[edit]
UPS commissioned brand consultancy FutureBrand to develop its own font, UPS Sans, for use in marketing and communication material. UPS Sans was created by slightly altering certain parts of FSI FontShop International's font FF Dax without permission. This has resulted in an agreement between FSI FontShop International and FutureBrand to avoid litigation.[46]
Environmental record[edit]
As of 2013, UPS has over 104,900 vehicles in operation worldwide including nearly 7,000 alternative-fuel vehicles.[1] In May 2008 UPS placed an order for 200 hybrid electric vehicles (adding to the 50 it had at that point) and 300 compressed natural gas (which are 20% more fuel efficient, and add to the 800 it already has) vehicles from Daimler Trucks North America.[47][48][49]
UPS received a "striding" rating of 80 points out of 100 totals on the environmental scorecard by the Climate Counts Group for its efforts to lessen the company's impact on the environment.[50] UPS has also been awarded the Clean Air Excellence Award by the United States Environmental Protection Agency because of the alternative fuel program it has developed.[51]
In October 2009, UPS became the first small-package carrier to offer customers the chance to buy carbon offsets to neutralize the greenhouse gas emissions generated by the transport of their packages. Although initially only available on ups.com and to high-volume shippers, they are now widely available through UPS shipping systems and UPS Ready third-party shipping systems.[52][53]
Controversy[edit]
On May 26, 2017, A federal judge ordered United Parcel Service to pay nearly $247 million in damages and penalties for illegally shipping large amounts of untaxed cigarettes in New York.[54]

United Parcel Service (UPS) is the world's largest package delivery company and a provider of supply chain management solutions.[3] The global logistics company is headquartered in the city of Sandy Springs, Georgia, United States, which is a part of the Greater Atlanta metropolitan area. UPS delivers more than 15 million packages per day to more than 7.9 million customers in more than 220 countries and territories around the world.[4][5][6][better source needed]
UPS is known for its trademark brown delivery trucks and uniforms, hence the company nickname "Brown". UPS also operates its own airline and air cargo delivery service (IATA: 5X, ICAO: UPS, Call sign: UPS) based in Louisville, Kentucky, United States.

History[edit]
Foundation[edit]




Merchants Parcel Delivery delivery vehicles in 1916


On August 28, 1907, James Casey founded the American Messenger Company with Claude Ryan[7] in Seattle, Washington,[8] capitalized with $100 in debt.[9] Most deliveries at this time were made on foot and bicycles were used for longer trips.
The American Messenger Company focused primarily on package delivery to retail stores with special delivery mail delivered for its largest client the United States Postal Service. In 1913 the company acquired a Model T Ford as its first delivery vehicle. Casey and Ryan merged with a competitor, Evert McCabe, and formed Merchants Parcel Delivery. Consolidated delivery was also introduced, combining packages addressed to a certain neighborhood onto one delivery vehicle.[9] In 1916 Charlie Soderstrom joined Merchants Parcel Delivery bringing in more vehicles for the growing delivery business. In 1919 the company expanded for the first time outside of Seattle to Oakland, California and changed its name to United Parcel Service. The name change to United Parcel Service was to remind the company expansion that operations were still United under the same organisation and Parcel identified the type of business offered as part of its Service. Common carrier service was acquired in 1922 from a company in Los Angeles, California. UPS became one of the only companies in the United States to offer common carrier service. At first common carrier was only limited to a small area around Los Angeles but by 1927 expanded to areas up to 125 miles outside the city. In 1924 a conveyor belt system was debuted for the handling of packages for UPS operations.[10]
In 1930, a consolidated service began in New York City, and soon after in other major cities in the East and the Midwest.[11] The use of common carrier for delivery between all customers placed UPS in direct competition with the United States Postal Service and the Interstate Commerce Commission. The common carrier service was applied in cities where UPS could use the service without the authority of the ICC and state commerce commissions. The first city for UPS to use common carrier status outside of California was Chicago, Illinois in 1953.[12]

Air service through UPS was first used in 1929 through private airlines. However, The Great Depression and a lack of volume ended the air service. In 1953 UPS resumed air service called UPS Blue Label Air with two-day service to major cities along the East Coast and West Coast.[13]
Expansion and diversification[edit]
In 1975, UPS moved its headquarters to Greenwich, Connecticut and began servicing all of the 48 contiguous states of the United States. The expanded operations to all 48 states made UPS the first package delivery company to serve every address in the Continental United States. UPS went international in 1975 establishing operations in Canada and in 1976 operations were established in Germany. On February 28, UPS Ltd. (later changed to UPS Canada Ltd.) began operations in Toronto, Ontario. UPS Canada's head office is located in Burlington, Ontario. In 1976, UPS established a domestic operation in West Germany.[14]
UPS Next Day Air Service was launched in 1985 for all 48 states plus Puerto Rico. In 1988, UPS Airlines was launched with authorization from the Federal Aviation Administration. UPS Airlines became the fastest-growing airline in FAA history and today is the 10th largest airlines in the United States.[15] Domestic air service was added to Germany in 1989.[16] In 1991, UPS moved its headquarters to Sandy Springs, Georgia, a suburb of Atlanta. In 1992, UPS acquired both Haulfast and Carryfast and rebranded them UPS Supply Chain Solutions. Haulfast provided the pallet haulage and trucking network for the CarryFast group of companies. By 1993 UPS was delivering up to 11.5 million packages and documents per day.
The large volume of UPS customers in the 1990s made UPS develop new technology for better efficiency. A handheld device called Delivery Information Acquisition Device (DIAD) was created to record and upload delivery information to the UPS network immediately upon pickup by every UPS driver. In 1992, UPS began tracking all ground shipments electronically. In 1994, UPS.com debuted, and provided the perfect interface to make what was primarily internal operational information available for customer access. In 1995, UPS acquired SonicAir to offer service parts logistics and compete with Choice Logistics. In the same year UPS launched UPS Logistics Group to facilitate global supply chain management solutions and consulting for customer needs. In 1997, a walkout by the 185,000 members of the Teamsters shut down UPS for 16 days.[17] In 1998, UPS Capital was established to enable companies to grow their business through a comprehensive menu of integrated financial services through UPS.[18] UPS acquired Challenge Air in 1999 to expand its operations in Latin America.[19]




Mail Boxes Etc., Inc. was re-branded as The UPS Store in 2001.


On November 10, 1999, UPS became a public company.[20]
21st century[edit]
In 2001, UPS acquired. Mail Boxes Etc., Inc.[21] In 2003 approximately 3,000 Mail Boxes Etc., Inc. were rebranded as The UPS Store.
In 2004, UPS entered the heavy freight business with purchase of Menlo Worldwide Forwarding, a former subsidiary of Menlo Worldwide. UPS rebranded it as UPS Supply Chain Solutions. The purchase price was US$150 million and the assumption of US$110 million in long-term debt. On August 5, 2005, UPS announced that it has completed its acquisition of less-than-truckload (LTL) trucking company Overnite Transportation for US$1.25 billion.[22] This was approved by the FTC and Overnite shareholders on August 4, 2005. In 2005 UPS offered non-stop delivery service between Guangzhou and the United States.[23] On April 28, 2006, Overnite officially became UPS Freight. On October 3, 2005, UPS completed the purchase of LYNX Express Ltd, one of the largest independent parcel carriers in the United Kingdom, for £55.5 million (US$97.1 million) after receiving approval for the transaction from the European Commission. The first joint package car center operation, in Dartford, Kent, is opened in 2006.
On August 28, 2007, United Parcel Service celebrated its 100th anniversary.[24] All Nippon Airways, a Star Alliance member, and UPS formed a cargo alliance and code-share to transport member cargo in 2008, similarly to an airline alliance.[25] On March 19, 2012, UPS announced that it intended to acquire TNT Express for $6.8 billion, in a move to help expand its presence in European and Asian markets.[26] However, the deal fell through in January 2013 after it was announced that UPS had failed to obtain permission from the European Commission and as such had been blocked on competition grounds.[27] In February 2012 UPS acquired Brussels-based company Kiala that provides e-commerce retailers the option to have goods delivered to a convention retail location.[28]
Operations[edit]
UPS's primary business is the time-definite delivery of packages and documents worldwide. In recent years, UPS has extended its service portfolio to include less than truckload (LTL) transportation (primarily in the U.S.) and supply chain services. UPS reports its operations in three segments: U.S. Domestic Package operations, International Package operations, and Supply Chain & Freight operations.
U.S. Domestic Package[edit]
U.S. Domestic Package operations include the time-definite delivery of letters, documents, and packages throughout the United States.

International Package[edit]




UPS has service worldwide, including at Israel's Ben Gurion International Airport (pictured above).


International Package operations include delivery to more than 220 countries and territories worldwide,[6] including shipments wholly outside the United States, as well as shipments with either origin or distribution outside the United States.
Supply Chain & Freight[edit]
Supply Chain & Freight (UPS-SCS for UPS Supply Chain Solutions) includes UPS' forwarding and contract logistics operations, UPS Freight, and other related business units. UPS' forwarding and logistics business provides services in more than 175 countries and territories worldwide, and includes worldwide supply chain design, execution and management, freight forwarding and distribution, customs brokerage, mail and consulting services. UPS Freight offers a variety of less than truckload ("LTL") and truckload ("TL") services to customers in North America.
Other business units within this segment include The UPS Store and UPS Capital.[29]

Personnel structure[edit]
UPS employs approximately 444,000 staff: 362,000 in the U.S. and 82,000 internationally.[31] Approximately 240,000 UPS drivers, package handlers and clerks are represented by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. During the 1997 United Parcel Service strike, the company's only nationwide strike in its history, which lasted 16 days, Teamster President Ron Carey negotiated a new contract for workers.[32]

Competitors[edit]
Major competitors in the United States include United States Postal Service (USPS) and FedEx, as well as regional US carriers such as OnTrac, Eastern Connection, and LSO, formerly known as Lonestar Overnight. In addition to these domestic carriers, UPS competes with a variety of international operators, including Canada Post (and its subsidiary Purolator), TransForce, Deutsche Post (and its subsidiary DHL), Royal Mail, Japan Post, India Post and many other regional carriers, national postal services and air cargo handlers (see Package delivery and Mail pages).
Historically, the bulk of UPS' competition came from inexpensive ground-based delivery services, such as Parcel Post (USPS) or Choice Logistics. But in 1998 FedEx expanded into the ground parcel delivery market by acquiring RPS (originally Roadway Package System) and rebranding it as FedEx Ground in 2000. In 2003 DHL expanded its US operations by acquiring Airborne Express, significantly increasing its presence in the United States, and adding more competition in the ground delivery market. In response to this, UPS partnered with the US Postal Service to offer UPS Mail Innovations,[34] a program that allows UPS to pick up mail & packages separately from the main Ground network and transfer them to a USPS center, or destination delivery unit (DDU),[35] for final distribution. This process is also known as zone skipping,[36] long used by Parcel Consolidators.[37] UPS also has a separate product called "SurePost" which uses the UPS Ground network to deliver packages to the nearest UPS Package Center, which transfers them to the USPS DDU for "final mile" delivery.[38]
More recently, the continued growth of online shopping, combined with increasing awareness of the role transportation (including package delivery) has on the environment, has contributed to the rise of emerging competition from niche carriers or rebranded incumbents. For instance, the US Postal Service claims "greener delivery" of parcels on the assumption that USPS letter carriers deliver to each US address, six days a week anyway, and therefore offer the industry's lowest fuel consumption per delivery. Other carriers, like ParcelPool.com,[39] which specializes in residential package delivery to APO/FPO addresses, Hawaii, Alaska, Puerto Rico, and other US Territories, arose in response to increased demand from catalog retailers and online e-tailers for low-cost residential delivery services closely matching service standards normally associated with more expensive expedited parcel delivery.
Transportation[edit]
Delivery vans[edit]

UPS refers to its delivery van as a "package car". The company utilizes several designs and sizes of package cars, dependent on routes and package volume. The rounded-nose design of fiberglass hood of the UPS package car was patented by the company in 1965.[40] Morgan Olson (Grumman Olson), Union City Body, and Utilimaster manufacture the bodies for UPS delivery vans; older vehicles are based on Ford or General Motors P-chassis, while package cars introduced since the 1990s are based on Freightliner, Navistar, or Workhorse chassis. Originally, UPS delivery vehicles were equipped with manual transmissions and steering, although many newer vehicles are updated with automatic transmissions. In a 2010s redesign of the hood, the rounded-nose design has been phased out; its sealed-beam headlights have been replaced with automotive-sourced composite headlight units faired into the hood.
Along with its large delivery vans, for smaller routes, the company utilizes brown-painted delivery vehicles based on off-the-shelf production vehicles, including minivans (including the Ford Transit Connect and Dodge Grand Caravan) and Mercedes-Benz (Dodge/Freightliner) Sprinter box vans. UPS has ordered Modec electric vans for its UK and German fleets. Energy costs play a huge part in the potential profitability of package delivery companies like DHL and FedEx.[41]
When UPS ground vehicles reach the end of their useful service life and are no longer roadworthy (typically 20–25 years or more, but generally when the body's structural integrity is compromised), they are almost always stripped of reusable parts, repainted in household paint to cover up the trademark, and then sent to the scrapyard to be crushed and broken up. The only exception to this policy is when a package car is repainted white for internal use, usually at a large hub. Prior to scrapping, UPS trucks and trailers are assigned an ADA (Automotive Destruction Authorization) number and must be crushed under supervision of UPS Automotive personnel, which records the vehicle's destruction, as UPS does not re-sell any of its ground vehicles.

The UPS package car (delivery van) is a major symbol of the U.S. business world, with its iconic status referenced in an early 2000s ad campaign following UPS' sponsorship of Dale Jarrett in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series: the ads were about how the company would prefer to race the truck over a stock car despite the futility of doing so, as "people love the truck".
Tractor-trailers[edit]




UPS DAF LF cabover straight truck in Plymouth, United Kingdom


UPS commonly refers to its ground package tractor-trailers as "feeders"; these vehicles are separate from the UPS Freight fleet. In line with its delivery vehicles, nearly all UPS tractor units are painted in a Pullman brown livery. As part of a company policy to avoid manufacturer advertising, all UPS semitractors have all manufacturer emblems and badging removed wherever possible.
Prior to the 1990s, many tractors were of cabover configuration; as trailer-length laws were revised in the United States, the company transitioned towards the use of conventional-style semitractor. As of 2017, nearly the entire tractor fleet consists of conventionals.
In North America, vehicles of the UPS semitractor fleet are manufactured by Mack Trucks (the Pinnacle and Vision) and Navistar (International ProStar+ and 9900i) along with PACCAR vehicles (Kenworth T800, T660 and T680). Older vehicles in the fleet include Ford/Sterling tractors (Aeromax/A-Line), Freightliner (Argosy, the final caboveritruck used by UPS); Mack CH and International 8100 tractors are in the process of being phased out.
Previous trucks used by UPS include the Ford L9000, Ford Aeromax, International 8100/8200, International 9670, GMC Astro, Peterbilt 362, Ford L9000, Ford Aeromax, WhiteGMC High Cabover/Road Commander II, Mack CH, Mack MH UltraLiner, Mack F, and Diamond T/Diamond Reo cabovers. At one time[when?], UPS used electric-powered trucks (made by White Motors) for deliveries in Manhattan, NYC. There were only a few hundred of them, but they were notable for their "spooky silence" when running[citation needed].
Painted a light gray, company-owned semitrailers are distinguished by a large UPS emblem on the forward portion of the trailer sides; newer trailers are distinguished by the fitment of trailer skirts. Designed in several configurations, UPS uses several lengths of trailers (28, 45, 48, and 53 feet). Along with standard flat-bottom van trailers, there are drop-frame trailers (largely being phased out of the fleet) and trailer-on-flatcar trailers (TOFC); the latter are trailers designed for transport on railroad cars.
Based on state and provincial regulations, many UPS short trailers are towed in tandem.

Bicycles[edit]
In 2008, UPS started hiring bicycle delivery personnel in Vancouver, Washington, and in several cities in Oregon (Portland, Salem, Corvallis, Eugene, and Medford).[42]
Trains[edit]
UPS contracts with several railroad companies in the United States to provide intermodal transport for its cargo.
Cargo airlines[edit]
Main article: UPS Airlines
UPS Airlines consists of 236 aircraft that serves over 200 countries and territories worldwide.[43][44] Based out of Louisville, Kentucky (home to Worldport), UPS Airlines operates several major hubs throughout the United States; the largest are in Philadelphia and in Rockford, Illinois (Chicago).
Outside of North America, a hub in Cologne, Germany services Europe, while in Asia, UPS Airlines operates a facility in Hong Kong and two hubs in mainland China.
Company brand[edit]
Brown[edit]
The brown color that UPS uses on its vehicles and uniforms is called Pullman Brown. Company founder James E. Casey originally wanted company vehicles to use a yellow paint scheme, but one of his partners, Charlie Soderstrom, stated that a yellow vehicle would be hard to keep clean and that Pullman railroad cars were brown for just that reason.[7]
During the 2000s, the company used the familiarity of its color scheme in an advertising slogan: "What can Brown do for you?"[45]
Font[edit]
UPS commissioned brand consultancy FutureBrand to develop its own font, UPS Sans, for use in marketing and communication material. UPS Sans was created by slightly altering certain parts of FSI FontShop International's font FF Dax without permission. This has resulted in an agreement between FSI FontShop International and FutureBrand to avoid litigation.[46]
Environmental record[edit]
As of 2013, UPS has over 104,900 vehicles in operation worldwide including nearly 7,000 alternative-fuel vehicles.[1] In May 2008 UPS placed an order for 200 hybrid electric vehicles (adding to the 50 it had at that point) and 300 compressed natural gas (which are 20% more fuel efficient, and add to the 800 it already has) vehicles from Daimler Trucks North America.[47][48][49]
UPS received a "striding" rating of 80 points out of 100 totals on the environmental scorecard by the Climate Counts Group for its efforts to lessen the company's impact on the environment.[50] UPS has also been awarded the Clean Air Excellence Award by the United States Environmental Protection Agency because of the alternative fuel program it has developed.[51]
In October 2009, UPS became the first small-package carrier to offer customers the chance to buy carbon offsets to neutralize the greenhouse gas emissions generated by the transport of their packages. Although initially only available on ups.com and to high-volume shippers, they are now widely available through UPS shipping systems and UPS Ready third-party shipping systems.[52][53]
Controversy[edit]
On May 26, 2017, A federal judge ordered United Parcel Service to pay nearly $247 million in damages and penalties for illegally shipping large amounts of untaxed cigarettes in New York.[54]

History[edit]
Foundation[edit]




Merchants Parcel Delivery delivery vehicles in 1916


On August 28, 1907, James Casey founded the American Messenger Company with Claude Ryan[7] in Seattle, Washington,[8] capitalized with $100 in debt.[9] Most deliveries at this time were made on foot and bicycles were used for longer trips.
The American Messenger Company focused primarily on package delivery to retail stores with special delivery mail delivered for its largest client the United States Postal Service. In 1913 the company acquired a Model T Ford as its first delivery vehicle. Casey and Ryan merged with a competitor, Evert McCabe, and formed Merchants Parcel Delivery. Consolidated delivery was also introduced, combining packages addressed to a certain neighborhood onto one delivery vehicle.[9] In 1916 Charlie Soderstrom joined Merchants Parcel Delivery bringing in more vehicles for the growing delivery business. In 1919 the company expanded for the first time outside of Seattle to Oakland, California and changed its name to United Parcel Service. The name change to United Parcel Service was to remind the company expansion that operations were still United under the same organisation and Parcel identified the type of business offered as part of its Service. Common carrier service was acquired in 1922 from a company in Los Angeles, California. UPS became one of the only companies in the United States to offer common carrier service. At first common carrier was only limited to a small area around Los Angeles but by 1927 expanded to areas up to 125 miles outside the city. In 1924 a conveyor belt system was debuted for the handling of packages for UPS operations.[10]
In 1930, a consolidated service began in New York City, and soon after in other major cities in the East and the Midwest.[11] The use of common carrier for delivery between all customers placed UPS in direct competition with the United States Postal Service and the Interstate Commerce Commission. The common carrier service was applied in cities where UPS could use the service without the authority of the ICC and state commerce commissions. The first city for UPS to use common carrier status outside of California was Chicago, Illinois in 1953.[12]

Air service through UPS was first used in 1929 through private airlines. However, The Great Depression and a lack of volume ended the air service. In 1953 UPS resumed air service called UPS Blue Label Air with two-day service to major cities along the East Coast and West Coast.[13]
Expansion and diversification[edit]
In 1975, UPS moved its headquarters to Greenwich, Connecticut and began servicing all of the 48 contiguous states of the United States. The expanded operations to all 48 states made UPS the first package delivery company to serve every address in the Continental United States. UPS went international in 1975 establishing operations in Canada and in 1976 operations were established in Germany. On February 28, UPS Ltd. (later changed to UPS Canada Ltd.) began operations in Toronto, Ontario. UPS Canada's head office is located in Burlington, Ontario. In 1976, UPS established a domestic operation in West Germany.[14]
UPS Next Day Air Service was launched in 1985 for all 48 states plus Puerto Rico. In 1988, UPS Airlines was launched with authorization from the Federal Aviation Administration. UPS Airlines became the fastest-growing airline in FAA history and today is the 10th largest airlines in the United States.[15] Domestic air service was added to Germany in 1989.[16] In 1991, UPS moved its headquarters to Sandy Springs, Georgia, a suburb of Atlanta. In 1992, UPS acquired both Haulfast and Carryfast and rebranded them UPS Supply Chain Solutions. Haulfast provided the pallet haulage and trucking network for the CarryFast group of companies. By 1993 UPS was delivering up to 11.5 million packages and documents per day.
The large volume of UPS customers in the 1990s made UPS develop new technology for better efficiency. A handheld device called Delivery Information Acquisition Device (DIAD) was created to record and upload delivery information to the UPS network immediately upon pickup by every UPS driver. In 1992, UPS began tracking all ground shipments electronically. In 1994, UPS.com debuted, and provided the perfect interface to make what was primarily internal operational information available for customer access. In 1995, UPS acquired SonicAir to offer service parts logistics and compete with Choice Logistics. In the same year UPS launched UPS Logistics Group to facilitate global supply chain management solutions and consulting for customer needs. In 1997, a walkout by the 185,000 members of the Teamsters shut down UPS for 16 days.[17] In 1998, UPS Capital was established to enable companies to grow their business through a comprehensive menu of integrated financial services through UPS.[18] UPS acquired Challenge Air in 1999 to expand its operations in Latin America.[19]




Mail Boxes Etc., Inc. was re-branded as The UPS Store in 2001.


On November 10, 1999, UPS became a public company.[20]
21st century[edit]
In 2001, UPS acquired. Mail Boxes Etc., Inc.[21] In 2003 approximately 3,000 Mail Boxes Etc., Inc. were rebranded as The UPS Store.
In 2004, UPS entered the heavy freight business with purchase of Menlo Worldwide Forwarding, a former subsidiary of Menlo Worldwide. UPS rebranded it as UPS Supply Chain Solutions. The purchase price was US$150 million and the assumption of US$110 million in long-term debt. On August 5, 2005, UPS announced that it has completed its acquisition of less-than-truckload (LTL) trucking company Overnite Transportation for US$1.25 billion.[22] This was approved by the FTC and Overnite shareholders on August 4, 2005. In 2005 UPS offered non-stop delivery service between Guangzhou and the United States.[23] On April 28, 2006, Overnite officially became UPS Freight. On October 3, 2005, UPS completed the purchase of LYNX Express Ltd, one of the largest independent parcel carriers in the United Kingdom, for £55.5 million (US$97.1 million) after receiving approval for the transaction from the European Commission. The first joint package car center operation, in Dartford, Kent, is opened in 2006.
On August 28, 2007, United Parcel Service celebrated its 100th anniversary.[24] All Nippon Airways, a Star Alliance member, and UPS formed a cargo alliance and code-share to transport member cargo in 2008, similarly to an airline alliance.[25] On March 19, 2012, UPS announced that it intended to acquire TNT Express for $6.8 billion, in a move to help expand its presence in European and Asian markets.[26] However, the deal fell through in January 2013 after it was announced that UPS had failed to obtain permission from the European Commission and as such had been blocked on competition grounds.[27] In February 2012 UPS acquired Brussels-based company Kiala that provides e-commerce retailers the option to have goods delivered to a convention retail location.[28]
Operations[edit]
UPS's primary business is the time-definite delivery of packages and documents worldwide. In recent years, UPS has extended its service portfolio to include less than truckload (LTL) transportation (primarily in the U.S.) and supply chain services. UPS reports its operations in three segments: U.S. Domestic Package operations, International Package operations, and Supply Chain & Freight operations.
U.S. Domestic Package[edit]
U.S. Domestic Package operations include the time-definite delivery of letters, documents, and packages throughout the United States.

International Package[edit]




UPS has service worldwide, including at Israel's Ben Gurion International Airport (pictured above).


International Package operations include delivery to more than 220 countries and territories worldwide,[6] including shipments wholly outside the United States, as well as shipments with either origin or distribution outside the United States.
Supply Chain & Freight[edit]
Supply Chain & Freight (UPS-SCS for UPS Supply Chain Solutions) includes UPS' forwarding and contract logistics operations, UPS Freight, and other related business units. UPS' forwarding and logistics business provides services in more than 175 countries and territories worldwide, and includes worldwide supply chain design, execution and management, freight forwarding and distribution, customs brokerage, mail and consulting services. UPS Freight offers a variety of less than truckload ("LTL") and truckload ("TL") services to customers in North America.
Other business units within this segment include The UPS Store and UPS Capital.[29]

Personnel structure[edit]
UPS employs approximately 444,000 staff: 362,000 in the U.S. and 82,000 internationally.[31] Approximately 240,000 UPS drivers, package handlers and clerks are represented by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. During the 1997 United Parcel Service strike, the company's only nationwide strike in its history, which lasted 16 days, Teamster President Ron Carey negotiated a new contract for workers.[32]

Competitors[edit]
Major competitors in the United States include United States Postal Service (USPS) and FedEx, as well as regional US carriers such as OnTrac, Eastern Connection, and LSO, formerly known as Lonestar Overnight. In addition to these domestic carriers, UPS competes with a variety of international operators, including Canada Post (and its subsidiary Purolator), TransForce, Deutsche Post (and its subsidiary DHL), Royal Mail, Japan Post, India Post and many other regional carriers, national postal services and air cargo handlers (see Package delivery and Mail pages).
Historically, the bulk of UPS' competition came from inexpensive ground-based delivery services, such as Parcel Post (USPS) or Choice Logistics. But in 1998 FedEx expanded into the ground parcel delivery market by acquiring RPS (originally Roadway Package System) and rebranding it as FedEx Ground in 2000. In 2003 DHL expanded its US operations by acquiring Airborne Express, significantly increasing its presence in the United States, and adding more competition in the ground delivery market. In response to this, UPS partnered with the US Postal Service to offer UPS Mail Innovations,[34] a program that allows UPS to pick up mail & packages separately from the main Ground network and transfer them to a USPS center, or destination delivery unit (DDU),[35] for final distribution. This process is also known as zone skipping,[36] long used by Parcel Consolidators.[37] UPS also has a separate product called "SurePost" which uses the UPS Ground network to deliver packages to the nearest UPS Package Center, which transfers them to the USPS DDU for "final mile" delivery.[38]
More recently, the continued growth of online shopping, combined with increasing awareness of the role transportation (including package delivery) has on the environment, has contributed to the rise of emerging competition from niche carriers or rebranded incumbents. For instance, the US Postal Service claims "greener delivery" of parcels on the assumption that USPS letter carriers deliver to each US address, six days a week anyway, and therefore offer the industry's lowest fuel consumption per delivery. Other carriers, like ParcelPool.com,[39] which specializes in residential package delivery to APO/FPO addresses, Hawaii, Alaska, Puerto Rico, and other US Territories, arose in response to increased demand from catalog retailers and online e-tailers for low-cost residential delivery services closely matching service standards normally associated with more expensive expedited parcel delivery.
Transportation[edit]
Delivery vans[edit]

UPS refers to its delivery van as a "package car". The company utilizes several designs and sizes of package cars, dependent on routes and package volume. The rounded-nose design of fiberglass hood of the UPS package car was patented by the company in 1965.[40] Morgan Olson (Grumman Olson), Union City Body, and Utilimaster manufacture the bodies for UPS delivery vans; older vehicles are based on Ford or General Motors P-chassis, while package cars introduced since the 1990s are based on Freightliner, Navistar, or Workhorse chassis. Originally, UPS delivery vehicles were equipped with manual transmissions and steering, although many newer vehicles are updated with automatic transmissions. In a 2010s redesign of the hood, the rounded-nose design has been phased out; its sealed-beam headlights have been replaced with automotive-sourced composite headlight units faired into the hood.
Along with its large delivery vans, for smaller routes, the company utilizes brown-painted delivery vehicles based on off-the-shelf production vehicles, including minivans (including the Ford Transit Connect and Dodge Grand Caravan) and Mercedes-Benz (Dodge/Freightliner) Sprinter box vans. UPS has ordered Modec electric vans for its UK and German fleets. Energy costs play a huge part in the potential profitability of package delivery companies like DHL and FedEx.[41]
When UPS ground vehicles reach the end of their useful service life and are no longer roadworthy (typically 20–25 years or more, but generally when the body's structural integrity is compromised), they are almost always stripped of reusable parts, repainted in household paint to cover up the trademark, and then sent to the scrapyard to be crushed and broken up. The only exception to this policy is when a package car is repainted white for internal use, usually at a large hub. Prior to scrapping, UPS trucks and trailers are assigned an ADA (Automotive Destruction Authorization) number and must be crushed under supervision of UPS Automotive personnel, which records the vehicle's destruction, as UPS does not re-sell any of its ground vehicles.

The UPS package car (delivery van) is a major symbol of the U.S. business world, with its iconic status referenced in an early 2000s ad campaign following UPS' sponsorship of Dale Jarrett in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series: the ads were about how the company would prefer to race the truck over a stock car despite the futility of doing so, as "people love the truck".
Tractor-trailers[edit]




UPS DAF LF cabover straight truck in Plymouth, United Kingdom


UPS commonly refers to its ground package tractor-trailers as "feeders"; these vehicles are separate from the UPS Freight fleet. In line with its delivery vehicles, nearly all UPS tractor units are painted in a Pullman brown livery. As part of a company policy to avoid manufacturer advertising, all UPS semitractors have all manufacturer emblems and badging removed wherever possible.
Prior to the 1990s, many tractors were of cabover configuration; as trailer-length laws were revised in the United States, the company transitioned towards the use of conventional-style semitractor. As of 2017, nearly the entire tractor fleet consists of conventionals.
In North America, vehicles of the UPS semitractor fleet are manufactured by Mack Trucks (the Pinnacle and Vision) and Navistar (International ProStar+ and 9900i) along with PACCAR vehicles (Kenworth T800, T660 and T680). Older vehicles in the fleet include Ford/Sterling tractors (Aeromax/A-Line), Freightliner (Argosy, the final caboveritruck used by UPS); Mack CH and International 8100 tractors are in the process of being phased out.
Previous trucks used by UPS include the Ford L9000, Ford Aeromax, International 8100/8200, International 9670, GMC Astro, Peterbilt 362, Ford L9000, Ford Aeromax, WhiteGMC High Cabover/Road Commander II, Mack CH, Mack MH UltraLiner, Mack F, and Diamond T/Diamond Reo cabovers. At one time[when?], UPS used electric-powered trucks (made by White Motors) for deliveries in Manhattan, NYC. There were only a few hundred of them, but they were notable for their "spooky silence" when running[citation needed].
Painted a light gray, company-owned semitrailers are distinguished by a large UPS emblem on the forward portion of the trailer sides; newer trailers are distinguished by the fitment of trailer skirts. Designed in several configurations, UPS uses several lengths of trailers (28, 45, 48, and 53 feet). Along with standard flat-bottom van trailers, there are drop-frame trailers (largely being phased out of the fleet) and trailer-on-flatcar trailers (TOFC); the latter are trailers designed for transport on railroad cars.
Based on state and provincial regulations, many UPS short trailers are towed in tandem.

Bicycles[edit]
In 2008, UPS started hiring bicycle delivery personnel in Vancouver, Washington, and in several cities in Oregon (Portland, Salem, Corvallis, Eugene, and Medford).[42]
Trains[edit]
UPS contracts with several railroad companies in the United States to provide intermodal transport for its cargo.
Cargo airlines[edit]
Main article: UPS Airlines
UPS Airlines consists of 236 aircraft that serves over 200 countries and territories worldwide.[43][44] Based out of Louisville, Kentucky (home to Worldport), UPS Airlines operates several major hubs throughout the United States; the largest are in Philadelphia and in Rockford, Illinois (Chicago).
Outside of North America, a hub in Cologne, Germany services Europe, while in Asia, UPS Airlines operates a facility in Hong Kong and two hubs in mainland China.
Company brand[edit]
Brown[edit]
The brown color that UPS uses on its vehicles and uniforms is called Pullman Brown. Company founder James E. Casey originally wanted company vehicles to use a yellow paint scheme, but one of his partners, Charlie Soderstrom, stated that a yellow vehicle would be hard to keep clean and that Pullman railroad cars were brown for just that reason.[7]
During the 2000s, the company used the familiarity of its color scheme in an advertising slogan: "What can Brown do for you?"[45]
Font[edit]
UPS commissioned brand consultancy FutureBrand to develop its own font, UPS Sans, for use in marketing and communication material. UPS Sans was created by slightly altering certain parts of FSI FontShop International's font FF Dax without permission. This has resulted in an agreement between FSI FontShop International and FutureBrand to avoid litigation.[46]
Environmental record[edit]
As of 2013, UPS has over 104,900 vehicles in operation worldwide including nearly 7,000 alternative-fuel vehicles.[1] In May 2008 UPS placed an order for 200 hybrid electric vehicles (adding to the 50 it had at that point) and 300 compressed natural gas (which are 20% more fuel efficient, and add to the 800 it already has) vehicles from Daimler Trucks North America.[47][48][49]
UPS received a "striding" rating of 80 points out of 100 totals on the environmental scorecard by the Climate Counts Group for its efforts to lessen the company's impact on the environment.[50] UPS has also been awarded the Clean Air Excellence Award by the United States Environmental Protection Agency because of the alternative fuel program it has developed.[51]
In October 2009, UPS became the first small-package carrier to offer customers the chance to buy carbon offsets to neutralize the greenhouse gas emissions generated by the transport of their packages. Although initially only available on ups.com and to high-volume shippers, they are now widely available through UPS shipping systems and UPS Ready third-party shipping systems.[52][53]
Controversy[edit]
On May 26, 2017, A federal judge ordered United Parcel Service to pay nearly $247 million in damages and penalties for illegally shipping large amounts of untaxed cigarettes in New York.[54]

History[edit]
Foundation[edit]




Merchants Parcel Delivery delivery vehicles in 1916


On August 28, 1907, James Casey founded the American Messenger Company with Claude Ryan[7] in Seattle, Washington,[8] capitalized with $100 in debt.[9] Most deliveries at this time were made on foot and bicycles were used for longer trips.
The American Messenger Company focused primarily on package delivery to retail stores with special delivery mail delivered for its largest client the United States Postal Service. In 1913 the company acquired a Model T Ford as its first delivery vehicle. Casey and Ryan merged with a competitor, Evert McCabe, and formed Merchants Parcel Delivery. Consolidated delivery was also introduced, combining packages addressed to a certain neighborhood onto one delivery vehicle.[9] In 1916 Charlie Soderstrom joined Merchants Parcel Delivery bringing in more vehicles for the growing delivery business. In 1919 the company expanded for the first time outside of Seattle to Oakland, California and changed its name to United Parcel Service. The name change to United Parcel Service was to remind the company expansion that operations were still United under the same organisation and Parcel identified the type of business offered as part of its Service. Common carrier service was acquired in 1922 from a company in Los Angeles, California. UPS became one of the only companies in the United States to offer common carrier service. At first common carrier was only limited to a small area around Los Angeles but by 1927 expanded to areas up to 125 miles outside the city. In 1924 a conveyor belt system was debuted for the handling of packages for UPS operations.[10]
In 1930, a consolidated service began in New York City, and soon after in other major cities in the East and the Midwest.[11] The use of common carrier for delivery between all customers placed UPS in direct competition with the United States Postal Service and the Interstate Commerce Commission. The common carrier service was applied in cities where UPS could use the service without the authority of the ICC and state commerce commissions. The first city for UPS to use common carrier status outside of California was Chicago, Illinois in 1953.[12]

Air service through UPS was first used in 1929 through private airlines. However, The Great Depression and a lack of volume ended the air service. In 1953 UPS resumed air service called UPS Blue Label Air with two-day service to major cities along the East Coast and West Coast.[13]
Expansion and diversification[edit]
In 1975, UPS moved its headquarters to Greenwich, Connecticut and began servicing all of the 48 contiguous states of the United States. The expanded operations to all 48 states made UPS the first package delivery company to serve every address in the Continental United States. UPS went international in 1975 establishing operations in Canada and in 1976 operations were established in Germany. On February 28, UPS Ltd. (later changed to UPS Canada Ltd.) began operations in Toronto, Ontario. UPS Canada's head office is located in Burlington, Ontario. In 1976, UPS established a domestic operation in West Germany.[14]
UPS Next Day Air Service was launched in 1985 for all 48 states plus Puerto Rico. In 1988, UPS Airlines was launched with authorization from the Federal Aviation Administration. UPS Airlines became the fastest-growing airline in FAA history and today is the 10th largest airlines in the United States.[15] Domestic air service was added to Germany in 1989.[16] In 1991, UPS moved its headquarters to Sandy Springs, Georgia, a suburb of Atlanta. In 1992, UPS acquired both Haulfast and Carryfast and rebranded them UPS Supply Chain Solutions. Haulfast provided the pallet haulage and trucking network for the CarryFast group of companies. By 1993 UPS was delivering up to 11.5 million packages and documents per day.
The large volume of UPS customers in the 1990s made UPS develop new technology for better efficiency. A handheld device called Delivery Information Acquisition Device (DIAD) was created to record and upload delivery information to the UPS network immediately upon pickup by every UPS driver. In 1992, UPS began tracking all ground shipments electronically. In 1994, UPS.com debuted, and provided the perfect interface to make what was primarily internal operational information available for customer access. In 1995, UPS acquired SonicAir to offer service parts logistics and compete with Choice Logistics. In the same year UPS launched UPS Logistics Group to facilitate global supply chain management solutions and consulting for customer needs. In 1997, a walkout by the 185,000 members of the Teamsters shut down UPS for 16 days.[17] In 1998, UPS Capital was established to enable companies to grow their business through a comprehensive menu of integrated financial services through UPS.[18] UPS acquired Challenge Air in 1999 to expand its operations in Latin America.[19]




Mail Boxes Etc., Inc. was re-branded as The UPS Store in 2001.


On November 10, 1999, UPS became a public company.[20]
21st century[edit]
In 2001, UPS acquired. Mail Boxes Etc., Inc.[21] In 2003 approximately 3,000 Mail Boxes Etc., Inc. were rebranded as The UPS Store.
In 2004, UPS entered the heavy freight business with purchase of Menlo Worldwide Forwarding, a former subsidiary of Menlo Worldwide. UPS rebranded it as UPS Supply Chain Solutions. The purchase price was US$150 million and the assumption of US$110 million in long-term debt. On August 5, 2005, UPS announced that it has completed its acquisition of less-than-truckload (LTL) trucking company Overnite Transportation for US$1.25 billion.[22] This was approved by the FTC and Overnite shareholders on August 4, 2005. In 2005 UPS offered non-stop delivery service between Guangzhou and the United States.[23] On April 28, 2006, Overnite officially became UPS Freight. On October 3, 2005, UPS completed the purchase of LYNX Express Ltd, one of the largest independent parcel carriers in the United Kingdom, for £55.5 million (US$97.1 million) after receiving approval for the transaction from the European Commission. The first joint package car center operation, in Dartford, Kent, is opened in 2006.
On August 28, 2007, United Parcel Service celebrated its 100th anniversary.[24] All Nippon Airways, a Star Alliance member, and UPS formed a cargo alliance and code-share to transport member cargo in 2008, similarly to an airline alliance.[25] On March 19, 2012, UPS announced that it intended to acquire TNT Express for $6.8 billion, in a move to help expand its presence in European and Asian markets.[26] However, the deal fell through in January 2013 after it was announced that UPS had failed to obtain permission from the European Commission and as such had been blocked on competition grounds.[27] In February 2012 UPS acquired Brussels-based company Kiala that provides e-commerce retailers the option to have goods delivered to a convention retail location.[28]
Operations[edit]
UPS's primary business is the time-definite delivery of packages and documents worldwide. In recent years, UPS has extended its service portfolio to include less than truckload (LTL) transportation (primarily in the U.S.) and supply chain services. UPS reports its operations in three segments: U.S. Domestic Package operations, International Package operations, and Supply Chain & Freight operations.
U.S. Domestic Package[edit]
U.S. Domestic Package operations include the time-definite delivery of letters, documents, and packages throughout the United States.

International Package[edit]




UPS has service worldwide, including at Israel's Ben Gurion International Airport (pictured above).


International Package operations include delivery to more than 220 countries and territories worldwide,[6] including shipments wholly outside the United States, as well as shipments with either origin or distribution outside the United States.
Supply Chain & Freight[edit]
Supply Chain & Freight (UPS-SCS for UPS Supply Chain Solutions) includes UPS' forwarding and contract logistics operations, UPS Freight, and other related business units. UPS' forwarding and logistics business provides services in more than 175 countries and territories worldwide, and includes worldwide supply chain design, execution and management, freight forwarding and distribution, customs brokerage, mail and consulting services. UPS Freight offers a variety of less than truckload ("LTL") and truckload ("TL") services to customers in North America.
Other business units within this segment include The UPS Store and UPS Capital.[29]

Personnel structure[edit]
UPS employs approximately 444,000 staff: 362,000 in the U.S. and 82,000 internationally.[31] Approximately 240,000 UPS drivers, package handlers and clerks are represented by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. During the 1997 United Parcel Service strike, the company's only nationwide strike in its history, which lasted 16 days, Teamster President Ron Carey negotiated a new contract for workers.[32]

Competitors[edit]
Major competitors in the United States include United States Postal Service (USPS) and FedEx, as well as regional US carriers such as OnTrac, Eastern Connection, and LSO, formerly known as Lonestar Overnight. In addition to these domestic carriers, UPS competes with a variety of international operators, including Canada Post (and its subsidiary Purolator), TransForce, Deutsche Post (and its subsidiary DHL), Royal Mail, Japan Post, India Post and many other regional carriers, national postal services and air cargo handlers (see Package delivery and Mail pages).
Historically, the bulk of UPS' competition came from inexpensive ground-based delivery services, such as Parcel Post (USPS) or Choice Logistics. But in 1998 FedEx expanded into the ground parcel delivery market by acquiring RPS (originally Roadway Package System) and rebranding it as FedEx Ground in 2000. In 2003 DHL expanded its US operations by acquiring Airborne Express, significantly increasing its presence in the United States, and adding more competition in the ground delivery market. In response to this, UPS partnered with the US Postal Service to offer UPS Mail Innovations,[34] a program that allows UPS to pick up mail & packages separately from the main Ground network and transfer them to a USPS center, or destination delivery unit (DDU),[35] for final distribution. This process is also known as zone skipping,[36] long used by Parcel Consolidators.[37] UPS also has a separate product called "SurePost" which uses the UPS Ground network to deliver packages to the nearest UPS Package Center, which transfers them to the USPS DDU for "final mile" delivery.[38]
More recently, the continued growth of online shopping, combined with increasing awareness of the role transportation (including package delivery) has on the environment, has contributed to the rise of emerging competition from niche carriers or rebranded incumbents. For instance, the US Postal Service claims "greener delivery" of parcels on the assumption that USPS letter carriers deliver to each US address, six days a week anyway, and therefore offer the industry's lowest fuel consumption per delivery. Other carriers, like ParcelPool.com,[39] which specializes in residential package delivery to APO/FPO addresses, Hawaii, Alaska, Puerto Rico, and other US Territories, arose in response to increased demand from catalog retailers and online e-tailers for low-cost residential delivery services closely matching service standards normally associated with more expensive expedited parcel delivery.
Transportation[edit]
Delivery vans[edit]

UPS refers to its delivery van as a "package car". The company utilizes several designs and sizes of package cars, dependent on routes and package volume. The rounded-nose design of fiberglass hood of the UPS package car was patented by the company in 1965.[40] Morgan Olson (Grumman Olson), Union City Body, and Utilimaster manufacture the bodies for UPS delivery vans; older vehicles are based on Ford or General Motors P-chassis, while package cars introduced since the 1990s are based on Freightliner, Navistar, or Workhorse chassis. Originally, UPS delivery vehicles were equipped with manual transmissions and steering, although many newer vehicles are updated with automatic transmissions. In a 2010s redesign of the hood, the rounded-nose design has been phased out; its sealed-beam headlights have been replaced with automotive-sourced composite headlight units faired into the hood.
Along with its large delivery vans, for smaller routes, the company utilizes brown-painted delivery vehicles based on off-the-shelf production vehicles, including minivans (including the Ford Transit Connect and Dodge Grand Caravan) and Mercedes-Benz (Dodge/Freightliner) Sprinter box vans. UPS has ordered Modec electric vans for its UK and German fleets. Energy costs play a huge part in the potential profitability of package delivery companies like DHL and FedEx.[41]
When UPS ground vehicles reach the end of their useful service life and are no longer roadworthy (typically 20–25 years or more, but generally when the body's structural integrity is compromised), they are almost always stripped of reusable parts, repainted in household paint to cover up the trademark, and then sent to the scrapyard to be crushed and broken up. The only exception to this policy is when a package car is repainted white for internal use, usually at a large hub. Prior to scrapping, UPS trucks and trailers are assigned an ADA (Automotive Destruction Authorization) number and must be crushed under supervision of UPS Automotive personnel, which records the vehicle's destruction, as UPS does not re-sell any of its ground vehicles.

The UPS package car (delivery van) is a major symbol of the U.S. business world, with its iconic status referenced in an early 2000s ad campaign following UPS' sponsorship of Dale Jarrett in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series: the ads were about how the company would prefer to race the truck over a stock car despite the futility of doing so, as "people love the truck".
Tractor-trailers[edit]

UPS commonly refers to its ground package tractor-trailers as "feeders"; these vehicles are separate from the UPS Freight fleet. In line with its delivery vehicles, nearly all UPS tractor units are painted in a Pullman brown livery. As part of a company policy to avoid manufacturer advertising, all UPS semitractors have all manufacturer emblems and badging removed wherever possible.
Prior to the 1990s, many tractors were of cabover configuration; as trailer-length laws were revised in the United States, the company transitioned towards the use of conventional-style semitractor. As of 2017, nearly the entire tractor fleet consists of conventionals.
In North America, vehicles of the UPS semitractor fleet are manufactured by Mack Trucks (the Pinnacle and Vision) and Navistar (International ProStar+ and 9900i) along with PACCAR vehicles (Kenworth T800, T660 and T680). Older vehicles in the fleet include Ford/Sterling tractors (Aeromax/A-Line), Freightliner (Argosy, the final caboveritruck used by UPS); Mack CH and International 8100 tractors are in the process of being phased out.
Previous trucks used by UPS include the Ford L9000, Ford Aeromax, International 8100/8200, International 9670, GMC Astro, Peterbilt 362, Ford L9000, Ford Aeromax, WhiteGMC High Cabover/Road Commander II, Mack CH, Mack MH UltraLiner, Mack F, and Diamond T/Diamond Reo cabovers. At one time[when?], UPS used electric-powered trucks (made by White Motors) for deliveries in Manhattan, NYC. There were only a few hundred of them, but they were notable for their "spooky silence" when running[citation needed].
Painted a light gray, company-owned semitrailers are distinguished by a large UPS emblem on the forward portion of the trailer sides; newer trailers are distinguished by the fitment of trailer skirts. Designed in several configurations, UPS uses several lengths of trailers (28, 45, 48, and 53 feet). Along with standard flat-bottom van trailers, there are drop-frame trailers (largely being phased out of the fleet) and trailer-on-flatcar trailers (TOFC); the latter are trailers designed for transport on railroad cars.
Based on state and provincial regulations, many UPS short trailers are towed in tandem.

Bicycles[edit]
In 2008, UPS started hiring bicycle delivery personnel in Vancouver, Washington, and in several cities in Oregon (Portland, Salem, Corvallis, Eugene, and Medford).[42]
Trains[edit]
UPS contracts with several railroad companies in the United States to provide intermodal transport for its cargo.
Cargo airlines[edit]
Main article: UPS Airlines
UPS Airlines consists of 236 aircraft that serves over 200 countries and territories worldwide.[43][44] Based out of Louisville, Kentucky (home to Worldport), UPS Airlines operates several major hubs throughout the United States; the largest are in Philadelphia and in Rockford, Illinois (Chicago).
Outside of North America, a hub in Cologne, Germany services Europe, while in Asia, UPS Airlines operates a facility in Hong Kong and two hubs in mainland China.
Company brand[edit]
Brown[edit]
The brown color that UPS uses on its vehicles and uniforms is called Pullman Brown. Company founder James E. Casey originally wanted company vehicles to use a yellow paint scheme, but one of his partners, Charlie Soderstrom, stated that a yellow vehicle would be hard to keep clean and that Pullman railroad cars were brown for just that reason.[7]
During the 2000s, the company used the familiarity of its color scheme in an advertising slogan: "What can Brown do for you?"[45]
Font[edit]
UPS commissioned brand consultancy FutureBrand to develop its own font, UPS Sans, for use in marketing and communication material. UPS Sans was created by slightly altering certain parts of FSI FontShop International's font FF Dax without permission. This has resulted in an agreement between FSI FontShop International and FutureBrand to avoid litigation.[46]
Environmental record[edit]
As of 2013, UPS has over 104,900 vehicles in operation worldwide including nearly 7,000 alternative-fuel vehicles.[1] In May 2008 UPS placed an order for 200 hybrid electric vehicles (adding to the 50 it had at that point) and 300 compressed natural gas (which are 20% more fuel efficient, and add to the 800 it already has) vehicles from Daimler Trucks North America.[47][48][49]
UPS received a "striding" rating of 80 points out of 100 totals on the environmental scorecard by the Climate Counts Group for its efforts to lessen the company's impact on the environment.[50] UPS has also been awarded the Clean Air Excellence Award by the United States Environmental Protection Agency because of the alternative fuel program it has developed.[51]
In October 2009, UPS became the first small-package carrier to offer customers the chance to buy carbon offsets to neutralize the greenhouse gas emissions generated by the transport of their packages. Although initially only available on ups.com and to high-volume shippers, they are now widely available through UPS shipping systems and UPS Ready third-party shipping systems.[52][53]
Controversy[edit]
On May 26, 2017, A federal judge ordered United Parcel Service to pay nearly $247 million in damages and penalties for illegally shipping large amounts of untaxed cigarettes in New York.[54]

History[edit]
Foundation[edit]




Merchants Parcel Delivery delivery vehicles in 1916


On August 28, 1907, James Casey founded the American Messenger Company with Claude Ryan[7] in Seattle, Washington,[8] capitalized with $100 in debt.[9] Most deliveries at this time were made on foot and bicycles were used for longer trips.
The American Messenger Company focused primarily on package delivery to retail stores with special delivery mail delivered for its largest client the United States Postal Service. In 1913 the company acquired a Model T Ford as its first delivery vehicle. Casey and Ryan merged with a competitor, Evert McCabe, and formed Merchants Parcel Delivery. Consolidated delivery was also introduced, combining packages addressed to a certain neighborhood onto one delivery vehicle.[9] In 1916 Charlie Soderstrom joined Merchants Parcel Delivery bringing in more vehicles for the growing delivery business. In 1919 the company expanded for the first time outside of Seattle to Oakland, California and changed its name to United Parcel Service. The name change to United Parcel Service was to remind the company expansion that operations were still United under the same organisation and Parcel identified the type of business offered as part of its Service. Common carrier service was acquired in 1922 from a company in Los Angeles, California. UPS became one of the only companies in the United States to offer common carrier service. At first common carrier was only limited to a small area around Los Angeles but by 1927 expanded to areas up to 125 miles outside the city. In 1924 a conveyor belt system was debuted for the handling of packages for UPS operations.[10]
In 1930, a consolidated service began in New York City, and soon after in other major cities in the East and the Midwest.[11] The use of common carrier for delivery between all customers placed UPS in direct competition with the United States Postal Service and the Interstate Commerce Commission. The common carrier service was applied in cities where UPS could use the service without the authority of the ICC and state commerce commissions. The first city for UPS to use common carrier status outside of California was Chicago, Illinois in 1953.[12]




Ford Model T UPS delivery vehicle in 1921


Air service through UPS was first used in 1929 through private airlines. However, The Great Depression and a lack of volume ended the air service. In 1953 UPS resumed air service called UPS Blue Label Air with two-day service to major cities along the East Coast and West Coast.[13]
Expansion and diversification[edit]
In 1975, UPS moved its headquarters to Greenwich, Connecticut and began servicing all of the 48 contiguous states of the United States. The expanded operations to all 48 states made UPS the first package delivery company to serve every address in the Continental United States. UPS went international in 1975 establishing operations in Canada and in 1976 operations were established in Germany. On February 28, UPS Ltd. (later changed to UPS Canada Ltd.) began operations in Toronto, Ontario. UPS Canada's head office is located in Burlington, Ontario. In 1976, UPS established a domestic operation in West Germany.[14]
UPS Next Day Air Service was launched in 1985 for all 48 states plus Puerto Rico. In 1988, UPS Airlines was launched with authorization from the Federal Aviation Administration. UPS Airlines became the fastest-growing airline in FAA history and today is the 10th largest airlines in the United States.[15] Domestic air service was added to Germany in 1989.[16] In 1991, UPS moved its headquarters to Sandy Springs, Georgia, a suburb of Atlanta. In 1992, UPS acquired both Haulfast and Carryfast and rebranded them UPS Supply Chain Solutions. Haulfast provided the pallet haulage and trucking network for the CarryFast group of companies. By 1993 UPS was delivering up to 11.5 million packages and documents per day.
The large volume of UPS customers in the 1990s made UPS develop new technology for better efficiency. A handheld device called Delivery Information Acquisition Device (DIAD) was created to record and upload delivery information to the UPS network immediately upon pickup by every UPS driver. In 1992, UPS began tracking all ground shipments electronically. In 1994, UPS.com debuted, and provided the perfect interface to make what was primarily internal operational information available for customer access. In 1995, UPS acquired SonicAir to offer service parts logistics and compete with Choice Logistics. In the same year UPS launched UPS Logistics Group to facilitate global supply chain management solutions and consulting for customer needs. In 1997, a walkout by the 185,000 members of the Teamsters shut down UPS for 16 days.[17] In 1998, UPS Capital was established to enable companies to grow their business through a comprehensive menu of integrated financial services through UPS.[18] UPS acquired Challenge Air in 1999 to expand its operations in Latin America.[19]




Mail Boxes Etc., Inc. was re-branded as The UPS Store in 2001.


On November 10, 1999, UPS became a public company.[20]
21st century[edit]
In 2001, UPS acquired. Mail Boxes Etc., Inc.[21] In 2003 approximately 3,000 Mail Boxes Etc., Inc. were rebranded as The UPS Store.
In 2004, UPS entered the heavy freight business with purchase of Menlo Worldwide Forwarding, a former subsidiary of Menlo Worldwide. UPS rebranded it as UPS Supply Chain Solutions. The purchase price was US$150 million and the assumption of US$110 million in long-term debt. On August 5, 2005, UPS announced that it has completed its acquisition of less-than-truckload (LTL) trucking company Overnite Transportation for US$1.25 billion.[22] This was approved by the FTC and Overnite shareholders on August 4, 2005. In 2005 UPS offered non-stop delivery service between Guangzhou and the United States.[23] On April 28, 2006, Overnite officially became UPS Freight. On October 3, 2005, UPS completed the purchase of LYNX Express Ltd, one of the largest independent parcel carriers in the United Kingdom, for £55.5 million (US$97.1 million) after receiving approval for the transaction from the European Commission. The first joint package car center operation, in Dartford, Kent, is opened in 2006.
On August 28, 2007, United Parcel Service celebrated its 100th anniversary.[24] All Nippon Airways, a Star Alliance member, and UPS formed a cargo alliance and code-share to transport member cargo in 2008, similarly to an airline alliance.[25] On March 19, 2012, UPS announced that it intended to acquire TNT Express for $6.8 billion, in a move to help expand its presence in European and Asian markets.[26] However, the deal fell through in January 2013 after it was announced that UPS had failed to obtain permission from the European Commission and as such had been blocked on competition grounds.[27] In February 2012 UPS acquired Brussels-based company Kiala that provides e-commerce retailers the option to have goods delivered to a convention retail location.[28]
Operations[edit]
UPS's primary business is the time-definite delivery of packages and documents worldwide. In recent years, UPS has extended its service portfolio to include less than truckload (LTL) transportation (primarily in the U.S.) and supply chain services. UPS reports its operations in three segments: U.S. Domestic Package operations, International Package operations, and Supply Chain & Freight operations.
U.S. Domestic Package[edit]
U.S. Domestic Package operations include the time-definite delivery of letters, documents, and packages throughout the United States.

International Package[edit]




UPS has service worldwide, including at Israel's Ben Gurion International Airport (pictured above).


International Package operations include delivery to more than 220 countries and territories worldwide,[6] including shipments wholly outside the United States, as well as shipments with either origin or distribution outside the United States.
Supply Chain & Freight[edit]
Supply Chain & Freight (UPS-SCS for UPS Supply Chain Solutions) includes UPS' forwarding and contract logistics operations, UPS Freight, and other related business units. UPS' forwarding and logistics business provides services in more than 175 countries and territories worldwide, and includes worldwide supply chain design, execution and management, freight forwarding and distribution, customs brokerage, mail and consulting services. UPS Freight offers a variety of less than truckload ("LTL") and truckload ("TL") services to customers in North America.
Other business units within this segment include The UPS Store and UPS Capital.[29]

Personnel structure[edit]
UPS employs approximately 444,000 staff: 362,000 in the U.S. and 82,000 internationally.[31] Approximately 240,000 UPS drivers, package handlers and clerks are represented by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. During the 1997 United Parcel Service strike, the company's only nationwide strike in its history, which lasted 16 days, Teamster President Ron Carey negotiated a new contract for workers.[32]

2014–present, David Abney

Competitors[edit]
Major competitors in the United States include United States Postal Service (USPS) and FedEx, as well as regional US carriers such as OnTrac, Eastern Connection, and LSO, formerly known as Lonestar Overnight. In addition to these domestic carriers, UPS competes with a variety of international operators, including Canada Post (and its subsidiary Purolator), TransForce, Deutsche Post (and its subsidiary DHL), Royal Mail, Japan Post, India Post and many other regional carriers, national postal services and air cargo handlers (see Package delivery and Mail pages).
Historically, the bulk of UPS' competition came from inexpensive ground-based delivery services, such as Parcel Post (USPS) or Choice Logistics. But in 1998 FedEx expanded into the ground parcel delivery market by acquiring RPS (originally Roadway Package System) and rebranding it as FedEx Ground in 2000. In 2003 DHL expanded its US operations by acquiring Airborne Express, significantly increasing its presence in the United States, and adding more competition in the ground delivery market. In response to this, UPS partnered with the US Postal Service to offer UPS Mail Innovations,[34] a program that allows UPS to pick up mail & packages separately from the main Ground network and transfer them to a USPS center, or destination delivery unit (DDU),[35] for final distribution. This process is also known as zone skipping,[36] long used by Parcel Consolidators.[37] UPS also has a separate product called "SurePost" which uses the UPS Ground network to deliver packages to the nearest UPS Package Center, which transfers them to the USPS DDU for "final mile" delivery.[38]
More recently, the continued growth of online shopping, combined with increasing awareness of the role transportation (including package delivery) has on the environment, has contributed to the rise of emerging competition from niche carriers or rebranded incumbents. For instance, the US Postal Service claims "greener delivery" of parcels on the assumption that USPS letter carriers deliver to each US address, six days a week anyway, and therefore offer the industry's lowest fuel consumption per delivery. Other carriers, like ParcelPool.com,[39] which specializes in residential package delivery to APO/FPO addresses, Hawaii, Alaska, Puerto Rico, and other US Territories, arose in response to increased demand from catalog retailers and online e-tailers for low-cost residential delivery services closely matching service standards normally associated with more expensive expedited parcel delivery.
Transportation[edit]
Delivery vans[edit]

UPS refers to its delivery van as a "package car". The company utilizes several designs and sizes of package cars, dependent on routes and package volume. The rounded-nose design of fiberglass hood of the UPS package car was patented by the company in 1965.[40] Morgan Olson (Grumman Olson), Union City Body, and Utilimaster manufacture the bodies for UPS delivery vans; older vehicles are based on Ford or General Motors P-chassis, while package cars introduced since the 1990s are based on Freightliner, Navistar, or Workhorse chassis. Originally, UPS delivery vehicles were equipped with manual transmissions and steering, although many newer vehicles are updated with automatic transmissions. In a 2010s redesign of the hood, the rounded-nose design has been phased out; its sealed-beam headlights have been replaced with automotive-sourced composite headlight units faired into the hood.
Along with its large delivery vans, for smaller routes, the company utilizes brown-painted delivery vehicles based on off-the-shelf production vehicles, including minivans (including the Ford Transit Connect and Dodge Grand Caravan) and Mercedes-Benz (Dodge/Freightliner) Sprinter box vans. UPS has ordered Modec electric vans for its UK and German fleets. Energy costs play a huge part in the potential profitability of package delivery companies like DHL and FedEx.[41]
When UPS ground vehicles reach the end of their useful service life and are no longer roadworthy (typically 20–25 years or more, but generally when the body's structural integrity is compromised), they are almost always stripped of reusable parts, repainted in household paint to cover up the trademark, and then sent to the scrapyard to be crushed and broken up. The only exception to this policy is when a package car is repainted white for internal use, usually at a large hub. Prior to scrapping, UPS trucks and trailers are assigned an ADA (Automotive Destruction Authorization) number and must be crushed under supervision of UPS Automotive personnel, which records the vehicle's destruction, as UPS does not re-sell any of its ground vehicles.

The UPS package car (delivery van) is a major symbol of the U.S. business world, with its iconic status referenced in an early 2000s ad campaign following UPS' sponsorship of Dale Jarrett in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series: the ads were about how the company would prefer to race the truck over a stock car despite the futility of doing so, as "people love the truck".
Tractor-trailers[edit]




UPS DAF LF cabover straight truck in Plymouth, United Kingdom


UPS commonly refers to its ground package tractor-trailers as "feeders"; these vehicles are separate from the UPS Freight fleet. In line with its delivery vehicles, nearly all UPS tractor units are painted in a Pullman brown livery. As part of a company policy to avoid manufacturer advertising, all UPS semitractors have all manufacturer emblems and badging removed wherever possible.
Prior to the 1990s, many tractors were of cabover configuration; as trailer-length laws were revised in the United States, the company transitioned towards the use of conventional-style semitractor. As of 2017, nearly the entire tractor fleet consists of conventionals.
In North America, vehicles of the UPS semitractor fleet are manufactured by Mack Trucks (the Pinnacle and Vision) and Navistar (International ProStar+ and 9900i) along with PACCAR vehicles (Kenworth T800, T660 and T680). Older vehicles in the fleet include Ford/Sterling tractors (Aeromax/A-Line), Freightliner (Argosy, the final caboveritruck used by UPS); Mack CH and International 8100 tractors are in the process of being phased out.
Previous trucks used by UPS include the Ford L9000, Ford Aeromax, International 8100/8200, International 9670, GMC Astro, Peterbilt 362, Ford L9000, Ford Aeromax, WhiteGMC High Cabover/Road Commander II, Mack CH, Mack MH UltraLiner, Mack F, and Diamond T/Diamond Reo cabovers. At one time[when?], UPS used electric-powered trucks (made by White Motors) for deliveries in Manhattan, NYC. There were only a few hundred of them, but they were notable for their "spooky silence" when running[citation needed].
Painted a light gray, company-owned semitrailers are distinguished by a large UPS emblem on the forward portion of the trailer sides; newer trailers are distinguished by the fitment of trailer skirts. Designed in several configurations, UPS uses several lengths of trailers (28, 45, 48, and 53 feet). Along with standard flat-bottom van trailers, there are drop-frame trailers (largely being phased out of the fleet) and trailer-on-flatcar trailers (TOFC); the latter are trailers designed for transport on railroad cars.
Based on state and provincial regulations, many UPS short trailers are towed in tandem.

Bicycles[edit]
In 2008, UPS started hiring bicycle delivery personnel in Vancouver, Washington, and in several cities in Oregon (Portland, Salem, Corvallis, Eugene, and Medford).[42]
Trains[edit]
UPS contracts with several railroad companies in the United States to provide intermodal transport for its cargo.
Cargo airlines[edit]
Main article: UPS Airlines
UPS Airlines consists of 236 aircraft that serves over 200 countries and territories worldwide.[43][44] Based out of Louisville, Kentucky (home to Worldport), UPS Airlines operates several major hubs throughout the United States; the largest are in Philadelphia and in Rockford, Illinois (Chicago).
Outside of North America, a hub in Cologne, Germany services Europe, while in Asia, UPS Airlines operates a facility in Hong Kong and two hubs in mainland China.
Company brand[edit]
Brown[edit]
The brown color that UPS uses on its vehicles and uniforms is called Pullman Brown. Company founder James E. Casey originally wanted company vehicles to use a yellow paint scheme, but one of his partners, Charlie Soderstrom, stated that a yellow vehicle would be hard to keep clean and that Pullman railroad cars were brown for just that reason.[7]
During the 2000s, the company used the familiarity of its color scheme in an advertising slogan: "What can Brown do for you?"[45]
Font[edit]
UPS commissioned brand consultancy FutureBrand to develop its own font, UPS Sans, for use in marketing and communication material. UPS Sans was created by slightly altering certain parts of FSI FontShop International's font FF Dax without permission. This has resulted in an agreement between FSI FontShop International and FutureBrand to avoid litigation.[46]
Environmental record[edit]
As of 2013, UPS has over 104,900 vehicles in operation worldwide including nearly 7,000 alternative-fuel vehicles.[1] In May 2008 UPS placed an order for 200 hybrid electric vehicles (adding to the 50 it had at that point) and 300 compressed natural gas (which are 20% more fuel efficient, and add to the 800 it already has) vehicles from Daimler Trucks North America.[47][48][49]
UPS received a "striding" rating of 80 points out of 100 totals on the environmental scorecard by the Climate Counts Group for its efforts to lessen the company's impact on the environment.[50] UPS has also been awarded the Clean Air Excellence Award by the United States Environmental Protection Agency because of the alternative fuel program it has developed.[51]
In October 2009, UPS became the first small-package carrier to offer customers the chance to buy carbon offsets to neutralize the greenhouse gas emissions generated by the transport of their packages. Although initially only available on ups.com and to high-volume shippers, they are now widely available through UPS shipping systems and UPS Ready third-party shipping systems.[52][53]
Controversy[edit]
On May 26, 2017, A federal judge ordered United Parcel Service to pay nearly $247 million in damages and penalties for illegally shipping large amounts of untaxed cigarettes in New York.[54]

History of United Parcel Service, Inc.








Known in the industry as "Big Brown," United Parcel Service, Inc. (UPS) is the world's largest package delivery company. The Atlanta-based business delivered approximately 3.4 billion items throughout more than 200 countries and territories in 2003. In addition to its fleet of 88,000 vehicles, the company operates the ninth largest airline in North America by virtue of its nearly 600 company-owned and chartered aircraft. Although UPS's global reach has been steadily expanding, it is the firm's U.S. operations that are its most impressive asset. Its door-to-door delivery system reaches every residential and business address in the country, and UPS estimates that its system carries goods that are valued at more than 6 percent of the U.S. gross domestic product. More than 83 percent of UPS's revenues is generated in the United States, where the firm has a market share of about 60 percent in ground shipping and about 35 percent in air shipping. Although UPS sold a 10 percent stake in the company to the public in November 1999 through newly created Class B shares, the Class A shares, which control 99 percent of the voting rights in the company, remain in private hands, mostly those of employees and retirees.

Roots in the Early 20th Century

UPS was founded in 1907 in Seattle, Washington, by 19-year-old Jim Casey as a six-bicycle messenger service called American Messenger Company. He set the future tone of the company by mandating that it be employee-owned. Casey delivered telegraph messages and hot lunches and sometimes took odd jobs to keep his struggling business going. In 1913 Casey merged his company with Evert McCabe's rival firm, Motorcycle Delivery Company, creating Merchants Parcel Delivery. The "fleet" at this point consisted of a few motorcycles and one Model T Ford. In 1915, by which time the fleet had expanded to four cars and five motorcycles, the company began painting its delivery vehicles brown. It was Charlie Soderstrom, one of Casey's partners, who urged that brown be adopted, noting that the color hid dirt well--a fact that had earlier led the Pullman company to paint its railroad cars that same hue.
With Casey's tacit approval, company drivers joined the International Brotherhood of Teamsters in 1916. In 1918 three Seattle department stores hired the service to deliver merchandise to purchasers on the day of the purchase. Department store deliveries remained the center of the firm's business until the late 1940s. In 1919, meantime, Merchants Parcel Delivery made its first move outside its home market, buying a delivery firm in Oakland, California. Because there was a similarly named firm already operating in San Francisco, another name change was in order. The moniker chosen was United Parcel Service. During the 1920s, UPS expanded to Los Angeles, San Francisco, San Diego, and Portland, Oregon. An expansion drive on the East Coast began in 1930 with the start of delivery service in New York City. UPS moved its headquarters to New York that same year.
In 1929 UPS began air delivery through a new division, United Air Express, which put packages on to passenger planes. The Great Depression ended plans for an overnight air service, and UPS terminated United Air Express in 1931; the company did not resume air service until 1953, when UPS Air was launched as a two-day service connecting major cities on the East and West Coasts. In the late 1940s the urban department stores that UPS serviced began following their clients to the new suburbs. More people owned cars and picked up their own parcels. UPS's revenue declined.
Casey decided to change direction and expand the common-carrier parcel business, picking up parcels from anyone and taking them to anyone else, charging a fixed rate per parcel. The company's initial customers were primarily industrial and commercial shippers, although the firm also serviced consumers. The company had offered common-carrier service in Los Angeles since 1922, and in 1953 UPS extended it to San Francisco, Chicago, and New York. UPS delivered any package meeting weight and size requirements to any location within 150 miles of these bases. After this initial expansion, UPS frequently appeared before the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) to expand its operating rights.
UPS scaled its operations to fit its market niche, refusing packages weighing more than 50 pounds or with a combined length and width of more than 108 inches, limitations that would increase in concert with the company's capabilities. Its average package weighed about ten pounds and was roughly the size of a briefcase, making sorting and carrying easy. UPS competed with scores of regional firms but most had not limited the size and weight of their packages. They ended up with the heavier packages, higher overheads, and lower volumes.

A New Generation of Leadership for the 1960s

Casey resigned as chief executive officer in 1962, when UPS achieved annual revenues of about $141 million. He was succeeded by George D. Smith. UPS more than doubled its sales and profits between 1964 and 1969, when the company made $31.9 million on sales of about $548 million. The company remained privately owned, its stock held by several hundred of its executives. UPS in 1969 served 31 states on the East and West Coasts. It had just gotten ICC approval to add nine midwestern states and soon got approval for three more states. Only the lightly populated states of Arizona, Alaska, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, and Utah were without UPS service. The firm kept a low profile, avoiding publicity, and refusing interviews of its chief executives. UPS officials believed only one parcel shipping company could exist in the United States, and it hoped that keeping a low profile would prevent anyone from copying its methods.
The firm's secrecy policy was possible because it was closely held. Its 3,700 stockholders (a number raised to 23,000 by 1991) were its own top and middle managers and their families. Stockholders wanting to sell sold their stock back to the company. Because management owned UPS, the company could make long-range plans without the pressure for instant profits faced by many publicly owned firms. Most managers started as UPS drivers or sorters and came up through the ranks, creating great loyalty. The company's management structure was relatively informal, stressing partnership and the involvement of management at all levels.
In 1970 Congress considered a reform of the United States Postal Service that would allow it to subsidize its parcel post operations with profits from its first-class mail. This would allow it to lower prices and compete more directly with UPS. UPS hired a public relations firm and for the first time officially announced its earnings, trying to build a case that it was an integral part of the U.S. economy and that the postal reform would be disruptive. UPS handled 500 million packages in 1969 for 165,000 regular customers. The company claimed that 95 percent of all deliveries within 150 miles were delivered overnight. The company centered operations around a five-day-a-week cycle. Drivers made deliveries in the morning, made pickups in the afternoon, and returned to operations centers around 6 p.m. Their packages were immediately sorted and transferred for delivery.
UPS trucks, which were cleaned every night, were assigned to specific drivers, who the company treated as future managers and owners. The company had 22,000 drivers in 1969, and most were kept on the same route to develop a relationship with customers. Some drivers, however, found UPS management inflexible, resulting in occasional local strikes.
In 1976 UPS tried to replace, gradually, all of its full-time employees who sorted and handled packages at warehouses with part-time workers. Teamsters locals in the South, Midwest, and West accepted the idea, but 17,000 UPS employees from Maine to South Carolina went on strike. The strike caused chaos for East Coast retailers as their suppliers were forced to send Christmas goods through the overburdened U.S. Postal Service. UPS eventually reached agreement with the Teamsters, but its labor relations continued to be spotty. Because management owned the business, it tended to drive its employees hard, and many drivers complained of the long hours and hard work. To maximize driver performance, the company kept records of the production of every driver and sorter and compared them to its performance projections. Drivers' routes were timed in great detail.
In 1975, meantime, UPS achieved a long coveted goal when it became the first package delivery firm to serve every address in the continental United States. That same year, the company expanded outside the country for the first time, launching delivery service in Ontario, Canada, and also relocated its headquarters to Connecticut. In 1976 UPS launched service in West Germany with 120 delivery vans. It quickly ran into trouble because of cultural and language differences. UPS eventually adapted by hiring some German managers and accepting the German dislike of working overtime. George C. Lamb, Jr., succeeded Harold Oberkotter as UPS chairman in 1980.

Intensifying Competition in the 1980s

UPS continued to grow rapidly, aided by trucking deregulation in 1980. By 1980 UPS earned $189 million on revenues of $4 billion, shipping 1.5 billion packages. Federal Express Corporation (FedEx), however, which began operations in 1973, was siphoning off a growing amount of UPS's business. FedEx shipped packages overnight by air, and many businesses began shipping high-priority packages with FedEx. UPS had the resources to challenge FedEx, but it meant taking on significant debt, something the conservatively run UPS was reluctant to do. In 1981 it had only $7 million in long-term debt and a net worth of $750 million. To compete with FedEx, UPS bought nine used 727 airplanes in 1981 from Braniff Airlines for $28 million. It opened an air hub in Louisville, Kentucky, but was hesitant about directly challenging FedEx because of the huge cost of building an air fleet. It decided to stick with two-day delivery rather than overnight delivery, hoping that many businesses would be willing to let packages take an extra day if it meant savings of up to 70 percent. It called its two-day delivery Blue Label Air and spent $1 million in 1981 to promote it--a large sum for UPS, which had rarely advertised. In 1982 UPS ran its first-ever television ads, trying to convince executives that two-day service was fast enough for most packages.








The recession of the early 1980s helped UPS because many companies shifted to smaller inventories, shipping smaller lots more frequently and demanding greater reliability. Package volume grew by 6 percent in 1981. Because of the recession, the Teamsters accepted a contract in 1982 that limited wage increases to a cost-of-living adjustment, which then was diverted to pay the increased cost of medical benefits. When UPS then released information showing its net income rose 74 percent in 1981, labor relations worsened. Bitterness continued between UPS management and drivers as company profits swelled 48 percent to $490 million in 1983. UPS and the Teamsters secretly negotiated for two months in 1984 and reached a three-year agreement providing for bonuses and increased wages. The move averted a probable strike by 90,000 employees. Despite this labor tension, UPS's employee turnover remained remarkably low at 4 percent. Many workers were recruited as part-time employees while college students and were offered full-time positions after graduation.
In 1982 UPS decided to offer overnight air service (UPS Next Day Air), charging about half of FedEx's rate. By 1983 its second-day and next-day services were shipping a combined 140,000 packages a day. In 1982 UPS earned $332 million on $5.2 billion in sales. It had a fleet of more than 62,000 trucks. Mail-order firms and catalog houses were the fastest growing part of UPS's business. Jack Rogers became UPS chairman in 1984. In 1985 UPS began offering international air service between the United States and six European countries.
Despite labor troubles, a Fortune survey found UPS's reputation the highest in its industry every year from 1984 to 1991. It was by far the most profitable U.S. transportation company, making more than $700 million in 1987 on revenue of $10 billion. FedEx, however, had 57 percent of the rapidly growing overnight package business; UPS had only 15 percent. FedEx was highly automated and used electronics to track packages en route and to perform other services. UPS still did most jobs manually, but was rapidly switching to the use of electronic scanners at its sorting centers and to computers on its trucks. UPS introduced technology methodically, buying a software firm and a computer design shop to create the necessary equipment. It then field-tested its new gear at a 35-car messenger service it owned in Los Angeles. It launched a $1.5 billion five-year computerization project, trying to create a system that tracked packages door-to-door, which FedEx was doing already. UPS's healthy river of cash flow enabled it to pay $1.8 billion for 110 aircraft in 1987. The purchase made it the tenth largest U.S. airline. The company launched its first wide-range television advertising campaign in 1988, spending $35 million to publicize the slogan, "We run the tightest ship in the shipping business." Despite these expenses, the company still had only $114 million in long-term debt and continued to finance large projects out of its cash flow.
By 1988 UPS's ground service was growing by 7 to 8 percent per year, and air service was growing by 30 percent per year. UPS handled 2.3 billion packages per year, compared with 1.4 billion for the U.S. Postal Service. The 300-plane fleet of the UPS overnight service handled 600,000 parcels and documents per day, making $350 million on $2.2 billion in sales in 1988. UPS continued building an overseas air network, but in West Germany, where it had 6,000 employees, it delivered only on the ground. The company shipped eight million packages overseas in 1988, losing $20 million in the process. UPS bought its Italian partner, Alimondo, in 1988, hoping to use it and its German base to expand through Europe. The company also bought nine small European courier companies to expand air service. Its overseas acquisitions cost UPS less than $100 million. UPS and rival FedEx both were losing money on overseas operations, but UPS had an advantage: FedEx could not match its $6.5 billion in assets and $480 million in cash with minimal debt. UPS hoped this would give it greater staying power as the two companies struggled to build a global delivery network. Meanwhile, UPS slowly won some FedEx customers by giving volume discounts, which it previously had refused to do. The overseas shipping war escalated as FedEx bought Tiger International, Inc., a major international shipper that UPS used for some of its foreign deliveries.

Invigorated Through New Leadership in the 1990s

Kent C. Nelson succeeded Jack Rogers as chairman and CEO in 1989. Nicknamed "Oz" for 1940s-era band leader Ozzie Nelson, the 52-year-old had spent his entire working life at UPS, starting with the company only two days after graduating from college. The new leader undertook a gradual, but complete transformation of UPS that extended from its innermost workings to its public image.
Challenged by competitors large and small, UPS launched a plethora of new services in the early 1990s. These ranged from timed and same-day deliveries to less expensive two- and three-day services. The company's Worldwide Logistics subsidiary (formed in 1993) offered clients everything from inventory management to warehousing and, of course, delivery. Powerful and costly technical systems, often developed internally by a 4,000-member staff, backed up these expanded operations. UPS's DIAD (delivery information acquisition device), for example, combined a barcode scanner, electronic signature capture, and cellular tracking network in a single handheld tool. By 1992, the corporation was investing more money in computers than in ubiquitous brown vehicles. These internal changes reflected the company's traditional focus on super-efficiency as well as its newfound emphasis on customer satisfaction.
In 1991, meanwhile, UPS relocated its corporate headquarters from Greenwich, Connecticut, to Atlanta, Georgia. Another important development during this period came in 1995, when the corporation introduced a new stock purchase program that was open to all UPS employees--both full- and part-time; previously, only management was given the opportunity to buy the stock.
In contrast to its secretive early years, the UPS of the 1990s was a bold global marketer. The company embarked on the largest advertising campaign in its history in 1996, spending an estimated $100 million in conjunction with its sponsorship of the Centennial Olympics held in its new base of Atlanta. UPS hoped that the worldwide recognition enjoyed by the Olympic rings would rub off on its brown trucks, which were not well known outside the United States.
That recognition was vital to the success of UPS's international operations, which continued to lose money into the mid-1990s. By 1995, in fact, losses on the company's European assault totaled nearly $1 billion. But backed by its patient and confident employee/stockholders and a hefty bank account, UPS was able to wait out publicly held FedEx, which had limited its European service to intercontinental deliveries by mid-decade. In stark contrast, UPS had expanded its international network to include 200 countries and territories worldwide. Undaunted by its massive losses, UPS announced plans to invest more than $1 billion in its European operations from 1995 to 2000, and it infused another $130 million into its Asian operations. The company hoped to profit on its piece of the $25 billion European parcel post market by the end of the century.
This global push fueled a 69 percent increase in sales over the course of Nelson's first six years at the helm of UPS. At the same time, however, it played a significant role in the reduction of the company's overall profit margin from 8 percent in 1987 to 4.8 percent in 1995.
In January 1997 James P. Kelly succeeded Nelson as chairman and CEO. Kelly had worked his way up through the ranks, having joined UPS in 1964 as a package car driver. His first year at the company turned into a rough one as the 190,000 Teamsters employees at UPS went on strike for 15 days in August before agreeing to a new five-year pact. In addition to wage increases, the new agreement called for the creation of 10,000 new full-time jobs and the shifting of 10,000 part-time workers into full-time jobs as such jobs became available through attrition and growth. The strike cost UPS $700 million in lost revenue, resulting in less than 1 percent sales growth for the year and a decline in profits to $909 million from the 1996 figure of $1.15 billion.
UPS shook off any lingering effects from the strike by 1998 when its domestic shipping revenues jumped 9.4 percent, reaching $20.65 billion. UPS continued to reap benefits from the ever-growing e-commerce section, which was fueling demand for shipping services. During the year, the company rolled out a money-back guarantee for on-time delivery for all of its ground business-to-business shipments. Other good news came in the form of the first-ever annual profits for the company's international operations, which now generated nearly 13 percent of overall revenues.
In 1999 company executives determined that UPS needed the added flexibility of publicly traded stock in order to pursue some larger acquisition targets. Thus in November, UPS completed what was then the largest initial public offering (IPO) ever conducted in the United States. The company raised $5.47 billion by selling 109.4 million shares of newly created Class B shares at $50 per share on the New York Stock Exchange. The Class A shares, which controlled 99 percent of the voting rights at the company, remained in the private hands of employees and retirees. The newly public company (whose official name was shortened from United Parcel Service of America Inc. to United Parcel Service, Inc.) was immediately confronted with a new challenge from FedEx. The arch-rival had bought a truck-based shipping company earlier in the year and then in 2000 launched two new truck-based delivery services: FexEx Ground, specializing in business-to-business deliveries, and FedEx Home Delivery, concentrating on deliveries to residences.

Acquisitions at Center Stage in the Early 2000s

UPS's post-IPO acquisition spree began with the 2000 purchase of Challenge Air Cargo, a Miami-based freight carrier operating in Latin America. That same year, the firm gained the right to fly directly to China from the United States; the following April, UPS began making six weekly freight flights to Shanghai and Beijing. Also in April 2001, UPS spent about $185 million in cash for Mail Boxes Etc., a U.S. franchise-based chain of stores providing packing, shipping, and mail services. There were more than 4,300 Mail Boxes Etc. locations throughout the United States as well as overseas, and the chain was expected to expand UPS's services to small and home-based businesses and to consumers as well. In May 2001, as part of the company's aggressive move into global supply-chain management, UPS acquired Fritz Companies, Inc. in a $456 million stock swap. Fritz, which specialized in freight forwarding, customs brokering, and logistics, was subsequently renamed UPS Freight Services. Then in late 2002 UPS Freight Services was merged with UPS Logistics Group to form UPS Supply Chain Solutions, a streamlined unit operating out of 120 countries and offering freight forwarding, international trade management, logistics and distribution, and other specialized supply-chain services.
At the beginning of 2002 Michael L. Eskew succeeded the retiring Kelly as chairman and CEO. Eskew had joined the company in 1972 as an industrial engineering manager and had risen to become executive vice-president by 1999. Also in 2002, UPS extended its money-back guarantee for on-time ground-delivered packages to include residential shipments within the continental United States, and it also launched an advertising campaign featuring a new slogan, "What can Brown do for you?"
In early 2003 most of the 3,300 Mail Boxes Etc. outlets in the United States began operating under a new name, the UPS Store, in the hope of capitalizing on the well-known UPS brand. Simultaneously, the corporation revamped its logo for the first time since 1961. The new logo kept the shield that had been part of the logo since 1919, though the shield was modernized with a more three-dimensional look. The previous logo's bow-tied package was removed, however, as the company wanted to emphasize that it was involved in more than just shipping. Likewise, the phrase "Worldwide Delivery Service," which had appeared on its 88,000-vehicle fleet, was replaced with "Synchronizing the World of Commerce," thereby reflecting UPS's expanded activities in the wider supply-chain industry. Brown remained the company's principal color. Also during 2003, UPS attempted to fend off the inroads that FedEx and other competitors had made into its core domestic ground shipping business by shaving at least one day off the amount of time it needed to ship items between more than half of the largest U.S. metropolitan areas.
Despite the implosion of numerous e-commerce companies, and the package deliveries that died along with the companies, UPS managed to continue to grow during the recessionary early 2000s. Total revenues reached $33.49 billion by 2003, with faster growth in international package deliveries and nonpackage operations (including the extended supply-chain activities and the UPS Store) making up for shortfalls in the U.S. package delivery sector. As it neared its 100th anniversary in 2007, UPS remained one of the most respected companies in its industry and a formidable competitor. One concern going forward was the aggressive move of Deutsche Post AG, the German postal agency, into the U.S. cargo market through its acquisitions of DHL Worldwide Express and Airborne Inc.

	Why Avon Products, United Parcel Service and United States Steel Are 3 of Today’s Worst Stocks
UPS, AVP and X stock finished the week on a very, very low note

The wind in the market’s sails on Thursday was nowhere to be found on Friday, as investors put the good news of economic stimulus in Europe behind them, perhaps doubting that it will do any good. Stocks closed 0.55% red today, though still well up for the week.
Some stocks, however, were hit much harder than others. Avon Products, Inc. (AVP), United Parcel Service, Inc. (UPS) and United States Steel Corporation (X), for instance, were absolutely crushed. Here’s the deal.
5 Vanguard Funds No One Needs to Own
Avon Products (AVP)
Thursday may have been the first glimmer of hope for Avon Products in months, with AVP stock rising 14% in the wake of rumors it was a buyout target.
The buyers weren’t nearly as confident on Friday, however, letting AVP stock slide nearly 8%. The potential buyer is reported to be private-equity firm TPG Capital.
If it all seems a little familiar for Avon Products, that may be because cosmetics maker Coty (COTY) offered to buy Avon in 2012, for more than $10 billion. The company opted to hand the keys over to CEO Sheri McCoy, though, confident she could turn things around. She hasn’t. Now Avon Products is only valued at $3.7 billion, with sales and earnings continuing to deteriorate.
United Parcel Service (UPS)
United Parcel Service may have been as busy during 2014’s holiday shopping — and shipping — season as it first thought it would be, but it wasn’t doing it as profitably as it had hoped.
That news came in the form of a profit-warning for those who own UPS stock. The company said to expect earnings of $1.25 per share for its fiscal Q4 of last year, versus analyst estimates of $1.47. David Abney, CEO of United Parcel Service, said of last quarter:
“Clearly, our financial performance during the quarter was disappointing. UPS invested heavily to ensure we would provide excellent service during peak when deliveries more than double. Though customers enjoyed high quality service, it came at a cost to UPS. Going forward, we will reduce operating costs and implement new pricing strategies during peak season.”
UPS stock fell almost 10% by the time the closing bell rang.
United States Steel (X)
As if shareholders of United States Steel hadn’t been run through the wringer enough already since late September, X stock fell another 9% today, bringing the four-month pullback to a whopping loss of 53%.
Investors have seen the company waving several red flags recently, one of which was this week’s news that United States Steel would be shuttering plants and laying off more than 5,000 people. That announcement came just a couple of weeks after the steel company said it would be laying off more than 600 employees at a pipe manufacturing facility in Ohio.
Today’s big setback was the result of an industry downgrade from Goldman Sachs. The investment bank now expects iron ore prices to average 17% less than it had first guessed, after prices fell 47% last year. It’s a concern that could end up being big trouble for United States Steel.
As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.
