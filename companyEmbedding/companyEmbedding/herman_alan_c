                                    Patents by Inventor Alan C. Herman
                                




                    Alan C. Herman has filed for patents to protect the following inventions. This listing includes patent applications that are pending as well as patents that have already been granted by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO).
                







Fluid proportioning pump system



Patent number:  4714545
                                            

Abstract:  A plurality of different liquid solutions are connected to an input of a pump system having at least two displacement chambers and in a manner to control the proportions of each constituent that are taken into each chamber during its intake stroke. The outputs of the chambers are connected to a common liquid output. The chambers are driven by independently controllable motors so that the discharge stroke may be chosen to have some parameters, such as speed profile and duration, that are different than during the intake stroke. As a result, both chambers may simultaneously discharge liquid through the common output, if desired. The proportion of constituents may be made different each time one of the chambers is filled, so the simultaneous discharge of the chambers allows a gradual, carefully controlled change from the mixture of one chamber to that of the other.
