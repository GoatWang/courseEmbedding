International Game Technology PLC (IGT), formerly Gtech S.p.A. and Lottomatica S.p.A., is a multinational gaming company that produces slot machines and other gaming technology. The company is headquartered in London, with major offices in Rome, Providence, and Las Vegas. It is controlled with a 51 percent stake by De Agostini.[4]
Lottomatica acquired Gtech Corporation, a U.S. gaming company, in August 2006, and later changed its own name to Gtech. This transaction created one of the world's leading gaming solutions providers, with significant global market share and the broadest portfolio of technology, services, and content solutions. Gtech managed many state and provincial lotteries in the United States and also had contracts with local and national lotteries in Europe, Australia, Latin America, the Caribbean, and Asia.
In 2015, the company acquired American gaming company International Game Technology and again adopted the acquired company's name as its own.
Current holdings[edit]
With the 2006 acquisition of Gtech Corporation, the company increased its global business activities due to a permanent presence of its employees in several countries throughout the world. IGT has operations in more than 100 countries worldwide, and deals with various ethnicities and nations with different levels of local employment laws. In order to meet these various requirements, IGT complies with the principles of the International Labor Office’s Tripartite Declaration of Principles concerning Multinational Enterprises and its social policy (Geneva 2000). In particular, the Company complies with all of the recommendations in the aforementioned declaration with regard to relations with staff in the various states.[5]
In July 2014, Gtech agreed to acquire American company International Game Technology (IGT), the world's largest slot machine manufacturer, for a total of $6.4 billion, including $4.7 billion in cash and $1.7 billion in assumed debt. The companies combined under a new holding company based in the United Kingdom, and the Gtech name was dropped in favor of IGT.[6][7]
On April 7, 2015, Gtech completed its merger with IGT. The new combined company's name is International Game Technology PLC.[8]

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million
Updated: June 9, 2013
Data Format: CSV

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

International Game Technology PLC (IGT), formerly Gtech S.p.A. and Lottomatica S.p.A., is a multinational gaming company that produces slot machines and other gaming technology. The company is headquartered in London, with major offices in Rome, Providence, and Las Vegas. It is controlled with a 51 percent stake by De Agostini.[4]
Lottomatica acquired Gtech Corporation, a U.S. gaming company, in August 2006, and later changed its own name to Gtech. This transaction created one of the world's leading gaming solutions providers, with significant global market share and the broadest portfolio of technology, services, and content solutions. Gtech managed many state and provincial lotteries in the United States and also had contracts with local and national lotteries in Europe, Australia, Latin America, the Caribbean, and Asia.
In 2015, the company acquired American gaming company International Game Technology and again adopted the acquired company's name as its own.
Current holdings[edit]
With the 2006 acquisition of Gtech Corporation, the company increased its global business activities due to a permanent presence of its employees in several countries throughout the world. IGT has operations in more than 100 countries worldwide, and deals with various ethnicities and nations with different levels of local employment laws. In order to meet these various requirements, IGT complies with the principles of the International Labor Office’s Tripartite Declaration of Principles concerning Multinational Enterprises and its social policy (Geneva 2000). In particular, the Company complies with all of the recommendations in the aforementioned declaration with regard to relations with staff in the various states.[5]
In July 2014, Gtech agreed to acquire American company International Game Technology (IGT), the world's largest slot machine manufacturer, for a total of $6.4 billion, including $4.7 billion in cash and $1.7 billion in assumed debt. The companies combined under a new holding company based in the United Kingdom, and the Gtech name was dropped in favor of IGT.[6][7]
On April 7, 2015, Gtech completed its merger with IGT. The new combined company's name is International Game Technology PLC.[8]

LONDON, May 25, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- 

Continued growth in instant and draw-based lottery same-store revenue and in global gaming machine installed base 
Net loss of $55 million, adjusted Net income of $59 million; adjusted EBITDA of $371 million reflects comparison with unusually high base in prior year  
Net debt of $7,398 million, down from $7,569 million at 2016 year end  
2017 outlook updated for pending DoubleDown transaction and new gaming machine taxation in Italy 
Cash dividend declared of $0.20 per ordinary share









International Game Technology PLC ("IGT") (NYSE:   IGT) today reported financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2017. Today, at 8:00 a.m. EDT / 1:00 p.m. BST / 2:00 p.m. CEST, management will host a conference call and webcast to present the first quarter results; access details are provided below.
"The first quarter of 2017 has been a dynamic period for us," said Marco Sala, CEO of IGT. "Our revenue and profit are consistent with the pattern of the year that we described in March. Year to date, we've strengthened our leading positions in global lotteries and begun the rollout of a new generation of gaming machines. We are monetizing non-core assets that will allow us to significantly reduce debt, and we are adopting a new business model for our future participation in the social casino space."
"As we noted in March, a unique combination of elements affected first quarter revenue and profit comparisons, including record jackpot activity in 2016," said Alberto Fornaro, CFO of IGT. "Disciplined asset and operational management are a top priority for the Company, and this is evident in the strong first quarter cash flow. We are updating our outlook to incorporate the DoubleDown transaction and the impact of increased taxation on gaming machines in Italy."

Comparability of Results
All figures presented in this news release are prepared under U.S. GAAP, unless noted otherwise. Adjusted figures exclude the impact of items such as purchase accounting, impairment charges, restructuring expense, foreign exchange, and certain one-time, primarily transaction-related items.  Reconciliations to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures are included in the tables in this news release. Constant currency changes for 2017 are calculated using the same foreign exchange rates as the corresponding 2016 period. 
Management believes that referring to certain constant currency or adjusted measures is a useful way to evaluate the Company's underlying performance.
Overview of Consolidated First Quarter Results
Consolidated revenue was $1,153 million compared to $1,282 million in the first quarter of 2016. The decline in revenue reflects comparisons with the high jackpot levels of the prior year, new Italy Lotto concession dynamics, and lower gaming product sales. 
Global lottery same-store revenue, excluding Italy, declined 11% in the first quarter, following record jackpot activity in North America and the United Kingdom during the prior-year period. Excluding multi-state jackpot games, global lottery same-store revenue grew nearly 2%. Italy lottery wagers decreased 2% due to higher late numbers activity in the first quarter of 2016.  
Gaming service revenue was impacted by lower DoubleDown revenue, and gaming product sales were down due to large system and software sales in the first quarter of 2016. The Company shipped 5,953 gaming machines worldwide during the first quarter, and the global installed base rose to 59,034.
Adjusted EBITDA of $371 million was 19% below the first quarter of 2016. Operating income was $119 million compared to $188 million in the first quarter of 2016, and Adjusted operating income was $238 million compared to $310 million. The declines in Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted operating income primarily reflect lower revenues, International segment performance, and unfavorable foreign exchange translation. 
Interest expense was $115 million compared to $118 million in the prior-year period.
Net loss attributable to IGT was $55 million in the first quarter of 2017, reflecting the after-tax impacts of $70 million in purchase price accounting and $36 million impact in non-cash foreign exchange losses. On an adjusted basis, net income attributable to IGT was $59 million. The Company reported net loss per diluted share of $(0.27) and earned $0.29 per diluted share on an adjusted basis. 
In the first three months of the year, cash from operations was $284 million and capital expenditures were $172 million. 
Cash and cash equivalents were $463 million as of March 31, 2017, compared to $294 million as of December 31, 2016. Net debt was $7,398 million as of March 31, 2017. 
Operating Segment Review
North America Gaming & InteractiveRevenue for North America Gaming & Interactive was $305 million compared to $339 million in the first quarter of 2016. 
Service revenue was $234 million compared to $258 million in the prior-year period, primarily driven by a year-over-year decrease in the installed base and fewer daily active users at DoubleDown. 
Product sales were $71 million compared to $81 million in the first quarter of 2016, which benefitted from a large system sale. The segment shipped 3,944 gaming machine units in the quarter compared to 3,951 units in the prior-year period. 
Operating income for North America Gaming & Interactive was $66 million compared to $89 million in the first quarter of 2016. The decline is primarily due to lower revenues, increased depreciation on investments in the installed base, and higher jackpot expense. 
North America LotteryNorth America Lottery revenue was $281 million compared to $315 million in the first quarter of 2016, which benefitted from record multi-state jackpot activity. 
Service revenue of $268 million reflects a 14.0% decline in same-store revenue growth on comparisons with record Powerball sales in the prior year. Excluding multi-state jackpot games, same-store revenue for draw-based games and instant tickets grew 1.5%. 
Product sales rose to $13 million in the first quarter of 2017 from $11 million in the prior-year period, and included higher instant ticket printing revenue.
Operating income for North America Lottery was $69 million compared to $88 million in the first quarter of 2016 on lower jackpot revenue and associated profit. 
InternationalInternational revenue was $164 million compared to $185 million in the first quarter of 2016. On a constant currency basis, International revenue declined 9%. 
Lottery same-store revenue was up 2.0% on broad-based strength in Latin America and Europe, that was partially offset by continued weakness in the United Kingdom, including elevated jackpot activity in the prior-year period. 
Gaming service revenue was $41 million compared to $47 million in the first quarter of 2016, down 9% on a constant currency basis, mainly due to the exit from certain interactive operations. The installed base grew sequentially on increased unit placements in Greece and South Africa. 
Product sales revenue was lower due to large, high-margin gaming software sales in the first quarter of 2016. The segment shipped a total of 2,009 gaming machine units during the first quarter of 2017 compared to 1,744 units in the prior-year period. A portion of the new and expansion unit revenue was deferred and is expected to be recognized in the second quarter of 2017. 
International operating income was below the prior-year period due to lower revenue; product sales mix and discounts; as well as unfavorable foreign exchange translation and bad debt expense. 
ItalyItaly revenue was $402 million compared to $444 million in the first quarter of 2016. At constant currency, revenue declined 6% as growth in machine gaming was more than offset by the new Lotto concession dynamics, primarily amortization of the upfront payment, and lower sports betting revenue.  
Total Lotto wagers in the quarter were €1,873 million compared to €1,928 million in the prior-year period, reflecting significantly lower late numbers activity. 10eLotto performance remained strong, with wagers increasing 4% over the prior-year period. Instant-ticket wagers were essentially unchanged at €2,341 million. 
Machine gaming service revenue was up over the first quarter of 2016 on increased vertical integration and higher installed units. Sports betting revenue declined during the first quarter of 2017 on higher payout, consistent with industry trends during the period. 
Italy operating income was $125 million compared to $148 million in the first quarter of 2016. The decline was mainly attributable to the new Lotto concession dynamics and sports betting performance, partially offset by machine gaming growth.  
Other Developments
As announced on April 17, 2017, the Company has reached a definitive purchase agreement to sell its social casino subsidiary, DoubleDown Interactive, to an affiliate of DoubleU Games, a leading global social casino operator, for a cash purchase price of $825 million. The sale is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2017. Upon the closing of the sale, the parties will enter into a game development and distribution agreement which will enable DoubleU Games to offer IGT's extensive casino game library on DoubleU Games' combined social casino platforms, in exchange for ongoing royalties to IGT.
The board of directors of the Company appointed Heather J. McGregor as a fourth member of the audit committee, effective May 24, 2017. McGregor previously joined the board of directors as an independent director on March 8, 2017.
Additionally, the Company's board of directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per ordinary share. The dividend is payable on June 22, 2017 to all shareholders of record as of the close of business on June 8, 2017.
Outlook
The Company updated its outlook to account for the closing of the DoubleDown transaction by the end of the second quarter and the impact of new taxation on gaming machines in Italy. The Company currently expects full year 2017 adjusted EBITDA of $1,600-$1,680 million, compared to its previous outlook of $1,680-$1,760 million. Net debt is now expected to be $6,950-$7,150 million at the end of 2017, compared to the previous $7,600-$7,800 million outlook, as net proceeds from the DoubleDown sale will be used to reduce debt. 
Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure. Management uses non-GAAP financial measures to understand and compare operating results across accounting periods, for internal budgeting and forecasting purposes, and to evaluate the Company's financial performance. Management believes these Non-GAAP financial measures reflect the Company's ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful period-to-period comparisons and analysis of business trends.
Conference Call and Webcast
Today, at 8:00 a.m. EDT / 1:00 p.m. BST / 2:00 p.m. CEST, management will host a conference call to present the first quarter 2017 results.

Today, at 8:00 a.m. EST / 1:00 p.m. GMT / 2:00 p.m. CET, management will host a conference call and webcast to present the fourth quarter and full year 2016 results; access details are provided below."We reached many important milestones in 2016," said Marco Sala, CEO of IGT. "We reinforced our number one position in Lottery globally, achieving robust same-store revenue growth and securing valuable, multi-year contracts. We also made good progress with our Gaming turnaround, developing compelling new titles and hardware, in addition to expanding our International presence.  We operate in growing global market segments and IGT has a long history of investing in innovation to create shareholder value.""We achieved our financial goals for 2016 and ended the year in strong financial condition," said Alberto Fornaro, CFO of IGT. "Disciplined capital management enabled us to reduce our debt and improve our leverage profile despite the large upfront investment in the Italy Lotto. We expect 2017 to evolve as a year of two halves, with difficult comparisons in the first part of the year easing as we reach the second half."Summary of Consolidated Fourth Quarter and Full Year Financial Results   Reported             Constant        Quarter Ended December 31,   2016   2015   Change   Currency           (%)   Change (%)        (In US $ millions, unless otherwise noted)            Revenue   1,321   1,365   -3%   -2%        Operating Income   138   132   5%   5%        Net income per diluted share   1.15   0.37   NM    NM         Net debt   7,569   7,707   -2%   -        Adjusted EBITDA   422   449   -6%   -6%        Adjusted Operating Income   281   293   -4%   -4%        Adjusted net income per diluted share   0.88   0.63   40%    NA                    Reported   Pro forma            Constant     Year Ended December 31,   2016   2015   Change   2016   2015   Change   Currency        (%)     (%)   Change (%)     (In US $ millions, unless otherwise noted)            Revenue   5,154   4,689   10%   5,154   5,088   1%   2%     Operating Income   660   540   22%   660   533   24%   24%     Net income (loss) per diluted share   1.05   (0.39)   NM   1.05    NA    NA    NA      Net debt   7,569   7,707   -2%   7,569   7,707   -2%   -     Adjusted EBITDA   1,755   1,611   9%   1,755   1,704   3%   3%     Adjusted Operating Income   1,167   1,043   12%   1,167   1,069   9%   9%     Adjusted net income per diluted share   2.33   1.88   24%   2.33    NA    NA    NA        Note: Pro forma is defined as the combined results of GTECH and legacy IGT for period prior to the second quarter of 2015. Adjusted operating income, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted net income per diluted share are non-GAAP financial measures.  Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are provided at the end of this news release.    Comparability of ResultsAll figures presented in this news release are prepared under U.S. GAAP, unless noted otherwise.As a result of the combination of GTECH S.p.A. ("GTECH") and International Game Technology ("legacy IGT"), which was completed on April 7, 2015, a number of items affect the comparability of reported results.  Reported financial information for the full year 2016 includes the results of operations of IGT PLC for the entire period, while reported financial information for the full year 2015 period includes IGT PLC for the second, third, and fourth quarters and only GTECH operations in the first quarter. Pro forma figures represent the combined results of both companies.Adjusted figures exclude the impact of items such as purchase accounting, impairment charges, restructuring expense, foreign exchange, and certain one-time, primarily transaction-related items. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures are included in the tables in this news release.Reported 2016 results were impacted by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar compared to the euro; the daily average Euro to U.S. dollar foreign exchange rate was 1.08 in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to 1.10 in the fourth quarter of 2015, and was 1.11 for the full year 2016 period compared to 1.11 in 2015. Constant currency changes for 2016 are calculated using the same foreign exchange rates as the corresponding 2015 period.Management believes that referring to certain pro forma, constant currency, or adjusted measures is a more useful way to evaluate the Company's underlying performance.Overview of Consolidated Fourth Quarter ResultsConsolidated revenue declined 3% to $1,321 million from $1,365 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, which included approximately $20 million of revenue benefits related to the catch-up reclassification of Stability Law taxes on gaming machines in Italy. Lower revenue reflects global lottery growth that was more than offset by lower gaming service revenue, mostly at DoubleDown.Read MoreGlobal lottery same-store revenue, excluding Italy, increased 2% during the fourth quarter while Italy lottery wagers increased 4%. Product sales rose 1% in the quarter on higher North America systems sales and the contribution from a recent intellectual property settlement. The Company shipped 10,320 gaming machines worldwide during the fourth quarter.Adjusted EBITDA of $422 million was 6% below the fourth quarter of 2015. Operating income was $138 million compared to $132 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, and adjusted operating income was $281 million compared to $293 million in the prior year. The declines in adjusted EBITDA and adjusted operating income primarily reflect an incremental $14 million of Italy value-added tax ("VAT") credit in the prior-year period, in addition to higher selling, general and administrative expenses.Interest expense was $116 million compared to $119 million in the prior-year period.Net income attributable to IGT was $233 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, reflecting the impact of $196 million in primarily non-cash foreign exchange gains and the favorable settlement of discrete tax items. On an adjusted basis, net income attributable to IGT was $179 million. The Company reported net income per diluted share of $1.15 and earned $0.88 per diluted share on an adjusted basis.Cash from operations was $985 million in the full-year period and capital expenditures were $557 million. The Company made two of three upfront installment payments for the new Lotto concession in Italy during the year. Cash and cash equivalents were $294 million as of December 31, 2016, compared to $627 million as of December 31, 2015. Net debt was $7,569 million as of December 31, 2016.Operating Segment ReviewNorth America Gaming & Interactive    Revenue for the North America Gaming & Interactive segment was $368 million compared to $378 million in the fourth quarter of 2015.Gaming service revenue was $230 million compared to $263 million in the prior-year period, primarily driven by fewer daily active users ("DAU") at DoubleDown and a year-on-year decrease in the installed base.Product sales rose 20% to $138 million in the quarter primarily driven by large systems sales; the contribution from a recent intellectual property settlement; and, as previously communicated, revenue associated with certain gaming machines shipped in the third quarter of 2016. The segment shipped 5,419 units in the period compared to 6,597 units in the fourth quarter of 2015, which included an additional 1,100 Canada video lottery terminals ("VLT").Operating income for North America Gaming & Interactive was $101 million compared to $106 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. The decline is primarily due to lower DoubleDown and gaming service revenue, partially offset by higher product sales.North America Lottery North America Lottery revenue was $284 million, up 6% from the fourth quarter of 2015.Service revenue of $267 million increased 5%. Lottery same-store revenue rose 1.5%, supported by the third consecutive year of strong instant tickets performance. Multi-state Jackpot game performance was modestly below the prior year's level after several quarters of above-average results. Product sales were $17 million, compared to $14 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, primarily due to increased instant ticket printing activity.Operating income for North America Lottery increased 54% to $65 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. Higher revenues, in addition to lower depreciation and amortization expense associated with recent lottery contract extensions, contributed to the substantial profit growth.International  International revenue was $220 million compared to $265 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. On a constant currency basis, International revenue declined 15%.International lottery same-store revenue increased 2.6% on broad-based geographical strength that was tempered by weakness in the United Kingdom. International gaming service revenue rose 6% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to growth in the commercial gaming installed base, and despite approximately 600 units that were converted to product sales. The installed base grew in Eastern Europe, South Africa and Mexico.Product sales were below the prior-year period, mostly on lottery product sales, which reflect the natural variability of that business. Gaming terminal sales declined slightly on lower unit volume. Systems sales increased double-digits year-over-year. The segment shipped a total of 4,901 gaming machines compared to 4,965 last year.International operating income was $44 million compared to $55 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, reflecting lower revenue.Italy Italy revenue was $449 million compared to $455 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. At constant currency, revenue was in line with the prior year. The fourth quarter comparisons are impacted by an approximately $20 million catch-up Stability Law reclassification booked in the prior-year period, in addition to one month of amortization of the new Lotto upfront concession fee.Total Lotto wagers in the quarter were €2,141 million, 15% greater than the €1,855 million achieved in the prior-year period. Strong Lotto performance was a result of significant late number activity and high single-digit growth in 10eLotto. Excluding late numbers, Lotto wagers increased 2% over the same period last year. Instant-ticket wagers were €2,289 million versus €2,391 million in the fourth quarter of 2015.Machine gaming service revenue was down given the prior-year Stability Law reclassification. Sports betting wagers increased 6% on growth in live wagers.  Operating income for the Italy segment was $130 million compared to $132 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. At constant currency, operating income was stable as strong Lotto growth compensated for the VAT credit in the prior year. Overview of Consolidated Full Year 2016 ResultsReported consolidated revenue was $5,154 million compared to $4,689 million in 2015. On a pro forma, constant currency basis, consolidated revenue increased 2%, primarily reflecting growth in lottery service revenue that was partially offset by lower DoubleDown performance and gaming product sales.During the year, the Company shipped 33,147 gaming machines worldwide and global lottery same-store revenue, excluding Italy, increased 8%. Italy lottery wagers rose 6% in 2016.On a reported basis, adjusted EBITDA of $1,755 million was 9% greater than the 2015 level. On a pro forma, constant currency basis, adjusted EBITDA increased 3%.     Reported operating income was $660 million compared to $540 million in 2015. On a pro forma, constant currency basis, adjusted operating income was 9% greater than 2015, primarily reflecting higher lottery service revenue that was partially offset by lower lottery product sales.Interest expense was $469 million compared to $458 million in the prior-year period.Net income attributable to IGT was $211 million in 2016. On an adjusted basis, net income was $472 million. The Company reported earnings per diluted share of $1.05 and earned $2.33 per diluted share on an adjusted basis in 2016.Other DevelopmentsIn a separate news release issued today, the Company announced that Heather J. McGregor was appointed as an independent director to its board of directors.Additionally, the Company's board of directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per ordinary share. The dividend is payable on April 6, 2017 to all shareholders of record as of the close of business on March 23, 2017.OutlookThe Company currently expects to achieve adjusted EBITDA of $1,680-$1,760 million for the full year 2017 period, as operational growth compensates for the Powerball and late numbers benefits recorded in 2016, in addition to new Lotto concession impacts in 2017. Maintenance capital expenditures are expected to be $525-$575 million, including approximately $100 million related to the timing of the new Florida Lottery contract. Growth capital expenditures will be approximately $100 million.The Italy Lotto renewal will require an outlay of approximately $320 million ($195 million net, after minority partner contribution), relating to the final upfront concession payment and associated network and infrastructure upgrades. Net debt is expected to be $7,600-$7,800 million at the end of 2017.The Company's outlook assumes an average euro/dollar exchange rate of 1.10.Conference Call and WebcastToday, at 8:00 a.m. EST / 1:00 p.m. GMT / 2:00 p.m. CET, management will host a conference call to present the fourth quarter and full year 2016 results.
