Ampco-Pittsburgh Announces Election of John S. Stanik as Chief 
      Executive Officer Effective January 1, 2015






December 17, 2014 09:25 AM Eastern Standard Time



PITTSBURGH--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Ampco-Pittsburgh Corporation (NYSE: AP) today announced that the 
      Company’s Board of Directors has elected John S. Stanik, age 61, as 
      Chief Executive Officer and also as a Director, effective January 1, 
      2015. Mr. Stanik will succeed Robert A. Paul as the Company’s Chief 
      Executive Officer upon Mr. Paul’s retirement effective December 31, 
      2014. Mr. Paul will remain on the Company’s Board of Directors and serve 
      as its non-executive Chairman of the Board.
    


      Mr. Paul said, “John Stanik has had a very distinguished career, and his 
      combination of deep executive and operating experience makes him well 
      suited to provide the leadership needed to continue to guide 
      Ampco-Pittsburgh in its focused efforts to create meaningful long-term 
      value for our shareholders. I am very pleased that I will be working 
      with John in my continuing role as Chairman, while having more time to 
      spend with my family and pursue my many other interests."
    

      Mr. Stanik worked at Calgon Carbon Corporation, an international company 
      specializing in purification products, technologies and services, from 
      1991 through 2012 when he retired for personal reasons. He served as 
      President and CEO of Calgon from 2003 to 2012 and became its Chairman of 
      the Board in 2007. Prior to joining Calgon, Mr. Stanik worked in various 
      capacities with increasing responsibility for Davy Corporation, an 
      engineering and construction company specializing in the metals (steel 
      and aluminium) markets, ultimately serving as Davy’s General Manager of 
      Operations.
    

      Mr. Stanik commented, “I am honored to lead Ampco-Pittsburgh and greatly 
      appreciative of the confidence that its Board of Directors has shown in 
      me. I am committed to establishing strong relationships with 
      Ampco-Pittsburgh’s shareholders, business partners and dedicated 
      employees.”
    

      The Board of Directors expressed its appreciation of Mr. Paul’s loyal 
      service and contributions to the Corporation as an officer for fifty 
      years, most recently as Chief Executive Officer since 1994, and for Mr. 
      Paul’s continuing commitment to serve on the Board of Directors as the 
      Company’s Chairman.
    

The matters discussed herein may contain forward-looking statements 
      that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual 
      results to differ materially from expectations. Some of these 
      risks are set forth in the Corporation’s Annual Report on Form 10-K as 
      well as the Corporation’s other reports filed with the Securities and 
      Exchange Commission.
