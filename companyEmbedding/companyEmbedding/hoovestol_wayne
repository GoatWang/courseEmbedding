Hoovestol














Hoovestol Inc
We believe that drivers are our most important asset.










Who We Are


								In 1978, Hoovestol Inc. was formed after three U.S. postal contracts were acquired from Burton Hoovestol. Shortly thereafter Hoovestol Inc. branched off into the refrigerated truckload and LTL businesses. Throughout the 1980's Hoovestol Inc. carried freight, as well as mail, across the country. Toward the end of that decade, the freight side of the business was sold, and Hoovestol again became solely a mail contractor for the Postal service. To this day, hauling mail for the postal service is the cornerstone of Hoovestol Inc.
							

								Although our main office and Maintenance facility is located in Eagan, MN, we also have shops in Nebraska, Kansas, Illinois, and Massachusetts. In addition, we have service trucks located in Seattle, WA, Los Angeles, CA and Jersey City, NJ.  All of our trucks and trailers are maintained at these facilities.
							

								At Hoovestol, we pride ourselves on having some of the best and most loyal drivers in the trucking industry. A typical day for a Hoovestol driver is 10 to 14 hours long. With only an occasional layover run, our drivers are often scheduled out months in advance.   This allows for plenty of quality time with family and friends.
							

								We are currently operating routes that run coast to coast and we hire drivers at designated locations along the way. If you are interested in joining our company please visit the recruiting section of this website.
							


								Thank you and if I can be of assistance to you please feel free to contact me.
							
SincerelyWayne Hoovestol












										$
									


									Hourly Pay
								

									Receive a competitive hourly rate plus health and welfare benefits. We take care of our drivers.
								








									Priorities
								

									We do our best to keep drivers with their families, reduce layovers, and keep our equipment in top condition.
								








									Respect
								

									We treat our drivers fair and we do our best to exceed your expectations. The only hitch is once you work for Hoovestol you won't want to work for anyone else.

Hoovestol














Hoovestol Inc
We believe that drivers are our most important asset.










Who We Are


								In 1978, Hoovestol Inc. was formed after three U.S. postal contracts were acquired from Burton Hoovestol. Shortly thereafter Hoovestol Inc. branched off into the refrigerated truckload and LTL businesses. Throughout the 1980's Hoovestol Inc. carried freight, as well as mail, across the country. Toward the end of that decade, the freight side of the business was sold, and Hoovestol again became solely a mail contractor for the Postal service. To this day, hauling mail for the postal service is the cornerstone of Hoovestol Inc.
							

								Although our main office and Maintenance facility is located in Eagan, MN, we also have shops in Nebraska, Kansas, Illinois, and Massachusetts. In addition, we have service trucks located in Seattle, WA, Los Angeles, CA and Jersey City, NJ.  All of our trucks and trailers are maintained at these facilities.
							

								At Hoovestol, we pride ourselves on having some of the best and most loyal drivers in the trucking industry. A typical day for a Hoovestol driver is 10 to 14 hours long. With only an occasional layover run, our drivers are often scheduled out months in advance.   This allows for plenty of quality time with family and friends.
							

								We are currently operating routes that run coast to coast and we hire drivers at designated locations along the way. If you are interested in joining our company please visit the recruiting section of this website.
							


								Thank you and if I can be of assistance to you please feel free to contact me.
							
SincerelyWayne Hoovestol

We believe that drivers are our most important asset.










Who We Are


								In 1978, Hoovestol Inc. was formed after three U.S. postal contracts were acquired from Burton Hoovestol. Shortly thereafter Hoovestol Inc. branched off into the refrigerated truckload and LTL businesses. Throughout the 1980's Hoovestol Inc. carried freight, as well as mail, across the country. Toward the end of that decade, the freight side of the business was sold, and Hoovestol again became solely a mail contractor for the Postal service. To this day, hauling mail for the postal service is the cornerstone of Hoovestol Inc.
							

								Although our main office and Maintenance facility is located in Eagan, MN, we also have shops in Nebraska, Kansas, Illinois, and Massachusetts. In addition, we have service trucks located in Seattle, WA, Los Angeles, CA and Jersey City, NJ.  All of our trucks and trailers are maintained at these facilities.
							

								At Hoovestol, we pride ourselves on having some of the best and most loyal drivers in the trucking industry. A typical day for a Hoovestol driver is 10 to 14 hours long. With only an occasional layover run, our drivers are often scheduled out months in advance.   This allows for plenty of quality time with family and friends.
							

								We are currently operating routes that run coast to coast and we hire drivers at designated locations along the way. If you are interested in joining our company please visit the recruiting section of this website.
							


								Thank you and if I can be of assistance to you please feel free to contact me.
							
SincerelyWayne Hoovestol
