HOME  "Company surviving the ‘coaldrums’ by gasifying coal"~ Latest Article posted on June 3, 2015       Second, we are determined to help our nation alleviate thepressing air pollution and global warming problems our country faces. The clean-burning syngas we are now producing will do exactly that, and together with the clean burning syngas we will produce as a result of the Underground Coal Gasification-Carbon Capture and Storage process we have announced and for which  we have broken ground, we plan  to be producing 100,000 cubic meters of coking syn gas per hour and 180,000 cu meters of UCG produced syngas by the end of the 2015.   Thus we will make a significant contribution to the country’s well-being.Click here to see CEO's speech at UCG groundbreaking  ceremony.  技术泓利   节约泓利   服务泓利  NASDAQ:CETC          LinksHONGLI CLEAN ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES CORP.

LVIn April of this year, after years of research and trials, we at Hongli made the historic and important decision to take advantage of our vast coal resources, our knowledge and expertise in producing high end coking products for steel manufacturers on the one hand and our close relationship with the North China Institute on the other hand, and the needs of China, to focus our energies on creating clean synthetic gas, syngas, in the coking process and also on producing syngas by processing our coal resources deep in the ground. We are committed to President Xi’s stated goal, which is to replace coal with cleaner energy sources. We will strive to become one of China’s leading producers of clean energy products- products capable of generating new streams of high-margin revenue for our Company.    HONGLI CLEAN ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES CORP., a Florida corporation, is a vertically-integrated coal and coke processor that historically has used coal from both its own mines and that of third-party mines to produce basic and value-added coal products for steel manufacturers, power generators, and various industrial users. Most recently, Hongli has begun to produce synthetic gas during the coking process and will in 2015 begin producing syngas through its announced UCG (underground coal gasification) and CCS (carbon capture and storage).  The company also expects to begin producing Compressed Natural Gas ("CNG") in its coking gas facility in 2015.  Thus, Hongli is making the transition from an "old" energy company to a "new", green energy company through science and technology.

PINGDINGSHAN, China, Oct. 26, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Hongli Clean Energy Technologies Corp. (NASDAQ:    CETC) (the "Company"), today announced that a reverse stock split of its shares of common stock at a ratio of 1-for-10 shares (the "Reverse Split") will be effective when the market opens on October 27, 2016. At the market open on Thursday, October 27, 2016, the Company's common stock will begin trading on a split-adjusted basis, under the same trading symbol, CETC.








As a result of the Reverse Split, each 10 pre-split shares of common stock outstanding will automatically combine into one new share of common stock without any action on the part of the holders. The Reverse Split will also apply to common stock issuable upon the exercise of the Company's outstanding warrants and stock options.
As a result of the reverse stock split, the Company's issued and outstanding shares of common stock will decrease to approximately 2,396,452 shares, post-split, from approximately 23,960,217 shares, pre-split. No fractional shares will be issued as a result of the Reverse Split. Fractional shares outstanding after the reverse stock split will be rounded up. When effectuating the Reverse Split, the authorized number of shares of Company's common stock will change from 100,000,000 to 10,000,000 shares. As a result, the proportion of shares owned by Company's stockholders relative to the number of shares authorized for issuance will not change. 
The Reverse Split was approved by the Company's Board of Directors on September 15, 2016, in part, to enable the Company to regain and maintain compliance with the minimum closing bid price of $1.00 per share for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market. 
Jianhua Lv, Company's Chief Executive Officer, said, "With this reverse stock split, we expect to satisfy Nasdaq's minimum bid price requirement and to maintain compliance with that requirement as we move forward with the development of our business. We are highly confident about the long-term prospects of our Company as we continually devote our efforts to make Hongli Clean Energy Technologies Corp. a premier provider of clean energy in China."
Additional information about the reverse stock split can be found in the Company's definitive information statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 27, 2016, a copy of which is available at www.sec.gov.

Hongli Clean Energy Technologies Corp. Reports Fiscal Year 2016 Q2 Financial Results
Gross margin improves by 19.49 points to 40.69% compared to the same period last year



















February 16, 2016 16:51 ET

 | Source: Hongli Clean Energy Technologies Corp.






PINGDINGSHAN, China, Feb.  16, 2016  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Hongli Clean Energy Technologies Corp. (NASDAQ:CETC) (“Hongli” or the “Company”), a vertically integrated producer of clean energy products located in Henan Province, China, today reported its second quarter financial results for fiscal year 2016, which ended December 31, 2015. Second Quarter Financial Highlights: Revenue of syngas was $4,520,206 for the quarter ended December 31, 2015 with sales volume of 46,832,764 cubic meters and an average selling price per cubic meter of $0.1, which revenue accounted for 84% of our total revenue, highlighting the company’s transformation from a coke and coal producer to clean energy producer.Net loss for the quarter ended December 31, 2015 was $48,689,412, or ($2.03) per diluted share, compared to net profit of $3,981,858, or $0.17 per diluted share, for the same period of fiscal year 2015.Gross profit decreased by $505,194, or 18.80%, to $2,182,656 but gross margin improved by 19.49 points to 40.69% for the quarter ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in gross profit (18.80%) was mainly due to the decline in sales of coal and coke despite the higher gross profit contributed from sales of syngas.Cost of revenues decreased by 68.15%, from $9,989,469 to $3,181,705 compared to the same period last year. The decrease was mainly driven by lower sales volumes for coal and coke products and the low cost of revenue from syngas. Revenue decreased by $7,312,958 or 57.69% to $5,364,361 for the three months ended December 31, 2015. Such decrease resulted from decreases in sales of coal and coke products to steel plants, offset by increased sales of our new product, syngas. The average price of syngas was approximately $0.10 or RMB 0.62 per cubic meter. The Company has long-term syngas supply agreements with customers to provide syngas at a fixed vending price of $0.10 or RMB 0.62 per cubic meter. In some cases, syngas may be sold with periodic price adjustments. Due to the control of coal consumption by the Chinese government, the use of syngas is encouraged and its price is currently lower than natural gas. The vending price of syngas is stable and we expect the price to increase. On November 24, 2015, the Company announced that it has discontinued its coking business by terminating its coke producing agreement with Pingdingshan Hongfengxuanmei Coking and Chemical Company. The Company’s coke inventory will be used for producing syngas. Company management expects coke demand will continue to slide due to the current weak economic position of the steel industry in China. In the meantime, CETC will be more focused on developing, manufacturing and commercializing its clean energy products by leveraging its existing technologies and infrastructure. In order to reorganize its capital structure and effect the company’s long-term strategic goal of transforming from a coke and coal producer to clean energy producer, CETC entered into a Credits and Debts Transfer Agreement with an unrelated third party, Wuhan Guangyao New Energy Automobile Operation Co., Ltd. (“Guangyao”) on January 10, 2016. CETC agreed to make a transfer to Guangyao with a lump sum of credit assets of RMB 254,160,210.59 and outstanding debts of RMB 274,167,269.37. The 20,007,058.78 difference will be paid by CETC within 6 months of the effective date of the agreement, and a 4.5% interest rate will be applied if not paid on time. In connection with the Credits and Debts Transfer Agreement, CETC has also signed an Assets Transfer Agreement with Guangyao to transfer 900,000 tons of Coking Asset in Construction for RMB 45,692,140. Guangyao will make the payment within 6 months of the effective date with a 4.5% interest if not paid on time.  The Company’s CEO, Mr. Jianhua Lv, said “The past quarter is a truly revolutionary quarter for CETC as we made an important strategic decision to fully discontinue our low margin coal and coking business. Now 84% of our revenue comes from our flagship product—syngas—with overall gross profit achieving 40.69%. Though the macroeconomic conditions in China remain challenging, we believe our strategy of focusing on developing clean energy products with our robust innovation capabilities will bring unprecedented growth to the Company in near future.” About Hongli Clean Energy Technologies Corp.

Hongli Clean Energy Technologies Corp. Plans to Lease Syngas Production Facility From Leading SOE




















August 12, 2015 07:30 ET

 | Source: Hongli Clean Energy Technologies Corp.





PINGDINGSHAN, China, Aug. 12, 2015 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Hongli Clean Energy Technologies Corp. (NASDAQ:CETC) ("Hongli" or the "Company"), a vertically integrated producer of clean energy products located in Henan Province, today announced that it has agreed in principle to lease a facility for syngas production (the "Facility") for 10 years for an annual payment of RMB10.1 million (approximately US$1.6 million) from Zhengzhou Coal Industry (Group) Co., Ltd. ("ZMJT"), a large-scale state-owned coal and electric energy company. The Company intends to use cash generated from operations and/or bank loans to meet the lease payment requirement. The Company is also in early discussions with ZMJT for potential joint venture arrangements in the future that would allow the Company to further integrate along the "coal – coking – syngas production – chemical industry" value chain.

	Located in Linying County, Henan Province, the Facility is currently owned and operated by Yingqing Chemical Industry Co., Ltd., a subsidiary of ZMJT, and is expected to provide the Company with additional production capacity of: 1) 100,000 cubic meters per hour (m3/h) of syngas; 2) 12,000 m3/h of hydrogen; 3) 16,000 metric tons per year (MT/y) of carbon dioxide; 4) 12,000 MT/y of ammonium bicarbonate; 5) 100,000 MT/y of methanol; 6) 180,000 MT/y of ammonia; and 7) 24,000 MT/y of formaldehyde, as well as 8) 12,000 kwh of electricity generated from waste heat.

	Mr. Jianhua Lv, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Hongli, commented, "We are thrilled to have the opportunity to cooperate and collaborate with a leading state owned enterprise of ZMJT's scale and caliber. We view this as just the beginning of a mutually beneficial relationship between the two parties, and we expect broader cooperation between two parties, such as the formation of a potential joint venture to explore a domestic exchange listing. We believe this cooperation will help our efforts to transform Hongli from a traditional coal and coke company into a leader in the gasification and clean energy industry."

	Mr. Lv continued, "The Facility, located just approximately 78 kilometers from the Company's coking facility, will also allow us to consume up to 75% of our coke output internally, significantly reducing the margin squeeze on our coke products by steel manufacturers who have been struggling due to industry-wide supply-demand imbalance and plunging steel prices in recent years. The expansion plans for our syngas facilities in Shilong District, Pingdingshan City have been delayed because the current gas pipeline network extends only 10 kilometers from our existing syngas facilities. The Yingqing Facility, with its ability to liquefy and compress syngas for ease of storage and transportation, will allow us to break this geographical barrier, paving the way for a replicable business model for future growth."

	The Company and ZMJT are currently negotiating the definitive agreement for the lease, and the Company makes no promises on whether and when such a definitive agreement will be reached. Moreover, the project will be under the supervision of the local Linying County government, and require satisfaction of customary closing conditions. The Company will provide timely updates on progress.
