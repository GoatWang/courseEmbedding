EquiPower Resources Corp.

In May 2010 Energy Capital formed EquiPower, a power generation company that owned and operated a portfolio of fossil power generation facilities in the eastern United States. In April 2015, Energy Capital closed on the sale of EquiPower to Dynegy Inc.

ADA Carbon Solutions, LLC

In October 2008, Energy Capital announced the formation of ADA Carbon Solutions (“ACS”) to develop and construct an activated carbon (“AC”) production facility in Coushatta, Louisiana.


Environmental Infrastructure


Current








ACS was formed in anticipation of federal and state regulations requiring mercury removal from coal-fired power plant emissions. ACS designed and built what Energy Capital believes is the largest, most automated and most environmentally friendly AC manufacturing plant in North America focused on mitigating mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants. The facility, which is called Red River, was completed in 2010, can produce 150 million pounds per year of AC and has begun shipping product to utility customers. In addition, ACS developed its own dedicated source of raw material, the Five Forks Mine, located in close proximity to the Red River plant.
 
In December 2011, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) released its final Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (“MATS”), which set stringent new federal limits on hazardous emissions from the nation’s coal and oil-fired power plants. After a few delays, the rule went into full effect for all U.S. coal plants in April 2016.
 
For more information about ADA Carbon Solutions, please visit the company’s website at www.ADA-CS.com.






























Cardinal Gas Storage Partners, LLC

In May 2008, Energy Capital Partners and Redbird Gas Storage LLC formed Cardinal Gas Storage Partners LLC, focusing on the development, construction, operation and management of natural gas storage facilities in North America. In August 2014, Energy Capital sold its interest in Cardinal to Martin Midstream.


Midstream Oil & Gas


Realized








Cardinal’s portfolio of salt cavern and depleted reservoir gas storage development projects included:
 



Arcadia
An operating salt cavern natural gas storage facility in Bienville Parish, LA.


Cadeville
An operating depleted reservoir facility in Ouachita Parish, LA.


Perryville
An operating salt cavern facility in Franklin Parish, LA.


Monroe
An operating depleted reservoir facility in Monroe County, MS; the facility was acquired by Cardinal in May 2011.

































CE2 Carbon Capital, LLC

CE2 Carbon Capital was formed to invest in carbon offsets and other assets focused on reducing greenhouse gas emissions in North America.

STEAG SCR-Tech

In August 2011, Energy Capital acquired CoaLogix, the established leader in selective catalytic reduction (“SCR”) management services and catalyst regeneration technologies used by coal-fired power plants to reduce nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions. In January 2016, CoaLogix merged with competitor STEAG Energy Services, forming STEAG SCR-Tech. 


Environmental Infrastructure


Current








STEAG SCR-Tech provides innovative, cost-effective solutions that help utility customers achieve and maintain compliance with increasingly stringent environmental regulations. SCR is the leading control technology for reducing NOx emissions from coal-fired power plants worldwide. Within an SCR system, power plant flue gas reacts with a catalyst enabling a chemical reaction to transform NOx emissions into environmentally friendly, nitrogen and water vapor. Over time, catalysts in the SCR system must be replaced or regenerated to maintain effective NOx reduction. Through its proprietary processes, STEAG SCR-Tech regenerates deactivated catalysts at a substantial discount relative to the replacement cost of catalysts, while also eliminating the need for catalyst disposal and catalyst inventory storage. With operations in China and a large European customer base, STEAG SCR-Tech provides a vital global service for reducing coal plant emissions.For more information about STEAG SCR-Tech, visit the company’s website at www.steagscrtech.com/us-home.
