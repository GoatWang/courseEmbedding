The Product  HomeIron DeficiencyAbout UsTechnologyThe ProductOur TeamUseful LinksContact Us    The Gut MicrobiomeThe gastrointestinal system contains a natural and widely varied microbial ecosystem, called the gut microbiome.  Diet, exercise, disease, and many other factors affect the gut microbiome that can alter the balance of good and bad bacteria.  Good gastrointestinal health is achieved by facilitating the growth of good bacteria while keeping bad bacterial growth in check.   Elemental Iron supplements, such as Ferrous Sulfate, cause a shift in the gut microbiome causing bad bacteria to flourish and preventing good bacterial persistence.BioFe has been engineered in order to protect the balance of the gut microbiome, providing a natural biologic form of iron as a Ferritin:Iron complex much like mothers milk for an infant.      The Product    BioFe™ is the first medical food product from the Siderosorb™ platform; Bakers yeast expressing the human H-Ferritin gene, FTH1. The H-Ferritin protein/iron complex is an indispensable mammalian iron absorption, transport, and storage system that is delivered directly to the bloodstream from the intestine in the non-toxic, Fe+3, state. An illustrative example of the natural biology of the Ferritin/Iron complex is its presence in human breast milk, providing nursing infants the readily adsorbed iron required for rapid learning and development. BioFe™ provides stable, high level expression of the Ferritin protein that is complexed with iron during growth.  BioFe™ is pasturized and dried allowing its incorporation into a variety of formats for consumption.  Alone, BioFe™ is pleasant tasting with a sweet, nutty flavor. We have demonstrated that BioFe™ is effective in two animal models of iron deficiency anemia (IDA). First, in a rat model of IDA, BioFe™ was found to be significantly more effective than the current standard-of-care, ferrous sulfate (FeSO4), at correcting serum iron and hemoglobin levels. Second, spontaneously anemic infant monkeys achieved normal serum iron and hemoglobin levels with just two weeks of BioFe™ treatment.  Spontaneously iron deficient monkeys is a very good model of human iron deficiency. These primate experiments will continue with an ongoing $2.5M grant from the National Institutes of Health (NIH).Sidero is currently launching two clinical trials of BioFe™ for the management of iron deficiency.We are currently preparing several scientific publications to present many additional novel and exciting findings.

HERSHEY, Pa.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Sidero 
      Bioscience, a specialty biotechnology company advancing disruptive 
      technologies targeting human digestive health, has been awarded a grant 
      by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, 
      part of the US National Institutes of Health (NIH). The $225,000 Phase I 
      STTR grant, in collaboration with the Pennsylvania State University, 
      will support a clinical trial of BioFe in people with iron deficiency.
    
“The committee appreciated the 
      profound potential impact of the proposed work, considered 
      ‘game-changing’, on the treatment of anemia in children.”

      "We are delighted to be selected by the NIH to support the clinical 
      development goals for our first product candidate, BioFeTM 
      medical food for the management of iron deficiency," says Darren Wolfe, 
      President & CEO of Sidero. "Securing this new dedicated funding source 
      allows Sidero to advance human clinical testing and accelerate BioFe 
      development."
    

      The NIH commented on BioFe, stating, "The committee appreciated the 
      profound potential impact of the proposed work, considered 
      ‘game-changing’, on the treatment of anemia in children."
    

      The World Health Organization claims, "Iron deficiency is the most 
      common and widespread nutritional disorder in the world. The numbers are 
      staggering: 2 billion people – over 30% of the world’s population...". 
      The most common symptom of iron deficiency is Iron Deficiency Anemia 
      (IDA). IDA impedes motor and mental development in children leading to 
      lifelong cognitive deficiencies and causes fatigue, reduced work 
      capacity, and reduced quality of life in adults. Iron deficiency without 
      anemia is also linked to restless leg syndrome (RLS), hearing deficits, 
      reduced athletic performance, and heart failure morbidity among others.
    

      While oral iron supplements can be both effective and inexpensive, they 
      suffer from substantial gastrointestinal side effects reducing 
      compliance by up to 50%. Alternatively, intravenous iron can also be 
      effective for iron supplementation but requires frequent transfusions 
      and is expensive leading to both patient and payor dissatisfaction. The 
      market for IV-Iron alone is expected to reach $1.8 Billion by 2020.
    

      James Connor, Chairman of the Board of Sidero and co-inventor of the 
      SiderosorbTM Medical Food technology platform, states, "The 
      dedicated mission of Sidero is to provide a safe, effective, and 
      economical remedy for iron deficiency for all peoples of the world."
    

      Sidero is advancing the patented SiderosorbTM Medical Food 
      technology platform utilizing nutritional Baker’s yeast, Saccharomyces 
      cerevisiae, to provide therapeutic proteins/complexes as food for 
      consumption to improve human health. Medical foods have a simplified and 
      streamlined regulatory pathway allowing rapid and low-cost development, 
      significantly accelerating market access. BioFe is nutritional yeast 
      expressing high levels of the Ferritin protein, FTH1, that is a natural 
      iron transport and storage protein normally produced at low levels by 
      almost all living organisms. An illustrative example of the natural 
      biology of the Ferritin/Iron complex is its presence in human breast 
      milk, providing nursing infants the readily adsorbed iron required for 
      rapid learning and development without gastrointestinal upset.

      profound potential impact of the proposed work, considered 
      ‘game-changing’, on the treatment of anemia in children."
    

      The World Health Organization claims, "Iron deficiency is the most 
      common and widespread nutritional disorder in the world. The numbers are 
      staggering: 2 billion people – over 30% of the world’s population...". 
      The most common symptom of iron deficiency is Iron Deficiency Anemia 
      (IDA). IDA impedes motor and mental development in children leading to 
      lifelong cognitive deficiencies and causes fatigue, reduced work 
      capacity, and reduced quality of life in adults. Iron deficiency without 
      anemia is also linked to restless leg syndrome (RLS), hearing deficits, 
      reduced athletic performance, and heart failure morbidity among others.
    

      While oral iron supplements can be both effective and inexpensive, they 
      suffer from substantial gastrointestinal side effects reducing 
      compliance by up to 50%. Alternatively, intravenous iron can also be 
      effective for iron supplementation but requires frequent transfusions 
      and is expensive leading to both patient and payor dissatisfaction. The 
      market for IV-Iron alone is expected to reach $1.8 Billion by 2020.
    

      James Connor, Chairman of the Board of Sidero and co-inventor of the 
      SiderosorbTM Medical Food technology platform, states, "The 
      dedicated mission of Sidero is to provide a safe, effective, and 
      economical remedy for iron deficiency for all peoples of the world."
    

      Sidero is advancing the patented SiderosorbTM Medical Food 
      technology platform utilizing nutritional Baker’s yeast, Saccharomyces 
      cerevisiae, to provide therapeutic proteins/complexes as food for 
      consumption to improve human health. Medical foods have a simplified and 
      streamlined regulatory pathway allowing rapid and low-cost development, 
      significantly accelerating market access. BioFe is nutritional yeast 
      expressing high levels of the Ferritin protein, FTH1, that is a natural 
      iron transport and storage protein normally produced at low levels by 
      almost all living organisms. An illustrative example of the natural 
      biology of the Ferritin/Iron complex is its presence in human breast 
      milk, providing nursing infants the readily adsorbed iron required for 
      rapid learning and development without gastrointestinal upset.

Sidero 
      Bioscience, a specialty biotechnology company advancing disruptive 
      technologies targeting human digestive health, has been awarded a grant 
      by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, 
      part of the US National Institutes of Health (NIH). The $225,000 Phase I 
      STTR grant, in collaboration with the Pennsylvania State University, 
      will support a clinical trial of BioFe in people with iron deficiency.
    

      "We are delighted to be selected by the NIH to support the clinical 
      development goals for our first product candidate, BioFeTM 
      medical food for the management of iron deficiency," says Darren Wolfe, 
      President & CEO of Sidero. "Securing this new dedicated funding source 
      allows Sidero to advance human clinical testing and accelerate BioFe 
      development."
    

      The NIH commented on BioFe, stating, "The committee appreciated the
