Hodorek and Matthew J. Purdy.  The two industry veterans have worked together for the past decade at Tornier, who later merged with Wright Medical.  During their time together they developed a best in class shoulder and elbow arthroplasty portfolio comprised of first-to-market, break-through products that have shaped the competitive landscape in these segments. Purdy noted, "Brian's extensive R&D and Clinical experience is very complimentary to my Marketing and Sales experience.  We have a clearly defined and shared view on how we approach clinical problems with our surgeon partners that we believe will serve us well in our pursuit to fuel motion.""Ignite was established to fulfill a distinct purpose.  We focus on the reason we do what we do and that establishes a differentiated perspective for the products we develop. This is reflected in our purpose statement: Ignite exists to create a community for inspired people to make a difference," Hodorek remarked.  In addition to Hodorek and Purdy, Ignite has recently appointed two tenured industry executives to its Board of Directors.  Terry D. Schlotterback has been appointed as Chairman of the Board of Directors.  Schlotterback previously served as President of Zimmer Spine and subsequently as the President of Zimmer Trauma.  He currently serves as Executive Chairman for OrthoPediatrics Corp. and Chairman of the Board for Nextremity Solutions Inc.  Schlotterback commented, "I am very pleased to be working with Ignite and these innovative young men.  They bring a unique experience and enthusiasm to the venture and I am looking forward to their success."Ignite has also appointed seasoned entrepreneur, Rod K. Mayer to the Board of Directors.  Rod has extensive experience in sales, distribution and business development.  He co-founded DVO Extremity Solutions, LLC. and Del Palma Orthopedics.  Rod currently serves as the President and CEO of Nextremity Solutions where he pioneered a novel micro-commercialization strategy leading to an exclusive distribution agreement with Zimmer Biomet."I am thrilled and honored to be co-laboring with these talented and energized individuals. Their goal of becoming a surgeon-driven musculoskeletal product development company is totally in line with what we are seeing evolve in the marketplace. The opportunity for Ignite Orthopedics is great and I truly see that they will quickly become a game-changer in this space," said Mayer.To learn more about the Ignite Orthopedics' story, the team or how to engage and connect, visit www.igniteorthopedics.com.About Ignite Orthopedics, LLC.Ignite Orthopedics, LLC.

What is the treatment for trigger finger? - Del Palma Orthopedics

What is the treatment for trigger finger?
The goal of treatment is to eliminate the catching or locking and allow full movement of the finger without discomfort. This may be accomplished by non-surgical interventions such as:

wearing a splint
reducing activities that cause pain
oral steroids
steroid injection into the area around the tendon and pulley to reduce the inflammation

If non-surgical forms of treatment do not relieve the symptoms, surgery may be recommended. The goal of surgery is to widen the opening of the tunnel so the tendon can glide through it more easily, and can be performed as an outpatient in most cases. 
Anesthesia can be: Local, Regional (arm block) or General.
Various surgical techniques involving scissors, needles, and endoscopes all have the common approach designed to release the first annular pulley and allow full unrestricted use of the finger.
 
 
 




Advansor TF™ - Advanced Surgical Tool
Newer devices such as the Advansor TF enable the surgeon to safely and effectively perform the procedure without the trauma of a scalpel. The process is "percutaneous," i.e. accomplished by inserting a needle into the skin.
The doctor will often do the procedure in his/her office or outpatient setting with minimal soft tissue trauma, often requiring no stitches.
If the surgeon and patient elect to perform the procedure in the office, this leads to lower cost for the patient, less time involved in treatment and no return office visit for suture removal.
Following the procedure, the hand is wrapped in a bulky, compressive dressing to aid in swelling reduction and minimize bleeding.

What is the rehabilitation following percutaneous surgery?
Movement of the fingers should begin immediately after surgery. Normal use of the hand can usually be resumed when comfort permits.
The patient will experience pain, discomfort and swelling about the area of the surgery for the first 24 — 48 hours. The dressing should remain on until 48 hours after surgery.
The hand should be kept dry until a scab forms over the incision area, then it can be treated normally.
The middle joint of the finger may have occasional soreness for several months following the procedure.
 
 
 




What are the possible complications of a trigger finger release?
Trigger finger release surgery is very safe and effective; however, there are possible complications.
The trigger finger could return if there is an incomplete release of the tendon sheath.
As with any surgery, infection could occur.
Other possible complications include stiffness of the finger, damage to the tendon or nerves and development of scar tissue.

What is Trigger Finger?
Trigger finger (medically known as stenosing tenosynovitis) is a painful condition of the tendon and pulley system of the hand. Triggering can cause a finger to catch or lock in either a bent or extended position. When a triggering finger is forcibly flexed or extended a “snap” is sometimes felt. This condition is best explained by understanding the anatomy of the hand.
