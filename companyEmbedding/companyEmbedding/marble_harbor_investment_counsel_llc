                	Our Firm
                
Since the early 1990s the investment management field has grown in size. It has also grown in complexity, and in many instances has placed its own goals ahead of the goals of its clients. As an independent, employee-owned company, Marble Harbor is able to dedicate itself exclusively to its mission of offering a customized solution for each client based on our proprietary research, without the hindrance of competing interests so often found at larger organizations.
Our team of experienced professionals, which shares nearly 20 years of working together, was formed with the defining purpose of focusing squarely on those we serve - individuals, families, endowments and foundations. We tailor each portfolio to meet the client's unique needs, objectives and risk tolerance. Our interests are aligned with those of our clients, many of whom we have worked with for as long as 25 years.
At Marble Harbor, we believe that no one should come between you and your investment decision maker. To that end, each client has a close relationship with the professional who tailors his or her individual portfolio investment plan. Additionally, each investment counselor plays an active role in analyzing and selecting securities for clients' portfolios.



                    Investment Philosophy
                


                        	We are long-term investors and manage core portfolios of equities and fixed income.
                        

                        	Investments in client portfolios are chosen through a rigorous process that focuses on the underlying strengths of the companies.
                        

                        	We invest in businesses rather than speculate in stocks. Our goal is to identify companies that we believe have superior long-term growth potential and purchase them at reasonable valuations.
                        
 
                        	Our disciplined approach helps to avoid the fads and extremes in valuation that so often lead to the permanent loss of capital.

					Q1				

					2017				


				           		"Have you ever noticed how quickly home renovations get completed on HGTV?  Jonathan and Drew promise entire gut jobs in 5 to 7 weeks.  Not a word is ever said about pulling a building permit, and walls are knocked down without the slightest concern for whether they are load bearing.  Carpenters, plumbers, plasterers, installers, painters and countless other trades people coordinate their schedules like a perfectly choreographed ballet.  Anyone who's actually undergone a major renovation knows all too well that these small screen wonders bear little resemblance to the true life experience.  Alas, as on TV, the chasm between campaign rhetoric and the realities of governing are vast.   ..."

					Q4				

					2016				


				           		"In The Iliad, Calchas was a seer who divined the future by interpreting the flights of birds. His soothsaying acumen, a gift from Apollo, played a vital role in getting those Greek ships to Troy. Nowadays, Calchas would be an economist. Instead of pondering avian migratory patterns, he would be analyzing economic data and global events. No doubt he’d still be making predictions, and, like Calchas, he would have a wide and hungry audience. After 5,000 years, we haven’t changed much. Uncertainty still makes us wring our hands with angst, and to calm our frayed nerves, we turn to the Oracle of CNBC and the like, hoping that Apollo will guide our ship to port. Regrettably, forecasts by our modern-day prognosticators are not as reliable as those of their mythological counterparts. Contrary to many pundits’ predictions, 2017 is unlikely to be either the best or the worst year in history. No one predicted the highly surprising geopolitical events of 2016 and the one thing we can bet on is that they will be just as far off the mark about 2017. We don’t have the foresight of the gods, so we focus on buying quality businesses at attractive valuations. To us, this is the true wisdom of the seers.  ..."

					Q3				

					2016				


				           		"Looking at the current economic environment, it’s easy to feel a bit disoriented, as if we’ve stepped through the looking glass and found ourselves, like Alice, in a world where down is up and backward is forward. In Europe and Japan, $11 trillion of sovereign debt and even some corporate debt has a negative yield, subverting the traditional relationship between lender and borrower, with investors paying bond issuers for the privilege of using their money. Likewise, the conventional logic concerning the role fixed income and equities play in a portfolio is also turned on its head. Customarily, one would look to the fixed income portion of the portfolio to provide stability and income. If more income were the goal, then you could allocate more to bonds. But in today’s Jabberwockian setting, if we sell equities and buy bonds, chances are income will actually decrease. To successfully invest in the Red Queen’s world, we must accept our new surroundings and adapt accordingly..."

					2016				


				           		"On Sunday June 20, we were lucky enough to watch LeBron James and Steph Curry, two of the best basketball players in history, battle in Game 7 of the NBA Championship title. The advantage oscillated from Golden State to Cleveland and back again. The score was close all the way through to the end, so much so that no one could predict the outcome with certainty. Less than a week later, we watched in disbelief as the UK voted to leave the European Union. This competition, too, had wild swings with “Leave” ahead, and then the tragic death of Jo Cox pushing “Remain” into the lead. Even as the polls were closing, the vote was too close to call. There is a word for guessing about sports events. Gambling. But so often when people talk about geopolitical events, they justify trading around those events by calling it investing. Let’s be clear: No one knew what the result of the Brexit vote would be any more than they knew who would prevail in Game 7, and consequently trades based on the vote’s outcome were outright gambling..."

        Our Services
    
No two clients are the same. Understanding you, your financial goals, return objectives and risk tolerance is vital to an investment counseling relationship. We begin with an in-depth discussion of how your investments fit into your overall financial picture. From this conversation, your investment counselor develops an asset allocation framework, which he or she then implements with a combination of common stocks, fixed income and alternative assets, as appropriate. The investment counselor you work with is the professional who makes the investment decisions in your portfolio.
Regular communication between investment counselor and client is a crucial part of the management process. Our clients receive a personal letter every quarter from their investment counselor reviewing the current investment environment, any recent changes in their specific portfolio along with updates on companies they own.
At Marble Harbor we have chosen to focus exclusively on managing your investment portfolio. This allows us to concentrate on the most critical aspect of your financial picture. We work in concert with your other specialized professionals such as tax accountants, attorneys and estate planners to coordinate your personal financial picture.
While we manage your portfolio, your assets are held for safekeeping by an independent, qualified custodian, such as a bank, trust company or brokerage firm.

Marble Harbor Investment Counsel - Philosophy

        Investment Philosophy
    

    	Equity
    
We make long-term investments in strong businesses within attractive industries. These enterprises must have sustainable competitive advantages, consistent patterns of growth, strong profit and cash flow characteristics, solid balance sheets and proven management teams.
We find these companies through a process of extensive primary research. This entails regular meetings with numerous company managements that lead to a thorough understanding of the underlying businesses within each enterprise. Valuation also plays an important role in our analysis, since paying too much for even a great company can lead to a poor investment.
Company fundamentals and valuations drive portfolio construction and sector weightings. We do not chase constantly fluctuating macro or economic opinions. Portfolios are composed of attractively valued companies that demonstrate the ability to grow earnings and cash flow at above average rates. Over long periods of time, earnings growth drives stock prices and dividends. Our focus is on the long term because the direction of stock prices in the short term is unknowable.
To control risk, our portfolios are diversified across economic sectors and stay fully invested. In our opinion, market timing is a fool's errand.
Our extensive research generally allows us to hold companies for an extended period of time. This low turnover is a natural element of our investment work, and it is particularly appropriate for taxable accounts.

    	Fixed Income
    
Client assets are invested in bonds with an eye toward capital preservation and a steady stream of income. The core portion of a client's fixed income portfolio is not an appropriate place to take significant risk. We implement a conservative, common sense approach to fixed income investing by building a laddered, medium term, high quality portfolio. This strategy seeks to minimize credit and reinvestment rate risk for our clients.
Our approach to fixed income analysis is similar to the one we employ with equities. We concentrate on the health and sustainability of the underlying government entity or company rather than relying on rating agencies or credit insurance. Because we intend to hold the bonds until maturity, quality is important.

    	Alternative Assets
    
Alternative assets can offer greater potential for investment returns as well as diversification where appropriate for eligible clients. We have developed a platform through which we can offer our clients access to a carefully selected group of private equity, venture capital, high yield, real estate and commodity funds. We perform extensive due diligence and look for managers who carry the same high standards as we do in our public company investments.
We allocate capital to these asset classes only when we feel the valuations are particularly compelling; diversification for its own sake can be detrimental. As well, we are sensitive to the illiquidity of many of these sorts of investments and, so, are more demanding of those we select. Further, we limit our investments to funds that charge a fee we believe to be reasonable.

Ruminations

H. Bradlee Perry, former chairman of David L. Babson & Company and a member of Marble Harbor's Advisory Board writes Ruminations, a regular commentary containing his thoughts on investing and the business environment.  An acclaimed writer and speaker, with a perspective honed by more than 50 years as a professional investor, Brad offers keen, independent insights into the challenges and opportunities we face in today's markets.


May 2015A New, and More Uncertain, Investment EnvironmentOften in our investment lives, new developments creep up on us unexpectedly. Many take a long time to emerge, and others come more quickly – as has happened since the recent financial crash. Today we can see some very important new factors in the equation which make it clear that we are in a changed investment world. This world appears likely to be more difficult and uncertain than the generally comfortable environment that prevailed during the last two decades of the 20th century – before the bursting of the technology bubble in 2000-2002 and then the big financial crash in 2008-2009.  In what now looks like a nostalgic view, the Princeton economics professor, Ben Bernanke, labeled the late 1900s’ placid period “The Great Moderation” – shortly before he became Chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank in 2006. Unfortunately, though, no “moderation” prevailed during his eight years in that position.  Many changes have caused this shift in the environment, all of them negative to some degree. I don’t want to over-dramatize this situation, but it deserves careful consideration. So let’s examine realistically these notable changes and see what they portend for the future. Successful investors are always sweeping their eyes across the entire world, looking through binoculars to find important information – while most others merely focus on a few current short-term events, usually local ones, peering through microscopes. Here, we’ll take a broad view.Download PDFNovember 2014How Should We Look At The Stock Market?I have found that many individuals who own stocks devote a majority of their investment thinking to looking at the stock market and trying to figure out where it’s going in the near future. But that’s really very unproductive. So I want to talk to you about how you should look at the market, and get some benefits from doing so. Investing is a crucial activity for many people, because it’s the foundation of their financial well-being. Making successful investment decisions requires a close focus on a few significant long-term certainties, and ignoring all the uncertainties that are mostly short-term in nature and thus of no lasting relevance.Download PDFSeptember 2014FarewellAfter 62 years of deep involvement in investment management and writing about it, now at the age of 87 I think I’ve reached an appropriate time to end the writing of monthly Ruminations. This is a hard decision because I continue to be fascinated by investing, and I enjoy writing about it. But I think this is a sensible move. I don’t want to stay past my prime the way great athletes like Willie Mays and Brett Favre did – trying desperately to find fly balls in the outfield or throwing one interception after another. (Not that I consider myself a “great” investor!)
 In closing, I’d like to pass on a few thoughts about key things I’ve learned from my many years of generally successful experience. Most of these will be familiar to my long-time readers; but they are worth repeating.Download PDFJuly 2014China RisenAfter three and a half decades of China rising economically, it has finally risen to reach parity with the U.S. in physical size of Gross Domestic Product.
Thirty six years have now elapsed since Deng Xiaoping released his country from the harsh anti-business Communist economic policies of Mao Tse Tung and pointed China toward a market economy.  Since then the innate capabilities of the hard working Chinese people have propelled its economy from a small, weak position (with a GDP less than a quarter the size of America's) to a strong, relatively prosperous position of equal size with the highly efficient American economy.Download PDFJune 2013Here We Go Again – Another BubbleIn the past 33 years investors have experienced three huge bubbles in the stock market (oil stocks in 1979-80, technology in 1999-2000, and housing and financial stocks in 2003-6).  In each case investor enthusiasm drove the shares of a group of companies that were generating exceptional profit growth at the moment up to ridiculous, unsustainable price levels.  Then, when earnings gains slowed down, to a more normal pace or less, stock prices collapsed.  Declines over the ensuing two years ranged from 45% for oil shares, to 85% for the tech group, and 85% for both housing and financial stocks.  
Today we ' re well along in a different kind of bubble, but certainly it has reached a precarious state of risk.  Surprisingly, this one is in bonds, good old stable bonds.
Download PDFApril 2013Building Capital:  A Crucial, and Difficult ActivityFor the great majority of individuals, businesses and non-profit organizations, few activities are more essential to their long-term well-being than building capital.  And the process of doing that is often difficult. Download PDFMarch 2013Evaluating Investment PerformanceAmericans love to keep score, whether it's for sports teams and the performance of their players, the changing rank of billionaires (as compiled by Forbes magazine), or in a more serious vein evaluating corporate profits and assessing the figures in government budgets, or many other things.  But nowadays no group is more obsessed with "how'm I doing" than investors. Download PDFSeptember 2012Still in the Game  There's a new word gaining usage these days:  Declinism.  (In fact, it's so new that it's not in the dictionaries most of us have on our shelves.)  On this side of the ocean, declinism refers to the expected deterioration of the economic strength and global geopolitical status of the United States.  Elsewhere it's being applied, with more justification, to many European nations and a few others, like Japan.Download PDFJuly 2012The Perils of ComplexityFive years ago, just as the financial crisis was about to erupt, I wrote about "the new financial world",  summarizing a series of dramatic changes in the way key elements of the financial sector were functioning compared to the past and citing the many new financial instruments that brilliant mathematicians, the "rocket scientists" of Wall Street, had developed.  I said most of these were very complex and potentially risky trading vehicles.  But little did we know then how badly they would turn out!Download PDFJanuary 20122011 - A Mixed BagInvestors would have been well served to hit the snooze button a year ago.  Though not without excitement, 2011 will go down as the stock market's most volatile year in recent memory but, surprisingly, it concluded just a short putt from its starting point. We discuss the elements of an interesting but fruitless year for most investors.Download PDFJuly 2011Investment Wisdom PersistsCommon sense is a key element to wisdom, and wise advice is timeless.   Some thoughts on the "Predictables" that lead to good long-term investment decision making.Download PDFJuly 2010China: Great Success But An EnigmaChina is a behemoth that has periodically dominated the global economy and then gone into periods of relative insignificance. This discussion looks at both China's past and the issues that could derail its current rapid growth.Download PDFNovember 2009Dividends Do Matter - A LotOver the long span of history, dividends have represented a larger part of your portfolio returns than you might expect.

What are analysts saying about Pentair PLC. stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Pentair PLC. stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "Pentair has outperformed the Zacks sub-industry year to date. Pentair expects full-year 2017 adjusted EPS guidance to be in the range of $3.45–$3.55 and revenues to approximately $4.8 billion. The company will gain from continued dealer wins, strong product innovations and the sale of Valves & Controls. It also remains focused on making progress in building order channel. Further, Pentair's focus on price increases will help mitigate cost inflation. The company also has a positive record of earnings surprises in recent quarters." (7/12/2017)
2. Credit Suisse Group analysts commented, "Given signs of a bottoming in the latter, and PNR's late-cycle sales mix, we think this out-growth is unlikely to accelerate. While its markets are strong now, we note that PNR's cyclicality was no lower than the sector average during the 2009 downturn," analyst Julian Mitchell wrote in a note. That said, Mitchell noted that the company should continue to record strong margin growth, while its operating margins have increased by about 300bps over the past three years.Related Link: Cowen & Company Downgrades Pentair To Underperform"We view five business units (-30 percent of sales) as 'under-earning' today, in that they offer 300bps+ of margin expansion opportunity; we assume that two-thirds of this opportunity (equating to $0.18–0.20 of EPS) is indeed realized in the next few years," Mitchell continued. Meanwhile, investors would focus on how the company deploys its V&C proceeds, while the company is keen to put the remaining balance sheet capacity of $1.4 billion to work.Mitchell said although the move would add $0.45 to EPS, it would increase the leverage "at the very top of the large-cap EE/MI leverage spectrum (implying ~3X ND /EBITDA), and back to a level which management apparently found too high."Notably, the main aim behind the sale of V&C was to reduce the leverage."There is a risk that PNR uses the proceeds from selling assets that may be close to a cyclical trough (V&C), to buy businesses that may be close to a cyclical peak (in Water, TS), and the company seems willing to return to a similar balance sheet leverage level (3X) as before the V&C sale took place," (9/26/2016)

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Pentair PLC. (NYSE:PNR) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 2 Sell Ratings, 10 Hold Ratings, 5 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.18)Consensus Price Target: $66.08 (4.44% upside)

Consensus Ratings for Ann (NYSE:ANN) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: No ratings tracked in the last 12 months.Consensus Rating:N/A (Score: NaN)Consensus Price Target: N/A

                	Our Firm
                
Since the early 1990s the investment management field has grown in size. It has also grown in complexity, and in many instances has placed its own goals ahead of the goals of its clients. As an independent, employee-owned company, Marble Harbor is able to dedicate itself exclusively to its mission of offering a customized solution for each client based on our proprietary research, without the hindrance of competing interests so often found at larger organizations.
Our team of experienced professionals, which shares nearly 20 years of working together, was formed with the defining purpose of focusing squarely on those we serve - individuals, families, endowments and foundations. We tailor each portfolio to meet the client's unique needs, objectives and risk tolerance. Our interests are aligned with those of our clients, many of whom we have worked with for as long as 25 years.
At Marble Harbor, we believe that no one should come between you and your investment decision maker. To that end, each client has a close relationship with the professional who tailors his or her individual portfolio investment plan. Additionally, each investment counselor plays an active role in analyzing and selecting securities for clients' portfolios.



                    Investment Philosophy
                


                        	We are long-term investors and manage core portfolios of equities and fixed income.
                        

                        	Investments in client portfolios are chosen through a rigorous process that focuses on the underlying strengths of the companies.
                        

                        	We invest in businesses rather than speculate in stocks. Our goal is to identify companies that we believe have superior long-term growth potential and purchase them at reasonable valuations.
                        
 
                        	Our disciplined approach helps to avoid the fads and extremes in valuation that so often lead to the permanent loss of capital.
