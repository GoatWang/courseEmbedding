The following constitutes Amendment No.
4 to the Schedule 13D filed by the undersigned (“Amendment No. 4”). This Amendment No. 4 amends the Schedule 13D as
specifically set forth herein.
 
Item 5.  Interest in Securities of the Issuer.
 
Item 5(a) is hereby amended and restated to read as follows:
 
(a)       The
aggregate percentage of Shares reported owned by each person named herein is based upon 6,047,972 Shares outstanding. This latter
number of Shares is arrived at by adding the number of Shares reported as being outstanding in the Issuer’s Agreement and
Plan of Merger as of July 11, 2017 (5,689,361 Shares) to the number of Shares (358,611 Shares) which would be receivable by the
Reporting Persons if they were to convert all of the Issuer’s Series A Convertible Preferred Stock and Common Stock Warrants
held by them into Shares. The 6,047,972 Shares outstanding used to calculate the Reporting Persons’ 18.8% ownership assumes
no other shareholder converts their preferred stock and warrants to Shares.
 
As of the close of business
on the date hereof, MC beneficially owned 198,868 Shares, constituting approximately 3.3% of the Shares outstanding. In calculating
MC’s ownership percentage, Shares which are subject to options, warrants, call agreements and other rights to purchase, exercisable
within 60 days, have been treated as outstanding Shares. The Shares beneficially owned by MC consist of: (i) 148,271 Shares held
by MC; (ii) warrants held by MC to acquire 27,500 Shares at a price of $10.00 per Share at any time on or before July 8, 2021;
and (iii) 7,699 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock convertible into 23,097 Shares.
 
As of the close of business
on the date hereof, MCC beneficially owned 921,000 Shares, constituting approximately 15.2% of the Shares outstanding. In calculating
MCC’s ownership percentage, Shares which are subject to options, warrants, call agreements and other rights to purchase,
exercisable within 60 days, have been treated as outstanding Shares. The Shares beneficially owned by MCC consist of: (i) 614,000
Shares held by MCC; and (ii) warrants held by MCC to acquire 307,000 Shares at a price of $10.00 per Share at any time on or before
July 8, 2021.
 
Meson, as the investment
adviser and general partner of MC and MCC, may be deemed to beneficially own the 1,119,868 Shares owned in the aggregate by MC
and MCC, constituting approximately 18.5% of the Shares outstanding.
 
As of the close of business
on the date hereof, Mr. Morris beneficially owned 21,005 Shares, constituting less than 1% of the Shares outstanding. The Shares
beneficially owned by Mr. Morris include 338 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock convertible into 1,014 Shares. Mr.
Morris, as the Managing Member of Meson, may be deemed to beneficially own the 1,119,868 Shares owned in the aggregate by MC and
MCC, constituting approximately 18.5% of the Shares outstanding. Mr. Meson may be deemed to beneficially own 1,140,873 Shares,
constituting approximately 18.8% of the Shares outstanding.
 
Each Reporting Person,
as a member of a “group” with the other Reporting Persons for the purposes of Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended, may be deemed the beneficial owner of the Shares directly owned by the other Reporting Persons. Each
Reporting Person disclaims beneficial ownership of such Shares except to the extent of his or its pecuniary interest therein.

The following constitutes Amendment No.
4 to the Schedule 13D filed by the undersigned (“Amendment No. 4”). This Amendment No. 4 amends the Schedule 13D as
specifically set forth herein.
 
Item 5.  Interest in Securities of the Issuer.
 
Item 5(a) is hereby amended and restated to read as follows:
 
(a)       The
aggregate percentage of Shares reported owned by each person named herein is based upon 6,047,972 Shares outstanding. This latter
number of Shares is arrived at by adding the number of Shares reported as being outstanding in the Issuer’s Agreement and
Plan of Merger as of July 11, 2017 (5,689,361 Shares) to the number of Shares (358,611 Shares) which would be receivable by the
Reporting Persons if they were to convert all of the Issuer’s Series A Convertible Preferred Stock and Common Stock Warrants
held by them into Shares. The 6,047,972 Shares outstanding used to calculate the Reporting Persons’ 18.8% ownership assumes
no other shareholder converts their preferred stock and warrants to Shares.
 
As of the close of business
on the date hereof, MC beneficially owned 198,868 Shares, constituting approximately 3.3% of the Shares outstanding. In calculating
MC’s ownership percentage, Shares which are subject to options, warrants, call agreements and other rights to purchase, exercisable
within 60 days, have been treated as outstanding Shares. The Shares beneficially owned by MC consist of: (i) 148,271 Shares held
by MC; (ii) warrants held by MC to acquire 27,500 Shares at a price of $10.00 per Share at any time on or before July 8, 2021;
and (iii) 7,699 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock convertible into 23,097 Shares.
 
As of the close of business
on the date hereof, MCC beneficially owned 921,000 Shares, constituting approximately 15.2% of the Shares outstanding. In calculating
MCC’s ownership percentage, Shares which are subject to options, warrants, call agreements and other rights to purchase,
exercisable within 60 days, have been treated as outstanding Shares. The Shares beneficially owned by MCC consist of: (i) 614,000
Shares held by MCC; and (ii) warrants held by MCC to acquire 307,000 Shares at a price of $10.00 per Share at any time on or before
July 8, 2021.
 
Meson, as the investment
adviser and general partner of MC and MCC, may be deemed to beneficially own the 1,119,868 Shares owned in the aggregate by MC
and MCC, constituting approximately 18.5% of the Shares outstanding.
 
As of the close of business
on the date hereof, Mr. Morris beneficially owned 21,005 Shares, constituting less than 1% of the Shares outstanding. The Shares
beneficially owned by Mr. Morris include 338 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock convertible into 1,014 Shares. Mr.
Morris, as the Managing Member of Meson, may be deemed to beneficially own the 1,119,868 Shares owned in the aggregate by MC and
MCC, constituting approximately 18.5% of the Shares outstanding. Mr. Meson may be deemed to beneficially own 1,140,873 Shares,
constituting approximately 18.8% of the Shares outstanding.
 
Each Reporting Person,
as a member of a “group” with the other Reporting Persons for the purposes of Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended, may be deemed the beneficial owner of the Shares directly owned by the other Reporting Persons. Each
Reporting Person disclaims beneficial ownership of such Shares except to the extent of his or its pecuniary interest therein.
