technology that gives you the most powerful and safe online experience. This 
Statement of Privacy applies to the Tim Rigney Web

Collection of your Personal Information
Tim Rigney collects personally 
identifiable information, such as your e-mail address, name, home or work 
address or telephone number. Tim Rigney also collects anonymous 
demographic information, which is not unique to you, such as your ZIP code, 
age, gender, preferences, interests and favorites.
There is also information about your computer hardware and 
software that is automatically collected by Tim Rigney. This information 
can include: your IP address, browser type, domain names, access times and 
referring Web site addresses. This information is used by Tim Rigney for 
the operation of the service, to maintain quality of the service, and to 
provide general statistics regarding use of the Tim Rigney Web site. 
Please keep in mind that if you directly disclose personally identifiable 
information or personally sensitive data through Tim Rigney public 
message boards, this information may be collected and used by others. Note: 
Tim Rigney does not read any of your private online communications. 
Tim Rigney encourages you to review the privacy statements of Web sites 
you choose to link to from Tim Rigney so that you can understand how 
those Web sites collect, use and share your information. Tim Rigney is 
not responsible for the privacy statements or other content on Web sites 
outside of the Tim Rigney and Tim Rigney family of Web sites.
Use of your Personal Information
Tim Rigney collects and uses your personal 
information to operate the Tim Rigney Web site and deliver the services 
you have requested. Tim Rigney also uses your personally identifiable 
information to inform you of other products or services available from

via surveys to conduct research about your opinion of current services or of 
potential new services that may be offered.
Tim Rigney does not sell,

time to time, contact you on behalf of external business partners about a 
particular offering that may be of interest to you. In those cases, your unique

One of the primary 
purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The 
purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a 
specific page. For example, if you personalize Tim Rigney pages, or

company and customer feedback. Tim Rigney encourages you to periodically 
review this Statement to be informed of how Tim Rigney is protecting 
your information.
