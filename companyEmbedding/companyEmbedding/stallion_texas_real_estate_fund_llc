										FAQs						



 



FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS


Who invests in STREF?
The fund is open to accredited investors only. STREF is an appropriate investment for individuals and institutional investors who are seeking a consistent high-yield return with low volatility and collateral protection. It is also suitable for investors who want passive income from regular distributions and those who would like to diversify their overall portfolio away from traditional investments like stocks, bonds, and government debt. Because the fund invests in notes backed by real estate, investors driven by capital preservation are still able to enjoy returns more typical of riskier high yield assets.Test.
What is an accredited investor?
An accredited investor is an individual who has income of at least $200,000 over the previous two years (or $300,000 with a spouse) or who has assets worth at least $1M outside the value of a primary residence. For entity investors, assets must total at least $5 million or all of the owners of the entity must be accredited investors.
Who borrows from Stallion and why are they willing to pay a higher interest rate?
Clients borrow from Stallion when they have the opportunity to profit from real estate investments but bank financing is unavailable or impractical. The borrower may have a very short time frame to purchase the property, may have certain credit challenges, or the property may be outside of a bankâs scope of lending. Our fast turnaround time and excellent service allow the borrower to take advantage of real estate opportunities that would otherwise be missed.
How are these loans structured?
Loans are typically 12 month, interest-only loans with a balloon payment due at maturity. Payments are due from the borrowers monthly. Borrowers have the right to repay the loan completely before the balloon is due, however he or she must pay at least four months of interest.
How is my investment secured?
All investments are secured by first lien deeds of trust. Your investment is used to fund loans in multiple properties. In the event of a foreclosure, Stallion will handle the entire process, assume ownership of the property, and either sell it, manage it until it becomes profitable to sell, or continue to collect the cash flow if it is an income-producing property. The advantage of the fund structure is that if any individual loan results in a lower than expected yield or capital loss, the effects on the investor are minimal as they are offset by the positive performance of multiple other loans.
How do I get started?
Please contact Stallion Capital Management to request a copy of our Private Placement Memorandum (PPM) and Subscription Document. Once you have reviewed the documents and have had your questions answered, we can walk you through what is required on the Subscription Agreement. Once this document is signed and we have confirmed receipt of your funds, your money will be put to work quickly.
How do I receive payments?
You will receive quarterly distributions through check or direct deposit unless you have chosen to reinvest dividends. You can expect to receive your quarterly payment between the 15th and the 20th of the month following the end of each quarter.
Can I change my mind about reinvestment?
Yes, you have the ability to change your reinvestment options quarterly.
What is the minimum investment to get started?
The average investment is around $250,000, though we require a minimum investment of $100,000 to begin investing in the Stallion Texas Real Estate Fund.
When can I add to my investment?
You can add to your investment at any time. Please note that your additional investment will not be converted to shares in the fund until the end of the current quarter, but will be paid a flatÂ 8% interest through the end of that quarter. Â Then, at the start of the next quarter your additional investment will be converted into membership shares in the fund.
Can I use my IRA, 401K, or other qualified funds to invest?
Many IRAs, 401Ks, and pension custodians allow the use of qualified funds to invest with Stallion. We work closely with several custodians that can accommodate your specific needs.
Is it possible to withdraw my investment?â¨
There is an 18 month commitment period. After the commitment period is fulfilled, funds can be withdrawn at the end of the next quarter.
How do I keep up to date with my investment?
You will receive a statement after every quarter detailing the performance of your investment. You can also monitor the performance of your investment through our online portal.

What Our InvestorsÂ Have To Say




Our biggest fear was not knowing anyone who had done business with Stallion. We spent a lot of time reading the material, talking to Vincent and Peter, getting questions answered, analyzing what we heard. We felt like we could trust their decisions and past performance, and we knew we already respected their values.Rusty and Kim R.
What I like most about investing with Stallion is the reduction of the uncertainty of returns. With any other type of investment, the return projection is a shot in the dark. With my STREF investment, I have high confidence in my expected growth.Scott M.
If I had had any fear, I would not have invested with Stallion. When I approached Stallion in 2010, I believe it was, I spoke at length with Vincent. Vincent was extraordinarily patient and willing to talk with me and answer my questions until I felt satisfied.  Stallion takes excellent care of my money. They know what theyâre doing, they do what they say, and their integrity is absolute.Kate C.
I have the utmost respect and trust with Vincent and his team. They operate with integrity, honor, trustworthiness, and with their investorsâ best interest at heart.Colby M.
Our favorite part of working with Stallion is that they are a small firm which is responsive and personal. They have good values and have been trustworthy.Scot H.
What I appreciate most about working with Stallion is that their response is always quick and follow through is quick. They are a legitimate, honest company who is really looking out for the best outcome for our investments.Audrey C.
I believe that the ethical standards at Stallion are very high. In my view Stallion would not increase its risk profile to take on more investor money. This is rare in the investment world.Scott M.
If you are an investor who wants maximum returns on investments and is comfortable with some risk overall, I don't know of any investment opportunity better than Stallion.Joe W.
My favorite part of working with Stallion is having the confidence in their team that even if a deal goes bad, they have done the proper due diligence to protect their investors' principal.Colby M.
I know and trust Stallion. Have a close friendship with some of the folks there. Good yield with acceptable risk. Trustworthy.Cason B.

Costs & Facts - Inheritance Advance





















































 




 

New Applications & Customer Service 800-775-8044  


 











Inheritance Advance Application is Simple and Fast
Probate and Trust Inheritance Cash Advances, for the sake of convenience, are often referred to as âInheritance Loansâ, âProbate Loansâ, âTrust Loansâ or âEstate Loansâ â often by the Heirs who are applying for an Advance on their Inheritance. 
These advances are in fact NOT loans but are cash advance assignments, without interest rates or payment schedules. Likewise, employment status, income and credit history are not an issue when applying.
YOU ARE NEVER LIABLE TO PAY BACK THE ASSIGNMENT ADVANCE (THEREFORE IT IS NON RECOURSE).  At the end of the Estate or Trust process â if funds are NOT available for repayment, your advance WILL BE ON US.
Or, if it takes longer than we estimated for the probate court or trustee to pay the assignment back to our office â YOUR COST WILL NEVER INCREASE.Â  Once our agreements are executed, the numbers never change. There are never any surprises.
Because this is not a loan, there is no risk of recourse from us for non payment. Once you receive your inheritance advance from us you are not personally responsible for repayment.
In order to receive a fast Trust Fund Loan or Probate Cash Advance you assign a portion of your expected Inheritance to Inheritance Advance. We purchase (buy) a portion of your inheritance, at a discount.
We advance you money now andÂ  we wait to get paid what you have assigned to us solely from your share ofÂ  the estate, if in fact there are sufficient funds in the estate to pay us.
If there are not sufficient funds to pay us what we are owed, WE TAKE THE LOSS, NOT YOU â you are not responsible in any way to pay back the money that we advanced you.Â  We are paid back strictly from the estate if and when the money is there to be distributed from your share.
Fill out our simple application form or give us a call at 800-775-8044. If you are approved you can sit back, and relax. You could have your advance within days.
The cost of a Probate or Trust Advance to an Heir or Beneficiary depends on a number of variables specific to the Estate. These would include, among other factors, the overall risk, what the assets are; possible complications, creditors, taxes due, and how long we guestimate it will take for the estate to close, and distribute the funds.
We work with the attorneys, the personal representatives, the trustees and the probate court, so you can get your cash advance quickly. Once our agreements are executed, the numbers never change. There are never any surprises.
Pre-apply online or call us for the lowest cost Inheritance Cash Advance. Call us today at 800-775-8044 to discuss the process and facts associated with your Inheritance Advance; to get information, facts and cost, regarding your specific inheritance. There is never an obligation to apply.

FAQs - Inheritance Advance





















































 




 

New Applications & Customer Service 800-775-8044  


 











Trust Fund Loan & Probate Advance FAQs
Visitors on Inheritance Advance often write in and request answers to many important inheritance cash advance and inheritance loan questions and issues. Our Senior Editor has listed some of the more common questions â¦
How long will it take to receive a Trust Fund Loan or Probate Advance once I send in all my documents and Estate paperwork?
It usually takes only a few days to receive your Inheritance Advance once our office has all your paperwork
Do I have any extra legal or processing fees to be concerned with when applying for an Inheritance Cash Advance?
Inheritance Advance takes care of all processing expenses. You are charged only one inheritance Advance fee, plus a legal fee in the state that your Inheritance is based in.
If I refer an Heir from the same Estate that my Inheritance Advance is coming from, do I receive a Tell-a-Friend Fee? If so, how much do I get for one referral?
You will receive a Tell-a-Friend fee if you refer another Heir, and that Heir is approved for an Inheritance Advance. The amount you would receive is strictly based on the size of the Inheritance Advance that the other Heir is set to receive.
Are there taxes on a Probate Loan or Trust Fund Inheritance Advance?
There may be. If there are federal Inheritance taxes imposed, the Heir or the Estate will be expected to pay any taxes associated with an Inheritance or an Inheritance Cash Advance or Loan.
If I am receiving an Inheritance Loan are there ways I can avoid paying Inheritance Taxes?
Possibly. This is an issue your accountant or tax attorney can address with you. It generally depends on the total value of the Estate; also if the deceased had been receiving an income from your inheritance assets.
If my fatherâs Estate has some debt, could this affect my Inheritance Advance, Probate Loan, or Inheritance Loan, in any way?
If the deceased owed money to various creditors who show up to collect on these debts, the debts may be paid out of the Estate. This could decrease the total Inheritance that your father left you, and therefore affect your Inheritance Advance.
Can my husband and I receive my entire Inheritance in advance, before Probate closes?
Most Inheritance Advances are fifty to sixty percent of the total Inheritance that is expected. We can only provide you with an Inheritance Cash Advance that is a percentage of the total Inheritance you are expecting.
Do you provide Inheritance Loans for Trusts, Probate Loans and 72-Hr. Trust Fund Loans and Probate Advances, in every region in Canada?
Yes, we provide Probate Loans and Cash Advances, as well as Trust Fund Loans and Trust Cash Advances, to all regions in Canada.
I am expecting an Inheritance from England. Will Inheritance Advance give me an Inheritance Loan?
We do not provide Inheritance Cash Advances for Heirs of Estates in the UK. The Estate must be based in the USA or Canada.
If I am approved for an Inheritance Cash Advance or Estate Loan in a state where there are no taxes imposed on a personâs Inheritance, is it still necessary for me to pay taxes?
Federal Inheritance taxes may still be imposed.
Will my credit union or local bank provide me with an Estate Loan, even if it is a small Advance?
No, banks and credit unions consider Inheritance Cash Advances and Inheritance Loans too much of a risk to make it a part of their business model. Traditional lenders will never provide an Heir with an Inheritance Cash Advance or Inheritance Loan of any size.
If my sisters and I are expecting a cash Inheritance from house sale, and there are no liquid assets in the estate, can I get an Inheritance Loan for a Probate or Trust Fund Inheritance Cash Advance?
Usually you can, but it depends on the value of the property, if the property is for sale, and the overall saleability of the property.
My Inheritance is in the form of a Trust, without liquid assets â the Trust is based completely on real estate with a great deal of debt. Can I get approved for an Inheritance Advance?
Most likely you will not be approved for an Inheritance Advance.
If Probate has not been filed with the Probate Court, but will be filed soon, can I apply for an Inheritance Cash Advance?
It would be too early to apply for an Inheritance Cash Advance if you have not yet filed for Probate. However, once Probate is open it is likely we can help you with a Probate Loan or Probate Advance.
If I am expecting a large Inheritance from my grandmother, but we are not expecting to file for Probate, can I still apply for an Inheritance Advance, if there are a good deal of liquid assets in the estate?
We can only furnish an Heir with an Inheritance Cash Advance, or an Inheritance Loan, if the Estate in question is already in Probate, or in Trust.
After Probate has started, if an Heir belonging to the Estate contests the Will in some way, does that prevent this Heir from applying for a large Estate Loan, or Inheritance Cash Advance?
It really depends on what the specific Will challenges are. There is still a good chance this Heir may be approved for an Inheritance Cash Advance, and that the Inheritance Advance in question will be the amount the Heir wishes it to be.
Can an Executor, who is also an Heir, apply for an Inheritance Cash Advance?
An Heir of the same Estate, who is also an Executor, can be approved for an Inheritance Advance.
