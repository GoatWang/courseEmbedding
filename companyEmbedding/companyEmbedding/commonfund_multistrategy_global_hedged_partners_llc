About us


Our Mission


Our History












About us
Commonfund is an asset management firm founded in 1971 with a two-part mission. First, to create investment solutions for nonprofits that previously did not have the scale and access to the best managers and strategies. As importantly, our charter was to also create educational programs that would bring current best practices to institutional investors of all sizes and segments. Our insights have helped to advance asset management practices and grow portfolios through ever-changing investment environments. Commonfund too, has changed and grown dramatically over the years–expanding both our investment solution offerings and the client segments we serve. Yet, our mission has remained the same: to enhance the financial resources and improve the investment management practices of our clients.

Commonfund is Proud to be Ranked in the Top Five Most Trusted Institutional Asset Managers for Nonprofits1. 

As of March 31, 2017, Commonfund manages $23.7 billion2 for hundreds of institutions with a focus on two primary activities:


 Outsourced Investment Management


 Alternative Strategies


Our only business is asset management and we are active in all sectors of the global capital markets – in both public and private markets.










Our Mission
Our core mission is to enhance the financial resources of our clients and to help them improve investment management practices. As a private, nonprofit organization, we are beholden to our clients, not to shareholders or outside owners. This enables us to align our interests with those of our clients and lets us focus our undivided attention on institutional asset management.

The Commonfund Difference - Higher Value

How we execute our mission is the key difference that sets us apart, with three mutually supportive components grounded in a strong financial foundation.
Performance Investment programs that seek to generate superior risk-adjusted, long-term investment performance net of fees²
Service Support based on an in-depth understanding of client needs
Insight Knowledge sharing, educational programs and research that promote best practices among institutional investors
Our strong financial resources serve as the underpinning that enables us to implement our mission. It is this strong base that permits us to hire, grow and retain talented people; invest in information technology and other client support assets; and consistently deliver a broad range of educational programs specifically for institutional investors.
 










Our History
The founding of Commonfund is one of the exciting stories of innovation in asset management. To understand why, return to the late 1960s. In this era, investment returns from college endowments persistently lagged the rate of growth in operating budgets. There was increasing concern throughout higher education regarding the future vitality of these institutions. And, many institutions faced problems of faculty compensation and deferred maintenance. Traditional endowment management as practiced at the time hampered trustees’ ability to address these issues.

But change was in the air. Thought leaders of the day were looking at the then-new concept of total return and thinking about allowing colleges to set their own spending rate. One study, Managing Educational Endowments, concluded that poor results were due to an over-emphasis on avoiding losses and maximizing current income. The Ford Foundation sponsored a landmark study, The Law and the Lore of Endowment Funds, published in 1969, that served as a further catalyst for action.
Out of this came a Ford Foundation grant of $2.8 million for the founding of The Common Fund for Nonprofit Organizations (Commonfund). Two years later, July, 1, 1971, The Common Fund was officially founded. Of the $2.8 million, $500,000 was earmarked for research and publications — a tradition that continues today. By the end of 1971, a total of 72 endowments had invested $63 million. We also launched our first investment fund, the Multi-Strategy Equity Fund, initiating an approach to investing that later would become known as the "endowment model".












Milestones

Over the years, Commonfund has grown and expanded the range of investment funds and supporting services it offers its clients. Along the way, key milestones in the history of Commonfund include:

Operating Assets





Home  >  Investments  >  Operating Assets 









The Operating Asset Challenge and Opportunity
Over our more than four decades of working with nonprofit institutions we have observed that many have excess liquidity and do not utilize best investment practices such as timeframe arbitrage and diversification in managing their operating assets. Commonfund is offering a comprehensive investment program structured to address this situation as many large operating entities are rethinking their fully liquid portfolios. We believe best practice is to transition these investors from a daily liquid portfolio to a more appropriate diversified limited-term portfolio. Dependent upon the risk tolerance of the individual organization, the investment solutions may range from fixed income only, to portfolios that include allocations to equities and alternatives. Due to liquidity needs and limited risk “appetites”, these portfolios should not be endowment-like in return expectation, or volatility.
Commonfund Cash Programs
Currently Commonfund offers investment programs in Liquid, Contingent and Core levels for higher education investors. We determine the “liquidity level” to be investments for daily needs to one year, “contingent level” to be investments not needed for three years and “core level” to be up to five years. For higher education institutions with significant cash portfolios we offer Commonfund Treasury+ program. The Treasury+ program offers operating asset investors a transition from a daily liquid portfolio to a more appropriate diversified limited-term portfolio. Commonfund plays an advisory role as well as investment provider in Treasury+ relationships. The program is flexible and completely customized to the risk and return needs of each investor using the full range of options described in the chart below. The program allows cash investors to earn a competitive return on their balances while maintaining the necessary risk controls and liquidity to reliably fund operations.
