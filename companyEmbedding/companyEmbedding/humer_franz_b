      ■ As chairman and chief executive officer (CEO) of Roche Group,
      Franz B. Humer led the Swiss pharmaceutical company through a number of
      financial ups and downs and a controversial price-fixing case. Through all
      of the changes, Humer never compromised the family-owned business's
      solidarity, refusing even to discuss the possibility of a merger with
      other large pharmaceutical companies. In 2001, in the midst of a
      significant economic and company downturn, Humer sold all
      nonpharmaceutical divisions. He strengthened the company's
      research-and-development arm and bolstered its new and core drug
      offerings. Humer always tried to balance his financial responsibilities to
      his shareholders with his ethical responsibilities to the millions of
      people who use Roche's drugs.

      EDUCATION AND EARLY CAREER
    

      Humer received his doctorate in law from the University of Innsbruch in
      Austria, then went on to earn an MBA from INSEAD in Fontainbleau, France.
      He learned survival skills and developed an innate sense of human behavior
      while in his 20s, working as a tour guide for large groups. "There
      was no salary, only tips. Pretty soon, I could hone in on particular
      groups. Eventually, I could predict within 10% how much I could earn from
      any particular group," he told 
      
        Harvard Business Review
      
       (September 1, 2000).
    

      Humer began his career in 1971 with ICME International in Zurich,
      Switzerland. Two years later he entered the pharmaceutical industry,
      joining Schering Plough Corporation as assistant to the vice president for
      Europe, Africa, and the Middle East. After leaving Schering Plough, Humer
      held various managerial
       positions (including director) at Glaxo Holding. He was responsible for
      research, business development, manufacturing, commercial strategy, and
      all operations outside the United States.
    

      MOVING TO ROCHE
    

      Humer joined Roche in 1995 as a member of the board of directors of Roche
      Holding and as the head of its pharmaceuticals division. In 1998 he
      assumed the role of Roche's CEO. In the late 1990s, a time when
      several other pharmaceutical companies were merging, Roche remained
      staunchly independent. Humer said that, although he was not completely
      opposed to the idea of a merger, he was confident that his company could
      succeed alone by simply focusing on its internal products and by marketing
      new drugs.
    

      One of the biggest new drugs Roche marketed was a weight-loss medication
      called Xenical, which gained approval from the U.S. Food and Drug
      Administration in 1999. Worldwide sales exceeded $350 million, and Xenical
      became one of the most profitable Roche products since Valium.
    

      In 2001 Humer became chairman of Roche. He kept a tight rein on the
      company and its employees, according to industry insiders, which led to
      some disagreements with other Roche executives. In May 2001 Humer fired
      chief financial officer Anton Affentranger after just four months of
      service because of a reported personality clash.
    

      HUMER VOWS TO KEEP ROCHE INDEPENDENT
    

      In 2002 Roche lost $2.9 billion dollars, the greatest annual loss in the
      company's 108-year history. Humer blamed the drop on investment
      losses and on a multimillion dollar fine that stemmed from a 1990s vitamin
      price-fixing case. In 2001 rumors had begun to circulate that rival Swiss
      drug manufacturer Novartis was moving toward a merger with the
      family-owned Roche. Novartis purchased 20 percent of Roche's stock,
      and then steadily increased its stake. Humer quickly dismissed the idea,
      remaining firmly opposed to any such megamerger. "Large mergers,
      large acquisitions in this industry destroy value, destroy
      innovation," he said (MIT news release).
    

      Even when Novartis increased its Roche holdings to 33.3 percent in 2004,
      just below the level that the Swiss law considers a formal bid, Humer was
      unfazed. He was so unconcerned, in fact, that even amid rumors that his
      company was about to be swallowed up by Novartis, Humer went skiing. He
      said he was secure in knowing that the two Roche owners (the Hoffmann and
      Oeris families) would never relinquish control over their company.
    

      But Humer had no trouble drawing other companies under Roche's
      wing. In fact, he wanted to create additional value for Roche's
      shareholders by changing the company's focus through strategic
      acquisitions. In order for the company to focus on its diagnostics and
      pharmaceutical businesses, Humer bought a controlling stake in the
      Japanese pharmaceutical company Chugai in 2001, and he acquired
      diagnostics company Igen International for $1.4 billion in 2003. He then
      rid the company of its less profitable chemicals business and sold its
      vitamins division to the Dutch company DSM (although Roche was still
      responsible for all liabilities stemming from the price-fixing case).
      Roche also purchased a majority stake in the California-based biotech
      company Genentech.
    

      PROFITS AND RESPONSIBILITIES
    

      Humer said that one of his greatest challenges in running a large
      pharmaceutical company was balancing the company's fiscal and moral
      responsibilities. "The biggest challenge for us is how to cure the
      sick and run a profitable business at the same time," he told
      students at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT news release).
    

      In mid-2003 the two goals seemed at odds. Controversy developed when Roche
      released its new AIDS drug, Fuzeon. The drug had a yearly price tag for
      users of $20,000, which was three times the cost of the most expensive
      AIDS drug then on the market. AIDS activists protested that the drug was
      too expensive for the average patient to afford. But Humer defended the
      company's pricing, saying that it needed to recoup its
      research-and-development costs on the breakthrough therapy. "We
      need to make a decent rate of return on our innovations…. I
      can't imagine a society that doesn't want that innovation to
      continue," he told the 
      
        Associated Press
      
       (March 13, 2003). He promised that Roche would give discounts to
      government-run programs and even provide the drug free in some cases.
    

      Humer committed Roche resources to the fight against AIDS. In October 2001
      he met with the United Nations Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, and
      officials from several other drug companies to help poor countries get
      improved access to AIDS drugs. But, he said, supplying free medicine was
      not enough in countries that lacked the infrastructure to disseminate and
      use them properly. More training and governmental commitment would be
      needed before the drugs could be effective.
    

      VISION FOR THE FUTURE
    

      Humer said that he saw a "wave of innovation" in the
      pharmaceutical industry that one day would enable doctors to
      "identify the right patients for the right medication at the right
      dose at the right time" (
      
        American Way
      
      , March 1, 2004). Under Humer's leadership, Roche has spent about
      $3 billion a year on research and development. "When you look at
      what drives
       the success of pharmaceutical companies, it's clearly driven by
      the ability to innovate and the capacity to create new products,"
      he told 
      
        BusinessWeek Online
      
      .
    

      By 2004 Roche had bounced back from its financial troubles. Operating
      profits had increased by 28 percent, and the company went from a net loss
      of about $3 billion in 2002 to a net income of almost $2.5 billion the
      following year. The increase was due primarily to strong sales of the
      company's core drugs: Rituxan (a therapy for non-Hodgkin's
      lymphoma), CellCept (an immune-system suppressant used for organ
      transplantation), Herceptin (a drug used in the treatment of breast
      cancer), Tamiflu (a flu medication), and Pegasys (a therapy for Hepatitis
      C).
    

      OTHER ROLES
    

      In addition to his positions at Roche, Humer was vice president of the
      Swiss Business Federation and vice chairman of the European Federation of
      Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations. He was involved with a number
      of charitable organizations, including Project Hope and the Swiss American
      Chamber of Commerce, and he was active in the Paul Ehrlich Foundation, the
      European Round Table of Industrialists, and the World Business Council for
      Sustainable Development. Humer was on the board of candy manufacturer
      Cadbury Schweppes until he was appointed chairman of Roche in 2001.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

■ As chairman and chief executive officer (CEO) of Roche Group, Franz B. Humer led the Swiss pharmaceutical company through a number of financial ups and downs and a controversial price-fixing case. Through all of the changes, Humer never compromised the family-owned business's solidarity, refusing even to discuss the possibility of a merger with other large pharmaceutical companies. In 2001, in the midst of a significant economic and company downturn, Humer sold all nonpharmaceutical divisions. He strengthened the company's research-and-development arm and bolstered its new and core drug offerings. Humer always tried to balance his financial responsibilities to his shareholders with his ethical responsibilities to the millions of people who use Roche's drugs.
EDUCATION AND EARLY CAREER
Humer received his doctorate in law from the University of Innsbruch in Austria, then went on to earn an MBA from INSEAD in Fontainbleau, France. He learned survival skills and developed an innate sense of human behavior while in his 20s, working as a tour guide for large groups. "There was no salary, only tips. Pretty soon, I could hone in on particular groups. Eventually, I could predict within 10% how much I could earn from any particular group," he told Harvard Business Review (September 1, 2000).


Humer began his career in 1971 with ICME International in Zurich, Switzerland. Two years later he entered the pharmaceutical industry, joining Schering Plough Corporation as assistant to the vice president for Europe, Africa, and the Middle East. After leaving Schering Plough, Humer held various managerial positions (including director) at Glaxo Holding. He was responsible for research, business development, manufacturing, commercial strategy, and all operations outside the United States.
MOVING TO ROCHE
Humer joined Roche in 1995 as a member of the board of directors of Roche Holding and as the head of its pharmaceuticals division. In 1998 he assumed the role of Roche's CEO. In the late 1990s, a time when several other pharmaceutical companies were merging, Roche remained staunchly independent. Humer said that, although he was not completely opposed to the idea of a merger, he was confident that his company could succeed alone by simply focusing on its internal products and by marketing new drugs.
One of the biggest new drugs Roche marketed was a weight-loss medication called Xenical, which gained approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 1999. Worldwide sales exceeded $350 million, and Xenical became one of the most profitable Roche products since Valium.
In 2001 Humer became chairman of Roche. He kept a tight rein on the company and its employees, according to industry insiders, which led to some disagreements with other Roche executives. In May 2001 Humer fired chief financial officer Anton Affentranger after just four months of service because of a reported personality clash.
HUMER VOWS TO KEEP ROCHE INDEPENDENT
In 2002 Roche lost $2.9 billion dollars, the greatest annual loss in the company's 108-year history. Humer blamed the drop on investment losses and on a multimillion dollar fine that stemmed from a 1990s vitamin price-fixing case. In 2001 rumors had begun to circulate that rival Swiss drug manufacturer Novartis was moving toward a merger with the family-owned Roche. Novartis purchased 20 percent of Roche's stock, and then steadily increased its stake. Humer quickly dismissed the idea, remaining firmly opposed to any such megamerger. "Large mergers, large acquisitions in this industry destroy value, destroy innovation," he said (MIT news release).
Even when Novartis increased its Roche holdings to 33.3 percent in 2004, just below the level that the Swiss law considers a formal bid, Humer was unfazed. He was so unconcerned, in fact, that even amid rumors that his company was about to be swallowed up by Novartis, Humer went skiing. He said he was secure in knowing that the two Roche owners (the Hoffmann and Oeris families) would never relinquish control over their company.
But Humer had no trouble drawing other companies under Roche's wing. In fact, he wanted to create additional value for Roche's shareholders by changing the company's focus through strategic acquisitions. In order for the company to focus on its diagnostics and pharmaceutical businesses, Humer bought a controlling stake in the Japanese pharmaceutical company Chugai in 2001, and he acquired diagnostics company Igen International for $1.4 billion in 2003. He then rid the company of its less profitable chemicals business and sold its vitamins division to the Dutch company DSM (although Roche was still responsible for all liabilities stemming from the price-fixing case). Roche also purchased a majority stake in the California-based biotech company Genentech.
PROFITS AND RESPONSIBILITIES
Humer said that one of his greatest challenges in running a large pharmaceutical company was balancing the company's fiscal and moral responsibilities. "The biggest challenge for us is how to cure the sick and run a profitable business at the same time," he told students at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT news release).
In mid-2003 the two goals seemed at odds. Controversy developed when Roche released its new AIDS drug, Fuzeon. The drug had a yearly price tag for users of $20,000, which was three times the cost of the most expensive AIDS drug then on the market. AIDS activists protested that the drug was too expensive for the average patient to afford. But Humer defended the company's pricing, saying that it needed to recoup its research-and-development costs on the breakthrough therapy. "We need to make a decent rate of return on our innovations…. I can't imagine a society that doesn't want that innovation to continue," he told the Associated Press (March 13, 2003). He promised that Roche would give discounts to government-run programs and even provide the drug free in some cases.


Humer committed Roche resources to the fight against AIDS. In October 2001 he met with the United Nations Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, and officials from several other drug companies to help poor countries get improved access to AIDS drugs. But, he said, supplying free medicine was not enough in countries that lacked the infrastructure to disseminate and use them properly. More training and governmental commitment would be needed before the drugs could be effective.
VISION FOR THE FUTURE
Humer said that he saw a "wave of innovation" in the pharmaceutical industry that one day would enable doctors to "identify the right patients for the right medication at the right dose at the right time" (American Way, March 1, 2004). Under Humer's leadership, Roche has spent about $3 billion a year on research and development. "When you look at what drives the success of pharmaceutical companies, it's clearly driven by the ability to innovate and the capacity to create new products," he told BusinessWeek Online.
By 2004 Roche had bounced back from its financial troubles. Operating profits had increased by 28 percent, and the company went from a net loss of about $3 billion in 2002 to a net income of almost $2.5 billion the following year. The increase was due primarily to strong sales of the company's core drugs: Rituxan (a therapy for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma), CellCept (an immune-system suppressant used for organ transplantation), Herceptin (a drug used in the treatment of breast cancer), Tamiflu (a flu medication), and Pegasys (a therapy for Hepatitis C).
OTHER ROLES
In addition to his positions at Roche, Humer was vice president of the Swiss Business Federation and vice chairman of the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations. He was involved with a number of charitable organizations, including Project Hope and the Swiss American Chamber of Commerce, and he was active in the Paul Ehrlich Foundation, the European Round Table of Industrialists, and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development. Humer was on the board of candy manufacturer Cadbury Schweppes until he was appointed chairman of Roche in 2001.
