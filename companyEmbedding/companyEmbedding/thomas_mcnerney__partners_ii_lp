Alex Zisson
AdvisorAlex 
	was a partner at Thomas, McNerney & Partners since its first fund was raised in 2002. 
	Alex is currently a Managing Director at H.I.G. BioVentures. He currently serves 
	on the board of directors for Clarus Therapeutics, Inc. and Keystone Dental, Inc.
 Alex is a member of the Industry Advisory Board of the Children's Tumor Foundation 
	and a board member of Advanced Medical Research Institute of Canada Development Corporation (AMRIC-DC), which is focused on economic development in northern Ontario.  He is also an advisor for the Partnership Fund of NYC, which manages a bioaccelerator to advance local health care research, and is on the Life Sciences Council for Springboard Enterprises, a group that assists female entrepreneurs.  
	
Prior to Thomas, McNerney, he spent 11 
	years in the research department at Hambrecht & Quist (and its successor 
	firms Chase H&Q and JPMorgan H&Q). During his tenure at H&Q, Alex led 
	research teams covering the biotechnology, specialty pharmaceutical, 
	large-cap pharmaceutical, drug delivery and diagnostic industries. After the merger of Chase H&Q and JPMorgan, he became the firm's Health Care 
	Strategist. He was named twice in The Wall Street Journal's All-Star 
	Analysts Survey, including during his last year at JPMorgan, when he placed 
	in all three categories: stock picking (#1 in pharmaceuticals), earnings 
	estimate accuracy (tied for #2), and 'home run' hitting (#8 across all 
	industries). He graduated magna cum laude from Brown University, where he 
	was elected to Phi Beta Kappa.

LOCUS DEVELOPMENT, INC. MERGES WITH INVITAE DIVISION OF GENOMIC HEALTH

San Francisco, CA, August 8, 2012 - Genomic Health (NASDAQ: GHDX) merged its InVitae division into Locus Development, Inc., a Thomas, McNerney & Partners II, L.P. portfolio company.  San Francisco, CA-based Locus was founded in 2010 to consolidate the genetic testing market and enable practicing clinicians to interpret patient-specific genomic sequence data.  The company has developed a panel of tests to detect a broad spectrum of the known genetic mutations and has built a fully functional laboratory to process patient samples. 

	

	Randy Scott, the founder and prior CEO and Chairman of Genomic Health, will become CEO and Chairman of the combined entity, which will retain the InVitae name.  Randy has successfully built multibillion dollar companies twice before in his career.  He has been a board member of Locus since 2010, and his passion for the company’s mission and technology drove him to want to lead this combined entity.  Locus’ founding team and employees will remain with the merged company.

	

	InVitae will continue its focus on next generation sequencing for the clinical diagnostics market.  In fact, newly independent InVitae already has a significant head start in this rapidly growing segment of the market. This transaction expands Locus’ product offering to over 300 genetic conditions in its current testing panel, representing the majority of generic tests performed today. Additionally, it brings on board the commercial expertise and experience of Randy Scott and his team at a critical time for the company, having received its CLIA clearance in May 2012, making Locus commercial-ready.
