Dr. Arndt, a dermatologist in the Boston area, is one of the premier academic clinicians in dermatology and has had a strong impact on the practice and perception of dermatology both nationally and internationally. A fourth generation Californian, he attended the University of California at Berkeley, then became an Alpha Omega Alpha Honor Society graduate of Yale University School of Medicine, followed by training in dermatology at the Massachusetts General Hospital and the Department of Dermatology at Harvard Medical School. Dr. Arndt is Adjunct Professor of Surgery (Dermatology) at Dartmouth Medical School; Adjunct Professor of Dermatology at Brown Medical School; and Clinical Professor of Dermatology, Emeritus, Harvard Medical School; and a partner at SkinCare Physicians. He was Dermatologist-in-Chief at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center for over two decades. The Kenneth A. Arndt Professorship in Dermatology was established at Harvard Medical School in 2000 “in recognition of Dr. Arndt’s many contributions to the field.” The current and all future chairmen of the Department of Dermatology at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center carry the title of the Kenneth A. Arndt Professor.
Dr. Arndt has broad clinical and clinical research interests. He specializes in the diagnosis and therapy of medical dermatologic diseases, all aspects of cutaneous laser surgery including treatment of vascular and pigmented lesions, hypertrichosis, photodamage, and scarring, and the evaluation and treatment of photoaging including the use of soft tissue fillers, chemodenervation (Botox, Dysport), radiofrequency (Thermage), photorejuvenation and adjunctive therapies.
Dr. Arndt has been named as a Top Doctor in Boston for 16 years. 
Dr. Arndt is the author or editor of sixteen books. His Manual of Dermatologic Therapeutics is in its eighth edition and has been translated into six foreign languages. Dr. Arndt is co-author with Dr. Jeffrey S. Dover of the book Illustrated Cutaneous Laser Surgery: A Practitioner’s Guide, and its most recent edition as Illustrated Cutaneous and Aesthetic Laser Surgery, and also the book, Controversies and Conversations in Cutaneous Laser Surgery. Along with Drs. Kaminer, Dover and Rohrer, he is co-editor of the comprehensive text Atlas of Cosmetic Surgery. Dr. Arndt is the co-editor of the books Cutaneous Laser Therapy: Principles and Methods, and Lasers in Cutaneous and Aesthetic Surgery and editor of Scar Revision. He is also co-editor of The Manual of Clinical Problems in Dermatology, six volumes of Diagnostic Challenges, and a comprehensive five book textbook series which includes the two volume Cutaneous Medicine and Surgery, An Integrated Program in Dermatology; Atlas of Cutaneous Surgery; Primary Care Dermatology; Pocket Guide to Cutaneous Medicine and Surgery; and Cutaneous Medicine and Surgery: Self Assessment and Review.

Dr. Arndt, a dermatologist in the Boston area, is one of the premier academic clinicians in dermatology and has had a strong impact on the practice and perception of dermatology both nationally and internationally. A fourth generation Californian, he attended the University of California at Berkeley, then became an Alpha Omega Alpha Honor Society graduate of Yale University School of Medicine, followed by training in dermatology at the Massachusetts General Hospital and the Department of Dermatology at Harvard Medical School. Dr. Arndt is Adjunct Professor of Surgery (Dermatology) at Dartmouth Medical School; Adjunct Professor of Dermatology at Brown Medical School; and Clinical Professor of Dermatology, Emeritus, Harvard Medical School; and a partner at SkinCare Physicians. He was Dermatologist-in-Chief at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center for over two decades. The Kenneth A. Arndt Professorship in Dermatology was established at Harvard Medical School in 2000 “in recognition of Dr. Arndt’s many contributions to the field.” The current and all future chairmen of the Department of Dermatology at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center carry the title of the Kenneth A. Arndt Professor.
Dr. Arndt has broad clinical and clinical research interests. He specializes in the diagnosis and therapy of medical dermatologic diseases, all aspects of cutaneous laser surgery including treatment of vascular and pigmented lesions, hypertrichosis, photodamage, and scarring, and the evaluation and treatment of photoaging including the use of soft tissue fillers, chemodenervation (Botox, Dysport), radiofrequency (Thermage), photorejuvenation and adjunctive therapies.

Dr. Arndt is the author or editor of sixteen books. His Manual of Dermatologic Therapeutics is in its eighth edition and has been translated into six foreign languages. Dr. Arndt is co-author with Dr. Jeffrey S. Dover of the book Illustrated Cutaneous Laser Surgery: A Practitioner’s Guide, and its most recent edition as Illustrated Cutaneous and Aesthetic Laser Surgery, and also the book, Controversies and Conversations in Cutaneous Laser Surgery. Along with Drs. Kaminer, Dover and Rohrer, he is co-editor of the comprehensive text Atlas of Cosmetic Surgery. Dr. Arndt is the co-editor of the books Cutaneous Laser Therapy: Principles and Methods, and Lasers in Cutaneous and Aesthetic Surgery and editor of Scar Revision.

Frontier Communications Appoints Ken Arndt President of New East Region


New region to be headquartered in Connecticut pending approval and

      completion of AT&T Connecticut acquisition

 STAMFORD, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--

      Frontier Communications Corporation (NASDAQ:FTR) announced today that

      Kenneth Arndt has been appointed President of its new East Region

      comprising New York and Pennsylvania. Pending approval by the

      Connecticut Public Utilities Regulatory Authority (PURA) of Frontier's

      acquisition of AT&T's wireline, statewide fiber network and U-verse

      video and satellite TV operations, Connecticut will become part of the

      new East Region. Arndt will be based in New Haven, Connecticut and

      report to Daniel J. McCarthy, President and Chief Operating Officer.

      "Ken has demonstrated outstanding leadership at Frontier," McCarthy

      said. "He is a customer advocate who knows how our products and services

      make life better for those we serve. He values a local presence, strong

      relationships and a commitment to the community." McCarthy added: "I am

      delighted our new East Region is in such capable hands."

    


      Most recently, Arndt served as Region President and was responsible for

      operations in New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia. Going

      forward, West Virginia and Ohio will constitute the Company's new

      Mid-Atlantic Region.

    


      Arndt played a critical role when Frontier acquired Verizon assets in 14

      states in 2010 - a transaction that tripled the size of the company.

      Arndt managed the integration of Verizon's North Carolina, South

      Carolina and West Virginia operations. The transaction made West

      Virginia the largest state to date in Frontier's 27-state portfolio.

    


      Arndt said he looks forward to Frontier's pending move into Connecticut

      and ensuring that customers have access to the best communications

      services in the market.

    


      "At Frontier, our relationship with customers is our most important

      responsibility," Arndt said. "Our employees are proactive about

      communicating with customers, community and business leaders and

      government officials to emphasize our commitment to providing great

      network access and unparalleled customer service that results in a great

      quality of life and solid livelihoods. We know our broadband, voice and

      video products fuel economic growth in the states we serve; we take that

      seriously.

    


      "Frontier will continue to deliver great products and services in the

      East Region. Our business model includes being active contributors to

      the communities we serve and helping our markets grow and prosper," he

      added.

    


      Arndt joined Frontier in October 2003 as State Vice President and

      General Manager for its then seven-state Southeast Territory. Over the

      next 10 years, he held a variety of executive positions in customer

      service, marketing, sales, operations and general management.

    


      Arndt earned his B.S. in marketing from Trinity University in San

      Antonio, Texas and his MBA in marketing from Middlesex School of

      Business. He and his wife Sally reside in Milford, Connecticut.
