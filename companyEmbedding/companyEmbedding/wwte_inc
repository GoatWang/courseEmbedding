Expedia`s WWTE Partners With Alaska Airlines Site.


 16 October 2001






WWTE is partnering with Alaska Airlines to provide hotel and car rental booking capabilities to the alaskaair.com Web site. 
Due to the partnership, more than 40,000 hotel properties and all major national car rental companies are now available on alaskaair.com. Launched in July, WWTE is a division of Travelscape.com, a wholly owned subsidiary of Expedia.

“Alaskaair.com customers can now enjoy one-stop travel shopping and have access to the most competitive rates in lodging and car rentals from WWTE`s inventory,” said Steve Jarvis, Alaska Airlines` staff vice president of e-commerce. “WWTE also enhances alaskaair.com because of the speed in which their product could be deployed and integrated into our site.”

WWTE is unique because of its wide array of services and integrated offerings of both published and negotiated inventory, including hotel rates with discounts of up to 70 percent for nearly 400 domestic and international destinations. WWTE also supplies the phone and email-based customer service for the lodging and car rental booking for alaskair.com customers.

“Providing WWTE`s services to a top carrier like Alaska Airlines allows us to continue the momentum we established in July in supplying our partners with a product that`s proven among travelers,” said Greg Slyngstad, senior vice president of destinations for Expedia, Inc. “Alaska Airlines has always been at the forefront of travel technology—it was the first North American carrier to offer flight booking over the Internet. The WWTE product offering is a great complement to their already terrific air ticket services.”ADVERTISEMENT

BELLEVUE, Wash. – July 12, 2004– Expedia, Inc. today announced the continued momentum of its WWTE™ private-label service in powering 

BELLEVUE, Wash. – July 12, 2004– Expedia, Inc. today announced the continued momentum of its WWTE™ private-label service in powering the sites of Hawaii-based travel suppliers by announcing one new partnership and the expansion of another. 
ASTON Hotels & Resorts®Hawaii, a new WWTE partner, will use the technology to power its recently launched vacation package offerings for its online customers. Existing partner Hawaiian Airlines has extended its WWTE agreement to enable guests originating in Hawaii to book vacation packages including air, hotel and car online in one customized itinerary. 
For the past 50 years, ASTON®Hawaii has been offering great value to travelers at its 30 hotels and condominium resorts throughout the Hawaiian Islands. By partnering with WWTE to offer vacation packages on Astonhotels.com, the hotel company is extending this commitment to value so that customers can reap the time and money-saving benefits of booking air and car along with lodging at an ASTON property. 
“Our value-conscious customers are very interested in the convenience and cost savings associated with booking multiple trip components in one place,” said William Koo, vice president of channel management & travel distribution at ASTON Hotels & Resorts®Hawaii. “ASTON Vacations allows our online customers to tailor their Hawaii vacation packages – hotels, flights, car rentals and even activities – according to their travel desires quickly and easily. Selecting the WWTE private label service to power this offering enabled us to get up and running quickly and to provide our loyal customers with a one-stop shopping travel solution – everything they need for their Hawaiian vacation without ever leaving Astonhotels.com.” 
In addition to this new partnership, WWTE has also expanded its existing agreement with Hawaiian Airlines, Hawaii's largest and longest-serving airline. HawaiianAir.com now offers complete, customizable vacation packages from the islands to the mainland. Hawaiian Airlines has partnered with WWTE since April, providing standalone hotels and car rentals to online customers. 
“Hawaiian Airlines has already enjoyed great success working with WWTE in expanding our vacation offerings,” said Gordon Locke, senior vice president marketing and sales at Hawaiian Airlines. “By taking advantage of WWTE's proven technology and access to broad inventory, HawaiianAir.com is now a one-stop shop for travelers visiting the mainland.” 
“Hawaii is an important market, and we're excited to continue WWTE's momentum in powering the sites of suppliers based there,” said Barney Harford, senior vice president of air, car and private label at Expedia, Inc. “Both Aston Hotels and Hawaiian Airlines have long-standing recognition in the industry, and WWTE enables them to continue focusing on what they do best – serving the needs of their customers.” About WWTE
