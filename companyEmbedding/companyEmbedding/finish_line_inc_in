DRY Lube with Teflon® fluoropolymer

Finish Line's DRY Lube goes on wet and sets up with a dry 'wax-like' synthetic film that helps keep your chain clean by not absorbing excessive amounts grit, grime, or dust. Thanks to the added Teflon® fluoropolymer, Finish Line's DRY Lube minimizes pedaling friction, repels moisture, and withstands rides up to 100 miles. An extremely versatile lubricant and a perfect choice for many road and off-road cyclist.
More Info








WET Lube

WET Lube is typically recommended for extreme conditions. Formulated with high viscosity synthetic oils, water repelling polymers, and advanced anti-wear additives. WET Lube is Finish Line's strongest, longest lasting and most water resistant lubricant. WET Lube goes on wet, and stays wet, to provide maximum drivetrain smoothness, extremely quiet rides, and ultimate rust protection in the harshest of environments.
More Info








WAX Lube

Finish Line's WAX Lube goes on wet, but sets up with a hard, dry, super-slick wax film. WAX Lube contains no oily or greasy ingredients to attract or absorb dirt. The addition of molybdenum in Finish Line's wax film enhances lubricity and increases lubrication intervals. Your drivetrain will remain nearly contaminant free and clean to the touch. Cleaning before relubing is usually not required, however WAX Lube needs to be applied more frequently than DRY or WET.
More Info








1-Step™ Cleaner & Lubricant

Finish Line's 1-Step™ is engineered for cyclists seeking a quick, one-step clean and lube formulation. As 1-Step flushes out contaminants and old lube, it leaves behind a clean new film of low friction lubricant. For cyclists on the go, 1-Step is the perfect choice for maintaining your bicycle's drivetrain.
More Info








Ceramic Wet Lube

Ceramic Wet Lube is Finish Line’s most advanced and effective racing lubricant. This wet-style full synthetic lubricant builds a ceramic coating on frictional surfaces resulting in increased smoothness, longer intervals, and a chain that runs so quiet, you will notice the difference. Ceramic Wet’s extreme durability holds up even in wet weather conditions. Although more expensive than most lubes, Ceramic Wet delivers more miles per application, often exceeding 175 miles.
More Info








Ceramic Wax Lube

Finish Line's Ceramic Wax lube is an advanced, wax based bicycle chain lubricant that ensures total drivetrain cleanliness without the distance compromise that other wax lubricants require. Ceramic Wax Lube has even been use by one of Finish Line's WorldTour teams in dry weather races of 120 miles. Ceramic Wax lube is the perfect choice for serious cyclists who want to minimize the amount of time they spend on drivetrain maintenance and maximize the amount of time they spend in the saddle.

Finish Line - About Us



























Finish Line Products was founded in 2005 with the intent to revolutionize the drywall finishing industry by manufacturing quality joint treatment products at competitive prices.  The production plant, located in Winder, GA, services the entire Southeastern United States.  With over 100 years of combined experience, Finish Line has quickly gained respect in the market place for ethical business practices and quality products.  Finish Line has evolved into a company that resolves the jobsite problems that every day drywall contractors have, providing them with the products to eliminate or at least diminish these problems.
Before Finish Line, drywall contractors were told by BIG manufacturing companies, You cant do this and you cant do that to the products.  Finish Line started asking drywall contractors, Why, so as to learn what they were trying to accomplish.  Finish Line Products follows the philosophy of contractor based formulation; letting the end user formulate the working characteristics of the products.  Finish Line Products strives to solve job site problems for clients and welcomes any suggestions for new product lines.
MISSION STATEMENT:
To solve the everyday drywall problems that drywall contractors have by listening to their needs and providing them with the highest quality service and most consistent products in the industry.
COMMITMENT:
Finish Line Products commits to its customer base to bring them peace of mind knowing if ever they have a problem with the quality of the products, representatives will be on the jobsite within 24 hours of being notified of that problem. Finish Line will 100% stand responsible for such setbacks, up to and including the replacement of the product to mend such problems.

	Only the most thorough research and development goes into each and every Finish Line® QUALITY Horse Product. Our goal is to bring you the finest quality products for your horse. We care about horses and always stress: Be good to your horse.SM

	Our products contain superior ingredients and not just a lot of fillers! We are proud to call our products: “Original, All Natural, Apple-flavored, Tested,” and filled with “Quality!” Botanicals, herbs, and natural ingredients compliment Finish Line® formulations to bring you the best possible products for your horse. We take equine healthcare seriously.SM 

	Finish Line® is the “Originator” of the apple-flavored electrolyte, we use the same unique apple flavor in many other feed supplements like Ultra Fire™ and Apple-A-Day™ Electrolyte. Our poultices are creamy smooth on your horses’ leg. Finish Line®'s poultices go on easy and come off easy! Kool-Out™ Poultice cools and tightens after every workout and Original Premium™ Poultice is for minor inflammation/irratation.

	In order to best serve its customers and the horses they care for, Finish Line® has, and is constantly in the development of, laboratory facilities at its factory location. The availability and wide range of analytical instruments has proven very valuable in both R&D (research and development) or new products, as well as QC (quality control) of existing products.

	With the scope of R&D, the lab has a large variety of small quantities of raw materials for the product of ‘lab batches’ of new products for testing. Glassware, digital and mechanical balances, pH meters, viscometers, microscopes, cameras, Gas Chromatographs, Liquid Chromatographs, computer-based data acquisition, thermometers (electronic, IR and mechanical types), vacuum and convection ovens, vacuum pump, spectrophotometer, centrifuge, reagents for specific test, deionized water supply, a freezer, pipettes and test papers are just some of the equipment available for R&D projects.

	Many of the same instruments and equipment are also used for QC or Quality Control projects. For example, several ingredients such as sodium hyaluronate, glucosamine hydrochloride, methylsulfonylmethane, and biotin are considered “High Asset Value.” They’re expensive, so each incoming shipment is tested to insure that the identity/potency is what it’s supposed to be. All other raw materials are quarantined on arrival and can be used in manufacture only after approval, per the procedure in Finish Line®’s NASC BMP manual (National Animal Supplement Council, Best Manufacturing Practices manual).

	The lab is headed by Nick Cinquino, BS Chemistry, with over 30 years experience as an analytical chemist and formulator. Nick has been associated with Finish Line since the early 1980’s.

	Some fascinating situations can develop as a result of lab work. Case in point: several years ago Finish Line® purchased several of the leading joint relief products and ran several tests on all. On adding up the solid material listed on the guaranteed analysis of one of the products (competitor brand), a theoretical solids of 28% was calculated. But the actual oven solids came out at only 8%. Something is obviously not right. Finish Line®’s laboratory can assure that this never happens to our products; they contain what’s stated on the label, guaranteed.

	The lab’s mission is in line with Finish Line®’s philosophy; to assist in the formulation, production and quality control of all Finish Line® products and processes, so you, the consumer gets the best possible value for your horse’s well being. The lab is located within the facility where all Finish Line® products are manufactured, so the lab assets can be applied immediately to an issue large or small at any time and for any product or process. Long term R&D formulation projects can last up to two years, with input from Veterinarians, Trainers, and specialists such as Farriers.

	Unanimously elected to the Florida Harness Racing Hall of Fame in 2009, only the second Veterinarian to be so honored. Mill Pond Equine Clinic, Coconut Creek, Florida.
