Sessa Capital Highlights Ashford Prime's Admissions Of Corporate Governance Weaknesses






Business Wire




May 10, 2016 9:00 AM EDT













 




























































  Sessa Capital (Master), L.P. ("Sessa"), owner of 8.2% of the outstanding common shares of Ashford Hospitality Prime, Inc. (NYSE:AHP) ("Ashford Prime" or the "Company"), today commented on the Company's announcement of a series of last-minute governance proposals that Sessa believes will do little to address the issues that have plagued Ashford Prime since its 2013 spin-off.  Sessa believes the incumbent directors' newest proposal, that Monty Bennett step down as CEO, is merely a ruse to suggest that real governance changes are underway. At most companies, a CEO change would be meaningful. But this is not the case at Ashford Prime, where the incumbent directors relinquished their power to appoint the CEO less than a year ago by approving a highly unusual contractual arrangement. In Sessa's view, changing the Company's CEO will be merely symbolic because, by contract, any CEO will be appointed by Ashford Inc and therefore beholden to Monty Bennett in his role as Ashford Inc's Chairman and CEO. Sessa believes this arrangement renders the Company's latest proposal a mere cosmetic change that leaves Monty Bennett's power over Ashford Prime unchecked.  Sessa also questions the incumbent directors' campaign promise that they might appoint new independent directors if they are re-elected. Sessa agrees that truly independent directors are needed at Ashford Prime, but Sessa believes that the governance problem at Ashford Prime isn't an insufficient number of directors, but rather the conflicts of the existing "independent" directors. The incumbent directors were all identified by Chairman Bennett and have personal, professional and financial intersections with him and his other companies. A larger board would be unwieldy in size, more expensive and chosen by incumbent directors who have already failed to protect shareholders' interests. Sessa believes that shareholders should be wary of director additions sourced by a board that includes:   A director who is a direct subordinate of Chairman Bennett and has worked for him for nearly 15 years;   A high school friend of more than 30 years of Chairman Bennett who serves on the Company's Compensation Committee;   A director whose independence was questioned by RiskMetrics while serving as a director of Ashford Prime's predecessor because of his receipt of a $100,000 bonus;   A director whose affiliated company sold assets to Ashford Prime's predecessor, which later took $50 million in impairment charges on the purchase; and   Two political cronies of Chairman Bennett, Texas State Representatives who raised so much campaign money from Chairman Bennett that he was a leading individual donor to each.    For shareholders who, like Sessa, believe new independent directors are needed, electing Sessa's highly qualified nominees on June 10 is a more direct and immediate path to accomplish this objective.

Sessa Capital, One Of Ashford Hospitality Prime's Largest Shareholders, Nominates Control Slate Of Five Highly Qualified Director Candidates For Election To Board At 2016 Annual Meeting






Business Wire




Jan 15, 2016 8:00 AM EST













 




























































  Sessa Capital (Master), L.P. ("Sessa"), owner of 8.2% of the outstanding common shares of Ashford Hospitality Prime, Inc. (NYSE:AHP) ("Ashford Prime" or the "Company") and Ashford Prime's third largest shareholder, today announced it will nominate a slate of five highly-qualified, independent directors for election at the Company's 2016 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.  Sessa's nominees will be Larry Cunningham, Phil Livingston, John Petry, Daniel Silvers and Chris Wheeler.  Sessa believes corporate governance failures have been an unshakable burden on Ashford Prime since it started trading as a public company in November 2013 and have only worsened over time. Therefore, Sessa has concluded that a sale process on a level playing field for all potential bidders is the best way to maximize value for all shareholders.  Despite a brief period of outperformance following the Company's announcement of its decision to pursue strategic alternatives, the stock has since resumed the downward slide it has exhibited since it started trading.  Additionally, since Sessa's initial investment, the Company has engaged in a number of conflict-of-interest transactions, reflecting poor corporate governance, and remained virtually silent on the status of the strategic review process announced by the Company on August 28, 2015. The Company's actions appear to benefit Monty Bennett, the Chairman and CEO of the Company and Chairman and CEO of its external manager Ashford Inc., at the expense of all shareholders.  Despite Sessa's repeated calls for the Company to address its corporate governance deficiencies and reverse the series of shareholder-unfriendly actions that have exacerbated the conflicts of interest inherent in Ashford Prime's organizational structure, the Company has only made matters worse.  Since June 2015, Ashford Prime has:   Amended its advisory agreement with Ashford Inc., an entity dominated by Mr. Bennett, in an attempt to impose a large termination fee if shareholders elect directors not acceptable to Ashford Inc.;   Completed a share issuance dilutive to the Chairman's own subsequent estimate of NAV 1 in order to purchase an asset at a cap rate much richer than its own properties are valued by the market; and   Purchased $16.6 million of stock in Ashford Inc. at a 59% premium at the time and an 88% premium to yesterday's close.    The termination fee payable to Ashford Inc. undercuts the integrity of the strategic review process. Management has estimated the termination fee to be up to $5 per share, or nearly 50% of the Company's $11.21 closing share price as of January 14, 2016. Quite simply, this fee makes a fair strategic process virtually impossible. The estimated fee is about 17 times the Company's annualized base advisory fee paid to Ashford Inc. Sessa believes a customary fee in the industry would be less than 1/5 that amount. If management's numbers are correct, the Company would likely pay more to terminate the advisory agreement than it would pay in base fees for the remainder of the agreement's entire 10-year term based on the Company's current market capitalization.
