History[edit]




Generac SB-375 commercial generator on base fuel tank, Ann Arbor, Michigan






A portable Generac generator mounted on a vehicle.


Founded in 1959, the company soon began producing portable generators for Sears, Roebuck and Co. under the Craftsman brand. During the 1970s, Generac expanded its offerings in the portable and recreational vehicle markets, and in the 1980s the company entered the commercial and industrial markets with its backup power generation systems.[7]
By end of the 1980s, the company was manufacturing residential, commercial and industrial generators, and in 1989, Generac introduced the first gaseous-fueled automatic home standby system.[7]
In 1992, Generac began private labeling generator sets for Caterpillar, Inc. As the partnership grew between the two companies, they discussed a potential acquisition of Generac by Caterpillar, although a deal was never finalized. In June 1996, Caterpillar decided to terminate the private labeling agreement. Generac then sued Caterpillar under the Wisconsin Fair Dealership Law ("WFDL"), the Sherman Antitrust Act, the Wisconsin common law concerning restrictive covenants, and the Illinois Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices Act.[8] The federal district court, in two separate orders, disposed of the action in Caterpillar's favor. Generac then challenged the lower court's rulings in the U.S. 7th Circuit Court of Appeals, which ruled that Generac's claims were properly dismissed by the lower court.[9] Generac continued to supply some transfer switches to Caterpillar until 2002, when Caterpillar changed suppliers.
In 1998, Generac sold its portable products division to the Beacon group, a private equity firm, who later sold it to Briggs & Stratton Corporation. Upon expiration of a non-compete agreement related to the sale in 2007, Generac re-entered the portable generator market in 2008.[7]
In late 2006, Generac was purchased by CCMP Capital of New York.[7] In 2009 CCMP took a write-off, described as a non-cash goodwill and trade name impairment charge, of $583.5 million against their purchase of Generac.[10] Aaron Jagdfeld was appointed president and chief executive officer in September, 2008 and is the current CEO.[7]
Generac goes public[edit]
On February 11, 2010, Generac Holdings Inc. (NYSE: GNRC), parent company of Generac Power Systems, Inc., began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol GNRC.[7] The initial public offering provided $224 million in net proceeds, which were used to pay down debt.[7]
Recognition[edit]
Generac is a recipient of Milwaukee Magazine’s “Best Places to Work” award for Southeastern Wisconsin.[11]
Generac's industrial sizing application, Power Design Pro, received silver in the 2010 Plant Engineering "Product of the Year" award.[12]
The company has also earned the Good Housekeeping Seal for its Guardian Series home standby generators and several portable generators.[13]
Generac was honored with the 2014 Natural Gas Generator Company of the Year Award from Frost & Sullivan for its contribution to the North American natural gas generator set industry.[14]
Products[edit]
Generac manufactures gaseous-fueled, diesel-fueled and bi-fuel engine-driven power generation equipment, modular paralleling systems, automatic transfer switches and small engines.[6] The company supplies products to the industrial, commercial, and portable generator markets through many different distributors. In December 2009, Generac introduced Generac Industrial Power (a rebranding of its industrial products division) to include new engines, new enclosures, ergonomic changes and aesthetic changes. This included a partnership with Fiat Powertrain Technologies to supply Generac with industrial diesel engines for use in industrial generators.[15]

In 1992, Generac began private labeling generator sets for Caterpillar, Inc. As the partnership grew between the two companies, they discussed a potential acquisition of Generac by Caterpillar, although a deal was never finalized. In June 1996, Caterpillar decided to terminate the private labeling agreement. Generac then sued Caterpillar under the Wisconsin Fair Dealership Law ("WFDL"), the Sherman Antitrust Act, the Wisconsin common law concerning restrictive covenants, and the Illinois Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices Act.[8] The federal district court, in two separate orders, disposed of the action in Caterpillar's favor. Generac then challenged the lower court's rulings in the U.S. 7th Circuit Court of Appeals, which ruled that Generac's claims were properly dismissed by the lower court.[9] Generac continued to supply some transfer switches to Caterpillar until 2002, when Caterpillar changed suppliers.
In 1998, Generac sold its portable products division to the Beacon group, a private equity firm, who later sold it to Briggs & Stratton Corporation. Upon expiration of a non-compete agreement related to the sale in 2007, Generac re-entered the portable generator market in 2008.[7]
In late 2006, Generac was purchased by CCMP Capital of New York.[7] In 2009 CCMP took a write-off, described as a non-cash goodwill and trade name impairment charge, of $583.5 million against their purchase of Generac.[10] Aaron Jagdfeld was appointed president and chief executive officer in September, 2008 and is the current CEO.[7]
Generac goes public[edit]
On February 11, 2010, Generac Holdings Inc. (NYSE: GNRC), parent company of Generac Power Systems, Inc., began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol GNRC.[7] The initial public offering provided $224 million in net proceeds, which were used to pay down debt.[7]
Recognition[edit]
Generac is a recipient of Milwaukee Magazine’s “Best Places to Work” award for Southeastern Wisconsin.[11]
Generac's industrial sizing application, Power Design Pro, received silver in the 2010 Plant Engineering "Product of the Year" award.[12]
The company has also earned the Good Housekeeping Seal for its Guardian Series home standby generators and several portable generators.[13]
Generac was honored with the 2014 Natural Gas Generator Company of the Year Award from Frost & Sullivan for its contribution to the North American natural gas generator set industry.[14]
Products[edit]
Generac manufactures gaseous-fueled, diesel-fueled and bi-fuel engine-driven power generation equipment, modular paralleling systems, automatic transfer switches and small engines.[6] The company supplies products to the industrial, commercial, and portable generator markets through many different distributors. In December 2009, Generac introduced Generac Industrial Power (a rebranding of its industrial products division) to include new engines, new enclosures, ergonomic changes and aesthetic changes. This included a partnership with Fiat Powertrain Technologies to supply Generac with industrial diesel engines for use in industrial generators.[15]

Generac Holdings Inc. Reports Unaudited Consolidated Earnings Results for the First Quarter Ended March 31, 2017; Reaffirms Earnings Guidance for the Year 2017; Provides Earnings Guidance for the Second Quarter, First Half and Second Half of Fiscal 2017
Apr 27 17
Generac Holdings Inc. reported unaudited consolidated earnings results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2017. For the quarter, net sales were $331,814,000 against $286,535,000 a year ago. Income from operations was $31,845,000 against $26,964,000 a year ago. Income before provision for income taxes was $21,100,000 against $15,931,000 a year ago. Net income attributable to company was $12,842,000 or $0.21 per diluted share against $10,208,000 or $0.15 per basic and diluted share a year ago. Net cash used in operating activities was $4,546,000 against net cash provided by operating activities of $22,151,000 a year ago. Expenditures for property and equipment were $3,548,000 against $7,093,000 a year ago. Adjusted EBITDA was $47,658,000 against $49,809,000 a year ago. Adjusted EBITDA attributable to company was $46,702,000 against $49,125,000 a year ago. Adjusted net income attributable to Generac Holdings Inc. was $25,789,000 or $0.41 per diluted share against $30,887,000 or $0.46 per diluted share a year ago. Free cash flow was $8,094,000 against $15,058,000 a year ago. The declines in cash flow were primarily driven by an increase in working capital investment during the current-year quarter including higher finished goods for residential products as inventory levels were replenished to more normalized levels following the strong demand experienced during the fourth quarter of 2016. Excluding this restructuring charges in the prior year, the decline in GAAP net income was driven by lower operating earnings as previously detailed and higher GAAP income taxes recorded during the current year quarter. 


The company is maintaining its prior guidance for full-year 2017. Net sales are still expected to increase between 5% to 7% as compared to the prior year, with core organic growth of between 1% to 3%. Net income margins, before deducting for non-controlling interests, are still expected to be between 7.5 to 8.0%, while adjusted EBITDA margins, also before deducting for non-controlling interests, are still expected to be between 19.0% to 19.5%. The top-line guidance assumes no material changes in the current macroeconomic environment and also assumes a power outage severity level for the remainder of the year similar to that experienced during 2016 excluding the impact of Hurricane Matthew. Operating and free cash flow generation is expected to improve over the remaining quarters and be strong for the full-year 2017, with the conversion of adjusted net income expected to be over 90%. The current year cash taxes reflect an expected cash tax rate of approximately 15% for the full year of 2017, while the prior year first quarter was based on an expected cash tax rate of approximately 9% for the full year 2016. As a reminder, the favorable tax shield of approximately $50 million through annual intangible amortization in tax return results in cash income tax rate being significantly lower than GAAP income tax rate of approximately 36% for 2017. 

The company also announced the guidance remains unchanged for the first half of the year expected to represent approximately 45% to 47% of total sales, and the second half, approximately 53% to 55%. By way of comparison, 2016 organic seasonality was 46% in the first half and 54% in the second half. second half 2017 adjusted EBITDA margins are forecasted to be appreciably better in comparison to the first half of the year. This improvement is expected to be the result of the increasing benefit from product cost reductions, a more favorable product mix, improved pricing and SG&A leverage on higher sales volumes for the back half of the year. 

For the second quarter of 2017, adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to improve sequentially between 275 to 300 basis points as compared to the first quarter and then further increased sequentially during the third and fourth quarters.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

Portable PowerWhere and When You Need It







                    The Power to
                    
                           Live. Work. Play.
                    



	Portable generators are a welcome addition to many activities at home, at work, and away. In an emergency, portable generators can provide critical backup power. They make camping and tailgating more comfortable. And contractors appreciate the flexibility portable power brings to the jobsite.






The Power to Live


	Many get their first introduction to portable generators when they need emergency power. During a power outage, Generac portable generators make sure the most important items—lights, refrigerators and freezers, sump pumps, even space heaters and window air conditioners—are up and running, minimizing any disruption to your lifestyle.

Portable Generators for Backup Power
                                





The Power to Work


	Utility power isn’t always available where and when you need to tackle home improvement projects. Take a Generac portable generator to that far corner of your property instead of running lengthy extension cords. Or rely upon portable power if you need to turn off utility power for extensive home improvement work.

The Power to Play


	Roughing it is only fun until you can’t make a cup of coffee or charge your cell phone. Bring a Generac portable generator to your next tailgate party or camping trip and you’ll have all the comforts of home wherever you are. Power kitchen appliances. Charge personal electronics. Watch TV or listen to music. Generac portable generators ensure the good times roll.

This allows you to back up your most critical appliances without running extension cords. And you can back up hard-wired appliances, like your furnace or well pump. Added convenience when you need it most.
