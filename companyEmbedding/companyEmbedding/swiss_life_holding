Swiss Life: exposure to Madoff products
16.12.2008
After conducting the necessary clarifications, Swiss Life has ascertained that it holds no direct investments in products managed by Madoff Investment Securities, but is exposed to an amount of roughly CHF 90 million via Fund of Funds offered by providers such as RMF, UBP and Reichmuth. This corresponds to less than 0.1% of Swiss Life's assets under management.

The Swiss Life Group is one of Europe's leading providers of life insurance and pension solutions. The Group offers individuals and corporations a broad range of products combined with comprehensive advice through its own sales force as well as brokers and banks in Switzerland, France and Germany. It provides internationally operating corporations with employee benefits solutions from a single source, and is among the global leaders in structured life and pension products for high net worth individuals with its centres of competence in Luxembourg, Liechtenstein and Singapore.

Swiss Life is the majority shareholder of the Hanover-based AWD Group, one of Europe's top financial services providers for the medium- and high-income customer segments. AWD offers its clients independent financial advisory services. Around 6300 advisors and intermediaries work for the AWD Group in ten European countries.

Swiss Life Holding Ltd, registered in Zurich, was founded in 1857 as Schweizerische Rentenanstalt. The shares of Swiss Life Holding Ltd are listed on the SIX Swiss Exchange (SLHN). The Swiss Life Group employs a staff of around 9000.

The same shall apply for the entry of orders as part of a quote.(2) An Exchange Participant may submit a description of his internal and external links to the EDP system of the Eurex Exchanges to the Market Surveillance Office of Eurex Germany or to the Surveillance and Enforcement Office of Eurex Zurich, with a view to a decision on whether the Exchange Participant acted knowingly within the meaning of paragraph 1. The details of the specifications of the description of the IT linkage pursuant to sentence 1 shall be determined by the Surveillance Offices of Eurex Germany and Eurex Zurich in agreement with the Boards of Management of the Eurex Exchanges. The specifications shall be subject to publication. Disclosure of said specifications to one of the two Surveillance Offices named above shall be deemed to be disclosure to both Eurex Surveillance Offices.(3) A cross trade or a pre-arranged trade is admissible if a participant in a cross-trade or a pre-arranged trade, prior to entering his order or quote, enters a cross request equivalent to the number of contracts of the order. The order or quote giving rise to the cross trade or pre-arranged trade must be entered one second at the earliest and 61 seconds at the latest with regard to Money Market Futures contracts, Fixed Income Futures contracts, Options on Money Market Futures contracts and options on Fixed Income Futures contracts, respectively 31 seconds at the latest with regard to all other futures and option contracts after having entered the cross request.
