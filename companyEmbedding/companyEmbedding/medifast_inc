Customer Reviews:
(Real reviews, by real customers.  Note: we've removed the names of other diet programs from these customer reviews.)


Better Than (Other Program) All The Way Around
This product is superior to (Other Program) on every level. WonderSlim tastes so much better, the cost is very reasonable, you don't get gouged in the wallet on shipping, delivery is FAST and the customer service leaves (Other Program) in the dust! There is no magic in (Other Program) ! Wonderslim is the best product I have found for weight loss and to help maintain weight loss. I wish everyone on (Other Program) would just try Wonderslim! Wonderslim works, tastes great, reasonable cost and World Class customer service!  - Claire from Connecticut



Losing weight and feeling great!!!!
This diet is wonderful. I would recommend it to all who are serious about losing weight. I've only been on the program for a week and 2 days and have lost 11 lbs.*  Everything tastes great. I know with the WonderSlim program I will reach my goal. - Shima from Virginia



I have completed my four week plan and "drum roll"...I have lost a total of 14 lbs! *
Losing that amount of weight is what I needed to jump start my new eating habits and lifestyle. The food was better than I thought it would be. I am very pleased with my results and new outlook on life. If you are skeptical about this plan...don't be. - JA from North Carolina



I Have Been Using (Other Program) 
I have been using the (Other Program) and this product is SUPERIOR to (Other Program) as far as taste. I love the plan! I wish I had known about WonderSlim before the other plan. I would have saved money and really been enjoying my food rather than choking down the horrible shakes! I told several friends about this plan and they have switched.  - Janice from Massachusetts



For someone who has tried every possible diet
throughout my lifetime, this is the easiest to follow. I never feel hungry, the food is very tasty and it's incredible how small portions of food can be so filling. It is easy to take your meals to work without planning. I have a sweetooth and rather eat dessert than meals, but with this plan I feel so satisfied I may skip the included dessert. - Mali from Puerto Rico



Delicious & Effective
I was previously on (Other Program) . But kept reading how Wonderslim is less expensive, tastes better and is just as effective, so I tried it. ALL TRUE!! Love it! I would highly recommend. Especially now that (Other Program) discontinued their discount program. Another plus with Wonderslim is that you don't need to keep your credit card on file for automatic delivery--You order when you want to. The minimum for free shipping is also much, much less than (Other Program) . - Mary from Pennsylvania



OMG! Loved it all!
I'm a former (Other Program) customer. I ordered their 4wk package and realized I only liked shakes and bars. With wonderslim, I LOVED IT ALL! I ordered it on Friday and it was at my post office on Monday! The shakes/puddings/smoothies mix very well. Sloppy Joe and mac n cheese was delish! Cheesecake tastes sinful! I'm losing weight and it tastes great! - Becki from New York



Liking these products
I am really enjoying the Wonderslim products and have lost 10 lbs in just over a week*. The shakes and bars are very good - and surprisingly filling. The Vegetarian Joe and Spicy Cheese and Pasta are excellent! I enjoy the hotcakes, oatmeal and cold cereal too. The soups are just so-so, I spice them up with salt and pepper. I have tried the competition and Wonderslim is superior in taste, texture and price. - Shannon from Texas

Losing weight and feeling great!!!!
This diet is wonderful. I would recommend it to all who are serious about losing weight. I've only been on the program for a week and 2 days and have lost 11 lbs.* Everything tastes great. I know with the WonderSlim program I will reach my goal..
- Shima from Virginia



I have completed my four week plan and "drum roll"...I have lost a total of 14 lbs! *
Losing that amount of weight is what I needed to jump start my new eating habits and lifestyle. The food was better than I thought it would be.I am very pleased with my results and new outlook on life. If you are skeptical about this plan...don't be.
- JA from North Carolina



For someone who has tried every possible diet
throughout my lifetime, this is the easiest to follow. I never feel hungry, the food is very tasty and it's incredible how small portions of food can be so filling. It is easy to take your meals to work without planning. I have a sweetooth and rather eat dessert than meals, but with this plan I feel so satisfied I may skip the included dessert.
- Mali from Puerto Rico

* Results not typical. Weight loss will vary for each person based on their individual weight, metabolism, age, activity level and commitment to their plan.

Clinically Proven, Doctor Recommended
Science sets Medifast and your weight-loss success apart from the rest.



Medifast is the brand recommended by over 20,000 doctors since 1980.


            Medifast has a long, clinical heritage of facilitating the weight loss success stories for thousands of customers and patients. It’s through our unique meal plans that we provide you with formulated nutrition and lifelong habits for weight management.
        

            Our story began with Dr. William Vitale. His specially formulated meal plan proved successful for his patients that, many times, needed to lose a significant amount of weight. His mission was that they do so healthily and with long-term results. His patients’
            success can now be yours.
        
Medifast is safe and effective

            Medifast has been used by doctors and physicians for many years. It’s only been within the past decade that Medifast was formulated to be available to you without a doctor’s supervision. Medifast is safe and effective to do on your own whether
            you want to lose 15 or 120 or more pounds.
        
Medifast Nutrition and How It Works to Make You Lose Weight

            Medifast weight loss meals are nutrient-dense and fortified with 24 vitamins and minerals, so you can lose pounds and inches without losing out on nutrition. Each meal has essentially the same nutritional profile, and has been designed to have enough
            low-fat protein and healthy fiber to help you feel full and satisfied, without the between-meal hunger that can sabotage a weight loss plan.
        
The Key?

            After a few days on either Medifast weight loss plan, your body will start to burn fat so you can lose weight while preserving muscle tissue.
        
Scientific Advisors to Ensure Continued Effectiveness

            Medifast employs a Scientific Advisory Board that’s composed of a distinguished panel of scientists and doctors. Their role is to review the effectiveness, safety, and nutritional benefits of Medifast’s products and programs. The board also
            helps develop new meals and supplements and investigates alternate weight-loss approaches for those with special medical or nutritional needs, such as patients with heart disease
            or those who follow a vegetarian diet. We have options for just about anyone.
        


                Clinical studies prove time and again that Medifast works.
            


                    Clinically proven safe and effective by researchers at major university teaching hospitals.
                

                    Studies published in major medical journals have proven meal replacements to be an effective method of weight loss and weight maintenance.
                




Studies

            Clinical studies prove time and again that Medifast works. Read the research here.*
        


Study 1

Nutrition Journal. Davis, et al.


                    This study compared the Medifast Program to a conventional USDA food-based diet of equal calories. After 16 weeks of weight loss, the results suggested that the Medifast program is a more effective strategy for producing robust initial weight loss and
                    for achieving improvements in a number of health-related parameters during weight maintenance.

Study 2

International Journal of Obesity. Shikany, et al.


                    This study compared the Medifast Program to a conventional food-based diet of equal calories. Medifast resulted in significantly greater reductions in body weight and fat compared with a food-based diet for 1 year after randomization.

What is a Medifast meal?
Medifast meals are the staple of the Medifast weight Loss method. Each serving counts as one meal out of your daily Medifast meal count. Meals are completely interchangeable. Each serving counts as one meal out of your daily Medifast meal count.
Choose from over 65 different weight loss meal options.

What’s in a Medifast meal?
Each Medifast meal is fortified with the essential vitamins and minerals you need for a healthy, sustained weight loss. Our carbohydrate-controlled, low-fat meals are all based on a similar nutritional footprint, so you’re assured of getting
            great nutrition every day.
Back to Top



Daily Lean and Green Meals
You can have your lean and green meals any time of day—breakfast, lunch, dinner, or in between—whatever works best for your schedule. If you like, you can divide the meal into two portions and eat half of it at a time. The choice is
            yours.
        
Every lean and green meal includes 5 to 7 oz. of lean protein, plus three servings of vegetables and up to two servings of healthy fats, depending on your lean protein choices. You put it all together to create an “official lean and green
            meal” or you can break it up throughout the day to reach your daily nutritional requirement.


About the “Lean”
Choose the appropriate serving size of any protein from the Medifast Lean Options list. We’ve broken down protein options into the Lean, Leaner,
                    and Leanest. All options are appropriate for the all Medifast weight loss plans—we've just divided it this way to help you make informed food choices.
If you require meatless choices, please refer to our Meatless Options List.
Get the Lean Options List »
Lean Options



About the “Green”
Each day, you’ll choose three servings from our Green Options list for each of your lean and green meals.
Again, to make it easy for you, we’ve broken down vegetable options into Lower, Moderate, and Higher Carbohydrate levels. All options are appropriate for the all Medifast weight loss plans.

Condiments
Keep the spice in your life while you lose weight! To flavor your meals and make your weight-loss plan more enjoyable, you have the option of adding condiments to your daily lean and green selections. Really, you can add them
            to any meal you choose. Our Condiments List will show you what you can add to your daily plan to spice up your meals. You’ll be surprised!

Medifast, Inc. is an American nutrition and weight loss company based in Owings Mills, Maryland. The company owns five subsidiaries: Jason Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Jason), Take Shape for Life, Inc. (TSFL), Jason Enterprises, Inc., Jason Properties, LLC and Seven Crondall, LLC. Medifast produces, distributes, and sells weight loss and other health-related products through websites, multi-level marketing, telemarketing, franchised weight loss clinics, and medical professionals.
The company is public with a market capitalization of $405 million, as of October 2014.[2]
Medifast was founded in 1980 by William Vitale, a medical doctor.[3] His products were sold directly to other doctors, who in turn prescribed them to their patients.
The company is publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange (symbol: MED).
On July 17, 1995, HealthRite (predecessor of Medifast) changed its name from Vitamin Specialties Corp.
In October 2010, Medifast was ranked number 1 on Forbes magazine's list of "America's 100 Best Small Companies".[4] The company was ranked 18th as of the 2014 list.[2]
In September 2012, Medifast's subsidiary, Jason Pharmaceuticals, paid a $3.7 million USD civil penalty for false advertising. The Federal Trade Commission and United States Department of Justice said that advertisements for the "Medifast 5 & 1 Plan" low-calorie diet told consumers they could "lose up to 2-5 pounds per week.", and that these weight-loss claims lacked a reasonable scientific basis, and were unsubstantiated. Under the settlement, any future claims made by the company must be backed by at least one human clinical study.[5][6]

Products feature ingredients sourced from places such as Morocco, Bolivia, Indonesia and the Philippines and are made with 25 vitamins and minerals as well as probiotics, the company said.

"With this introduction of innovative products, our health coaches will further their opportunity to transform lives not only in the United States, but over time to a diverse audience throughout the world," Mona Ameli, president of the Take Shape For Life division, said in an announcement.

Customer Reviews:
(Real reviews, by real customers.  Note: we've removed the names of other diet programs from these customer reviews.)


Better Than (Other Program) All The Way Around
This product is superior to (Other Program) on every level. WonderSlim tastes so much better, the cost is very reasonable, you don't get gouged in the wallet on shipping, delivery is FAST and the customer service leaves (Other Program) in the dust! There is no magic in (Other Program) ! Wonderslim is the best product I have found for weight loss and to help maintain weight loss. I wish everyone on (Other Program) would just try Wonderslim! Wonderslim works, tastes great, reasonable cost and World Class customer service!  - Claire from Connecticut



Losing weight and feeling great!!!!
This diet is wonderful. I would recommend it to all who are serious about losing weight. I've only been on the program for a week and 2 days and have lost 11 lbs.*  Everything tastes great. I know with the WonderSlim program I will reach my goal. - Shima from Virginia



I have completed my four week plan and "drum roll"...I have lost a total of 14 lbs! *
Losing that amount of weight is what I needed to jump start my new eating habits and lifestyle. The food was better than I thought it would be. I am very pleased with my results and new outlook on life. If you are skeptical about this plan...don't be. - JA from North Carolina



I Have Been Using (Other Program) 
I have been using the (Other Program) and this product is SUPERIOR to (Other Program) as far as taste. I love the plan! I wish I had known about WonderSlim before the other plan. I would have saved money and really been enjoying my food rather than choking down the horrible shakes! I told several friends about this plan and they have switched.  - Janice from Massachusetts



For someone who has tried every possible diet
throughout my lifetime, this is the easiest to follow. I never feel hungry, the food is very tasty and it's incredible how small portions of food can be so filling. It is easy to take your meals to work without planning. I have a sweetooth and rather eat dessert than meals, but with this plan I feel so satisfied I may skip the included dessert. - Mali from Puerto Rico



Delicious & Effective
I was previously on (Other Program) . But kept reading how Wonderslim is less expensive, tastes better and is just as effective, so I tried it. ALL TRUE!! Love it! I would highly recommend. Especially now that (Other Program) discontinued their discount program. Another plus with Wonderslim is that you don't need to keep your credit card on file for automatic delivery--You order when you want to. The minimum for free shipping is also much, much less than (Other Program) . - Mary from Pennsylvania



OMG! Loved it all!
I'm a former (Other Program) customer. I ordered their 4wk package and realized I only liked shakes and bars. With wonderslim, I LOVED IT ALL! I ordered it on Friday and it was at my post office on Monday! The shakes/puddings/smoothies mix very well. Sloppy Joe and mac n cheese was delish! Cheesecake tastes sinful! I'm losing weight and it tastes great! - Becki from New York



Liking these products
I am really enjoying the Wonderslim products and have lost 10 lbs in just over a week*. The shakes and bars are very good - and surprisingly filling. The Vegetarian Joe and Spicy Cheese and Pasta are excellent! I enjoy the hotcakes, oatmeal and cold cereal too. The soups are just so-so, I spice them up with salt and pepper. I have tried the competition and Wonderslim is superior in taste, texture and price. - Shannon from Texas

* Results not typical. Weight loss will vary for each person based on their individual weight, metabolism, age, activity level and commitment to their plan.

This diet is wonderful. I would recommend it to all who are serious about losing weight. I've only been on the program for a week and 2 days and have lost 11 lbs.* Everything tastes great. I know with the WonderSlim program I will reach my goal..
- Shima from Virginia



I have completed my four week plan and "drum roll"...I have lost a total of 14 lbs! *
Losing that amount of weight is what I needed to jump start my new eating habits and lifestyle. The food was better than I thought it would be.I am very pleased with my results and new outlook on life. If you are skeptical about this plan...don't be.
- JA from North Carolina



For someone who has tried every possible diet
throughout my lifetime, this is the easiest to follow. I never feel hungry, the food is very tasty and it's incredible how small portions of food can be so filling. It is easy to take your meals to work without planning. I have a sweetooth and rather eat dessert than meals, but with this plan I feel so satisfied I may skip the included dessert.
- Mali from Puerto Rico

* Results not typical. Weight loss will vary for each person based on their individual weight, metabolism, age, activity level and commitment to their plan.

Clinically Proven, Doctor Recommended
Science sets Medifast and your weight-loss success apart from the rest.



Medifast is the brand recommended by over 20,000 doctors since 1980.


            Medifast has a long, clinical heritage of facilitating the weight loss success stories for thousands of customers and patients. It’s through our unique meal plans that we provide you with formulated nutrition and lifelong habits for weight management.
        

            Our story began with Dr. William Vitale. His specially formulated meal plan proved successful for his patients that, many times, needed to lose a significant amount of weight. His mission was that they do so healthily and with long-term results. His patients’
            success can now be yours.
        
Medifast is safe and effective

            Medifast has been used by doctors and physicians for many years. It’s only been within the past decade that Medifast was formulated to be available to you without a doctor’s supervision. Medifast is safe and effective to do on your own whether
            you want to lose 15 or 120 or more pounds.
        
Medifast Nutrition and How It Works to Make You Lose Weight

            Medifast weight loss meals are nutrient-dense and fortified with 24 vitamins and minerals, so you can lose pounds and inches without losing out on nutrition. Each meal has essentially the same nutritional profile, and has been designed to have enough
            low-fat protein and healthy fiber to help you feel full and satisfied, without the between-meal hunger that can sabotage a weight loss plan.
        
The Key?

            After a few days on either Medifast weight loss plan, your body will start to burn fat so you can lose weight while preserving muscle tissue.
        
Scientific Advisors to Ensure Continued Effectiveness

            Medifast employs a Scientific Advisory Board that’s composed of a distinguished panel of scientists and doctors. Their role is to review the effectiveness, safety, and nutritional benefits of Medifast’s products and programs. The board also
            helps develop new meals and supplements and investigates alternate weight-loss approaches for those with special medical or nutritional needs, such as patients with heart disease
            or those who follow a vegetarian diet. We have options for just about anyone.
        


                Clinical studies prove time and again that Medifast works.
            


                    Clinically proven safe and effective by researchers at major university teaching hospitals.
                

                    Studies published in major medical journals have proven meal replacements to be an effective method of weight loss and weight maintenance.
                




Studies

            Clinical studies prove time and again that Medifast works. Read the research here.*
        


Study 1

Nutrition Journal. Davis, et al.


                    This study compared the Medifast Program to a conventional USDA food-based diet of equal calories. After 16 weeks of weight loss, the results suggested that the Medifast program is a more effective strategy for producing robust initial weight loss and
                    for achieving improvements in a number of health-related parameters during weight maintenance.

Study 2

International Journal of Obesity. Shikany, et al.


                    This study compared the Medifast Program to a conventional food-based diet of equal calories. Medifast resulted in significantly greater reductions in body weight and fat compared with a food-based diet for 1 year after randomization.

Medifast, Inc. is an American nutrition and weight loss company based in Owings Mills, Maryland. The company owns five subsidiaries: Jason Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Jason), Take Shape for Life, Inc. (TSFL), Jason Enterprises, Inc., Jason Properties, LLC and Seven Crondall, LLC. Medifast produces, distributes, and sells weight loss and other health-related products through websites, multi-level marketing, telemarketing, franchised weight loss clinics, and medical professionals.
The company is public with a market capitalization of $405 million, as of October 2014.[2]
Medifast was founded in 1980 by William Vitale, a medical doctor.[3] His products were sold directly to other doctors, who in turn prescribed them to their patients.
The company is publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange (symbol: MED).
On July 17, 1995, HealthRite (predecessor of Medifast) changed its name from Vitamin Specialties Corp.
In October 2010, Medifast was ranked number 1 on Forbes magazine's list of "America's 100 Best Small Companies".[4] The company was ranked 18th as of the 2014 list.[2]
In September 2012, Medifast's subsidiary, Jason Pharmaceuticals, paid a $3.7 million USD civil penalty for false advertising. The Federal Trade Commission and United States Department of Justice said that advertisements for the "Medifast 5 & 1 Plan" low-calorie diet told consumers they could "lose up to 2-5 pounds per week.", and that these weight-loss claims lacked a reasonable scientific basis, and were unsubstantiated. Under the settlement, any future claims made by the company must be backed by at least one human clinical study.[5][6]

Medifast, Inc. is an American nutrition and weight loss company based in Owings Mills, Maryland. The company owns five subsidiaries: Jason Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Jason), Take Shape for Life, Inc. (TSFL), Jason Enterprises, Inc., Jason Properties, LLC and Seven Crondall, LLC. Medifast produces, distributes, and sells weight loss and other health-related products through websites, multi-level marketing, telemarketing, franchised weight loss clinics, and medical professionals.
The company is public with a market capitalization of $405 million, as of October 2014.[2]
Medifast was founded in 1980 by William Vitale, a medical doctor.[3] His products were sold directly to other doctors, who in turn prescribed them to their patients.
The company is publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange (symbol: MED).
On July 17, 1995, HealthRite (predecessor of Medifast) changed its name from Vitamin Specialties Corp.
In October 2010, Medifast was ranked number 1 on Forbes magazine's list of "America's 100 Best Small Companies".[4] The company was ranked 18th as of the 2014 list.[2]
In September 2012, Medifast's subsidiary, Jason Pharmaceuticals, paid a $3.7 million USD civil penalty for false advertising. The Federal Trade Commission and United States Department of Justice said that advertisements for the "Medifast 5 & 1 Plan" low-calorie diet told consumers they could "lose up to 2-5 pounds per week.", and that these weight-loss claims lacked a reasonable scientific basis, and were unsubstantiated. Under the settlement, any future claims made by the company must be backed by at least one human clinical study.[5][6]

Medifast, Inc. is an American nutrition and weight loss company based in Owings Mills, Maryland. The company owns five subsidiaries: Jason Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Jason), Take Shape for Life, Inc. (TSFL), Jason Enterprises, Inc., Jason Properties, LLC and Seven Crondall, LLC. Medifast produces, distributes, and sells weight loss and other health-related products through websites, multi-level marketing, telemarketing, franchised weight loss clinics, and medical professionals.
The company is public with a market capitalization of $405 million, as of October 2014.[2]
Medifast was founded in 1980 by William Vitale, a medical doctor.[3] His products were sold directly to other doctors, who in turn prescribed them to their patients.
The company is publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange (symbol: MED).
On July 17, 1995, HealthRite (predecessor of Medifast) changed its name from Vitamin Specialties Corp.
In October 2010, Medifast was ranked number 1 on Forbes magazine's list of "America's 100 Best Small Companies".[4] The company was ranked 18th as of the 2014 list.[2]
In September 2012, Medifast's subsidiary, Jason Pharmaceuticals, paid a $3.7 million USD civil penalty for false advertising. The Federal Trade Commission and United States Department of Justice said that advertisements for the "Medifast 5 & 1 Plan" low-calorie diet told consumers they could "lose up to 2-5 pounds per week.", and that these weight-loss claims lacked a reasonable scientific basis, and were unsubstantiated. Under the settlement, any future claims made by the company must be backed by at least one human clinical study.[5][6]
