 In 1995, Hiroshi Okuda, president of Toyota Motor Corp., considers whether to push for a more aggressive launch of the Toyota Prius--an automobile that incorporates Toyota's new and technically advanced hybrid power train. This launch decision allows discussion of the importance of the Prius in Toyota's overall product strategy and explores issues ranging from market structure to competitive advantage and competitive dynamics.

History[edit]
TMCA first began in 1958 where Toyota Land Cruisers were imported by Thiess Toyota for the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric scheme. By 1963, assembly of Toyota vehicles in Australia by Australian Motor Industries (AMI) had begun, taking place at the production plant in Port Melbourne, Victoria. The production line of Toyota vehicles in 1963 was devoted to the Toyota Tiara. One of the leading forces of getting Toyota established in Australia was Kenneth Hougham.[citation needed]
In 1972 Toyota bought out British Leyland's interest in AMI[3] and announced plans to spend A$27 million on an engine and gearbox plant.[3]
A production plant in Altona, Victoria, was established and began the production of engines in 1978, following the progressive growth of AMI. After Toyota's products came in for heavy criticism regarding their handling, a handling package developed specifically for the Australian market was introduced in 1981.[4]
The first AMI exported car was a Toyota Corona wagon in 1986 headed for New Zealand.
The one-millionth locally built Toyota was produced in 1992.
In 1994, all vehicle manufacturing operations were moved from Port Melbourne to Altona. The last vehicle produced at the Port Melbourne plant was a Toyota Camry and the first vehicle produced at the Altona plant a Toyota Corolla. Port Melbourne continued performing minor operations for TMCA.
The two-millionth locally built Toyota was produced in 2004.
In 2005, the ten-millionth worldwide Camry was built at TMCA's Altona plant.
The complete closure and end of all Toyota production operations at the Port Melbourne plant took place in May 2006. All manufacturing was shifted to Altona.
The milestone of the 500,000th TMCA vehicle export also occurred in May 2006. The vehicle was a Toyota Camry, headed for New Zealand.
Throughout TMCA's history, many Toyota vehicles have been built at either Altona or Port Melbourne, including the Toyota Tiara, the Toyota Corona, the Toyota Crown, the Toyota Corolla, the Toyota Camry and the Toyota Avalon. The Toyota Land Cruiser was never built in Australia.
As of 2006, TMCA's Altona plant in Victoria produces the Camry. Production of the Avalon has ceased, due for replacement on the manufacturing line by the Toyota Aurion, which shares many components with the Camry. TMCA had expressed interests in locally building the Toyota Kluger 4WD at Altona in the future.
TMCA started to build the new Camry Hybrid in 2010 after securing a $35 million subsidy from the Federal Government.[5] The first locally-made Australian Toyota Hybrid Camry was completed and revealed to public on 11 December 2009, driven by the then prime minister Kevin Rudd.
On 10 February 2014, it was announced that by the end of 2017, Toyota would cease manufacturing vehicles and engines in Australia.[1] [6][7] The decision was based on the unfavourable Australian dollar making exports not viable, the high cost of local manufacture and the high amount of competition in a relatively small local market.[8] The company plans to consolidate its corporate functions in Melbourne by the end of 2017. The head office will remain in Port Melbourne and the Altona plant will be retained for other functions. The workforce is expected to be reduced from 3,900 to 1,300.[9]
Employees[edit]
As of 31 March 2015 it had 3,982 employees including 79 contractors located across the country. The majority of its employees are based at the manufacturing plant in Altona, Victoria. 15 per cent of its employees are female and 85 are male.[citation needed]
The decision to stop manufacturing in Australia by the end of 2017 has had and will continue to have a significant impact on Toyota Australia's employees. After it stops manufacturing by the end of 2017, Toyota expects its workforce will reduce from around 3,900 people to approximately 1,300. This will include the loss of both manufacturing and corporate jobs as well as the creation of some new roles.[citation needed]
Manufacturing[edit]
Toyota built cars in Victoria, Australia between 1963-2017.
It currently builds three models—Camry, Camry Hybrid and Aurion—for domestic and export customers. The fully integrated Altona manufacturing plant incorporates state-of-the-art weld, paint and assembly shops to produce cars that have been independently recognised as Australia's best quality locally built vehicles.
in February 2014, Toyota Australia announced its decision to close its manufacturing plant by the end of 2017 and become a national sales and distribution company.
Toyota vehicles built in Australia:

Tiara: 1963–1965
Crown: 1966–1980
Corona: 1965–1987
Camry: 1987–2017
Corolla: 1968–1999
Apollo: 1989–1996
Nova: 1989–1996
Avalon: 2000–2005
Aurion: 2006–2017
Camry Hybrid: 2009–2017

Altona plant[edit]
The Altona plant is the Toyota Australia manufacturing facility that operates in the Melbourne suburb of Altona. It opened in 1994, replacing the previous Port Melbourne site, but is scheduled to close in 2017. The plant produces the Camry and Aurion for sale locally in Australasia and for export to the Middle East. Until the early 2000s, export to East and Southeast Asia also occurred. The plant also manufactured the Avalon between 2000 and 2005.
In December 2009, full-scale production of the new Australian Camry Hybrid commenced.[10] On 11 December 2009, manufacture of the first locally-made Camry Hybrid was completed and revealed to the public, writing a new page in the history of the Australian automotive industry.
In April 2012, Toyota forcibly retrenched 350 workers. Toyota received criticism for the manner in which the process was carried out; for example, deploying security guards to escort sacked staff.[11]
The plant is scheduled to close at the end of 2017, marking the end of automobile manufacturing in Australia.
Sales[edit]
Toyota Australia currently holds the largest market share of Australia's new car market.

History[edit]
TMCA first began in 1958 where Toyota Land Cruisers were imported by Thiess Toyota for the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric scheme. By 1963, assembly of Toyota vehicles in Australia by Australian Motor Industries (AMI) had begun, taking place at the production plant in Port Melbourne, Victoria. The production line of Toyota vehicles in 1963 was devoted to the Toyota Tiara. One of the leading forces of getting Toyota established in Australia was Kenneth Hougham.[citation needed]
In 1972 Toyota bought out British Leyland's interest in AMI[3] and announced plans to spend A$27 million on an engine and gearbox plant.[3]
A production plant in Altona, Victoria, was established and began the production of engines in 1978, following the progressive growth of AMI. After Toyota's products came in for heavy criticism regarding their handling, a handling package developed specifically for the Australian market was introduced in 1981.[4]
The first AMI exported car was a Toyota Corona wagon in 1986 headed for New Zealand.
The one-millionth locally built Toyota was produced in 1992.
In 1994, all vehicle manufacturing operations were moved from Port Melbourne to Altona. The last vehicle produced at the Port Melbourne plant was a Toyota Camry and the first vehicle produced at the Altona plant a Toyota Corolla. Port Melbourne continued performing minor operations for TMCA.
The two-millionth locally built Toyota was produced in 2004.
In 2005, the ten-millionth worldwide Camry was built at TMCA's Altona plant.
The complete closure and end of all Toyota production operations at the Port Melbourne plant took place in May 2006. All manufacturing was shifted to Altona.
The milestone of the 500,000th TMCA vehicle export also occurred in May 2006. The vehicle was a Toyota Camry, headed for New Zealand.
Throughout TMCA's history, many Toyota vehicles have been built at either Altona or Port Melbourne, including the Toyota Tiara, the Toyota Corona, the Toyota Crown, the Toyota Corolla, the Toyota Camry and the Toyota Avalon. The Toyota Land Cruiser was never built in Australia.
As of 2006, TMCA's Altona plant in Victoria produces the Camry. Production of the Avalon has ceased, due for replacement on the manufacturing line by the Toyota Aurion, which shares many components with the Camry. TMCA had expressed interests in locally building the Toyota Kluger 4WD at Altona in the future.
TMCA started to build the new Camry Hybrid in 2010 after securing a $35 million subsidy from the Federal Government.[5] The first locally-made Australian Toyota Hybrid Camry was completed and revealed to public on 11 December 2009, driven by the then prime minister Kevin Rudd.
On 10 February 2014, it was announced that by the end of 2017, Toyota would cease manufacturing vehicles and engines in Australia.[1] [6][7] The decision was based on the unfavourable Australian dollar making exports not viable, the high cost of local manufacture and the high amount of competition in a relatively small local market.[8] The company plans to consolidate its corporate functions in Melbourne by the end of 2017. The head office will remain in Port Melbourne and the Altona plant will be retained for other functions. The workforce is expected to be reduced from 3,900 to 1,300.[9]
Employees[edit]
As of 31 March 2015 it had 3,982 employees including 79 contractors located across the country. The majority of its employees are based at the manufacturing plant in Altona, Victoria. 15 per cent of its employees are female and 85 are male.[citation needed]
The decision to stop manufacturing in Australia by the end of 2017 has had and will continue to have a significant impact on Toyota Australia's employees. After it stops manufacturing by the end of 2017, Toyota expects its workforce will reduce from around 3,900 people to approximately 1,300. This will include the loss of both manufacturing and corporate jobs as well as the creation of some new roles.[citation needed]
Manufacturing[edit]
Toyota built cars in Victoria, Australia between 1963-2017.
It currently builds three models—Camry, Camry Hybrid and Aurion—for domestic and export customers. The fully integrated Altona manufacturing plant incorporates state-of-the-art weld, paint and assembly shops to produce cars that have been independently recognised as Australia's best quality locally built vehicles.
in February 2014, Toyota Australia announced its decision to close its manufacturing plant by the end of 2017 and become a national sales and distribution company.
Toyota vehicles built in Australia:

Tiara: 1963–1965
Crown: 1966–1980
Corona: 1965–1987
Camry: 1987–2017
Corolla: 1968–1999
Apollo: 1989–1996
Nova: 1989–1996
Avalon: 2000–2005
Aurion: 2006–2017
Camry Hybrid: 2009–2017

Altona plant[edit]
The Altona plant is the Toyota Australia manufacturing facility that operates in the Melbourne suburb of Altona. It opened in 1994, replacing the previous Port Melbourne site, but is scheduled to close in 2017. The plant produces the Camry and Aurion for sale locally in Australasia and for export to the Middle East. Until the early 2000s, export to East and Southeast Asia also occurred. The plant also manufactured the Avalon between 2000 and 2005.
In December 2009, full-scale production of the new Australian Camry Hybrid commenced.[10] On 11 December 2009, manufacture of the first locally-made Camry Hybrid was completed and revealed to the public, writing a new page in the history of the Australian automotive industry.
In April 2012, Toyota forcibly retrenched 350 workers. Toyota received criticism for the manner in which the process was carried out; for example, deploying security guards to escort sacked staff.[11]
The plant is scheduled to close at the end of 2017, marking the end of automobile manufacturing in Australia.
Sales[edit]
Toyota Australia currently holds the largest market share of Australia's new car market.

History[edit]
TMCA first began in 1958 where Toyota Land Cruisers were imported by Thiess Toyota for the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric scheme. By 1963, assembly of Toyota vehicles in Australia by Australian Motor Industries (AMI) had begun, taking place at the production plant in Port Melbourne, Victoria. The production line of Toyota vehicles in 1963 was devoted to the Toyota Tiara. One of the leading forces of getting Toyota established in Australia was Kenneth Hougham.[citation needed]
In 1972 Toyota bought out British Leyland's interest in AMI[3] and announced plans to spend A$27 million on an engine and gearbox plant.[3]
A production plant in Altona, Victoria, was established and began the production of engines in 1978, following the progressive growth of AMI. After Toyota's products came in for heavy criticism regarding their handling, a handling package developed specifically for the Australian market was introduced in 1981.[4]
The first AMI exported car was a Toyota Corona wagon in 1986 headed for New Zealand.
The one-millionth locally built Toyota was produced in 1992.
In 1994, all vehicle manufacturing operations were moved from Port Melbourne to Altona. The last vehicle produced at the Port Melbourne plant was a Toyota Camry and the first vehicle produced at the Altona plant a Toyota Corolla. Port Melbourne continued performing minor operations for TMCA.
The two-millionth locally built Toyota was produced in 2004.
In 2005, the ten-millionth worldwide Camry was built at TMCA's Altona plant.
The complete closure and end of all Toyota production operations at the Port Melbourne plant took place in May 2006. All manufacturing was shifted to Altona.
The milestone of the 500,000th TMCA vehicle export also occurred in May 2006. The vehicle was a Toyota Camry, headed for New Zealand.
Throughout TMCA's history, many Toyota vehicles have been built at either Altona or Port Melbourne, including the Toyota Tiara, the Toyota Corona, the Toyota Crown, the Toyota Corolla, the Toyota Camry and the Toyota Avalon. The Toyota Land Cruiser was never built in Australia.
As of 2006, TMCA's Altona plant in Victoria produces the Camry. Production of the Avalon has ceased, due for replacement on the manufacturing line by the Toyota Aurion, which shares many components with the Camry. TMCA had expressed interests in locally building the Toyota Kluger 4WD at Altona in the future.
TMCA started to build the new Camry Hybrid in 2010 after securing a $35 million subsidy from the Federal Government.[5] The first locally-made Australian Toyota Hybrid Camry was completed and revealed to public on 11 December 2009, driven by the then prime minister Kevin Rudd.
On 10 February 2014, it was announced that by the end of 2017, Toyota would cease manufacturing vehicles and engines in Australia.[1] [6][7] The decision was based on the unfavourable Australian dollar making exports not viable, the high cost of local manufacture and the high amount of competition in a relatively small local market.[8] The company plans to consolidate its corporate functions in Melbourne by the end of 2017. The head office will remain in Port Melbourne and the Altona plant will be retained for other functions. The workforce is expected to be reduced from 3,900 to 1,300.[9]
Employees[edit]
As of 31 March 2015 it had 3,982 employees including 79 contractors located across the country. The majority of its employees are based at the manufacturing plant in Altona, Victoria. 15 per cent of its employees are female and 85 are male.[citation needed]
The decision to stop manufacturing in Australia by the end of 2017 has had and will continue to have a significant impact on Toyota Australia's employees. After it stops manufacturing by the end of 2017, Toyota expects its workforce will reduce from around 3,900 people to approximately 1,300. This will include the loss of both manufacturing and corporate jobs as well as the creation of some new roles.[citation needed]
Manufacturing[edit]
Toyota built cars in Victoria, Australia between 1963-2017.
It currently builds three models—Camry, Camry Hybrid and Aurion—for domestic and export customers. The fully integrated Altona manufacturing plant incorporates state-of-the-art weld, paint and assembly shops to produce cars that have been independently recognised as Australia's best quality locally built vehicles.
in February 2014, Toyota Australia announced its decision to close its manufacturing plant by the end of 2017 and become a national sales and distribution company.
Toyota vehicles built in Australia:

Tiara: 1963–1965
Crown: 1966–1980
Corona: 1965–1987
Camry: 1987–2017
Corolla: 1968–1999
Apollo: 1989–1996
Nova: 1989–1996
Avalon: 2000–2005
Aurion: 2006–2017
Camry Hybrid: 2009–2017

Altona plant[edit]
The Altona plant is the Toyota Australia manufacturing facility that operates in the Melbourne suburb of Altona. It opened in 1994, replacing the previous Port Melbourne site, but is scheduled to close in 2017. The plant produces the Camry and Aurion for sale locally in Australasia and for export to the Middle East. Until the early 2000s, export to East and Southeast Asia also occurred. The plant also manufactured the Avalon between 2000 and 2005.
In December 2009, full-scale production of the new Australian Camry Hybrid commenced.[10] On 11 December 2009, manufacture of the first locally-made Camry Hybrid was completed and revealed to the public, writing a new page in the history of the Australian automotive industry.
In April 2012, Toyota forcibly retrenched 350 workers. Toyota received criticism for the manner in which the process was carried out; for example, deploying security guards to escort sacked staff.[11]
The plant is scheduled to close at the end of 2017, marking the end of automobile manufacturing in Australia.
Sales[edit]
Toyota Australia currently holds the largest market share of Australia's new car market.

History[edit]
TMCA first began in 1958 where Toyota Land Cruisers were imported by Thiess Toyota for the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric scheme. By 1963, assembly of Toyota vehicles in Australia by Australian Motor Industries (AMI) had begun, taking place at the production plant in Port Melbourne, Victoria. The production line of Toyota vehicles in 1963 was devoted to the Toyota Tiara. One of the leading forces of getting Toyota established in Australia was Kenneth Hougham.[citation needed]
In 1972 Toyota bought out British Leyland's interest in AMI[3] and announced plans to spend A$27 million on an engine and gearbox plant.[3]
A production plant in Altona, Victoria, was established and began the production of engines in 1978, following the progressive growth of AMI. After Toyota's products came in for heavy criticism regarding their handling, a handling package developed specifically for the Australian market was introduced in 1981.[4]
The first AMI exported car was a Toyota Corona wagon in 1986 headed for New Zealand.
The one-millionth locally built Toyota was produced in 1992.
In 1994, all vehicle manufacturing operations were moved from Port Melbourne to Altona. The last vehicle produced at the Port Melbourne plant was a Toyota Camry and the first vehicle produced at the Altona plant a Toyota Corolla. Port Melbourne continued performing minor operations for TMCA.
The two-millionth locally built Toyota was produced in 2004.
In 2005, the ten-millionth worldwide Camry was built at TMCA's Altona plant.
The complete closure and end of all Toyota production operations at the Port Melbourne plant took place in May 2006. All manufacturing was shifted to Altona.
The milestone of the 500,000th TMCA vehicle export also occurred in May 2006. The vehicle was a Toyota Camry, headed for New Zealand.
Throughout TMCA's history, many Toyota vehicles have been built at either Altona or Port Melbourne, including the Toyota Tiara, the Toyota Corona, the Toyota Crown, the Toyota Corolla, the Toyota Camry and the Toyota Avalon. The Toyota Land Cruiser was never built in Australia.
As of 2006, TMCA's Altona plant in Victoria produces the Camry. Production of the Avalon has ceased, due for replacement on the manufacturing line by the Toyota Aurion, which shares many components with the Camry. TMCA had expressed interests in locally building the Toyota Kluger 4WD at Altona in the future.
TMCA started to build the new Camry Hybrid in 2010 after securing a $35 million subsidy from the Federal Government.[5] The first locally-made Australian Toyota Hybrid Camry was completed and revealed to public on 11 December 2009, driven by the then prime minister Kevin Rudd.
On 10 February 2014, it was announced that by the end of 2017, Toyota would cease manufacturing vehicles and engines in Australia.[1] [6][7] The decision was based on the unfavourable Australian dollar making exports not viable, the high cost of local manufacture and the high amount of competition in a relatively small local market.[8] The company plans to consolidate its corporate functions in Melbourne by the end of 2017. The head office will remain in Port Melbourne and the Altona plant will be retained for other functions. The workforce is expected to be reduced from 3,900 to 1,300.[9]
Employees[edit]
As of 31 March 2015 it had 3,982 employees including 79 contractors located across the country. The majority of its employees are based at the manufacturing plant in Altona, Victoria. 15 per cent of its employees are female and 85 are male.[citation needed]
The decision to stop manufacturing in Australia by the end of 2017 has had and will continue to have a significant impact on Toyota Australia's employees. After it stops manufacturing by the end of 2017, Toyota expects its workforce will reduce from around 3,900 people to approximately 1,300. This will include the loss of both manufacturing and corporate jobs as well as the creation of some new roles.[citation needed]
Manufacturing[edit]
Toyota built cars in Victoria, Australia between 1963-2017.
It currently builds three models—Camry, Camry Hybrid and Aurion—for domestic and export customers. The fully integrated Altona manufacturing plant incorporates state-of-the-art weld, paint and assembly shops to produce cars that have been independently recognised as Australia's best quality locally built vehicles.
in February 2014, Toyota Australia announced its decision to close its manufacturing plant by the end of 2017 and become a national sales and distribution company.
Toyota vehicles built in Australia:

Tiara: 1963–1965
Crown: 1966–1980
Corona: 1965–1987
Camry: 1987–2017
Corolla: 1968–1999
Apollo: 1989–1996
Nova: 1989–1996
Avalon: 2000–2005
Aurion: 2006–2017
Camry Hybrid: 2009–2017

Altona plant[edit]
The Altona plant is the Toyota Australia manufacturing facility that operates in the Melbourne suburb of Altona. It opened in 1994, replacing the previous Port Melbourne site, but is scheduled to close in 2017. The plant produces the Camry and Aurion for sale locally in Australasia and for export to the Middle East. Until the early 2000s, export to East and Southeast Asia also occurred. The plant also manufactured the Avalon between 2000 and 2005.
In December 2009, full-scale production of the new Australian Camry Hybrid commenced.[10] On 11 December 2009, manufacture of the first locally-made Camry Hybrid was completed and revealed to the public, writing a new page in the history of the Australian automotive industry.
In April 2012, Toyota forcibly retrenched 350 workers. Toyota received criticism for the manner in which the process was carried out; for example, deploying security guards to escort sacked staff.[11]
The plant is scheduled to close at the end of 2017, marking the end of automobile manufacturing in Australia.
Sales[edit]
Toyota Australia currently holds the largest market share of Australia's new car market.

The milestone of the 500,000th TMCA vehicle export also occurred in May 2006. The vehicle was a Toyota Camry, headed for New Zealand.
Throughout TMCA's history, many Toyota vehicles have been built at either Altona or Port Melbourne, including the Toyota Tiara, the Toyota Corona, the Toyota Crown, the Toyota Corolla, the Toyota Camry and the Toyota Avalon. The Toyota Land Cruiser was never built in Australia.
As of 2006, TMCA's Altona plant in Victoria produces the Camry. Production of the Avalon has ceased, due for replacement on the manufacturing line by the Toyota Aurion, which shares many components with the Camry. TMCA had expressed interests in locally building the Toyota Kluger 4WD at Altona in the future.
TMCA started to build the new Camry Hybrid in 2010 after securing a $35 million subsidy from the Federal Government.[5] The first locally-made Australian Toyota Hybrid Camry was completed and revealed to public on 11 December 2009, driven by the then prime minister Kevin Rudd.
On 10 February 2014, it was announced that by the end of 2017, Toyota would cease manufacturing vehicles and engines in Australia.[1] [6][7] The decision was based on the unfavourable Australian dollar making exports not viable, the high cost of local manufacture and the high amount of competition in a relatively small local market.[8] The company plans to consolidate its corporate functions in Melbourne by the end of 2017. The head office will remain in Port Melbourne and the Altona plant will be retained for other functions. The workforce is expected to be reduced from 3,900 to 1,300.[9]
Employees[edit]
As of 31 March 2015 it had 3,982 employees including 79 contractors located across the country. The majority of its employees are based at the manufacturing plant in Altona, Victoria. 15 per cent of its employees are female and 85 are male.[citation needed]
The decision to stop manufacturing in Australia by the end of 2017 has had and will continue to have a significant impact on Toyota Australia's employees. After it stops manufacturing by the end of 2017, Toyota expects its workforce will reduce from around 3,900 people to approximately 1,300. This will include the loss of both manufacturing and corporate jobs as well as the creation of some new roles.[citation needed]
Manufacturing[edit]
Toyota built cars in Victoria, Australia between 1963-2017.
It currently builds three models—Camry, Camry Hybrid and Aurion—for domestic and export customers. The fully integrated Altona manufacturing plant incorporates state-of-the-art weld, paint and assembly shops to produce cars that have been independently recognised as Australia's best quality locally built vehicles.
in February 2014, Toyota Australia announced its decision to close its manufacturing plant by the end of 2017 and become a national sales and distribution company.
Toyota vehicles built in Australia:

Tiara: 1963–1965
Crown: 1966–1980
Corona: 1965–1987
Camry: 1987–2017
Corolla: 1968–1999
Apollo: 1989–1996
Nova: 1989–1996
Avalon: 2000–2005
Aurion: 2006–2017
Camry Hybrid: 2009–2017

Altona plant[edit]
The Altona plant is the Toyota Australia manufacturing facility that operates in the Melbourne suburb of Altona. It opened in 1994, replacing the previous Port Melbourne site, but is scheduled to close in 2017. The plant produces the Camry and Aurion for sale locally in Australasia and for export to the Middle East. Until the early 2000s, export to East and Southeast Asia also occurred. The plant also manufactured the Avalon between 2000 and 2005.
In December 2009, full-scale production of the new Australian Camry Hybrid commenced.[10] On 11 December 2009, manufacture of the first locally-made Camry Hybrid was completed and revealed to the public, writing a new page in the history of the Australian automotive industry.
In April 2012, Toyota forcibly retrenched 350 workers. Toyota received criticism for the manner in which the process was carried out; for example, deploying security guards to escort sacked staff.[11]
The plant is scheduled to close at the end of 2017, marking the end of automobile manufacturing in Australia.
Sales[edit]
Toyota Australia currently holds the largest market share of Australia's new car market.

History[edit]
TMCA first began in 1958 where Toyota Land Cruisers were imported by Thiess Toyota for the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric scheme. By 1963, assembly of Toyota vehicles in Australia by Australian Motor Industries (AMI) had begun, taking place at the production plant in Port Melbourne, Victoria. The production line of Toyota vehicles in 1963 was devoted to the Toyota Tiara. One of the leading forces of getting Toyota established in Australia was Kenneth Hougham.[citation needed]
In 1972 Toyota bought out British Leyland's interest in AMI[3] and announced plans to spend A$27 million on an engine and gearbox plant.[3]
A production plant in Altona, Victoria, was established and began the production of engines in 1978, following the progressive growth of AMI. After Toyota's products came in for heavy criticism regarding their handling, a handling package developed specifically for the Australian market was introduced in 1981.[4]
The first AMI exported car was a Toyota Corona wagon in 1986 headed for New Zealand.
The one-millionth locally built Toyota was produced in 1992.
In 1994, all vehicle manufacturing operations were moved from Port Melbourne to Altona. The last vehicle produced at the Port Melbourne plant was a Toyota Camry and the first vehicle produced at the Altona plant a Toyota Corolla. Port Melbourne continued performing minor operations for TMCA.
The two-millionth locally built Toyota was produced in 2004.
In 2005, the ten-millionth worldwide Camry was built at TMCA's Altona plant.
The complete closure and end of all Toyota production operations at the Port Melbourne plant took place in May 2006. All manufacturing was shifted to Altona.
The milestone of the 500,000th TMCA vehicle export also occurred in May 2006. The vehicle was a Toyota Camry, headed for New Zealand.
Throughout TMCA's history, many Toyota vehicles have been built at either Altona or Port Melbourne, including the Toyota Tiara, the Toyota Corona, the Toyota Crown, the Toyota Corolla, the Toyota Camry and the Toyota Avalon. The Toyota Land Cruiser was never built in Australia.
As of 2006, TMCA's Altona plant in Victoria produces the Camry. Production of the Avalon has ceased, due for replacement on the manufacturing line by the Toyota Aurion, which shares many components with the Camry. TMCA had expressed interests in locally building the Toyota Kluger 4WD at Altona in the future.
TMCA started to build the new Camry Hybrid in 2010 after securing a $35 million subsidy from the Federal Government.[5] The first locally-made Australian Toyota Hybrid Camry was completed and revealed to public on 11 December 2009, driven by the then prime minister Kevin Rudd.
On 10 February 2014, it was announced that by the end of 2017, Toyota would cease manufacturing vehicles and engines in Australia.[1] [6][7] The decision was based on the unfavourable Australian dollar making exports not viable, the high cost of local manufacture and the high amount of competition in a relatively small local market.[8] The company plans to consolidate its corporate functions in Melbourne by the end of 2017. The head office will remain in Port Melbourne and the Altona plant will be retained for other functions. The workforce is expected to be reduced from 3,900 to 1,300.[9]
Employees[edit]
As of 31 March 2015 it had 3,982 employees including 79 contractors located across the country. The majority of its employees are based at the manufacturing plant in Altona, Victoria. 15 per cent of its employees are female and 85 are male.[citation needed]
The decision to stop manufacturing in Australia by the end of 2017 has had and will continue to have a significant impact on Toyota Australia's employees. After it stops manufacturing by the end of 2017, Toyota expects its workforce will reduce from around 3,900 people to approximately 1,300. This will include the loss of both manufacturing and corporate jobs as well as the creation of some new roles.[citation needed]
Manufacturing[edit]
Toyota built cars in Victoria, Australia between 1963-2017.
It currently builds three models—Camry, Camry Hybrid and Aurion—for domestic and export customers. The fully integrated Altona manufacturing plant incorporates state-of-the-art weld, paint and assembly shops to produce cars that have been independently recognised as Australia's best quality locally built vehicles.
in February 2014, Toyota Australia announced its decision to close its manufacturing plant by the end of 2017 and become a national sales and distribution company.
Toyota vehicles built in Australia:

Tiara: 1963–1965
Crown: 1966–1980
Corona: 1965–1987
Camry: 1987–2017
Corolla: 1968–1999
Apollo: 1989–1996
Nova: 1989–1996
Avalon: 2000–2005
Aurion: 2006–2017
Camry Hybrid: 2009–2017

Altona plant[edit]
The Altona plant is the Toyota Australia manufacturing facility that operates in the Melbourne suburb of Altona. It opened in 1994, replacing the previous Port Melbourne site, but is scheduled to close in 2017. The plant produces the Camry and Aurion for sale locally in Australasia and for export to the Middle East. Until the early 2000s, export to East and Southeast Asia also occurred. The plant also manufactured the Avalon between 2000 and 2005.
In December 2009, full-scale production of the new Australian Camry Hybrid commenced.[10] On 11 December 2009, manufacture of the first locally-made Camry Hybrid was completed and revealed to the public, writing a new page in the history of the Australian automotive industry.
In April 2012, Toyota forcibly retrenched 350 workers. Toyota received criticism for the manner in which the process was carried out; for example, deploying security guards to escort sacked staff.[11]
The plant is scheduled to close at the end of 2017, marking the end of automobile manufacturing in Australia.
Sales[edit]
Toyota Australia currently holds the largest market share of Australia's new car market.

History[edit]
TMCA first began in 1958 where Toyota Land Cruisers were imported by Thiess Toyota for the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric scheme. By 1963, assembly of Toyota vehicles in Australia by Australian Motor Industries (AMI) had begun, taking place at the production plant in Port Melbourne, Victoria. The production line of Toyota vehicles in 1963 was devoted to the Toyota Tiara. One of the leading forces of getting Toyota established in Australia was Kenneth Hougham.[citation needed]
In 1972 Toyota bought out British Leyland's interest in AMI[3] and announced plans to spend A$27 million on an engine and gearbox plant.[3]
A production plant in Altona, Victoria, was established and began the production of engines in 1978, following the progressive growth of AMI. After Toyota's products came in for heavy criticism regarding their handling, a handling package developed specifically for the Australian market was introduced in 1981.[4]
The first AMI exported car was a Toyota Corona wagon in 1986 headed for New Zealand.
The one-millionth locally built Toyota was produced in 1992.
In 1994, all vehicle manufacturing operations were moved from Port Melbourne to Altona. The last vehicle produced at the Port Melbourne plant was a Toyota Camry and the first vehicle produced at the Altona plant a Toyota Corolla. Port Melbourne continued performing minor operations for TMCA.
The two-millionth locally built Toyota was produced in 2004.
In 2005, the ten-millionth worldwide Camry was built at TMCA's Altona plant.
The complete closure and end of all Toyota production operations at the Port Melbourne plant took place in May 2006. All manufacturing was shifted to Altona.
The milestone of the 500,000th TMCA vehicle export also occurred in May 2006. The vehicle was a Toyota Camry, headed for New Zealand.
Throughout TMCA's history, many Toyota vehicles have been built at either Altona or Port Melbourne, including the Toyota Tiara, the Toyota Corona, the Toyota Crown, the Toyota Corolla, the Toyota Camry and the Toyota Avalon. The Toyota Land Cruiser was never built in Australia.
As of 2006, TMCA's Altona plant in Victoria produces the Camry. Production of the Avalon has ceased, due for replacement on the manufacturing line by the Toyota Aurion, which shares many components with the Camry. TMCA had expressed interests in locally building the Toyota Kluger 4WD at Altona in the future.
TMCA started to build the new Camry Hybrid in 2010 after securing a $35 million subsidy from the Federal Government.[5] The first locally-made Australian Toyota Hybrid Camry was completed and revealed to public on 11 December 2009, driven by the then prime minister Kevin Rudd.
On 10 February 2014, it was announced that by the end of 2017, Toyota would cease manufacturing vehicles and engines in Australia.[1] [6][7] The decision was based on the unfavourable Australian dollar making exports not viable, the high cost of local manufacture and the high amount of competition in a relatively small local market.[8] The company plans to consolidate its corporate functions in Melbourne by the end of 2017. The head office will remain in Port Melbourne and the Altona plant will be retained for other functions. The workforce is expected to be reduced from 3,900 to 1,300.[9]
Employees[edit]
As of 31 March 2015 it had 3,982 employees including 79 contractors located across the country. The majority of its employees are based at the manufacturing plant in Altona, Victoria. 15 per cent of its employees are female and 85 are male.[citation needed]
The decision to stop manufacturing in Australia by the end of 2017 has had and will continue to have a significant impact on Toyota Australia's employees. After it stops manufacturing by the end of 2017, Toyota expects its workforce will reduce from around 3,900 people to approximately 1,300. This will include the loss of both manufacturing and corporate jobs as well as the creation of some new roles.[citation needed]
Manufacturing[edit]
Toyota built cars in Victoria, Australia between 1963-2017.
It currently builds three models—Camry, Camry Hybrid and Aurion—for domestic and export customers. The fully integrated Altona manufacturing plant incorporates state-of-the-art weld, paint and assembly shops to produce cars that have been independently recognised as Australia's best quality locally built vehicles.
in February 2014, Toyota Australia announced its decision to close its manufacturing plant by the end of 2017 and become a national sales and distribution company.
Toyota vehicles built in Australia:

Tiara: 1963–1965
Crown: 1966–1980
Corona: 1965–1987
Camry: 1987–2017
Corolla: 1968–1999
Apollo: 1989–1996
Nova: 1989–1996
Avalon: 2000–2005
Aurion: 2006–2017
Camry Hybrid: 2009–2017

Altona plant[edit]
The Altona plant is the Toyota Australia manufacturing facility that operates in the Melbourne suburb of Altona. It opened in 1994, replacing the previous Port Melbourne site, but is scheduled to close in 2017. The plant produces the Camry and Aurion for sale locally in Australasia and for export to the Middle East. Until the early 2000s, export to East and Southeast Asia also occurred. The plant also manufactured the Avalon between 2000 and 2005.
In December 2009, full-scale production of the new Australian Camry Hybrid commenced.[10] On 11 December 2009, manufacture of the first locally-made Camry Hybrid was completed and revealed to the public, writing a new page in the history of the Australian automotive industry.
In April 2012, Toyota forcibly retrenched 350 workers. Toyota received criticism for the manner in which the process was carried out; for example, deploying security guards to escort sacked staff.[11]
The plant is scheduled to close at the end of 2017, marking the end of automobile manufacturing in Australia.
Sales[edit]
Toyota Australia currently holds the largest market share of Australia's new car market.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

Data Format: CSV

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

Toyota is a Japanese brand whose refined, well-designed vehicles have earned it a great deal of popularity. Toyotas also have a superb record for reliability and durability, which goes a long way toward justifying their typically high purchase prices. For buyers who plan on owning their new vehicles for a long time, the Toyota marque is a very compelling choice.
The automaker's name is a variation of the surname of its founder, Kiichiro Toyoda. After years of research, Toyoda unveiled his first prototype, the A1, in 1935, marking the birth of the Toyota Motor Corporation. The '40s witnessed the launch of additional passenger cars and even a pickup. By the end of the decade, the automaker had produced more than 100,000 vehicles.
Toyota grew bigger in the '50s and expanded its roster with a slew of new small cars. The company also unveiled the utilitarian BJ truck; this vehicle was the precursor to the Land Cruiser. By the end of the decade, Toyota had commenced exports to the U.S. with the establishment of Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A., Inc. The first Toyota to be sold on American shores was the Crown; it held the distinction of being the first Japanese car to be sold Stateside.
The '60s witnessed even more growth for the emerging juggernaut. Toyota introduced the Corolla, an immensely popular model that is still in production today. Vehicles like the home-market Publica, the 2000GT, Hiace and Miniace were also launched. The decade closed with Toyota reporting annual domestic sales of 1 million units; cumulative exports also reached 1 million.
Japanese-market cars like the Carina, Light Ace and Publica Starlet were launched during the 1970s. In the States, the Corolla grew in popularity and the Corona and Mk II models debuted as well. The successful Celica sports coupe was also rolled out and would remain in production for more than 30 years. Toyota's shadow had spread far beyond Japan by this point. The decade's oil crisis had made the manufacturer's compact, fuel-efficient models more popular than ever in the United States. By the time the '70s drew to a close, the automaker had exported more than 10 million vehicles.
Toyota expanded its presence in the U.S. market during the '80s, with the introduction of popular models like the 4Runner SUV and the MR2 sports car. The true high point of these years, though, was the birth of the Toyota Camry sedan. Originally known as the Celica Camry in Japan, the car went on to be a hit of phenomenal proportions, earning kudos as America's best-selling car of the year time and time again.
During the '90s, Toyota rolled out the Avalon full-size sedan and expanded its selection of SUVs with the compact RAV4. By the end of the decade, more than 100 million Toyota vehicles had been produced in Japan. The company also proved itself on the cutting edge of new technology with the rollout of the Prius, the world's first mass-produced hybrid. The car debuted in Japan in 1997; by 2001, the fuel-sipping sedan had made its way to American highways. Despite the presence of a growing number of competitors in its segment, the Prius continues to boast class-leading sales.
Toyota's current lineup is relatively extensive, including minivans, cars, trucks and SUVs. The brand remains extremely popular among savvy consumers who place a high value on quality and dependability.

Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
