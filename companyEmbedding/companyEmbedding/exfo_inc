Latency Measuring Software
Photonics.comMay 2017EXFO Inc.Request Info 
        

            QUEBEC CITY, May 26, 2017 — Universal Virtual Sync from Exfo Inc. is a software-based solution enabling communications service providers to accurately and cost-effectively measure network latency.


This real-time visibility into latency behavior enables operators to deliver instant service at any time for applications like video, VoIP and interactive services. It is critical for assuring C-RAN, 5G and NFV’s sub-ms latency requirements.


The solution enabled communications service providers to reliably measure unidirectional latency in order to identify the direction of degradations and the location of excessive or uncontrolled delay.Visit company websitehttp://www.exfo.comAbout this supplier/Company.aspx?CompanyID=4659
