Page Content​​​​​​​Global LocationsThe original limestone and talc mineral operations that were the foundation 
of today’s Minerals Technologies began in the United States as early as the 
1840’s. Since then we have built more than 55 precipitated calcium carbonate 
(PCC) satellite plants at paper mills in over 17 countries and our Minteq 
monolithic refractory business operates around the world, making Minerals 
Technologies an international company, with facilities in more than 40 
countries. Geographical diversification continues as we invest and grow sales in 
Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe. Current locations are provided in our annual report.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
