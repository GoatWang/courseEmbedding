    Conservative Republican Candidate for State Representative, District 24

The Commonwealth needs a strong voice for the working people, small business owners, and farmers in our counties. I am asking for your support so I can become that voice.
	
There are forces in Frankfort who want to raise taxes. This is wrong. Kentucky needs new jobs. Not new taxes.
	
I hope you agree and will help me with my mission.


              




Alex LaRue Supports the House Republicans' Handshake with Kentucky


As your Republican representative to the legislature, I am committed to the Handshake with Kentucky proposed by the House Republican Caucus. Honest deals are made with a firm handshake. If the people of Kentucky entrust the Republicans with the majority, we will focus on these goals: 
Create Jobs and Economic Opportunities – These should be the top priorities of the 2015 General Assembly. We must ensure government does not stand in the way of Kentucky's existing businesses. We will also create an environment desirable for new businesses to begin or locate in Kentucky. 
Control Wasteful Spending – The House Democrat leadership in Frankfort recently proposed the largest level of debt in Kentucky's history. We must focus on high priority investments that improve education and workforce preparation to support job growth without leaving our children with crippling debt. 
End Corruption in the Kentucky House of Representatives – Democrats have held the majority in the House of Representatives since 1921.  During that time, an atmosphere that breeds corruption and misconduct has grown out of control. 
Stand Up to Obamacare Mandates – Kentucky cannot afford the unprecedented expansion of our Medicaid system mandated through Obamacare. House Republicans are prepared to take action to do what we can to repeal this expansion before it plummets our state into crippling debt. 
Take Action on Other Crucial Issues, so that fair, honest and transparent debate can begin and that these issues can be fully vetted before the 2016 General Assembly.

If you believe in my core principles of Republican Conservatism, help spread the word about my campaign by calling or talking to five friends and asking them to support me so that I can work to enact sound policies that will 
•  Create new and attractive jobs for the people of Kentucky, 
•  Reduce wasteful government spending, 
•  Cut taxes on working families, 
•  Oppose government-run health care, 
•  Support pro-life and pro-family policy, 
•  Create government transparency, 
•  Protect our second amendment rights,

... and protect all other rights enumerated in the Constitution.

RETURNS
Our return policy is for store credit only. Orders that are shipped are only eligible for return if they are received by LaRue Chic Boutique within 14 days of the original ship date with Return Form. (Download Return Form HERE) Due to the extremely fast moving pace of our inventory we have a very strict return policy in place. Please understand that we are unable to bend the rules for anyone, as that would be unfair to other LaRue shoppers. All discounted and/or sale items (25% or more), accessories, jewelry, hats, headband, swimwear, scarves, gloves, belts, custom items, or gift certificates are all sales final and can NOT be returned. All merchandise must be returned to us in their original, unworn, unwashed, smoke-free, pet hair-free condition with original tags attached. Shoes must be returned in their original shoe box without any damage to the box. If returned items have been tried on and they have make-up and/or deodorant on them, they will not be accepted as a return and the items will be sent back to you. Original and return shipping fees are non refundable and the responsibility of the customer. You may send your package back by any shipping method you prefer. However we highly recommend a trackable shipping method. LaRue Chic Boutique is NOT responsible for returns lost in the mail. Once we receive your package, your return will be processed within 2-5 business days. You will receive your store credit code via email when your return is processed.If any items are past the 14 day limit or do not fit the return guidelines, the items will be sent back with a future order. We will hold non-returnable merchandise for 30 days. After 30 days, the items will be donated to charity.
 
IN-STORE PICK UP
If you live in or around Royse City, TX and would like to choose our "In-Store Pick Up" option instead of having your order shipped, you will receive an email as soon as your order is available for pickup. Please Note:  Stated in your fulfillment email, it will have "Tracking Number". Instead of there being a tracking number it will state {CUSTOMER PICKUP} letting you know it is available at the boutique for pickup.   No shipping or handling charges are applied if selected.
Please allow at least 24 hours for processing once your order has been received. If you have not received an email, then your order is still at our warehouse and is not ready to be picked up in store. Once your email is sent confirming your order is ready for pick up, you must pick up your purchase within 14 days of the transaction date. If you fail to meet these terms and we cannot reach you, the item will returned to the sales floor and you will be issued a store credit for the amount of the order. Return policy remains the same as above.
*PLEASE NOTE*  ALL IN STORE PICK UP orders placed after 5PM on FRIDAY will NOT be processed or ready until 10 AM on TUESDAY (since the boutique is closed on Monday).If you chose In-Store Pick Up by mistake the In-Store Pick Up Policy still applies to your order. If you have not contacted us within 14 days of the transaction date to pay for your shipping, the item will returned to the sales floor and you will be issued a store credit for the amount of the order. 
 
EXCHANGESWe technically no longer have the ability to do exchanges because we are unable to guarantee that an item will not be sold out once we receive your return. We do not do any holds on online merchandise. The best way we can recommend making an “exchange” is to go ahead and purchase the item in the size that you are needing and then send the incorrect size back to us for a full refund. This way you are still able to get the correct size you are wanting. DEFECTIVE ITEMSIf you feel you have received defective merchandise or you were shipped incorrect merchandise, you must contact us within 3 days of receipt. NO EXCEPTIONS. 
SHIPPINGMost orders ship the same business day if placed before 2pm CST. Shipping times may vary due to availability. Check product description online for information on any product delays in shipping. Orders are not shipped on weekends or holidays. Once your order has shipped or is ready for pick up...you will receive an email stating that your order has been fulfilled. If you opted for shipping, your email will contain a tracking number to use on USPS.com to track your package. Unfortunately, LaRue Chic Boutique is NOT responsible for items lost in transit or any items that are confirmed delivered but customer reports undelivered. If your item shows delivered and you have not received it, we recommend checking with your local post office to verify exactly where the package was left. If your order is returned because you provided an incorrect shipping address or was classified "undeliverable" by USPS, it is not LaRue Chic Boutique's responsibility to pay additional shipping cost to resend it. 
PLEASE NOTE: ALL IN STORE PICK UP orders placed after 5PM on FRIDAY will NOT be processed or ready until 10 AM on TUESDAY (since the boutique is closed on Monday).
