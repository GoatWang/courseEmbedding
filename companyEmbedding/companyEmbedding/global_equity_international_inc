          Global Equity International Inc. - globalequityinternational.com                                      Introduction   Global Equity International Inc. is our US holding company. We operate 100% of our business through our non-US subsidiaries, Global Equity Partners Plc. and GEP Equity Holdings Limited. The Company´s network spans the entire globe and consists of a variety of different institutions based on the transaction at hand, from local, micro funds dealing in hundreds of thousands of dollars to Middle East family and Investment Bank money with minimum tickets of $50 million upwards.   With a diversified portfolio of companies already part of operating subsidiaries, we are uniquely positioned to take advantage of investment opportunities at all levels and have been working with companies led by outstanding and seasoned management teams in a much wider range of industries than most traditional Venture Capital, Private Equity and Merchant Banking firms.   We aim to provide our clients with all the support required to move business forward to a successful level of achievement that surpasses the ambition of the principals.   At Global Equity, we’re not just consultants and advisors. All of our principals have been the founders, executives and owners of numerous companies and have subsequently taken their companies public or guided them through successful mergers or acquisitions. We understand the entire scope of value added venture investing from startup and all the way through to IPO because we have historically sat on both sides of the table.

The process to achieve the public company status differs greatly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, from stock exchange to stock exchange and from regulator to regulator. The common denominator in any public listing or offering is planning and preparation in line with local regulation. It takes many years to build a good business, the IPO process can be part of that building and is never a quick fix. We like to always keep in mind and have our clients understand that "Rome wasn't built in a day".   Global Equity work in many different markets, exchanges and jurisdictions to guide a client through the right channel within the right time frame, there are many factors to consider when seeking an IPO and the decision to become a public company does not come without its own idiosyncrasies; regular reporting, corporate governance and external shareholders are all realities that have to be factored into your thought process for the future.   Once the decision has been made to go down the IPO route we must analyze the best possible route for the company, a successful IPO or direct offering can very often be the spring board to rapid growth and expansion building true value within your company.     Advantages and disadvantages of a public company      Advantages    Broad exposure for the company and its products – Public companies become very visible. Ability to capital raise – Public markets with many investors. Capital raising at lower cost – higher valuation thus less dilution. Ability to exit in part – To sell shares in small amounts. Higher corporate profile – High visibility of corporation. Higher company valuation – Typically public companies have much higher valuation than a private company. Possibly subject to a predator – Maybe providing management exit. Mass market for potential investors – Open to retail and Institutional investors. Attract Institutional investors without losing management controls – Traditionally no board seat required by institutions. Acquisitions with paper – Stock for stock acquisitions allowing non organic growth. Staff retention and motivation with stock options – To retain valuable employees.        Disadvantages    Regular reporting – Regular Quarterly and Annual reporting mandatory. Disclosure of all material events – Any material corporate activity must be disclosed. Shareholders – External shareholders. Corporate governance responsibility. Greater time involvement – Management must devote additional time to public company operations.

Global Equity International, Inc. and Subsidiaries - "Next Steps to Closing the Circle" - MarketWatch

















































Bulletin






Investor Alert























press release


					Oct. 21, 2016, 9:47 a.m. EDT
				
Global Equity International, Inc. and Subsidiaries - "Next Steps to Closing the Circle"
























DUBAI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES, Oct 21, 2016 (Marketwired via COMTEX) --
DUBAI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES--(Marketwired - Oct 21, 2016) -  Global Equity International, Inc. (otcqb:GEQU) and its fully-owned subsidiaries GEP Equity Holdings Limited and Global Equity Partners Plc. ("GEP" -         www.gepartnersplc.com
) a specialist consultancy firm with offices located in Dubai and London, would like to announce that the Board of Directors have firmly decided to commence the process of acquiring Regulated Funds under Management initially in the United Kingdom.


                                        








In common with the overall financial services sector, the micro fund management market is undergoing significant changes. Our Company would like to take advantage of these changes and acquire a significant selection of International and United Kingdom based Financial Advisory Firms with funds under management and via acquisition create a subsidiary under one efficient and cost effective umbrella that will provide long term revenue for Global Equity International Inc. and its fully owned subsidiaries.


                                        








A "Fund Division" of our Company, Global Equity, will provide long term stability via revenue, attractive value by paying up to three times profits and short term income from both the "Fund Division" and our Company due to our ability to then self-finance deals and ultimately "Close the circle."


                                        








Major Keys to Success:


                                        








Extensive and deep knowledge of the "Fund Management" sector.


                                        








25 years of experience within management of this type of business.


                                        








Close relationships with existing target companies to be acquired.


                                        








Timing.


                                        








Broadened product portfolio for clients (cross border opportunities).


                                        








Reduced General and Administrative expenses once consolidated.


                                        








Management previously created a similar company with US$2.2 Billion of Funds under Management.


                                        








To date we have identified four Funds under Management that we are interested in acquiring. The total amount of money under management would be approximately US$200,000,000 and total annual net profits vary between 1% and 1.5% of the fund value. These regulated and licensed Financial Advisory Firms with Funds under Management can be acquired for small multiples and with certain amounts paid up-front and the balance as a form of buy-out over time which will end up being self-funded from the revenues we intend to acquire. Each of these target Funds are based in the UK and are highly regulated by the UK FCA (        https://www.fca.org.uk/
).


                                        








Once we have acquired at least two of the Financial Advisory Firms with Funds under Management that we have on our shortlist, within 12 months, we will create a "Global Equity Special Opportunities Fund" that will be established in a regulated market thus allowing us, over time, to move certain pockets of money from the Funds under Management we acquire into our own fund thus allowing us to finance our own clients and by virtue increase the overall profitability, speed of transaction and deal making capability of the group.


                                        








Peter Smith, CEO of Global Equity International Inc., said, "Over the last 6 years we have slowly but surely built a professional team and a solid and very substantial network around us. Now the time has come to take the next step in order to "close the circle" on our business model. I travelled to the United Kingdom two weeks ago and met with certain significant people within the sector with a view of posing to them our idea of commencing an acquisition trail on various UK Regulated Funds. The idea was received with great enthusiasm, so much so that I and my CFO, Enzo Taddei, will be travelling back to the UK this coming Monday to follow up on my previous conversations and also to meet with all four potential acquisition targets with a view to agree on the basic terms of acquisition with each of them, and to set a timeframe to commence our comprehensive due diligence. Also I have spoken to various of our financial partners about assisting us to source the funding required, initially via debt only, to acquire the various targeted Financial Advisory Firms with Funds under Management and we have received an extremely positive response. We are feeling very bullish about getting these Funds acquired in the next 3 to 4 months. I personally have extensive experience in this type of business hence I know how profitable it can be. I also know that with a little "TLC" we can make the net profits of these funds substantially higher in time."

(  OTCQB :  GEQU ) and its fully-owned subsidiaries GEP Equity Holdings Limited and Global Equity Partners Plc. ("GEP" - www.gepartnersplc.com) a specialist consultancy firm with offices located in Dubai and London, would like to announce that the Board of Directors have firmly decided to commence the process of acquiring Regulated Funds under Management initially in the United Kingdom.In common with the overall financial services sector, the micro fund management market is undergoing significant changes. Our Company would like to take advantage of these changes and acquire a significant selection of International and United Kingdom based Financial Advisory Firms with funds under management and via acquisition create a subsidiary under one efficient and cost effective umbrella that will provide long term revenue for Global Equity International Inc. and its fully owned subsidiaries.A "Fund Division" of our Company, Global Equity, will provide long term stability via revenue, attractive value by paying up to three times profits and short term income from both the "Fund Division" and our Company due to our ability to then self-finance deals and ultimately "Close the circle."Major Keys to Success:Extensive and deep knowledge of the "Fund Management" sector. 25 years of experience within management of this type of business. Close relationships with existing target companies to be acquired. Timing. Broadened product portfolio for clients (cross border opportunities). Reduced General and Administrative expenses once consolidated. Management previously created a similar company with US$2.2 Billion of Funds under Management.To date we have identified four Funds under Management that we are interested in acquiring. The total amount of money under management would be approximately US$200,000,000 and total annual net profits vary between 1% and 1.5% of the fund value. These regulated and licensed Financial Advisory Firms with Funds under Management can be acquired for small multiples and with certain amounts paid up-front and the balance as a form of buy-out over time which will end up being self-funded from the revenues we intend to acquire. Each of these target Funds are based in the UK and are highly regulated by the UK FCA (https://www.fca.org.uk/).Once we have acquired at least two of the Financial Advisory Firms with Funds under Management that we have on our shortlist, within 12 months, we will create a "Global Equity Special Opportunities Fund" that will be established in a regulated market thus allowing us, over time, to move certain pockets of money from the Funds under Management we acquire into our own fund thus allowing us to finance our own clients and by virtue increase the overall profitability, speed of transaction and deal making capability of the group.Peter Smith, CEO of Global Equity International Inc., said, "Over the last 6 years we have slowly but surely built a professional team and a solid and very substantial network around us. Now the time has come to take the next step in order to "close the circle" on our business model. I travelled to the United Kingdom two weeks ago and met with certain significant people within the sector with a view of posing to them our idea of commencing an acquisition trail on various UK Regulated Funds. The idea was received with great enthusiasm, so much so that I and my CFO, Enzo Taddei, will be travelling back to the UK this coming Monday to follow up on my previous conversations and also to meet with all four potential acquisition targets with a view to agree on the basic terms of acquisition with each of them, and to set a timeframe to commence our comprehensive due diligence. Also I have spoken to various of our financial partners about assisting us to source the funding required, initially via debt only, to acquire the various targeted Financial Advisory Firms with Funds under Management and we have received an extremely positive response. We are feeling very bullish about getting these Funds acquired in the next 3 to 4 months. I personally have extensive experience in this type of business hence I know how profitable it can be. I also know that with a little "TLC" we can make the net profits of these funds substantially higher in time."About Global Equity International Inc. and subsidiariesGlobal Equity International Inc., through its wholly-owned subsidiaries GEP Equity Holdings Limited and Global Equity Partners Plc., advises worldwide business leaders with their most critical decisions and opportunities pertaining to growth, capital needs, structure and the development of a global presence.
