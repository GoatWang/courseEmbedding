Chic-a-Peas, LLC is voluntarily recalling a limited number of Chic-a-Peas Baked Crunchy Chickpeas 2 oz. packages because the product has the potential to be contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes, an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Although healthy individuals may suffer only short-term symptoms such as high fever, severe headache, stiffness, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea, Listeria infection can cause miscarriages and stillbirths among pregnant women.There have been no reports of consumer illness associated with this recall. We are voluntarily recalling these items out of an abundance of caution.A limited quantity was distributed online and in retail stores nationwide. Retailers and distributors who received the recalled lots have been contacted and asked to pull these lots from their inventory and shelves.This announcement applies only to the Chic-a-Peas Baked Crunchy Chickpeas products listed below and does not include any other items outside the below lot codes:Chic-a-Peas, Baked Crunchy Chickpeas, Sea Sat Unit Size: 2.0 oz (57g)Unit Size Best By Date: 12/27/2017 UPC: 853404004033Lot Code: 0867Chic-a-Peas, Baked Crunchy Chickpeas, Fresh Salsa Unit Size: 2.0 oz (57g)Unit Size Best By Date: 12/27/2017UPC: 853404004071Lot Code: 0877Chic-a-Peas, Baked Crunchy Chickpeas, Falafel Unit Size: 2.0 oz (57g)Unit Size Best By Date: 12/28/2017 UPC: 853404004026Lot Code: 0897The lot codes and best by dates can be found on the back of the package.This recall has been initiated because our manufacturing company notified us that Listeria monocytogenes was found in the production environment and it may have the potential to contaminate this product.Consumers who have purchased these products are urged to return them to the place of purchase to request a refund.If you have any questions, you can reach out to us at info@chicapeas.com or at (800) 481-5716 Monday- Friday 9AM – 5PM (EST).
