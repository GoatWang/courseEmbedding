FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Kennedy Wilson Announces Upsizing and Pricing of Additional 5.875% Senior Notes Due 2024
Aug 9 16
Kennedy-Wilson, Inc. announced that it priced its previously announced offering of additional 5.875% senior notes due 2024. Kennedy Wilson increased the size of the offering to $250 million aggregate principal amount of Notes.

The Notes will have substantially identical terms as the Initial Notes and will be treated as a single series with the Initial Notes under the indenture. Holders of the Notes and the Initial Notes will vote as one class under the indenture. The Notes will be Kennedy Wilson’s senior unsecured obligations and will be guaranteed by Kennedy-Wilson Holdings, Inc. and certain subsidiaries of Kennedy Wilson. The closing of the offering is expected to occur on August 12, 2016, subject to customary closing conditions. Kennedy Wilson intends to use a portion of the net proceeds from the offering to repay $75.0 million of the outstanding balance under its unsecured revolving credit facility, and the remainder for general corporate purposes, which may include future acquisitions, co-investments, capital expenditures and the repayment of other outstanding indebtedness.
