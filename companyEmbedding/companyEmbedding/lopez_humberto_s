Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Texas:













Does Lopez Humberto S carry a valid contracting license?



Only certain types of specialty contractors (e.g. HVAC, electrical) need to be licensed in Texas. There are no licensing requirements when it comes to hiring for a construction or major remodeling project.

How important is contractor licensing in Texas?



The Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation (TDLR) regulates HVAC and electrical contractors. You should verify their license status on the TDLR Website before hiring. General contractors and home builders are not licensed so you should do additional research before hiring one.











Your liability risk when hiring Lopez Humberto S



Although it isn't a regulatory requirement, you can ask your general contractor to provide evidence of workers' compensation and general liability insurance prior to hiring them.

The Texas Department of Licensing Regulation does not require general contractors to carry a surety bond nor is there a state recovery fund.











What else should I know before hiring Lopez Humberto S



There is no financial or criminal background check performed on general contractors by the TDLR. The State's Department of Public Safety does maintain a publicly accessible database so you can run your own background check prior to hiring. 











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



The information on BuildZoom is made available as a public service and should not be considered advertising. We collect client feedback and verify contractors' permitted history with dozens of local building departments in Texas, which saves you time and helps minimize your risk when hiring. 











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



The Texas Attorney General's office recommends getting several bids before hiring a contractor. Do not automatically accept the lowest bid - an abnormally low bid may indicate the contractor made a mistake and is not including the same work quoted by their competitors. We've made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free).

      Humberto & Czarina Lopez.
Welcome to The HS Lopez Family Foundation Web site.  We hope you enjoy your visit and are inspired to join us in our efforts of community support and service. 
History
When Humberto S. Lopez was 12, his father died unexpectedly, closing the door on the world that had been his. Gone was his comfortable life as the son of a successful rancher in Ciudad Obregon, Sonora, Mexico. Gone were the days when his mother could care for her six children without worrying about how she would feed them.


The Lopez family moved to Nogales, Arizona, to live with their maternal grandmother.  Lopez, the oldest of the children, worked hard as a young boy to feed the family. He saw no way to escape unless he took advantage of an open window-education. That, he determined, was the key to the future.


He had washed dishes, dug ditches, worked the fields and bagged groceries soon realizing that without an education his future and prospects of a better life would have been very bleak.


Losing his father at such an early age, Lopez learned to cope with, and eventually create, a new reality. "I probably would not have been so driven to exceed if I had not had a good lifestyle and then gone to poverty," he reflects. There is a dicho - a proverb or truism - in Spanish that says, "Hay que aprender a perder antes de saber jugar."  (One must learn how to lose before learning how to play.)  In effect, that is what happened to Lopez.


He initially enrolled in Cochise College in Douglas, Arizona, where he received an associate's degree in 1967. He then earned a bachelor's degree in accounting from The University of Arizona in 1969. 


Why did he choose accounting? "It was the first course I took, and I liked it," he said. 




Humberto and Czarina Lopez



Armed with a college degree, Lopez took two more important steps toward the life he wanted: First, he married Czarina Montano of Nogales, Sonora, a young woman he had met during his UA student days.  Second, he decided to begin his career in Los Angeles, not Arizona.  


His first job as an accountant was in the audit department of Deloitte Haskins and Sells, where he developed an expertise in the real estate field. It was during this time that Lopez launched his own investment company, borrowing $1,000 for a real estate purchase.  He then reinvested the $3,000 profit from the first piece of property, parlaying that into a $5,000 profit. 


The investment chain had begun.


In 1975, Lopez teamed with Glenn Toyoshima, CPA, to form HSL Properties. Within four years, the company had investments in California, Arizona, Colorado, Texas, New Mexico and Georgia. By 1980, with HSL Properties thriving, Humberto and Czarina decided it was time to move the family from Los Angeles to a smaller community.  They chose Tucson, Arizona.


"Our only daughter at the time was 10 years old and we wanted an environment that lent itself in knowing the parents of the friends our daughter would grow up with and Tucson was the perfect place," he said


In the meantime, HSL Properties continued to prosper. Today, the company is the largest apartment owner in Southern Arizona and owner of numerous Tucson hotels...  


In addition, Lopez is chairman of the board of Paragon Vision Sciences, the world's second largest manufacturer of rigid polymer disks, used to make flexible contact lenses. He is a member of the board of directors of Pinnacle West Capital Corporation, Santa Barbara Auto Group, Arizona Public Service, Suncor, and the Bank of Tucson. 


Czarina also quickly became instrumental in a number of Tucson causes. Her past involvements have been: Tucson/Mexico Sister Cities, Tucson Museum of Art League, Open Inn, Angel Charity for Children, La Frontera Center, Steele Memorial Children's Research Center, Las Familias, Friends of the Cancer Center, Parseghian Medical Research Foundation, Salpointe and St. Cyril's Foundation and the Center for Integrated Medicine. She currently serves on the following boards: San Miguel High School, Tu Nidito, Catholic Community Services and the Catholic Community Services Foundation.


This profile, however, does not represent the sum of Humberto S. Lopez.  Rising from a life-changing experience as an adolescent, he is more than a business success story and family man.  One of his many other descriptors are that of philanthropist.  Lopez believes that philanthropy includes not only the dispensing of resources to charity, but also giving of one's time, energy and expertise.  


In particular, Lopez supports causes related to education, health and welfare. His extensive community service includes several board memberships at The University of Arizona and throughout the Tucson community.  His efforts have been recognized by numerous organizations, including the Father's Day Council, City of Hope, the Tucson Hispanic Council, The University of Arizona Hispanic Alumni Association and the Tucson Chamber of Commerce.


The HS Lopez Family Foundation is a reflection of values that were developed early in the life of a young boy.  "It isn't about making money any more," Lopez said.  "It's about making a difference."
