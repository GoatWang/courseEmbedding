35% of world bromine production
11% of world potash production and 13% of international potash trade (excluding the cross-border trade between the United States and Canada)
9% of western world primary magnesium consumption
3% of world phosphate rock production, 3% of international phosphate rock trade (excluding the cross-border trade between the US and Canada)
One of the world’s most integrated manufacturers and suppliers of phosphate products.

ICL exports fertilizers to Europe and to numerous specialty chemical market segments. In Israel, ICL is the largest supplier of fertilizers and chemicals, as well as one of Israel's largest companies.[citation needed]
60% of ICL's raw products (minerals) are excavated in Israel. ICL also owns and operates underground mines in Spain, United Kingdom (North Yorkshire), China, the US and South America.[citation needed] Also, in Ethiopia at Danakil mine, Afar Regional State, purchased from Allana Potash Corporation.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

Israel Chemicals to fire 9 more workers over ongoing strikes






ByNiv Elis, GLOBES


May 3, 2015 23:25







“The move to more sustainable products and the high cost of resuming production following a long strike makes [restarting the product line] uneconomical,” Israel Chemicals said.

Israel Chemicals will add nine employees to the list of layoffs as a months-long strike continues, it said Sunday.The company had warned that ongoing strikes could reduce its ability to compete in certain product lines and lead to further layoffs, beyond the roughly 160 planned for employees at the Dead Sea Works and Bromine Compounds.

On Sunday, it announced it is discontinuing production of FR-1210 DECA, a flame retardant, and fired nine of the 12 employees who worked on it. The remaining employees are being moved to other positions, it said.“Due to the strike at the Bromine Compounds plant in Neot Hovav, which has been continuing for more than three months, and because the company has told its customers that it cannot meet its obligations to provide products due to ‘force majeure,’ ICL has been forced to close its production line,” Israel Chemicals said.
As the strike continued, customers moved to suppliers in other places, including China, it said.“The move to more sustainable products and the high cost of resuming production following a long strike makes [restarting the product line] uneconomical,” Israel Chemicals said.As part of its streamlining plan, which caused the start of the strike in February, the company said it is offering voluntary early retirement to the employees it is letting go. The Histadrut has said a company earning billions of shekels has no need to fire workers.

ICL embraces a new way of thinking, shifting its focus from being a products-oriented company, to one that listens to humanity’s needs.
The new company strategy and vision urged ICL to become attentive to the world’s needs. From that point on, it was quite simple to understand that the common denominator between end products that seem to have hardly any connection to each other – is humanity. People. Us. Us and whatever our basic needs are.

We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of the ordinary shares by the
underwriters, whether in connection with the forward sale agreements or the sale
of ordinary shares by Israel Corporation directly to the underwriters, including
any proceeds from any exercise by the underwriters of their option to purchase
additional shares. Israel Corporation will receive proceeds from its sale of the
ordinary shares directly to the underwriters and will receive proceeds from the
forward counterparties if it enters into the forward sale agreements.


Potash.  The potash market is characterized by a relatively small number of
manufacturers, some of which export jointly. See "Risk Factors—Risks Related to
Our Business—Our operations and sales are subject to the volatility of market
supply and demand and we face significant competition from some of the world's
largest chemical companies." The ability to compete in the market is dependent
mainly on production costs and logistics. Moreover, there are high entry
barriers for new players. The barriers to entry in the potash market are high
due to the large investments required to establish production plants for the
basic minerals and the relatively long time required to establish these plants.
In addition, this industry requires appropriate concessions and proximity of
production facilities to quarries.

The significant competitors of our Fertilizers segment in international
trade in the potash sector are Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan (Canada),
Belaruskali (Belarus), Mosaic (Canada and the United States), Uralkali (Russia),
K+S (Germany), Agrium (Canada), APC (Jordan) and SQM (Chile).

Although there is currently over-capacity in the industry, various companies
have announced plans to develop new mines and other companies have announced
plans to expand their production capacity. There is uncertainty in respect of
realization of the production capacities as well as the timing for their
achievement. In addition, a number of companies have announced their examination
of the possibility of entering into the potash industry.

Fertilizers and Phosphates.  The phosphate fertilizer market is extremely
competitive and is characterized by a relatively large number of competitors,
including international companies and government-owned companies. The main
competitive factor in the field of fertilizers is the price. The ability to
compete in the market is dependent mainly on relative production costs and
logistics. For this reason, companies located in proximity to sources of raw
materials, ports and customers benefit from competitive advantages. Additional
factors that affect competition to a certain extent include product quality,
range of products, service and the capacity to develop new products that provide
unique solutions.

There are phosphate mines and production facilities in many countries,
including Morocco, China, Russia, Jordan, the United States, Brazil, Saudi
Arabia and Tunisia. The main phosphate producers who compete with us are Mosaic
(United States), Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan (Canada), OCP (Morocco),
Group Chimique Tunisienne (Tunisia), Vale (Brazil), Ma'aden (Saudi Arabia), the
Roullier Group (Europe) and various Russian and Chinese producers. We believe a
number of producers are approaching depletion of their higher-quality reserves.

We believe our Fertilizers segment benefits from the following competitive
advantages:

        • The low cost of potash production;

        • An integrated value chain that allows our Fertilizers segment to use
          the phosphate rock it manufactures for use in the production of its
          phosphate fertilizers rather than purchasing phosphate rock from third
          party suppliers;

        • Logistical advantages due to its geographical location, access to
          nearby ports in Israel and Europe and relative proximity to its
          customers;

        • We are the only producer with the ability to ship potash and phosphate
          together, which reduces costs; and

        • Logistical synergies due to potash operations in Israel, where the hot
          and dry climate of the Dead Sea enables us to store, at very low cost,
          a large quantity of potash in an open area thereby allowing us to
          consistently produce at Sodom at full capacity, independent of
          fluctuations in global potash demand.

Our Industrial Products segment is the world's leading producer of elemental
bromine, accounting for approximately a third of total international production
of bromine, according to internal assessments. Our Industrial Products segment
estimates that it and its two main competitors, Albemarle and Chemtura,
accounted in 2013 for approximately 80% of the worldwide consumption of bromine
and approximately 64% of the bromine compounds. Chinese production accounts for
much of the remainder, but the quantity of brine available for producing bromine
in China continues to decline, leading to lower production capacity. Chemtura
and Albemarle produce bromine primarily from underground brine sources in the
United States. Albemarle also has a joint venture with a Jordanian company to
produce bromine and bromine compounds which started operations in November 2002
and is located on the Jordanian side of the Dead Sea with access to the same
source of raw materials that we have. In the beginning of 2013, Albemarle
doubled the production capacity of bromine and expanded its production capacity
of bromine compounds it produces at the site of its joint venture in Jordan.
Chemtura purchases bromine and some other bromine compounds from our Industrial
Products segment under long-term contracts. In January 2010, Chemtura and
Albemarle signed a long-term strategic agreement. Under the agreement, Albemarle
supplies Chemtura with a number of principal products, including flame
retardants, and organic and inorganic bromine-based compounds. As of June 30,
2014, we did not expect this agreement to have a negative effect on our
Industrial Products segment.

The main barrier to entry in the bromine and bromine compound market is
access to an economically viable source of bromine in high enough concentration.
In addition, the bromine business requires a complex logistics system based on
special containers (isotanks) for transporting the bromine. The need for the
logistics system is a barrier to entry to competitors in the global trade in
bromine.

The main competitors of our Industrial Products segment in the bromine-based
flame retardant market are Albemarle and Chemtura, as well as a number of
producers in China. The relatively low production cost of bromine affords our
Industrial Products segment a competitive advantage. Bromine production requires
a complex logistical system based on a fleet of special containers (isotanks)
specifically designed to transport bromine. One of the advantages of our
Industrial Products segment is having the largest fleet of isotanks in the
world, which enables it to transport relatively large quantities of bromine
around the world. Our Industrial Products segment has contracted with a supplier
of isotanks to expand its existing fleet. During 2013, all of the new isotanks
were received from the manufacturer. In addition, our Industrial Products
segment has a widespread worldwide marketing network and a range of high-quality
products, combined with a technical support system that works closely with
customers, providing a good competitive position in its target markets. In
China, for example, our Industrial Products segment's network includes three
production facilities in China, a sales site, a bromine containers farm, and
sales and technical support networks. In the Netherlands, our Industrial
Products segment has a bromine compound production facility, which gives it a
competitive advantage in Europe. The phosphorus-based flame retardant and
functional fluids production plants in the United States and Europe are situated
in close proximity to our Industrial Products segment's principal customers.

In the phosphorus-based flame retardants market, competition is mainly from
Chinese manufacturers operating in the local market and in markets outside
China, mainly Europe and the United States. Access to a source of high-quality,
low-cost phosphorus improves the capacity to compete in this market.

There are many competitors in the market for biocides for water treatment,
and entry barriers are mainly related to the process for obtaining a license to
sell.

There are several competitors in the magnesium chloride industry. The entry
barrier to this market is low, as any company with access to magnesium chloride
can produce the solution.

There are a number of small competitors in the pure potash market. Pure
potash is a high-quality potash used mainly in the food and pharmaceutical
industries. The main entry barrier is access to potash and the technological
knowledge required for its crystallization.

In part of the biocide industry, the magnesia industry and the industry for
other salts, our Industrial Products segment has a leading position in certain
niche products.
---

Our Performance Products segment has a leading position in the field of pure
phosphoric acid and its downstream products. Our Performance Products segment's
competitors are large and mid-size international chemical companies, which have
manufacturing and marketing presences in various countries, as well as regional
companies that reap the benefits of being local manufacturers in a regional
marketplace. In every field, many companies compete with our Performance
Products segment by offering similar or substitute products.

Competition in our Performance Products segment centers on product
characteristics, price, quality, service and the ability to address customers'
needs.

The primary competitors of our Performance Products segment in each field
are set forth below.
