Jon B. Kutler is Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Founder of Admiralty Partners. Based in Los Angeles, he is responsible for the strategic direction of the firm and its portfolio of investments.

Mr. Kutler began his investment-banking and private equity career on Wall Street in 1984, after serving ten years in various positions in the U.S. Navy. He has worked with Goldman Sachs, The First Boston Corporation and Wasserstein, Perella & Co., specializing in the global aerospace and defense sectors. 
As the Cold War waned, he foretold a paring of global aerospace and defense spending and resultant glut of capacity that would idle the entire sector, threatening both the security and economy of the victors. In a January 1990 issue of Aviation Week and Space Technology magazine, Kutler called for “an aggressive merger-and-acquisition environment” to forestall a high-stakes game of musical chairs for survival. Within months, the resultant merger and acquisition activity caused the sector to burst into an era of competition, efficiency and profitability. As a result of his advisory work on transactions in these sectors, Kutler was profiled by Institutional Investor magazine as the leading expert in the industry.

In 1992 he founded the Quarterdeck Family of Companies, including Quarterdeck Investment Partners, Inc.; Quarterdeck Investment Partners, LLC and Quarterdeck Investment Partners, Ltd. (both now operating as Jefferies Quarterdeck); Quarterdeck Equity Partners, Inc. and Quarterdeck Public Equities, LLC. In March 2006, Kutler resigned as Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Founder of Jefferies Quarterdeck (a division of NYSE traded investment bank Jefferies & Company, Inc.) to focus 100% of his efforts in private equity investments under the Admiralty Partners, Inc. banner.

Mr. Kutler is a nationally recognized expert in the field of aerospace and defense. His articles on consolidation, restructuring and defense conversion and profiles have appeared in Business Week, The New York Times, Fortune, The Los Angeles Times, Defense News and Aviation Week & Space Technology. Mr. Kutler has testified before numerous Congressional committees with regard to the driving forces and implications of the  consolidation of the defense and aerospace contractor base. In addition, he has served as Chairman of the White House Small Business Task Force on Defense Conversion and as a member of an advisory panel established by the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment to evaluate the status of the space launch vehicle industry. Mr. Kutler is a Trustee of the California Institute of Technology. He serves as Chairman of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory; a member of the Technology Transfer Committee and a�founding member of the Space Innovation Council.
                            Mr. Kutler is a graduate of the United States Naval Academy and holds a Bachelor of Science degree in Naval Architecture. He received his master's of business administration degree from Harvard University.

Admiralty CEO Jon B. Kutler to Join Arotech's Board of Directors

ANN ARBOR, Mich., Feb. 3, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Arotech Corporation (Nasdaq GM: ARTX) announced today that it has signed a definitive agreement with internationally-recognized aerospace and defense investment firm Admiralty Partners, Inc. and closed on the sale to Admiralty of 1.5 million shares of its stock in a private placement at a price of $1.99 per share, resulting in proceeds to Arotech of $2.985 million. The price of $1.99 per share was set by the parties based on the price of Arotech's stock at the time negotiations commenced. In conjunction with this investment, Jon B. Kutler, Admiralty Partners Chairman and CEO, will join Arotech's Board of Directors. Additional details regarding the material terms of the transaction will be disclosed in a Current Report on Form 8-K expected to be filed today. 
"We are truly flattered and excited by this vote of confidence from a legend in the aerospace and defense investment world, and we are thrilled to welcome Jon to our Board of Directors," commented Steven Esses, Arotech's President and CEO. "Jon's expertise in the fields of aerospace and defense is expected to help us to grow our business and aid in creating long-term shareholder value. We look forward to benefiting from Jon's vast knowledge, experience and contacts," Mr. Esses concluded.
"Arotech is positioned at the confluence of two trends in the defense industry – disproportionate government investment in key growth areas and the consolidation of the fragmented third-tier supplier base" said Jon B. Kutler, Admiralty Partners CEO. "Its strong presence in training and simulation and power systems, combined now with an increased capability to participate as a consolidator, are expected to provide multiple opportunities and avenues for growth and enhanced shareholder value."
Mr. Kutler is a recognized investor, investment banker and expert in the aerospace and defense industries. After service in the U.S. Navy and nearly a decade on Wall Street, Mr. Kutler founded Quarterdeck Investment Partners, Inc., a leading international investment bank focused exclusively on the global aerospace and defense markets. He sold Quarterdeck to Jefferies & Company in 2002 to focus on private equity investments under Admiralty Partners (www.admiraltypartners.com). Mr. Kutler has been profiled in numerous international trade and business publications and television and has been a leading voice regarding trends in the aerospace and defense sectors. He is a Trustee of the California Institute of Technology where he serves as Chairman of the Jet Propulsion Lab Committee. Mr. Kutler is a graduate of the United States Naval Academy and he received his Masters of Business Administration from Harvard University.
The offer and sale of the shares have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the shares may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration under such act and applicable state securities laws or an applicable exemption from those registration requirements. Arotech has agreed to file a registration statement covering the resale of the common stock issued in the private placement. This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to the registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction.
