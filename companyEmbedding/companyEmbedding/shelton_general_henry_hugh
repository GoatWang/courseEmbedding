Early life, family and education[edit]
Born in Tarboro, North Carolina, Shelton was raised just outside the small town of Speed, North Carolina. North Carolina Highway 122, which runs through Speed to Hobgood, North Carolina (right past the homestead he was raised on), was later named "General Henry Hugh Shelton Hwy" in his honor.[2] Shelton attended North Carolina State University[1] and was a member of Pershing Rifles. He earned a Bachelor of Science degree in textile engineering[1] while earning his Army commission through ROTC training. Shelton's further education includes a Master of Science degree in political science from Auburn University at Montgomery[1] in 1973 as well as studies at the Air Command and Staff College and the National War College.[3] Shelton married Carolyn L. Johnson in 1963 and have three sons together.[3] In 2002 he underwent spinal surgery.[4]
Military service[edit]
Shelton served two tours of duty in Vietnam[1] with the 5th Special Forces Group, and with the 173rd Airborne Brigade,[4] followed by a series of command and staff assignments. Following the Gulf War, Shelton commanded the 82nd Airborne Division at Fort Bragg in his home state of North Carolina.[1] In 1993, he was given command of XVIII Airborne Corps.[1] Shelton led the Joint Task Force responsible for Operation Uphold Democracy in Haiti in 1994.[4] In 1996, Shelton, a Special Forces soldier, was promoted to the rank of General and the position of Commander in Chief of United States Special Operations Command (SOCOM). He was the first Graduate of the U.S. Army Special Forces Program to command United States Special Operations Command.
Upon the retirement of John M. Shalikashvili, Shelton was appointed Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on October 1, 1997.[5] Shelton led the planning of the Kosovo War in 1999 during his time in office. Later during his time in that office he coined the phrase "Dover test", testing the support for a war based on the reaction of the people after seeing American casualties returning at the Dover Air Force Base.[6] During the events of September 11, 2001, Shelton was on a plane traveling to a NATO meeting in Europe, but turned back and returned to Washington.[7] Upon Shelton's end of term, President George W. Bush nominated then-Vice Chairman Air Force General Richard Myers who was sworn in on October 1, 2001.
Post-military career[edit]
In 2002 Shelton founded the General Hugh Shelton Leadership Center at North Carolina State University. The center was created to "inspire, educate, and develop values-based leaders, both locally and globally, committed to personal integrity, professional ethics, and selfless service."
In his retirement, Shelton joined the Board of Directors of Red Hat Corporation in April 2003, and was elected that board's chairman in 2010.[8][9] He also holds directorships at Anheuser Busch, Anteon International and Protective Products of America (PPA.TO). At his alma mater of North Carolina State University, the General Hugh Shelton Leadership Center was founded in 2002 and grants scholarships to young men and women whom are committed to personal integrity, professional ethics, and selfless service.[10]
Shelton also served as an advisor to Senator John Edwards' presidential campaign from 2003-2004.[11] Shelton created a minor controversy for 2004 Democratic presidential candidate, retired U.S. Army General Wesley Clark, a subordinate to Shelton during the 1999 Kosovo military actions, when he stated: "I will tell you the reason [Clark] came out of Europe early had to do with integrity and character issues, things that are very near and dear to my heart. […] I'll just say Wes won't get my vote," casting doubt upon the presidential contender's legitimacy.[11][12]
On March 1, 2008, General Shelton announced his endorsement of Senator Hillary Clinton for the 2008 Democratic Presidential Primary, stating, "I’ve been with Senator Clinton when she has been with our military men and women. I know from those experiences that she understands the demands and sacrifice of military life. I am confident she will always put the readiness and well being of our troops first. She is ready to be Commander-in-Chief." General Shelton was the second Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to endorse Senator Clinton, the first being General John Shalikashvili.[13]
On October 12, 2010, General Shelton published his autobiography, "Without Hesitation: The Odyssey of an American Warrior", along with coauthors Ron Levinson and Malcolm McConnell.[14] An excerpt tells the story of a high-ranking Clinton Cabinet member proposing that General Shelton intentionally allow an American pilot to be killed by the Iraqis to have an excuse to retaliate and go to war.[15] The book also tells of Bill Clinton's tearful confession to General Shelton;[16] a time during the Clinton administration when a close Clinton aide lost possession of the "biscuit" (top secret presidential nuclear launch authorization codes);[17] details of a contentious Camp David meeting among President George W. Bush and his National Security Council immediately after 9/11, where internal battle lines were drawn.[18] His book also says there were multiple attempts to kill Osama bin Laden that were shot down by Madeleine Albright.
On August 27, 2010, a statue of General Shelton was unveiled and dedicated at the Airborne Special Operations Museum in Fayetteville, NC. The statue was commissioned and donated by H. Ross Perot.[19]
On October 24, 2010, General Shelton appeared on This Week with Christiane Amanpour, on December 6, 2010 appeared on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, and on December 30, 2010 appeared on The Charlie Rose Show on PBS and Bloomberg TV, to promote the publication of his memoir Without Hesitation: The Odyssey of an American Warrior.[20]
On October 20, 2012, General Shelton was honored at the 6th Annual Brian & Kendra's Bluegrass Party in Speed, NC. He was presented with a Distinguished Achievements plaque and a road side display at the entrance of Speed, NC honoring General Shelton's home town and acknowledgement of his achievements.
Shelton and his wife, Carolyn J. Shelton, established the Hugh and Carolyn Shelton Military Neurotrauma Foundation in 2005 to fund research into traumatic brain injury among military personnel.[21]
Quotes[edit]
Warning that even Fort Bragg could be harmed by budget cuts, Hugh Shelton stated:

"Doing more with less is great for sissies and cowards. Standing up for what's right is what great leaders do."[22]

He served as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff from 1997 to 2001.Contents1 Early life, family and education2 Military service3 Post-military career4 Quotes5 Decorations and badges6 References7 External linksEarly life, family and educationBorn in Tarboro, North Carolina, Shelton was raised just outside the small town of Speed, North Carolina. North Carolina Highway 122, which runs through Speed to Hobgood, North Carolina (right past the homestead he was raised on), was later named "General Henry Hugh Shelton Hwy" in his honor.[2] Shelton attended North Carolina State University[1] and was a member of Pershing Rifles. He earned a Bachelor of Science degree in textile engineering[1] while earning his Army commission through ROTC training. Shelton's further education includes a Master of Science degree in political science from Auburn University at Montgomery[1] in 1973 as well as studies at the Air Command and Staff College and the National War College.[3] Shelton married Carolyn L. Johnson in 1963 and have three sons together.[3] In 2002 he underwent spinal surgery.[4]Military serviceShelton served two tours of duty in Vietnam[1] with the 5th Special Forces Group, and with the 173rd Airborne Brigade,[4] followed by a series of command and staff assignments. Following the Gulf War, Shelton commanded the 82nd Airborne Division at Fort Bragg in his home state of North Carolina.[1] In 1993, he was given command of XVIII Airborne Corps.[1] Shelton led the Joint Task Force responsible for Operation Uphold Democracy in Haiti in 1994.[4] In 1996, Shelton, a Special Forces soldier, was promoted to the rank of General and the position of Commander in Chief of United States Special Operations Command (SOCOM). He was the first Graduate of the U.S. Army Special Forces Program to command United States Special Operations Command.Upon the retirement of John M. Shalikashvili, Shelton was appointed Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on October 1, 1997.[5] Shelton led the planning of the Kosovo War in 1999 during his time in office. Later during his time in that office he coined the phrase "Dover test", testing the support for a war based on the reaction of the people after seeing American casualties returning at the Dover Air Force Base.[6] During the events of September 11, 2001, Shelton was on a plane traveling to a NATO meeting in Europe, but turned back and returned to Washington.[7] Upon Shelton's end of term, President George W. Bush nominated then-Vice Chairman Air Force General Richard Myers who was sworn in on October 1, 2001.Post-military careerIn 2002 Shelton founded the General Hugh Shelton Leadership Center at North Carolina State University. The center was created to "inspire, educate, and develop values-based leaders, both locally and globally, committed to personal integrity, professional ethics, and selfless service."In his retirement, Shelton joined the Board of Directors of Red Hat Corporation in April 2003, and was elected that board's chairman in 2010.[8][9] He also holds directorships at Anheuser Busch, Anteon International and Protective Products of America (PPA.TO). At his alma mater of North Carolina State University, the General Hugh Shelton Leadership Center was founded in 2002 and grants scholarships to young men and women whom are committed to personal integrity, professional ethics, and selfless service.[10]Shelton also served as an advisor to Senator John Edwards' presidential campaign from 2003-2004.[11] Shelton created a minor controversy for 2004 Democratic presidential candidate Wesley Clark, a subordinate to Shelton during the 1999 Kosovo military actions, when he stated: "I will tell you the reason [Clark] came out of Europe early had to do with integrity and character issues, things that are very near and dear to my heart. […] I'll just say Wes won't get my vote," casting doubt upon the presidential contender's legitimacy.[11][12]On March 1, 2008, General Shelton announced his endorsement of Senator Hillary Clinton for the 2008 Democratic Presidential Primary, stating, "I’ve been with Senator Clinton when she has been with our military men and women. I know from those experiences that she understands the demands and sacrifice of military life. I am confident she will always put the readiness and well being of our troops first. She is ready to be Commander-in-Chief." General Shelton was the second Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to endorse Senator Clinton, the first being General John Shalikashvili.[13]On October 12, 2010, General Shelton published his autobiography, "Without Hesitation: The Odyssey of an American Warrior", along with coauthors Ron Levinson and Malcolm McConnell.[14] An excerpt tells the story of a high-ranking Clinton Cabinet member proposing that General Shelton intentionally allow an American pilot to be killed by the Iraqis to have an excuse to retaliate and go to war.[15] The book also tells of Bill Clinton's tearful confession to General Shelton;[16] a time during the Clinton administration when a close Clinton aide lost possession of the "biscuit" (top secret presidential nuclear launch authorization codes);[17] details of a contentious Camp David meeting among President George W. Bush and his National Security Council immediately after 9/11, where internal battle lines were drawn.[18] His book also says there were multiple attempts to kill Osama bin Laden that were shot down by Madeleine Albright.On August 27, 2010, a statue of General Shelton was unveiled and dedicated at the Airborne Special Operations Museum in Fayetteville, NC. The statue was commissioned and donated by H. Ross Perot.[19]On October 24, 2010, General Shelton appeared on This Week with Christiane Amanpour, on December 6, 2010 appeared on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, and on December 30, 2010 appeared on The Charlie Rose Show on PBS and Bloomberg TV, to promote the publication of his memoir Without Hesitation: The Odyssey of an American Warrior.[20]On October 20, 2012, General Shelton was honored at the 6th Annual Brian & Kendra's Bluegrass Party in Speed, NC. He was presented with a Distinguished Achievements plaque and a road side display at the entrance of Speed, NC honoring General Shelton's home town and acknowledgement of his achievements.Shelton and his wife, Carolyn J. Shelton, established the Hugh and Carolyn Shelton Military Neurotrauma Foundation in 2005 to fund research into traumatic brain injury among military personnel.[21]QuotesWarning that even Fort Bragg could be harmed by budget cuts, Hugh Shelton stated:"Doing more with less is great for sissies and cowards. Standing up for what's right is what great leaders do."[22]Decorations and badgesGeneral Shelton has been decorated for service, to include:BadgeCombat Infantryman BadgeBadgeMaster Parachutist BadgeBadgeRanger TabSpecial Forces Tab1st Row AwardsDefense Distinguished Service Medal w/ 3 oak leaf clustersDistinguished Service Medal w/ 2 oak leaf clusters2nd Row AwardsLegion of Merit w/ 1 oak leaf clustersBronze Star w valor device & 3 oak leaf clustersPurple HeartMeritorious Service Medal w/ 2 oak leaf clusters3rd Row AwardsAir Medal w/ "2" deviceArmy Commendation Medal w/ 3 oak leaf clustersNational Defense Service Medal w/ 2 service starsArmed Forces Expeditionary Medal4th Row AwardsVietnam Service Medal w/ 4 bronze service starSouthwest Asia Service Medal w/ 2 service starsArmy Service RibbonArmy Overseas Service Ribbon5th Row AwardsVietnam Gallantry Cross w/ bronze starVietnam Campaign MedalKuwait Liberation Medal (Saudi Arabia)Kuwait Liberation MedalBadgePathfinder BadgeMilitary Free Fall Parachute BadgeBadgeOffice of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Identification BadgeAir Assault BadgeBadgeNavy and Marine Corps Parachutist InsigniaGerman Parachutist Badge in bronzeUnit AwardsUS Army Presidential Unit CitationUS Navy Presidential Unit CitationJoint Meritorious Unit AwardUnit AwardsMeritorious Unit CommendationVietnam Gallantry Cross Unit CitationVietnam Civil Actions Medal Unit CitationReferences^ a b c d e f g "Biography of Henry Hugh Shelton".

Gen. Henry Hugh Shelton
(Biography as published in Commencement Program, 5/98)
Gen. Henry Hugh Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and a highly decorated graduate of North Carolina State University, is the first member of the elite U.S. Army Special Forces -- the Green Berets -- to rise to the nation’s top military post. The 56-year-old, four-star general became the 14th chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in October 1997.
The Edgecombe County native serves as the principal military adviser to the president, the secretary of defense and the National Security Council. Previously, he served as commander in chief of the U.S. Special Operations Command, which oversees the Green Berets and the Navy SEALs.
Shelton earned his commission through the Reserve Officers Training Corps at NC State, where he graduated in 1963 with a degree in textile engineering. He earned a master of science degree from Auburn University. His military education includes completion of the Air Command and Staff College and the National War College programs. In the two decades after his commissioning, Shelton held a variety command and staff positions in the United States and Vietnam. He served two tours in Vietnam, first with the 5th Special Forces Group and then with the 173rd Airborne Brigade.
Following his selection in 1987 as brigadier general, Shelton served in the Operations Directorate of the Joint Staff. In 1989, he began a two-year assignment as assistant division commander for operations of the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault) -- a tour that included a seven-month deployment to Saudi Arabia for Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm. After the Gulf War, he was promoted to major general and assigned to Fort Bragg, where he commanded the 82nd Airborne Division. He was promoted to lieutenant general in 1993. In 1994, he commanded the Operation Uphold Democracy joint task force in Haiti. In 1996, Shelton was promoted to general and became commander in chief of the U.S. Special Operations Command.
His awards and decorations include the Defense Distinguished Service Medal (with 2 oak leaf clusters), Distinguished Service Medal, Legion of Merit (with oak leaf cluster), Bronze Star Medal with V device (with 3 oak leaf clusters), and the Purple Heart.
Shelton is married to Tarboro native Carolyn Johnson Shelton. They have three sons, Jon, Jeff and Mark.

Early life, family and education[edit]
Born in Tarboro, North Carolina, Shelton was raised just outside the small town of Speed, North Carolina. North Carolina Highway 122, which runs through Speed to Hobgood, North Carolina (right past the homestead he was raised on), was later named "General Henry Hugh Shelton Hwy" in his honor.[2] Shelton attended North Carolina State University[1] and was a member of Pershing Rifles. He earned a Bachelor of Science degree in textile engineering[1] while earning his Army commission through ROTC training. Shelton's further education includes a Master of Science degree in political science from Auburn University at Montgomery[1] in 1973 as well as studies at the Air Command and Staff College and the National War College.[3] Shelton married Carolyn L. Johnson in 1963 and have three sons together.[3] In 2002 he underwent spinal surgery.[4]
Military service[edit]
Shelton served two tours of duty in Vietnam[1] with the 5th Special Forces Group, and with the 173rd Airborne Brigade,[4] followed by a series of command and staff assignments. Following the Gulf War, Shelton commanded the 82nd Airborne Division at Fort Bragg in his home state of North Carolina.[1] In 1993, he was given command of XVIII Airborne Corps.[1] Shelton led the Joint Task Force responsible for Operation Uphold Democracy in Haiti in 1994.[4] In 1996, Shelton, a Special Forces soldier, was promoted to the rank of General and the position of Commander in Chief of United States Special Operations Command (SOCOM). He was the first Graduate of the U.S. Army Special Forces Program to command United States Special Operations Command.
Upon the retirement of John M. Shalikashvili, Shelton was appointed Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on October 1, 1997.[5] Shelton led the planning of the Kosovo War in 1999 during his time in office. Later during his time in that office he coined the phrase "Dover test", testing the support for a war based on the reaction of the people after seeing American casualties returning at the Dover Air Force Base.[6] During the events of September 11, 2001, Shelton was on a plane traveling to a NATO meeting in Europe, but turned back and returned to Washington.[7] Upon Shelton's end of term, President George W. Bush nominated then-Vice Chairman Air Force General Richard Myers who was sworn in on October 1, 2001.
Post-military career[edit]
In 2002 Shelton founded the General Hugh Shelton Leadership Center at North Carolina State University. The center was created to "inspire, educate, and develop values-based leaders, both locally and globally, committed to personal integrity, professional ethics, and selfless service."
In his retirement, Shelton joined the Board of Directors of Red Hat Corporation in April 2003, and was elected that board's chairman in 2010.[8][9] He also holds directorships at Anheuser Busch, Anteon International and Protective Products of America (PPA.TO). At his alma mater of North Carolina State University, the General Hugh Shelton Leadership Center was founded in 2002 and grants scholarships to young men and women whom are committed to personal integrity, professional ethics, and selfless service.[10]
Shelton also served as an advisor to Senator John Edwards' presidential campaign from 2003-2004.[11] Shelton created a minor controversy for 2004 Democratic presidential candidate, retired U.S. Army General Wesley Clark, a subordinate to Shelton during the 1999 Kosovo military actions, when he stated: "I will tell you the reason [Clark] came out of Europe early had to do with integrity and character issues, things that are very near and dear to my heart. […] I'll just say Wes won't get my vote," casting doubt upon the presidential contender's legitimacy.[11][12]
On March 1, 2008, General Shelton announced his endorsement of Senator Hillary Clinton for the 2008 Democratic Presidential Primary, stating, "I’ve been with Senator Clinton when she has been with our military men and women. I know from those experiences that she understands the demands and sacrifice of military life. I am confident she will always put the readiness and well being of our troops first. She is ready to be Commander-in-Chief." General Shelton was the second Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to endorse Senator Clinton, the first being General John Shalikashvili.[13]
On October 12, 2010, General Shelton published his autobiography, "Without Hesitation: The Odyssey of an American Warrior", along with coauthors Ron Levinson and Malcolm McConnell.[14] An excerpt tells the story of a high-ranking Clinton Cabinet member proposing that General Shelton intentionally allow an American pilot to be killed by the Iraqis to have an excuse to retaliate and go to war.[15] The book also tells of Bill Clinton's tearful confession to General Shelton;[16] a time during the Clinton administration when a close Clinton aide lost possession of the "biscuit" (top secret presidential nuclear launch authorization codes);[17] details of a contentious Camp David meeting among President George W. Bush and his National Security Council immediately after 9/11, where internal battle lines were drawn.[18] His book also says there were multiple attempts to kill Osama bin Laden that were shot down by Madeleine Albright.
On August 27, 2010, a statue of General Shelton was unveiled and dedicated at the Airborne Special Operations Museum in Fayetteville, NC. The statue was commissioned and donated by H. Ross Perot.[19]
On October 24, 2010, General Shelton appeared on This Week with Christiane Amanpour, on December 6, 2010 appeared on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, and on December 30, 2010 appeared on The Charlie Rose Show on PBS and Bloomberg TV, to promote the publication of his memoir Without Hesitation: The Odyssey of an American Warrior.[20]
On October 20, 2012, General Shelton was honored at the 6th Annual Brian & Kendra's Bluegrass Party in Speed, NC. He was presented with a Distinguished Achievements plaque and a road side display at the entrance of Speed, NC honoring General Shelton's home town and acknowledgement of his achievements.
Shelton and his wife, Carolyn J. Shelton, established the Hugh and Carolyn Shelton Military Neurotrauma Foundation in 2005 to fund research into traumatic brain injury among military personnel.[21]
Quotes[edit]
Warning that even Fort Bragg could be harmed by budget cuts, Hugh Shelton stated:

"Doing more with less is great for sissies and cowards. Standing up for what's right is what great leaders do."[22]

Early life, family and education[edit]
Born in Tarboro, North Carolina, Shelton was raised just outside the small town of Speed, North Carolina. North Carolina Highway 122, which runs through Speed to Hobgood, North Carolina (right past the homestead he was raised on), was later named "General Henry Hugh Shelton Hwy" in his honor.[2] Shelton attended North Carolina State University[1] and was a member of Pershing Rifles. He earned a Bachelor of Science degree in textile engineering[1] while earning his Army commission through ROTC training. Shelton's further education includes a Master of Science degree in political science from Auburn University at Montgomery[1] in 1973 as well as studies at the Air Command and Staff College and the National War College.[3] Shelton married Carolyn L. Johnson in 1963 and have three sons together.[3] In 2002 he underwent spinal surgery.[4]
Military service[edit]
Shelton served two tours of duty in Vietnam[1] with the 5th Special Forces Group, and with the 173rd Airborne Brigade,[4] followed by a series of command and staff assignments. Following the Gulf War, Shelton commanded the 82nd Airborne Division at Fort Bragg in his home state of North Carolina.[1] In 1993, he was given command of XVIII Airborne Corps.[1] Shelton led the Joint Task Force responsible for Operation Uphold Democracy in Haiti in 1994.[4] In 1996, Shelton, a Special Forces soldier, was promoted to the rank of General and the position of Commander in Chief of United States Special Operations Command (SOCOM). He was the first Graduate of the U.S. Army Special Forces Program to command United States Special Operations Command.
Upon the retirement of John M. Shalikashvili, Shelton was appointed Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on October 1, 1997.[5] Shelton led the planning of the Kosovo War in 1999 during his time in office. Later during his time in that office he coined the phrase "Dover test", testing the support for a war based on the reaction of the people after seeing American casualties returning at the Dover Air Force Base.[6] During the events of September 11, 2001, Shelton was on a plane traveling to a NATO meeting in Europe, but turned back and returned to Washington.[7] Upon Shelton's end of term, President George W. Bush nominated then-Vice Chairman Air Force General Richard Myers who was sworn in on October 1, 2001.
Post-military career[edit]
In 2002 Shelton founded the General Hugh Shelton Leadership Center at North Carolina State University. The center was created to "inspire, educate, and develop values-based leaders, both locally and globally, committed to personal integrity, professional ethics, and selfless service."
In his retirement, Shelton joined the Board of Directors of Red Hat Corporation in April 2003, and was elected that board's chairman in 2010.[8][9] He also holds directorships at Anheuser Busch, Anteon International and Protective Products of America (PPA.TO). At his alma mater of North Carolina State University, the General Hugh Shelton Leadership Center was founded in 2002 and grants scholarships to young men and women whom are committed to personal integrity, professional ethics, and selfless service.[10]
Shelton also served as an advisor to Senator John Edwards' presidential campaign from 2003-2004.[11] Shelton created a minor controversy for 2004 Democratic presidential candidate, retired U.S. Army General Wesley Clark, a subordinate to Shelton during the 1999 Kosovo military actions, when he stated: "I will tell you the reason [Clark] came out of Europe early had to do with integrity and character issues, things that are very near and dear to my heart. […] I'll just say Wes won't get my vote," casting doubt upon the presidential contender's legitimacy.[11][12]
On March 1, 2008, General Shelton announced his endorsement of Senator Hillary Clinton for the 2008 Democratic Presidential Primary, stating, "I’ve been with Senator Clinton when she has been with our military men and women. I know from those experiences that she understands the demands and sacrifice of military life. I am confident she will always put the readiness and well being of our troops first. She is ready to be Commander-in-Chief." General Shelton was the second Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to endorse Senator Clinton, the first being General John Shalikashvili.[13]
On October 12, 2010, General Shelton published his autobiography, "Without Hesitation: The Odyssey of an American Warrior", along with coauthors Ron Levinson and Malcolm McConnell.[14] An excerpt tells the story of a high-ranking Clinton Cabinet member proposing that General Shelton intentionally allow an American pilot to be killed by the Iraqis to have an excuse to retaliate and go to war.[15] The book also tells of Bill Clinton's tearful confession to General Shelton;[16] a time during the Clinton administration when a close Clinton aide lost possession of the "biscuit" (top secret presidential nuclear launch authorization codes);[17] details of a contentious Camp David meeting among President George W. Bush and his National Security Council immediately after 9/11, where internal battle lines were drawn.[18] His book also says there were multiple attempts to kill Osama bin Laden that were shot down by Madeleine Albright.
On August 27, 2010, a statue of General Shelton was unveiled and dedicated at the Airborne Special Operations Museum in Fayetteville, NC. The statue was commissioned and donated by H. Ross Perot.[19]
On October 24, 2010, General Shelton appeared on This Week with Christiane Amanpour, on December 6, 2010 appeared on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, and on December 30, 2010 appeared on The Charlie Rose Show on PBS and Bloomberg TV, to promote the publication of his memoir Without Hesitation: The Odyssey of an American Warrior.[20]
On October 20, 2012, General Shelton was honored at the 6th Annual Brian & Kendra's Bluegrass Party in Speed, NC. He was presented with a Distinguished Achievements plaque and a road side display at the entrance of Speed, NC honoring General Shelton's home town and acknowledgement of his achievements.
Shelton and his wife, Carolyn J. Shelton, established the Hugh and Carolyn Shelton Military Neurotrauma Foundation in 2005 to fund research into traumatic brain injury among military personnel.[21]
Quotes[edit]
Warning that even Fort Bragg could be harmed by budget cuts, Hugh Shelton stated:

"Doing more with less is great for sissies and cowards. Standing up for what's right is what great leaders do."[22]

Early life, family and education[edit]
Born in Tarboro, North Carolina, Shelton was raised just outside the small town of Speed, North Carolina. North Carolina Highway 122, which runs through Speed to Hobgood, North Carolina (right past the homestead he was raised on), was later named "General Henry Hugh Shelton Hwy" in his honor.[2] Shelton attended North Carolina State University[1] and was a member of Pershing Rifles. He earned a Bachelor of Science degree in textile engineering[1] while earning his Army commission through ROTC training. Shelton's further education includes a Master of Science degree in political science from Auburn University at Montgomery[1] in 1973 as well as studies at the Air Command and Staff College and the National War College.[3] Shelton married Carolyn L. Johnson in 1963 and have three sons together.[3] In 2002 he underwent spinal surgery.[4]
Military service[edit]
Shelton served two tours of duty in Vietnam[1] with the 5th Special Forces Group, and with the 173rd Airborne Brigade,[4] followed by a series of command and staff assignments. Following the Gulf War, Shelton commanded the 82nd Airborne Division at Fort Bragg in his home state of North Carolina.[1] In 1993, he was given command of XVIII Airborne Corps.[1] Shelton led the Joint Task Force responsible for Operation Uphold Democracy in Haiti in 1994.[4] In 1996, Shelton, a Special Forces soldier, was promoted to the rank of General and the position of Commander in Chief of United States Special Operations Command (SOCOM). He was the first Graduate of the U.S. Army Special Forces Program to command United States Special Operations Command.
Upon the retirement of John M. Shalikashvili, Shelton was appointed Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on October 1, 1997.[5] Shelton led the planning of the Kosovo War in 1999 during his time in office. Later during his time in that office he coined the phrase "Dover test", testing the support for a war based on the reaction of the people after seeing American casualties returning at the Dover Air Force Base.[6] During the events of September 11, 2001, Shelton was on a plane traveling to a NATO meeting in Europe, but turned back and returned to Washington.[7] Upon Shelton's end of term, President George W. Bush nominated then-Vice Chairman Air Force General Richard Myers who was sworn in on October 1, 2001.
Post-military career[edit]
In 2002 Shelton founded the General Hugh Shelton Leadership Center at North Carolina State University. The center was created to "inspire, educate, and develop values-based leaders, both locally and globally, committed to personal integrity, professional ethics, and selfless service."
In his retirement, Shelton joined the Board of Directors of Red Hat Corporation in April 2003, and was elected that board's chairman in 2010.[8][9] He also holds directorships at Anheuser Busch, Anteon International and Protective Products of America (PPA.TO). At his alma mater of North Carolina State University, the General Hugh Shelton Leadership Center was founded in 2002 and grants scholarships to young men and women whom are committed to personal integrity, professional ethics, and selfless service.[10]
Shelton also served as an advisor to Senator John Edwards' presidential campaign from 2003-2004.[11] Shelton created a minor controversy for 2004 Democratic presidential candidate, retired U.S. Army General Wesley Clark, a subordinate to Shelton during the 1999 Kosovo military actions, when he stated: "I will tell you the reason [Clark] came out of Europe early had to do with integrity and character issues, things that are very near and dear to my heart. […] I'll just say Wes won't get my vote," casting doubt upon the presidential contender's legitimacy.[11][12]
On March 1, 2008, General Shelton announced his endorsement of Senator Hillary Clinton for the 2008 Democratic Presidential Primary, stating, "I’ve been with Senator Clinton when she has been with our military men and women. I know from those experiences that she understands the demands and sacrifice of military life. I am confident she will always put the readiness and well being of our troops first. She is ready to be Commander-in-Chief." General Shelton was the second Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to endorse Senator Clinton, the first being General John Shalikashvili.[13]
On October 12, 2010, General Shelton published his autobiography, "Without Hesitation: The Odyssey of an American Warrior", along with coauthors Ron Levinson and Malcolm McConnell.[14] An excerpt tells the story of a high-ranking Clinton Cabinet member proposing that General Shelton intentionally allow an American pilot to be killed by the Iraqis to have an excuse to retaliate and go to war.[15] The book also tells of Bill Clinton's tearful confession to General Shelton;[16] a time during the Clinton administration when a close Clinton aide lost possession of the "biscuit" (top secret presidential nuclear launch authorization codes);[17] details of a contentious Camp David meeting among President George W. Bush and his National Security Council immediately after 9/11, where internal battle lines were drawn.[18] His book also says there were multiple attempts to kill Osama bin Laden that were shot down by Madeleine Albright.
On August 27, 2010, a statue of General Shelton was unveiled and dedicated at the Airborne Special Operations Museum in Fayetteville, NC. The statue was commissioned and donated by H. Ross Perot.[19]
On October 24, 2010, General Shelton appeared on This Week with Christiane Amanpour, on December 6, 2010 appeared on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, and on December 30, 2010 appeared on The Charlie Rose Show on PBS and Bloomberg TV, to promote the publication of his memoir Without Hesitation: The Odyssey of an American Warrior.[20]
On October 20, 2012, General Shelton was honored at the 6th Annual Brian & Kendra's Bluegrass Party in Speed, NC. He was presented with a Distinguished Achievements plaque and a road side display at the entrance of Speed, NC honoring General Shelton's home town and acknowledgement of his achievements.
Shelton and his wife, Carolyn J. Shelton, established the Hugh and Carolyn Shelton Military Neurotrauma Foundation in 2005 to fund research into traumatic brain injury among military personnel.[21]
Quotes[edit]
Warning that even Fort Bragg could be harmed by budget cuts, Hugh Shelton stated:

"Doing more with less is great for sissies and cowards. Standing up for what's right is what great leaders do."[22]

About General Shelton



GENERAL HENRY HUGH SHELTON, USA (R)
14th Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff
NCSU Shelton Leadership Center Founder and Executive Director                                                                            
General Henry H. Shelton was born in Tarboro, North Carolina. He received a bachelor's degree in textiles from North Carolina State University and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Infantry through the Reserve Officer Training Corps.   

General Shelton spent the next 38 years in a variety of command and staff positions in the continental United States, Hawaii, and Vietnam. He served two combat tours in Vietnam, the first with the 5th Special Forces Group and the second with the 173rd Airborne Brigade. Also, he commanded the 3d Battalion, 60th Infantry in the 9th Infantry Division at Fort Lewis, Washington; served as the 9th Infantry Division's Chief of Staff for operations; commanded the 1st Brigade of the 82nd Airborne Division at Fort Bragg, North Carolina; and, was the Chief of Staff of the 10th Mountain Division at Fort Drum, New York.
Selected for promotion to brigadier general in 1988, General Shelton served two years in the Operations Directorate of the Joint Staff. In 1989 he began a two-year assignment as the Assistant Division Commander for Operations of the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault) at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, where he participated in the liberation of Kuwait during Operation DESERT SHIELD/STORM. After the Gulf War, General Shelton was promoted to major general and assumed command of the 82nd Airborne Division, Fort Bragg, North Carolina. In 1993 he was promoted to lieutenant general and assumed command of the XVIII Airborne Corps. In 1994 during his tenure as Corps commander, General Shelton led the United States Joint Task Force that restored democracy in Haiti. In March 1996 he was promoted to general and became Commander in Chief of the U.S. Special Operations Command.
General Shelton became the 14th Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on October 1, 1997, and served two two-year terms, retiring on September 30, 2001. Throughout his tenure as chairman, U.S. forces were in heavy demand and participated in numerous joint operations around the globe.
During his tenure, General Shelton worked tirelessly on behalf of service members, their families, and military retirees by championing a number of landmark quality of life initiatives, including the largest military pay raise in 18 years, pay table and bonus reform, and critical improvements in both retirement and healthcare programs. He made great strides in improving the readiness and retention of the current force while simultaneously crafting Joint Vision 2020-the roadmap for the Future Joint Force. General Shelton established Joint Forces Command to consolidate joint experimentation efforts and guide the transformation of the U.S. Armed Forces for the 21st Century.
General Shelton holds a master's degree from Auburn University, and has attended Harvard University, the Air Command and Staff College, and the National War College. 
Among his many military awards, General Shelton has received four Defense Distinguished Service Medals, two Army Distinguished Service Medals, the Legion of Merit, the Bronze Star Medal for Valor, and the Purple Heart.
He has been decorated by 16 foreign governments and, in 2001, General Shelton was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II.
Highlights of his civilian awards include the Charlotte (NC) World Affairs Council World Citizen Award for 2002, North Carolina's highest Award for Public Service, the Eisenhower Award from the Business Executives for National Security, the American Academy of Achievement's Golden Plate Award, Intrepid Freedom Award, and recognition as National Father of the Year, among others.
For his exemplary service to his country, the 107th Congress bestowed the Congressional Gold Medal on General Shelton on September 19, 2002.  
General Shelton is the 2008 recipient of the United States Army Infantry’s Doughboy Award and the 2009 NFL and College Football Hall of Fame Distinguished American award. He was also presented the Army Special Operations Professionals Man of the Year award in 2009.
After retiring from the Armed Forces, General Shelton served as President, International Operations, M.I.C. Industries from 2001-2005. He has also served as a director on a number of public company boards to include Anheuser Busch Companies (2001-2008), Anteon International (2001-2007) and Professional Products of America (2005-2009). He is currently Chairman of the Board of Red Hat, Inc. and serves as a director of L-3 Communications.  In addition he serves as a director for the following private companies:  CoVant, AT Solutions, Robbins-Gioia, The O’Gara Group, Professional Products Enterprises and HighMark. He previously served as a director of BioSignia and Professional Products Services (P2S).
General Shelton is also the Executive Director of the General Hugh Shelton Leadership Center at North Carolina State University and serves as Director of the Hugh and Carolyn Shelton Military Neurotrauma Foundation, Washington, DC.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
