About Us - Summary








Our Company

AuraSource, Inc. is a Nevada corporation, focused on developing and implementing clean energy and mineral processing technologies. We are commencing operations with two hydrocarbon clean fuel technologies: AuraCoal™ and AuraFuel™, and a mineral processing technology: AuraMetal™







AuraCoal™

								AuraSource, Inc. developed the AuraCoal™ process, which is a patent pending technology to remove sulfur and ash from the coal during a pre-combustion processing stage. This process reduces energy costs and all but eliminates harmful emissions. This proprietary clean coal technology produces a hydrocarbon fuel which contains only trace amounts of sulfur, ash and thus a low-cost alternative to oil or natural gas. 
							







AuraMetal™

								AuraSource, Inc. developed the AuraMeta™ process based on its grinding and separation technologies. This technology separates commercially valuable minerals from their ores economically and efficiently. It has a broad application in metal beneficiation such as hematite which can not be concentrated by magnetic separation.
							







AuraFuel™

								AuraSource, Inc. has also licensed another proprietary hydrocarbon clean fuel technology, AuraFuel™, which utilizes a low temperature catalytic process to convert oil shale, asphalt shale and low-ranking coal to hydrocarbon clean fuel products in a highly-efficient manner.

Core Technologies








Core Technologies
AuraSource’s intellectual property portfolio includes ultrafine grinding and separation processes, which enable the production of high value feedstock and a further reduction in cost for several industrial applications.







Ultrafine Grinding Technology

								AuraSource’s ultrafine grinding technology utilizes a fluid shock wave to grind slurry materials into an ultrafine scale. The shock wave is generated when a pressurized (5-30Mpa) slurry passes through a grinding chamber. The shock wave carries a large amount of energy which creates strong shear, collision and cavitation effects thus causing particles in the slurry reduce to an ultrafine size. As a result, when used in conjunction with coal water slurry grinding, the coal water slurry can be effectively pulverized and its fluidity improved. The energy consumption of this technology is 70% less than that of the conventional ball mill process.
								




Separation Technology

								AuraSource’s ultrafine separation technology separates particles with different densities in an ultrafine slurry. The minimum particle size for conventional jigging and heavy media cycling is 0.2mm which makes it difficult to remove inorganic minerals. The settling velocity of particles in the slurry becomes very low under normal gravity when particles are fine. Particles settling may even stop due to interaction force between particles and disturbances caused by ultrafine particles in the slurry. Therefore, conventional coal preparation equipment doesn’t work. This technology enables particles separation by applying a large amount of gravity force. Thus impurities and unwanted substances (such as ash or sulfur in coal) can be removed.
